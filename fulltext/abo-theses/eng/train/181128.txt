Thesis title: The macroeconomic effects of COVID-19 in Finland – a DSGE scenario approach
Supervisor: Eva Österbacka
Abstract
The exogenous event of COVID-19 took the world by surprise in 2020. Much of the early
literature focused on modelling the pandemic dynamics in economic models (e.g., DSGE models)
and examined macroeconomic effects and scenarios1, mapping potential economic and
humanitarian outcomes. Both real business cycle and new Keynesian models have been applied,
in parallel with relevant frictions and aggregate health dynamics. The literature mainly studied
the U.S. and the Euro area. This thesis builds on the DSGE studies on the macroeconomic effects
of the pandemic, utilizing a NK-DSGE model with wage rigidities, consumption habit formation,
Ricardian and rule-of-thumb households, investment adjustment costs, costs related to the level
of utilization of installed capacity as well as a government and a central bank based on Costa
(2016). It also includes price indexation and identifies three COVID-19 shocks. The productivity
shock and the labor supply shock constitute the supply-side disturbances. The consumption
preference shock serves as a demand-side disturbance. The model is calibrated to fit the Finnish
economy, based on the results of Kilponen et al. (2016). They explain that the Finnish
environment differs from other DSGE models in several ways. These differences may have
qualitative and quantitative implications for the COVID-19 shock and government responses.
Based on this assumption, this thesis examines the macroeconomic dynamics of the COVID-19
shocks and the monetary and fiscal responses in a Finnish environment. The inclusion of
Ricardian and non-Ricardian households allows for an investigation of the effects of a
government discretionary shock and whether it leads to an increase in private consumption as in
Galí et al. (2007). This study also maps the welfare effects of the shocks given the heterogeneity
of the households. Lastly, it considers a mild and a severe shock scenario and inspects the effects
on the Finnish economy.
The results reveal that the Finnish environment may have important implications for the dynamics
of the shocks and for optimal fiscal and monetary responses. Low price stickiness and high wage
rigidity and habit formation affects household decisions and may result in a fall in private
consumption given a positive government discretionary shock. Additionally, the high investment
adjustment cost causes investments to adjust sluggishly to the shocks. The inflation dynamics
and central bank policy trade-offs fundamentally depend on whether the environment is
dominated by demand-side or supply-side disturbances (stage of the pandemic), as the latter may
cause stagflation, increased steering rates and worsened debt sustainability. Furthermore, the
rule-of-thumb consumer is worse off compared to the Ricardian counterpart, revealing potential
asymmetric welfare effects. The results also show that monetary policy is unable to improve
welfare by increasing the output-reaction term in the Taylor rule. The focus should be on price
stability, according to the model. However, the government can improve welfare by increasing
the strength of the automatic stabilizers (e.g., by increasing transfers to households). The
discretionary policy shock also stimulates output at the risk of crowding out private consumption
and investment. Additionally, the already strained debt sustainability problem in Finland is
worsened.

1. INTRODUCTION
The global outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 and its persistence in 2021 generate severe economic
damage and deteriorate aggregate household health. To hinder the spread of the virus and to alleviate
the negative aggregate health effects, governments globally issued restrictions and lockdowns in the
first quarter of 2020. Most European countries introduced lockdowns in early March, with Finland
declaring a state of emergency and lockdown measures on March 16. The macroeconomic effects
caused by the virus can broadly be categorized as demand-side and supply-side effects. According to
Eichenbaum et al. (2020), the demand-side dynamics emerge because households decrease
consumption to reduce their probability of attracting the virus. The supply-side effects stem from
households decreasing their labor supply to avoid catching the virus. Most studies analyze the
macroeconomic effects by examining the dynamics of the demand side2, or by placing further
restrictions on households’ endogenous supply of labor3. Ambrocio and Juselius (2020) summarize
that the economic effects emerge from three main channels, namely, a fall in productive capacity,
aggregate demand shortages and an expectations and uncertainty channel.
Stochastic modelling is the most common (theoretical) approach in the current literature. Eichenbaum
et al. (2020) utilize a real business cycle model extended with an epidemiological SIR model, to
examine the dynamics of epidemics. Several studies extend typical RBC and NK models with
additional rigidities and frictions, to allow for more complex economic dynamics. One aspect that
has been less emphasized is heterogeneity among households, which has important implications for
welfare analysis, shock responses and government policy (Galí et al., 2007). Zhang et al. (2021)
include heterogeneity by assuming Ricardian and non-Ricardian households, however, their model is
calibrated to fit the economy of China. Current literature also generally focuses on the U.S. and the
Euro area. Therefore, this thesis explores the pandemic dynamics and effects in a Finnish
environment, including Ricardian and non-Ricardian households in the model. Kilponen et al. (2016)
find that the Finnish environment differs from typical DSGE settings in several ways (further
discussed in the literature chapter). These differences may affect the behavior of market participants
in the model, entailing differing economic outcomes and dynamics compared to the results of other
DSGE models. Furthermore, the model builds on Costa (2016) and incorporates price and wage

rigidities, monopolistic markets, inflation inertia, habit formation, investment adjustment costs and
costs related to the level of utilization of installed capacity. Fiscal and monetary policy4 is appended
in an extension of the model. These additional frictions add important features to the standard NKDSGE model, following the adjustment principle (see chapters 3 and 6).
This study opts for an impulse response analysis in parallel with a scenario analysis to examine the
possible outcomes and dynamics of the effects of the pandemic in Finland. Three shocks are
identified: a positive shock to the disutility of labor supply, a negative shock to the utility of
consumption and a negative productivity shock. This thesis aims to contribute to current literature on
the macroeconomic effects of pandemics by analyzing the dynamics of the shocks in Finland
(parameterization of the model) and utilizing an extended NK-DSGE model, allowing for more
accurate dynamics and an examination of policy responses and welfare. The key parameterization
elements in the scenario analysis include the ratio of Ricardian to non-Ricardian households, the
magnitude and persistency of the shocks and the responses by fiscal and monetary authorities.
Furthermore, this thesis derives several potential outcomes for the Finnish economy given a mild and
a severe scenario.
The results show that the responses of households and firms to the COVID-19 shocks differ from
other DSGE models both due to the elements included in the model and the parameterization. High
wage rigidity and consumption habit formation and relatively flexible price formation causes private
consumption to respond sluggishly and negatively to a government spending shock. Optimal fiscal
and monetary responses depend on whether the pandemic is dominated by supply-side or demandside disturbances. In all scenarios, debt sustainability is at risk, however, money-financed fiscal
stimulus may alleviate the situation for highly indebted countries (Galí, 2020). Alternatively, a low
interest rate environment may support conventional fiscal policy. The central bank is unable to
improve welfare by reacting more strongly to deviations in output. However, increasing transfers to
households is welfare-improving. Policymakers also need to account for the asymmetric effects of
the COVID-19 shocks, as non-Ricardian households face higher welfare losses. Lastly, the shock
dynamics are presented and discussed for both the baseline and the extended model.
The structure of the thesis is as follows: the hypotheses of the thesis are discussed in subchapter 1.2.
Chapter 2 reviews COVID-19 and DSGE relevant literature and contrasts it to this study. Chapter 3

presents the methodology of the study, describing both DSGE modelling in general as well as the
specifics in this study. Chapter 4 discusses the results of the baseline model. Chapter 5 adds fiscal
and monetary authorities to the model and examines potential responses to the shocks. Chapters 6
and 7 present a summary and discussion of the results and limitations of this study. Lastly, chapter 8
provides a summary of the thesis in Swedish.

1.2 Hypotheses
Based on the discussion above, two hypotheses of interest are derived. First, the equilibrium dynamics
differ from those of the Euro area, as the parameterization of the model may have qualitatively
important implications for both the direction of and the strength of the effects. Second, modelling
Ricardian and non-Ricardian households have important implications for fiscal policy and welfare in
the current setting, where non-Ricardians face the brunt of the economic effects. Depending on the
parameterization of the model’s deep parameters and the Ricardian parameter, household responses
might vary (e.g., with respect to government spending, see chapter 5).

Many previous studies suggest that moderate to severe outbreak events cause a decline in output by
2 to 8 percent in one year (World Bank, 2020). However, these studies do not account for the harsh
containment measures exercised by governments globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. More
recent literature finds greater economic impacts, mainly through the decrease in labor supply (World
Bank, 2020). The virus and the containment policies affect the economy via several channels.
McKibbin and Fernando (2020) show that global virus outbreaks significantly reduce aggregate
demand and increase both firm operating costs and financial market risk premiums. They explain that
the main channels operate through distorted labor supply decisions, decreased consumption spending
(endogenous response to the outbreak), reduced labor force (due to the mortality rate of the virus),
increased business costs, financial market turmoil and forgone investment. Additionally, the longer
the containment measures (both household endogenous behavior and government policy) are in
effect, the greater is the impact on financial markets, firm survivability and hysteresis effects.
Furthermore, Ambrocio and Juselius (2020) summarize that the behavior of the market participants
and the containment policies can be viewed as a negative productivity shock (e.g., worsened working
conditions). They also conclude that the fall in economic activity mainly reflects a fluctuation in
aggregate demand. To narrow down the scope of this thesis, it focuses on the labor supply effect,
productivity effect and the household demand channel. Furthermore, it emphasizes short-term
dynamics, leaving long-term considerations to other and future work.
Emerging literature on the macroeconomic effects of COVID-19 typically analyzes supply shocks or
demand shocks. The distinction between the two, or sometimes the combination of the two, is
important for several reasons. Demand shocks lower aggregate demand and output, increase
deflationary risks and can be combatted with expansionary monetary and fiscal policy (e.g., by
lowering the central bank steering rates or by increasing government expenditure5). As aggregate
demand is lower than aggregate supply, monetary and fiscal policy is meaningful. However,
stabilization policy in reaction to a supply-side shock is more complex, because, at least to some
degree, the fall in demand and output is an efficient response to the shock. Additionally, negative
supply shocks can imply higher inflation, yielding a difficult trade-off for monetary policy. However,
Guerrieri et al. (2020) argue that given certain assumptions, a supply shock can cause a shortage of
demand, followed by a more than efficient decrease in output and employment. They name this shock
a Keynesian supply shock, which can cause large reductions in output and consumption.

Fornaro and Wolf (2020) conclude that the main effect is on the supply side. Shut-down policies such
as closing schools and restaurants induce an exogenous decrease in the supply of labor. Individuals
also endogenously reduce their supplied labor to reduce the risk of attracting the virus. Furthermore,
global supply-chain distortions and productivity losses decrease output. Fornaro and Wolf (2020) use
a simplified standard new Keynesian model and find three main results. First, they conclude that
global demand is affected negatively. Second, a demand-supply doom loop could amplify the
negative effects. Third, stagnation traps might occur given pessimistic animal spirits. They also argue
that fiscal and monetary stimulus could alleviate some of those negative effects.
A negative wealth effect, increased uncertainty and risk of attracting the virus upon engagement in
economic activities, cause demand-side disruptions. Faria-e-Castro (2020) utilizes a shock to the
utility of consumption of services to analyze the macroeconomic effects of COVID-19 in the U.S.
This demand-side effect leads to a decrease in consumption and employment. Faria-e-Castro (2020)
finds that the pandemic scenario with a persistent shock that holds for three quarters generates an
unemployment rate of 20 percent, leading to defaults and distortions in the financial sector, which
further amplify the recession. He also argues that borrower households are affected the most.
Eichenbaum et al. (2020) examine the macroeconomic effects in a SIR-macro model with both
demand-side and supply-side effects. They find that containment policy could save up to half a
million lives in the U.S., in parallel with exacerbating the recession. Hence, there is a strong tradeoff
between economic activity and saving lives. Using a DSGE model with different fiscal policies and
a public health policy (e.g., contact tracing and a successful execution of the vaccination program),
McKibbin and Fernando (2021) show that the latter is the most efficient tool in combatting the
recession. They also conclude that all fiscal policies alleviate the economic effects of the pandemic,
though public investment yields the fastest short-term recovery. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2021)
investigate the monetary responses to the pandemic and the welfare implications of the virus. They
summarize that if a labor demand shock or a combination of a labor and aggregate demand shock
dominate the environment a welfare optimizing central bank emphasizes output stabilization.
However, given an aggregate demand shock, the central bank should focus on price stability.
One of the key conclusions in the studies mentioned above is that monetary and fiscal policy is
meaningful to stabilize the economy and minimize welfare losses, even though the initial shock may
stem from supply-side distortions and the economic responses are at least partly efficient (also
efficient from the viewpoint of reducing the spread of the virus). The fall in aggregate demand and
6

economic activity requires stimulus to mitigate the impact of the outbreak, especially in certain
sectors (Brinca et al., 2020). Furthermore, monetary and fiscal policy can help resolve issues on
financial markets (e.g., to mitigate the impact on risk premiums and stabilize lending and short-term
liquidity on money markets) as well as support businesses and households financially in the short run.
These measures can alleviate and potentially hinder hysteresis and domino effects. Moreover, the
consensus is that both demand and supply shocks are prevalent during the outbreak of COVID-19
(Brinca et al., 2020). Hence, this study utilizes both demand-side shocks and supply-side shocks to
analyze the macroeconomic effects of the virus countermeasures.
Other than the discussion of demand versus supply above, it is imperative to consider a few other
assumptions and implications. First, the consensus is that the shock of relevance mainly hits the
service sector, from which it propagates to other parts of the economy, including the financial
markets. Fornaro and Wolf (2020) consider a simplified one-sector economy and focus on the general
effects on the economy. Faria-e-Castro (2020) and Guerrieri et al. (2020) investigate the economic
effects when there are two or multiple sectors, mainly a service and a non-service sector. As shown
in Guerrieri et al. (2020), this distinction may have qualitatively relevant implications for the effects
of the virus. The model employed in this thesis considers a one-sector economy, following the
example set by Fornaro and Wolf (2020). This approach simplifies the interpretation of the results,
makes comparisons to other DSGE material easier, whilst still allowing for complex short-term
dynamics. Heterogeneity in the model is instead introduced via the inclusion of Ricardian and nonRicardian households.
Furthermore, it is important to identify additional dynamics (e.g., frictions, financial market
implications and the persistence of the shocks), as they might amplify or lessen the macroeconomic
effects. Faria-e-Castro (2020) finds that heterogeneity among households has imperative implications
for welfare and policy analysis. Modelling a distinction between Ricardian and non-Ricardian
households as well as habit formation helps account for welfare and policy relevant trade-offs and
consumption behavior. Standard macroeconomic models assume that households smooth
consumption by adhering to the hypothesis of permanent income. However, empirical evidence
reveals that at least some households form consumption habits, meaning that consumption is
intertemporally non-separable (Costa, 2016). Therefore, adding habit formation to the model can help
form the bell-shaped reaction of consumption to a positive shock in income observed empirically
(Costa, 2016), given that individuals preserve habits in tumultuous times. However, if individuals
break habits in times of high volatility, fear and uncertainty, then it could arguably be preferred to
7

model consumption as intertemporally separable. Mankiw (2000) and Galí et al. (2007) show that
including rule-of-thumb (non-Ricardian) households helps explain the positive reaction in private
consumption to a government spending shock. These financial liquidity restrictions also help account
for the negative response of labor supply to a positive productivity shock (Furlanetto et al., 2012).
Given a public spending shock, Ricardian households decrease consumption due to the forwardlooking nature of intertemporal consumption. They assume that the government must increase taxes
in the future to repay the increase in debt, hence reducing consumption. Non-Ricardian consumers
spend all their disposable income in each period and are unable to smooth consumption as per the
Ricardian equivalence. Price-setting rigidity and the subsequent increase in the real wage (higher
labor demand from the increase in output) may offset the negative wealth effect of the public spending
shock, inducing non-Ricardians to consume more (Galí et al., 2004). Galí et al. (2007) also highlight
the importance of the parameterization of the ratio of Ricardian to non-Ricardian households in the
economy. This thesis investigates several values for this parameter.
Furthermore, as the outbreak of the pandemic likely affects investment decisions and leaves installed
capital underutilized, it is of interest to model investment adjustment costs and under-utilization of
installed capital. Costa (2016) explains that empirical evidence supports rigidities in capital
adjustment and utilization. Firms are typically unable to adjust investment immediately in response
to shocks. Instead, they construct investment plans, which generates rigidity in the investment
process. Investment adjustment costs entail additional costs related to investment, which cause capital
to adjust sluggishly to shocks. These costs also increase the quicker firms wish to adjust investment.
The costs of under-utilization of installed capacity follow the approach applied in Christiano,
Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and Smets and Wouters (2003) in that there is a cost linked to the
variation of utilization. Jointly, the investment and capital-related frictions present additional
mechanisms to the propagation of shocks, namely, that business cycle fluctuations cause both
investments to adjust at a slower and smoother rate and capital to vary in utilization. However, Costa
(2016) concludes that modelling these frictions has no qualitative implications.
Moreover, empirical evidence for inflation inertia (Romer, 2012) motivates the inclusion of
stubbornness of inflation in the model. Therefore, partial indexation in the pricing mechanics is
modelled. Lastly, augmenting the model with an international sector and modelling Finland as a small
open economy would allow for an investigation of open economy dynamics, such as a trade channel.
However, as the focus of this study is on the domestic labor supply and demand shocks, modelling
an open economy would unnecessarily complicate the model. To summarize, modelling these
8

additional frictions or extensions of the standard NK-DSGE model, mainly serves to follow the
adjustment principle6 (Costa, 2016). The model used in this study focuses on a standard NK-DSGE
model extended with wage rigidities à la Calvo (1983) and the additional frictions discussed above.
In chapter 5, an extension of the model also considers a government and a central bank.
According to the Finnish Ministry of Finance (A, 2020), economic agents remain cautious if there is
risk for additional waves of the virus. In this paper, to incorporate the persistency of the virus, the
shock of relevance is assumed to dissipate at a slow rate, with the corresponding rho value
(autoregressive coefficient) calibrated according to different scenarios. Furthermore, this paper uses
insights from Kilponen et al. (2016), who develop a DSGE model for the Finnish economy. They
summarize that wage rigidities in Finland are prevalent, price rigidities are relatively flexible,
investment adjustment costs are slightly higher than in many other estimated DSGE models and
consumption behavior is persistent (habit formation). This study mainly follows the parameterization
applied in Kilponen et al. (2016). They utilize Finnish data in the period 1994–2014 in a Bayesian
framework. Their DSGE model incorporates a monopolistically competitive banking sector and a
small open economy approach. They find that technology shocks are central in explaining Finland’s
business cycles, whilst shocks in the banking sector play a smaller role. This study excludes
modelling a separate banking sector or financial market. Households may invest in private capital
(yielding a real interest rate on utilized capital) and government bonds. Modelling a separate banking
sector with relevant frictions would allow for a more detailed analysis of the financial market
amplification effects, however, it is beyond the scope of this study. Lastly, Kilponen et al. (2016)
conclude that the duration of wages are more than three years and the duration of prices are one
quarter. Due to these results, this paper extends the baseline NK-DSGE model with wage rigidities,
based on Calvo (1983) pricing. The scenario and sensitivity analysis in both chapters 4 and 5
investigates the effect of changing the parameterization of the price and wage Calvo parameters.

3. METHODOLOGY
This chapter deliberates on the NK-DSGE model applied in this study. First, DSGE modelling is
discussed from a general perspective, whilst also drawing parallels to the specific approach employed
in the analysis. Second, the model specification is presented and discussed.

The adjustment principle means that models are changed to better fit empirical results, though not necessarily
generating qualitative changes (Costa, 2016).

This thesis aims to utilize a one-sector and infinite horizon NK-DSGE model with rational
expectations to examine the effects of COVID-19 on a vector of macroeconomic variables. DSGE
modelling allows for structural analysis through microeconomic foundations, which is beneficial due
to the scarcity of COVID-19-related macroeconomic data. The baseline DSGE model in this study
contains: utility-maximizing Ricardian and non-Ricardian households (where utility is a function of
intertemporal consumption and labor); profit maximizing, intermediate and imperfectly competitive
goods producers as well as perfectly competitive final good-aggregating firms and labor-aggregating
firms. Chapter 5 extends the baseline model with fiscal and monetary authorities. The market
participants operate per the optimality conditions derived from the optimization problems.
Households consume final goods and supply differentiated labor. Ricardian households are also able
to invest in capital and government bonds. The intermediate firms produce differentiated products,
demanding labor and capital as production inputs. The goods-aggregating firms aggregate the
differentiated products into single goods, which are demanded by households. Similarly,
differentiated labor is aggregated into final labor goods, which are demanded by firms. The abovementioned market participants determine most of the prices in the model (market clearing is
assumed). The government taxes consumption, capital and labor, issues debt and spends the tax
revenue on transfers and public spending. Lastly, the central bank follows an adjusted Taylor rule
(Taylor, 1993). The economy is assumed to converge to an efficient7 steady state (dropping the time
index of the equations). First-order conditions, such as the Euler equation8, the intratemporal decision
between consumption and leisure, and the price-setting equation for firms, are log-linear
approximated, to solve the model in a log-linear form in deviations from the steady state. Market
clearing conditions and equilibrium conditions are then explored, and determinacy is checked via the
Blanchard and Kahn (1980) conditions in a matrix formulation of the model equations. To solve the
linearized system of difference equations, the linearized equations are fed to Dynare in MATLAB,
where the model is solved9 and the dynamics of the model are explored via impulse response
functions.
Eichenbaum et al. (2020) note that using a real business cycle model might exclude relevant shortterm dynamics, as prices and wages are assumed to be fully flexible and markets are characterized by

Galí (2008) and Bergholt (2012) show the economic dynamics under a distorted steady state. This consideration may
have important implications for monetary policy and could be relevant during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, if it
leaves the economy structurally impaired. They also analyze policy under discretion and commitment.

perfect competition. Hence, this paper opts for a baseline NK-DSGE model, based on Costa (2016),
extended with relevant frictions. The NK model adds price rigidities and imperfect competition to the
RBC framework. Price (wage) determination in this paper applies the approach of Calvo (1983),
where only a fraction, [1 − 𝜃], of firms (households) can change prices (wages) in the current period.
Therefore, 𝜃 is a measurement of price rigidity. Furthermore, firms are assumed to have some market
power due to product differentiation and hence demands some price-setting power. In this NK setting,
fluctuations around the steady state are suboptimal variable movements, and therefore, monetary and
fiscal authorities have meaningful stabilization mandates and monetary policy is non-neutral.
Furthermore, empirically noted short-run dynamics such as the liquidity effect also emerge in this
setting (Romer, 2012), which in the RBC model, only emerges with real money balances in the utility
function and non-separability between consumption and real balances (Galí, 2008).
One of the ambiguous effects in the NK model is the persistent decline in employment caused by a
positive technology shock under a baseline calibration of the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity
of substitution parameter, (𝜎 = 1, which entails that the wealth effect and the substitution effect of
wage cancel out). However, according to Galí and Rabanal (2004), there is empirical evidence for a
decline in employment.
To account for both the demand-side and the supply-side effects of the pandemic, shocks are added
to both sides. As described in Faria-e-Castro (2020), this paper considers a negative shock to the
utility of consumption, a negative productivity shock and a positive shock to the disutility of labor.
To summarize, the model builds on the NK-DSGE model with wage rigidities, habit formation,
Ricardian households and investment adjustment and capital utilization costs used in Costa (2016).
The model is extended to include partial indexation in the formation of prices as well as the additional
COVID-19 related shocks. Chapter 5 also considers a government and a central bank. Figure 1
provides an overview of the model, its derivation process, equations, and steady state formulation
(the latter is based on Costa (2016)). The same notation logic is used as in Costa (2016), with ss
representing the steady state value of a variable.

3.1 Households
The households’ maximization problem can be written as follows10:

max 𝑈 = 𝐸𝑡 ∑

𝛽 𝑡 𝑢(𝐶𝑅,𝑡 , 𝐿𝑅,𝑡 ) 𝑠. 𝑡

(𝑈𝑡 − 1) ]

(2)

In equation (1), the Ricardian household maximizes its utility with respect to intertemporal
consumption (𝐶𝑅,𝑡 ) and leisure (1 − 𝐿𝑅,𝑡 ), subject to the budget constraint, which is given by the
expenditure on consumption and investment (𝑃𝑡 (𝐶𝑅,𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 )), labor income (𝑊𝑡 𝐿𝑅,𝑡 ) as well as the
interest gained on utilized capital net of the costs related to the level of capital utilization
(𝑅𝑡 𝑈𝑡 𝐾𝑡 − 𝑃𝑡 𝐾𝑡 [Ψ1 (𝑈𝑡 − 1) +

Ψ2
2

(𝑈𝑡 − 1)2 ]). It is assumed that households own the firms and

hence they incorporate the utilization costs and the investment adjustment costs in their budget
constraints. The path of capital is given by equation (2). Note that if there is no investment adjustment,
then the last term of equation (2) simplifies to 𝐾𝑡+1 = (1 − 𝛿)𝐾𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 . The Ricardian household also
chooses capital, investment and the level of utilization of installed capacity, where 𝑈𝑡 is the level of
utilization of maximum installed capacity and Ψ and 𝜒 are sensitivity parameters (utilization and
investment adjustment, respectively). Furthermore, 𝑊𝑡 is the nominal wage, 𝑅𝑡 is the gross interest
rate, 𝐼𝑡 represent investments and 𝛿 is the capital depreciation rate.
Assume an instantaneous and time-separable utility approach with constant relative risk aversion
(CES) and a Dixit-Stiglitz form (Galí, (2008) and Costa, (2016)), then the utility function 𝑢()
becomes (in CRRA11 form):

10

This paper utilizes Kuhn-Tucker conditions to solve for the first-order conditions when inequality constraints are
present, though dynamic programming would yield the same result (Bergholt, 2012).
11
CRRA is a common approach to modelling the utility function of households (Costa, 2016). Another common
strategy is to apply logarithmic utility of consumption and CRRA utility of labor. See Costa (2016) for an overview. Well
known applications can be found in Galí and Monacelli (2005) and Clarida et al. (2002). Kilponen et al. (2016) utilize
the combination strategy, where the utility of consumption is logarithmic.

) (3)

In equation (3), 𝐶𝑅,𝑡 and 𝐿𝑅,𝑡 , are consumption and labor for Ricardian households, respectively. 𝜙𝑐
is the habit formation parameter, 𝛽 𝑡 is the discount factor, 𝜎 is the risk aversion coefficient or the
inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution parameter and 𝜑 is the parameter for marginal
disutility of labor or the inverse of the Frisch elasticity of labor supply (Kilponen et al., 2016). With
𝜎 = 1, the utility function with respect to consumption is logarithmic. 𝜎 = 0 implies risk neutrality,
revealed by the linearity of the function. When 𝜎 increases, households are more risk averse, meaning
that they prefer consumption today over consumption in the future. Hence, 𝜎 affects intertemporal
consumption and has important implications for substitution and income effects of labor supply and
consumption decisions12. With consumption-labor separability in the utility function and the disutility
of labor defined as

𝐿𝑅,𝑡 1+𝜑
1+𝜑

, 𝜑 is the inverse of the Frisch elasticity of labor supply 13. Furthermore, a

shock to the disutility of labor (𝜁𝑡 ) as well as a shock to the utility of consumption (𝜉𝑡 ) has been
included and take the value 𝜁𝑠𝑠 = 𝜉𝑠𝑠 =1 in the steady state. These shocks may take several forms, but
this paper utilizes a simple exogenous first-order autoregressive process that slowly dissipates over
time, meaning that the shocks to the economy stay prevalent for several periods. Equation (3) exhibits
habit formation (𝜙𝑐 ) as current consumption also depends on the previous period’s consumption
(𝐶𝑅,𝑡 − 𝜙𝑐 𝐶𝑅,𝑡−1 ). Ricardian households (indexed as R) may invest into capital, which yields a gross
interest rate 𝑅𝑡 on the capital that is utilized. As households are the owners of capital and firms, saving
is equivalent to investing. Capital then depends on the previous level of capital (depreciated) and
investment, netted with the adjustment cost of investment 𝑓 (𝐼

𝐼𝑡

𝑡−1

). Setting up the Lagrangian of the

Ricardian household yields the following optimization problem and first-order conditions:

12

It should also be noted that the inclusion of price and wage rigidities affects the substitution and income effects in
the model, typically making the income effects more dominant (Costa, 2016).
13

In this case it suffices to use the following formula:

𝑈 ′′ (𝐿)
𝑈 ′ (𝐿)

∗ = 𝐹𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑐ℎ 𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦. It relates changes in the real wage

to adjustments in labor supply.

14

Equation (4) shows the optimization problem for the Ricardian households, which entails maximizing
the infinite lifetime path of utility, given the constraints, where the households also must account for
the costs related to the under-utilization of installed capacity and investment adjustment of capital.
The first-order condition with respect to consumption yields equation (5), which, together with
equation (6) and (8), determines the intertemporal consumption path for Ricardian households. Due
to the inclusion of habit formation, the Euler equation depends on consumption in period 𝑡, 𝑡 + 1 and
𝑡 + 2 (Costa, 2016). 𝜆𝑅,𝑡 is the shadow price with respect to the budget (i.e., the marginal utility of
loosening the budget).

The Lagrange multiplier 𝑄𝑡 is the shadow price of capital, and can be defined as Tobin’s Q. Formally,
Tobin’s Q is the market value of a firm divided by the firm’s capital replacement cost (Costa, 2016).
If Q is >1, then the firm should acquire more capital. In this context it is the marginal gain in utility
by loosening the capital constraint. The partial derivative of (4) with respect to 𝐾𝑡+1 yields equation
(6), that is, the optimality of capital, which depends on Tobin’s Q, the interest gained on utilized
capital and the cost of under-utilization of capital.

𝑄𝑡 = 𝛽𝐸𝑡 [𝑄𝑡+1 (1 − 𝛿) + 𝜆𝑅,𝑡+1 𝑅𝑡+1 𝑈𝑡+1 − 𝜆𝑅,𝑡+1 𝑃𝑡+1 [Ψ1 (𝑈𝑡+1 − 1) +

Ψ2

(6)

Equation (7) demonstrates the optimal choice of the level of utilization of capital. The level of
utilization depends on the relative price of capital and goods and the sensitivity parameters of the
utilization costs. The larger the term for relative price is, the higher the level of utilization (because
households gain more from capital in relation to consumption). To concretize, if Ψ1 is sufficiently
𝑅𝑡

large (so that 𝑃 − Ψ1 < 0) and Ψ2 is sufficiently large (so that
𝑡

𝑅𝑡
−Ψ1
𝑃𝑡

to under-utilize capital. However, it is assumed that utilization of capital is equal to 1 in the steady
state (full utilization).

Equation (8) reveals the optimal choice of investment, which depends on Tobin’s Q, the investment
adjustment costs and the expectation of future investment adjustment costs, related to the shadow
price of the budget constraint and the price of consumption. Consider the case without adjustment
costs (or 𝐼𝑡 =𝐼𝑡−1 ), then the decision of investment simplifies to 𝜆𝑅,𝑡 𝑃𝑡 = 𝑄𝑡 . Given that Tobin’s
𝑄

marginal Q can be defined as 𝑞𝑡 = 𝜆 𝑡 , then the optimal choice of investment is governed by 𝑃𝑡 = 𝑞𝑡 ,
𝑅,𝑡

which entails that the marginal gain of investment equals the price of one unit of consumption. If 𝑃𝑡
in the steady state is equal to 1, then so is 𝑞𝑡 , meaning that there is no incentive to invest further (in
the steady state).

Non-Ricardian households (indexed as NR) consume their entire budgets each period, hence the
optimization problem simplifies to (9). Equation (10) illustrates the consumption related first-order
condition for non-Ricardian households. These households (which are 1 − 𝜔𝑅 of the total
households), are unable to optimize their consumption intertemporally.

3.1.1 Deciding labor supply, optimal wages and labor demand
Households supply differentiated labor on a monopolistic labor market and thus possess some wage
setting power. Labor-aggregating firms function on a perfectly competitive market and transform the
differentiated labor (𝑗) into factor input for goods producing firms (Costa, 2016). Aggregation
follows the approach of Dixit and Stiglitz (1977), as shown in equation (11). Differentiated labor is
1

indexed in a continuous interval ∫0 𝐿, with 𝜓𝑤 being the elasticity of substitution between
differentiated labor. The problem is the same for Ricardian and non-Ricardian households, hence 𝑥 =
{𝑅, 𝑁𝑅}, to simplify the notation (Costa, 2016).

The labor-aggregating firm optimizes its profit as described in equation (12). Inserting (11) yields
equation (13); the demand for differentiated labor. It depends positively on the aggregate level of
labor demand (𝐿𝑥,𝑡 ), negatively on optimal wage (𝑊𝑗,𝑡 ∗ ), (which is chosen by households), and the
substitution parameter.

Both Ricardian and non-Ricardian households choose labor supply and optimal wage by maximizing
equation (14), which is derived from households’ Lagrange functions. By substituting the equation
for labor demand, the optimal wage equation (15) can be derived. A random fraction (1 − 𝜃𝑤 ) of
households are able to optimally adjust their wages each period according to equation (15).

the frictionless wage markup, which approaches 1 as 𝜓𝑤 approaches infinity, meaning that when 𝜓𝑤
approaches infinity, the labor market is characterized by perfect competition. 𝜃𝑤 is the Calvo
parameter regarding wage setting. Inserting equation (5) or (10) reveals that households set wages as
a markup over the weighted sum of the consumption-labor preferences (𝑀𝑅𝑆) adjusted with the price
level, where the weight accounts for the chance of being stuck with the set wage 𝑖 periods into the
future.

3.2 Firms
Firms are divided into retail firms that aggregate differentiated goods into final goods and wholesale
firms that produce differentiated goods monopolistically. The aggregation technique here follows the
same approach as applied in the aggregation of labor. Equation (19) gives the demand for
differentiated goods, where 𝜓𝑝 is the elasticity of substitution with respect to differentiated goods
(𝑗).

Wholesale firms minimize costs by choosing factor inputs, taking the level of production as given
and set prices according to a Calvo pricing rule, with the aim of maximizing profit. Technology (𝐴𝑡 )
follows a first-order autoregressive process (21) and the standard Cobb-Douglas production function
is defined in (31). 𝑈𝑡 is the level of utilization of installed capacity, that is, output is generated from
utilized capital. 𝛼 determines the sensitivity of output considering capital, and given the CobbDouglas form, (1 − 𝛼) shows the elasticity of production with respect to labor. The path for
14

Given the high wage rigidity in the model, it may be fitting to include wage indexation as well, to allow households
that are unable to change wages to adjust according to previous price inflation. Kilponen et al. (2016) assume full
wage indexation, however, a similar approach in the model used in this thesis yields instability and hence it is
excluded.

Marginal costs (𝑀𝐶) with utilization of capital are not derived in Costa (2016), therefore an
explanation of the derivation of the demand for capital and labor and the marginal cost function for a
wholesale firm is provided in the appendix. Wholesale firms minimize costs as given by (22), which
yields equations (23) – (27). In (22), the Lagrange multiplier 𝜇𝑗,𝑡 is the marginal cost of a wholesale

𝜃𝑝 is the ratio of firms that are unable to adjust their prices and 𝑃𝑗,𝑡

Optimal prices depend on the frictionless markup (𝜓

(29)

), that firms demand because they have some

𝑝 −1

market power, and future marginal costs adjusted by the chance of being unable to change prices. As
the elasticity of substitution between differentiated goods (the level of market competition, 𝜓𝑝 )
approaches infinity, the markup approaches 1, meaning that those intermediate firms loose market
power. Aggregation of prices follow the same approach as that of wages and is shown in equation
(30). To adhere the principle of inflation inertia, firms are allowed to index prices to previous
𝛾

inflation, giving the price indexation term 𝜋𝑡−1 , where 𝛾𝑝 is the indexation parameter. Hence, firms

The output function is a standard Cobb-Douglas production function with the inclusion of utilization
of capital (31). Furthermore, the processes for the household-related shocks are given in (32) and

technology.

3.3 Market clearing conditions
Next the clearing of the goods market as well as the derivation of the steady state needs to be
addressed. It is assumed that the goods market clears so that:
𝑌𝑡 = 𝐶𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡

(34)

Hence, total production is determined by total consumption and investment. Aggregated consumption
and labor supply are given by the ratio of Ricardian (𝜔𝑅 ) and non-Ricardian (1 − 𝜔𝑅 ) households as
per the following equations:
𝐶𝑡 = 𝜔𝑅 𝐶𝑅,𝑡 + (1 − 𝜔𝑅 )𝐶𝑁𝑅,𝑡

(35)

𝐿𝑡 = 𝜔𝑅 𝐿𝑅,𝑡 + (1 − 𝜔𝑅 )𝐿𝑁𝑅,𝑡

(36)

The steady state of the economy is derived by first normalizing prices in the steady state to one and
assuming that the steady state inflation is equal to zero. The rest of the steady state equations follow
by dropping the time index. The steady state is presented in the appendix.

3.4 Log-linearization
The model described above shape a difficult to solve non-linear system of difference equations. To
solve the model and analyze the equilibrium processes of the system, it is log-linear approximated
around the steady state, yielding variables in percentage deviations from the steady state (using the
notation 𝑥̂𝑡 ). This thesis follows Costa (2016) in applying the Uhlig method of linearization (Uhlig,
1999) to obtain the log-linearized versions of the adjusted equations. To deal with infinite sums, a
method of quasi-differencing is used (Costa, 2016). The full model description can be found in the
appendix. Note that the method of linearization is an approximation of the function around the steady
state (Taylor series approximation), meaning that the model results are only accurate in the

21

neighborhood of the steady state. Linearization may exclude important non-linear mechanics of the
economy.

3.5 Determinacy and model solution
There are several forward-looking variables in the model. According to Blanchard and Kahn (1980)
and Adjemian et al. (2011), to yield stable equilibrium conditions, there needs to be as many
eigenvalues larger than one as there are forward-looking variables in the model. Forward-looking
variables require the autoregressive component to be explosive to generate a determinate and stable
solution whilst backward-looking variables require stable autoregressive components (Pfeifer, 2018).
If the Blanchard and Kahn conditions are not satisfied, indeterminate solutions or sunspot equilibria
occur, as shocks may cause variables to explode and not return to the neighborhood of the loglinearized equations around the steady state (Galí, 2008). Solving each equation so that each
dependent variable at time 𝑡 is on the left-hand side of the equation, followed by writing the model
in matrix form and taking the inverse of the A-matrix, allows an examination of the Blanchard and
Kahn (1980) conditions for determinacy, by checking the eigenvalues of the 𝐴−1 𝐵 matrix (as shown
below)15. In standard NK-DSGE models, one decisive element for determinacy is the Taylor
principle, which states that the central bank must react with sufficient strength to deviations in
inflation to yield a determinate solution. Specifically, to raise the real interest rate and hence stabilize
the economy, the nominal interest rate should increase more than one-for-one to inflation (Bergholt,
2012).
𝐴𝑥𝑡 = 𝐵𝑥𝑡+1 + 𝑥𝑡−1 + 𝑒𝑡 → 𝑥𝑡 = 𝐴−1 𝐵𝑥𝑡+1 + 𝐴−1 𝑥𝑡−1 + 𝐴−1 𝑒𝑡
Simple models can be solved by hand via log-linearization, the Blanchard and Kahn (1980) conditions
and the method of undetermined coefficients. The impulse response analysis shows the effects of a
shock on the variables of the model. Hence, it is necessary to determine the contemporaneous effects
on the non-predetermined variables of the model (e.g., inflation). Utilizing the method of
undetermined coefficients, guesses of the decision rule or equation solution (for all equations) are
found, as expressions of the shocks of interest and all necessary dependent variables. Making these

15

The Blanchard and Kahn (1980) condition, specifically, states that given a recursive system with both predetermined
and non-predetermined variables on the left-hand side of the system equation and forward-looking variables as well
as the shock term on the right-hand side, a determinate solution can only be found if the eigenvalues inside the unit
circle of the 𝐴−1 𝐵 matrix equal the amount of non-predetermined variables (Bergholt, 2012).

22

guesses is simplified due to the log-linear approximations of the model equations, as the solutions are
also linear. The guess solution is typically of the form 𝑥𝑡 = 𝑔(𝑥𝑡−1 , 𝑒𝑡 ), and solves the model when
substituted into it. The equilibrium processes of the model and the shocks are then defined and can
be applied in the impulse response analysis. However, applying these steps by hand on the current
model – although providing an informative explanation of the derivation of the equilibrium processes
– is and extensive task and is beyond the scope of this thesis16. Instead, the model is written in its loglinear form in Dynare (MATLAB), where it is solved and checked for determinacy and stability. In
Dynare, it yields policy and transition functions of the form 𝑥𝑡 = 𝑥 𝑠𝑠 + 𝐴(𝑥𝑡 − 𝑥 𝑠𝑠 ) + 𝐵𝑒𝑡 , which
describe the effect a change in one 𝑡 − 1 variable has on a 𝑡 variable.

3.6 Calibration
Calibration of a DSGE model entails setting the parameters of the model so that they are in line with
previous results or theoretical conclusions and yield a steady state which corresponds with the longterm growth rates of the economy (observed in the data). The model used in this thesis is calibrated
to fit the Finnish economy, using conclusions from previous literature on the economic parameters in
Finland. Some simplifications are made, such as the normalization of steady state prices to one and
assuming steady state values of technology and the level of utilization of capital to be equal to one.
This thesis mainly calibrates according to the results of Kilponen et al. (2016). They apply a Bayesian
estimation approach, calibrating only a small set of structural parameters of the DSGE model. Their
data is on a quarterly level of the Finnish economy, starting from the second quarter of 1995 to the
last quarter of 2014. The data contains 24 variables, which are retrieved from the Statistic of Finland’s
Quarterly National Accounts, the Bank of Finland and the European Central Bank. Bayesian
estimation implies utilizing both prior information about the parameters and the information provided
by the data. Using broad prior distributions, they find that the data is informative, due to the
significantly differing posterior and prior distributions. A full explanation and visualization of the
prior and posterior distributions is found in the appendix of Kilponen et al. (2016).
Kilponen et al. (2016) parameterize their DSGE model to match averages of a set of variables in the
sample data, allowing some parameters to be estimated based on the information in the data and

keeping some parameters fixed and calibrated directly. First, the fixed parameters are discussed,
followed by the estimated parameters.

𝜓𝑝

The household discount rate (𝛽) is set equal to 0.998. The intermediate firm price markup (𝜓

) is

𝑝 −1

𝜓𝑤

calibrated to 1.08, meaning that 𝜓𝑝 = 13.5. Similarly, the household wage markup (𝜓

) is equal

𝑤 −1

to 1.45 and 𝜓𝑤 = 3.22, signifying that the wage markup is higher than the price markup in Finland.
The capital depreciation rate () is fixed at 0.014.
This thesis utilizes the posterior means used in Kilponen et al. (2016). The intertemporal consumption
is very persistent according to the data. The habit formation parameter posterior mean (𝜙𝑐 ) is 0.95.
The high persistence in consumption and resistance to external shocks may be due to demographic
trends (Kilponen et al., 2016). The investment adjustment cost parameter () is 8.2, which is higher
than in most other estimated DSGE models (Kilponen et al., 2016). The Calvo parameter of wage
(𝜃𝑤 ) and price formation (𝜃𝑝 ) is 0.94 and 0.39, respectively, reflecting that wages are relatively rigid
compared to prices. The price indexation parameter (𝛾𝑝 ) is set at 0.74. The Frisch labor supply
elasticity parameter () is estimated to 0.87. Furthermore, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution
parameter is not directly estimated in Kilponen et al. (2016), however, in a previous paper, Kilponen
et al. (2006) calibrate the parameter to 0.5, meaning that  is equal to 2 (inversely related)17.
Alternatively, the utility function can take the form of a logarithmic and CRRA combination (which
is assumed in subchapter 5.3.1). The share of non-Ricardian households is calibrated to 0.28 in the
baseline case, using data on the share of households in Finland that are able to meet unexpected
financial expenses (Eurostat, 2021). The average share is 28 percent of the total population, from
2005 to 2019. Furthermore, Guerriero (2019)18 finds that the labor share of income in Finland from
2000 to 2010 is 73 percent, meaning that the capital share of income is 27 percent (Cobb-Douglas
production function).

17

This inverse relationship between the intertemporal elasticity of substitution and risk aversion is unrealistic. Rather,
the risk aversion rate controls the household consumption substitution willingness across states and the
intertemporal elasticity of substitution parameter does the same but across time. See Kilponen et al. (2006) for
further discussion.
18
Guerriero (2019) argues that the estimation of the labor share of income is difficult and that there are several
means of calculating it. Guerriero (2019) uses several calculation approaches and argues that LS6 is one the most
reliable. This thesis utilizes the LS6 average of Finland in the period 2000-2010.

24

The parameters related to the shocks are calibrated depending on the scenario analysis. However, the
baseline autoregressive parameterization is calibrated to fit the results of Kilponen et al. (2016). They
find that the household preference rate shocks dissipate quickly in the Finnish business cycle, with
the autoregressive coefficient (𝜌𝜉1 ) being equal to 0.11. This parameter may be higher in the case of
the COVID-19 related preference shocks, due to the stubbornness of the virus. Hence, the scenario
analysis also assumes higher values for this parameter. The autoregressive parameters of the labor
supply shock (𝜌𝜁 ) and the productivity shock (𝜌𝐴 ) are set to 0.37 and 0.9, respectively. This
calibration follows the result of Snellman (2019), who use a calibrated DSGE model employed by
the Finnish Ministry of Finance (KOOMA). The labor supply shock may also be more persistent than
calibrated in the KOOMA model and is therefore further tested in the scenario analysis. Lastly, a unit
shock is used for all shock processes imposed on the model19 (including those of chapter 5), with the
standard deviation of the technology shock calibrated to 0.0487 and 0.2393, in the case of both the
consumption and labor supply shock. This parameterization is also based on Kilponen et al. (2016),
though since they do not model a labor supply preference shock, the standard deviation of the
consumption preference shock is also used for the labor supply shock. Note that the parameterization
of these standard deviations has no qualitative impact on the shock processes.

4. RESULTS
This chapter presents and discusses the results of the impulse response analysis. First the shock to the
utility of labor is investigated, followed by the shock to the utility of consumption and to productivity.
A scenario analysis is then conducted, examining the dynamics of different calibrations and shock
scenarios. Subchapter 4.4 tests the sensitivity of the model. Lastly, all figures assume yearly price
and wage inflation, meaning that the impulse response functions (IRF) of price and wage inflation
have been multiplied by 4. Furthermore, the IRF figures show the percentage deviations of the
variables from their respective steady states (multiply the y-axis by 100). Total consumption and
labor (notated Labor supply and Consumption in the figures, respectively) is divided into a Ricardian
and a non-Ricardian part.

19

A typical shock process can be calibrated or estimated based on aggregate macroeconomic data on the business
cycle (the autoregressive coefficient and the standard deviation of the shock). The shock will then follow the typical
process observed in the data. See Cooley and Prescott (1995) for an example.

25

4.1 Labor supply preference shock
Figure 2 illustrates a positive one standard deviation shock to the disutility of labor supply. The shock
dissipates quickly as per the baseline parameterization. The shock causes total labor supply to
decrease, though labor supply of Ricardian households fall more than the supply of the non-Ricardian
counterpart. This difference in behavior is mainly due to non-Ricardian households’ inability to
invest. The fall in income causes the Ricardian household to decrease consumption and savings.
However, non-Ricardian households have no investments and hence decrease leisure more (instead
of savings), because this was previously the asset they aquired as a substitut for investments. Total
labor supply falls by approximately 0.3 percent on impact, and then returns to the steady state. The
lesser willingness to work and the fall in labor supply is followed by an increase in wages. The fall
in labor is also accompanied by a fall in consumption and a drop in output (0.02 percent and 0.2
percent on impact, respectively). Consumption continues to fall for 25 quarters due to strong habit
20
̂𝑡 − 𝜆̂
formation. Firms’ willingness to invest drops, as shown in the fall of Tobin’s q (𝑞̂ = 𝑄
𝑅,𝑡 ) ,

which is below the steady state for three quarters. Capital adjusts sluggishly due to the specification
of investment adjustment costs. Furthermore, the level of utilization of installed capital is below the
steady state level for ten quarters. The intermediate firms demand less capital, and whilst capital is
adjusting to a lower level, the level of utilization decreases to make up for the slow adjustment process
of capital. The effect on inflation in this model is insignificant due to the optimization problem of
firms and the specification of investment vehicle. Firms choose the optimal bundle of inputs (capital
and labor). This dynamic determines wages and the gross interest rate so that they almost completely
cancel out, causing an insignificant effect on marginal costs (in terms of deviations from the steady
state). Without an alternative investment vehicle (e.g., bonds), the interest rate is solely determined
by the saving decisions that is done via firm investments. Modelling a nominal interest rate and a
corresponding interest rate as well as monetary authorities leads to additional inflation dynamics (see
chapter 5).

20

Here Tobin’s marginal q reflects the marginal willingness to invest. It depends on the shadow price of consumption
and capital. If the shadow price of consumption is higher than that of capital, then Tobin’s marginal q is negative, as in
figure 1. Note that households own firms and their savings/investments are directly connected to the firms, meaning
that if capital is deemed of higher value than previously, investment increases (ceteris paribus). Households compare
the value of capital to the value of consumption (utility-wise).

4.2 Consumption preference shock
Figure 3 illustrates a negative one standard deviation shock to the utility of consumption. Less utility
from consumption causes aggregate consumption and output to fall for the first two periods before
returning to the steady state. Labor supply also falls as a result of decreased value of consumption.
However, non-Ricardian households decrease labor supply more because their only alternative to
consumption is leisure. Ricardian households also increase their investment acquisitions, substituting
some consumption. Capital adjusts sluggishly and utilization of installed capacity is persistantly
below the steady state, due to output being below the steady state in parallel with capital increasing
over the same period. An interesting difference to the labor supply shock is that investments increase,
causing capital to build and the level of utilization of installed capacity to remain under the steady
state level for a long period of time. It also induces the real interest rate to fall further, as demand for
capital is low and the supply of capital increases.

29

4.3 Technology shock
Figure 4 illustrates a negative one standard deviation shock to technology. The shock causes the
maginal products of labor and capital to decrease, leading to intermediate firms demanding less input.
The decreased value of capital also causes Tobin’s q to fall, reducing investment and capital.
Utilization of installed capacity is below the steady state for as long as capital adjusts to the fall in
demand. The decrease in income leads non-Ricardian households to increase their labor supply due
to a dominant income effect. With consumption habit formation, they adjust more slowly, resulting
in a need for higher labor supply. Ricardian households decrease supplied labor due to a stronger
substitution effect. Note that these results may vary depending on the calibration of the model
parameters, where the inverse of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution parameter and the inverse
of the Frisch labor elasticity as well as the habit formation parameter and the nominal rigidities play
key roles in determining the income and substitution effects (Costa, 2016). Higher values for the habit
formation parameter (0.95) implies a strong income effect, which affects shock dynamics and
policymaking. Additionally, increasing the fraction of non-Ricardians entails less investments, which
worsens economic capacity and lowers consumption (Costa, 2016). Furthermore, output and
aggregate consumption fall in response to the negative productivity shock. Output decreases by 10
percent on impact and fully returns to the steady state after approximately 10 years.

30

Figure 4: Impulse response function, a negative one standard deviation shock to technology.
Measured as log-deviations from the steady state. The time axis is in quarters.

The results from the baseline calibration show that the COVID-19 pandemic shocks induce a fall in
output, consumption and labor supply. Investment increases in the case of a consumption preference
shock due to investment and leisure being the only two alternatives to consumption (leisure also
increases). The utilization of installed capacity also remains below the steady state level for
approximately 2 years, given a supply-side shock. During the consumption shock, however, the
increase in the capital stock (due to the rise in investment) in parallel with a fall in output, forces the
31

utilization of installed capacity as well as the real interest rate to remain below the steady state for a
long period of time.
Note that the calibration of the shock processes is set according to the results of previous literature,
meaning that the magnitude and persistence of the shocks are parameterized on typical Finnish
business cycle data. In the COVID-19 setting, some of these parameters might show stronger
magnitude or higher persistence. This might be especially true for the case of the labor and
consumption preference shocks, as they typically are insignificant drivers of the Finnish business
cycle fluctuations (Kilponen et al., 2016). Furthermore, other calibrations may be relevant in the
COVID-19 case, such as the parameterization of the Ricardian-to-non-Ricardian household ratio and
the deep parameters of the model. The next two subchapters discuss model sensitivity and utilize a
scenario approach with different calibrations for the Finnish environment to analyze the implications
of different COVID-19 shock processes.

4.4 Model sensitivity
The deep parameters affect both short-term and long-term dynamics of the model (Kilponen et al.,
2006). This subchapter follows the approach in Kilponen et al. (2006), analyzing the effects of
changing the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution parameter and the Frisch elasticity.
Additionally, both nominal rigidities are adjusted to 0.75, which implies higher price stickiness and
lower wage rigidity than in the baseline case (0.39 and 0.94, respectively). The sensitivity of the
model with respect to the habit formation parameter is examined in subchapter 5.3. An analysis of
different shock processes and different household heterogeneity calibrations is provided in subchapter
4.5. Figures are listed in the appendix.
Adjusting the intertemporal elasticity parameter primarily affects the intertemporal consumption
decision of households and the supply of labor. Increasing σ above 2 decreases the effect on
consumption independently of the type of shock. In the case of a consumption preference shock,
output falls less than when σ = 2. The directions of the effects are unaffected. Higher values of σ
entails higher risk aversion (lower intertemporal substitution elasticity) and a decreased willingness
to substitute consumption over time. Hence, consumption falls less with higher values of σ.

32

The Frisch elasticity determines how labor supply reacts to changes in the real wage. Increasing φ
from 0.87 to 1.5 has no qualitative or quantitative implications for the results. The model is insensitive
to changes in φ (in terms of the effects of the shocks).
Changing the nominal rigidities to 0.75 increases the stickiness of prices and decreases the stickiness
of wages. It does not result in qualitative remarks on the labor and consumption shock effects.
However, wages adjust more aggressively, causing a larger impact on labor supply. Interestingly,
given a productivity shock, a lower stickiness in wage formation induces Ricardian households to
increase their labor supply, meaning that the income effect dominates given a large enough fall in
wages. Furthermore, the productivity shock only reduces output by 1.5 percent. The model is highly
sensitive to changes in the nominal rigidities.

4.5 Scenario analysis
This subchapter performs a scenario analysis by differing the magnitude and persistency of the shocks
and increasing the fraction of rule-of-thumb consumers (non-Ricardians). The baseline case, which
assumes typical Finnish business cycle shock processes, is considered as the mild scenario. The
severe scenario assumes double magnitude and higher persistency (approximately 2 years).
Doubling the magnitude of the shocks exacerbates the severity of the effects but does not change the
persistency or dynamics of the shocks. Given a productivity shock, the effect on output on impact is
a fall of 20 percent. Similarly, the effect on output from a consumption preference shock and a labor
supply shock is -0.025 percent and -0.5 percent, respectively. However, the typical consumption
preference shock and labor supply shock have a comparatively small effect on the Finnish business
cycle. It might be that the COVID-19 specific shocks are of higher magnitude. In a severe scenario,
the COVID-19 shocks could affect the economy drastically in the short-run, with as much as 10-20
percent of output in the cases analyzed in this chapter.
In the baseline calibration, it takes 7.5 to 10 years for the economy (output) to fully reach its steady
state (though it starts recovering much earlier than that). However, adjusting the persistency of the
labor supply shock and the consumption preference shock both exacerbates the severity of the effects
and increases the amount of time it takes for the economy to reach its steady state. The appendix
reveals the case when the persistence is increased to 0.9 for both shocks. In that scenario (keeping the
magnitudes of the shocks equal to the baseline case), the labor supply shock causes output to fall by
33

0.5 percent on impact and 2.5 percent in the tenth quarter, before moving towards the steady state.
The steady state of output is reached after 15 years. Similarly, the consumption preference shock
generates an initial fall in output of 0.1 percent, continuing to decline to -0.45 percent in the tenth
quarter and reaching the steady state after 12.5 years.
There is great uncertainty in calibrating the COVID-19 shock processes, partly because the pandemic
is a novel exogenous shock typically unobserved in business cycle data. However, according to the
scenario approach above, the shocks could cause economic activity (output) to drop around 10 percent
in Finland, considering they might work in tandem. Furthermore, the outcome could be worse if
bankruptcies, financial dispersions, hysteresis effects or more severe calibrations were applied to the
model. Nevertheless, considering a lower productivity shock persistency or different deep parameter
calibrations can result in smaller effects on the economy (see subchapter 4.4). Additionally, including
stabilizing fiscal and monetary policy may also reduce the fall in economic activity (see chapter 5).
The next paragraph examines the effects of the shocks in an environment with a larger fraction of
rule-of-thumb consumers.
As per the baseline calibration, non-Ricardian households form 28 percent of the economy. However,
increased unemployment, financial distortions and uncertainty in the COVID-19 environment could
increase the fraction of non-Ricardian households. Increasing the fraction has two effects on the shock
outcomes. First, it increases the influence of non-Ricardian households on the economy. Second, it
changes the labor supply of the households. In the case of the labor supply shock and productivity
shock, Ricardian households further decrease their labor supply. In the productivity shock, a larger
fraction of non-Ricardians increase their labor supply, meaning that total labor falls less. Given a
consumption preference shock, Ricardian households respond by increasing labor supply in the first
period, after which their labor supply falls. A larger amount of non-Ricardians reduce their labor
supply, causing a larger fall in total labor and a higher increase in wage, which Ricardian households
take advantage of by working more (substitution effect) and expanding their investments. On average
(between the shocks), increasing the fraction of non-Ricardian households mitigates the fall in labor
supply and output. Other than these direct effects in the model, increasing the fraction of nonRicardians can change the dynamics of government fiscal policy and adds heterogeneity to the
optimal policy problem, which is investigated in chapter 5.

34

5. ADDING FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY
The government and the central bank affect economic outcomes via fiscal and monetary policy.
Ambrocio and Juselius (2020) outline several key arguments and pathways for policy action during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Fiscal policy should aid households and firms via relief programs,
transfers, unemployment benefits, programs to incentivize firms keeping workers and by alleviating
the pressured credit flow. Substantial support might be necessary to avoid hysteresis effects and
negative feedback loops. They also raise the issue whether stimulus should be inflation-based or debtfinanced. Finland’s fiscal maneuverability space is small, and an increased debt burden affect future
maneuverability, debt sustainability, international cooperation and the welfare of future generations
(Ambrocio and Juselius, 2020). Monetary policy can support the credit flow and steer the economy
via the policy interest rates and the large-scale asset purchase programs. Galí (2020) argues that
inflation-based stimuli may be preferable in highly indebted regions, such as the Euro area. Moreover,
Galí (2019) finds that even when an economy is restricted to a zero lower bound for nominal interest
rates, money-financed fiscal support is more effective in terms of fiscal multipliers than conventional
policy.
The model in this chapter is an extension of the baseline model, following the approach of Costa
(2016). A government is introduced by modelling taxes on capital, labor and consumption as well as
transfers and government expenditure. Seignorage, that is, money-financed fiscal stimulus, is
excluded as a means of stimulating the economy21. However, as shown by Gali (2019), considering
helicopter money or money-financed fiscal stimulus might provide a viable fiscal alternative, given
the zero lower bound and already highly indebted countries. Furthermore, it is assumed that the
negative effects of the COVID-19 related shocks are combatted via a Taylor rule set by the central
bank (Taylor, 1993). This is a simplification; Finland is only a small part of the euro block and the
ECB sets its policy according to the entire area. However, the COVID-19 exogenous shock hit all
Euro area countries simultaneously and the ECB is responding to the crisis with a strong
accommodative policy stance, in line with the negative economic effects in Finland. Hence, at least
to some degree, the shock is harmonized across most countries, meaning that the ECB is reacting to
the shock in Finland as it is to the shock in other countries. To model the partly imperfect response
to Finland’s economy, it is assumed that the Taylor rule follows a lagged structure22 and reacts to the
21

Issuing money via seignorage increases the money supply and aggregate demand without inferring an increase in
future tax rates or debt accumulation (Gali, 2019). However, the credibility of the central bank is at risk of eroding.
22
Kilponen et al. (2016) deliberate that there is some evidence of Finland’s banking sector (rates) reacting with a
lagged structure to changes in the ECB steering rates.

economy with smaller magnitude. Modelling a separate credit market in Finland with a link to the
ECB steering rates as in Kilponen et al. (2016) is beyond the scope of this thesis.

5.1 The model extended with fiscal and monetary policy
Introducing a government or public sector can be done in several ways. A complete public sector may
include public sector wages and labor, public investment, government spending and different types
of funding systems23. The latter includes public debt, seignorage (issuance of money), distortionary
and non-distortionary taxes and transfers (Costa, 2016). Additionally, modelling public goods in the
utility function or appending frictions such as investment adjustment costs and habit formation further
serves the adjustment principle. This chapter introduces a government to the model based on Costa
(2016). However, as the focus is on the government spending shock and a monetary policy shock, it
excludes public investment and public capital. It also adds price indexation as in the previous model
as well as the COVID-19 shocks. Most equations from the previous model still hold. The main
differences are the inclusion of taxes (which distort households’ decisions) and the government and
central bank related equations. The steady state is also adjusted. The next subchapter presents the
equations of the extended model.

5.1.1 Households and firms
The household optimization problem differs from the previous model only in terms of the
distortionary taxes, transfers and the government bonds that are added to the budget constraints of
the households. Equation (5.1) presents the maximization problem.

The firm side of the model remains unaltered, as public investment is omitted in this thesis24. Hence,
the marginal cost function, pricing mechanics, aggregations and production input equations in the
previous model, remain valid. However, total output now also includes government spending
(𝑌𝑡 = 𝐶𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡 + 𝐺𝑡 ).

5.1.2 Government and fiscal policy
The government taxes households, issues debt, controls the transfers and uses the revenue on
government expenditure (𝐺𝑡 ). The model assumes that the steady state of the government debt-toGDP ratio is given by 𝐵𝑠𝑠 = 𝜑𝐵𝑠𝑠 𝑌𝑠𝑠 . Similarly, 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝜑 𝑇𝑅𝐴𝑁𝑆𝑠𝑠 𝑌𝑠𝑠 . Total tax revenue is defined
by equation (5.4) and the government budget constraint follows equation (5.5). The term

Future work can model a complete public sector with public capital and investment, public goods as well as public
sector labor and capital demand. It could be interesting to analyze the effects of a capital destruction shock in the
private sector or a shock in private sector labor supply, assuming that mainly the private sector is hit by the pandemic.

37

Government debt is allowed to fluctuate around the steady state level. Temporary and positive shocks
in public spending are sustainable as long as they are offset by negative shocks over time
(𝐸𝑡 𝐺𝑡,𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑐𝑘 = 0), that is, the shock is random and have an expected mean of zero. Hence, public debt
is nonexplosive, and the no-Ponzi scheme condition is satisfied (Costa, 2016).
The instruments of fiscal policy are given by taxes, transfers and public spending. The modelling
approach of these instruments follow Costa (2016) and assumes a decision rule (5.6) for all
instruments (𝑧𝑡 = 𝜏𝑡𝑐 , 𝜏𝑡𝑙 , 𝜏𝑡𝑘 , 𝐺𝑡 , 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑡 )25. The shocks follow an autoregressive process (where 𝜌𝑧 is
the autoregressive coefficient and 𝜀 represents the error term) and use the same fiscal instrument
notation logic (5.7).

rules to yield a stable solution (debt-brake rule). Without it, fiscal policy could stimulate the economy
without bound.
The Finnish government has responded to the crisis with increased public expenditure and
investments, support programs for households and firms (e.g., loans) and automatic stabilizers such
as unemployment benefits (Ministry of Finance (B), 2020). These fiscal actions are captured via a
positive discretionary fiscal policy shock and by assuming output stabilizing fiscal policy rules. These
measures generally increase debt and stimulate output in the short run at the cost of worsened debt
sustainability. 𝑆𝑡𝑧 represents a fiscal policy shock.

the 60-percent target assumed by member states of the European Union. Increasing this target would
give Finland’s government more fiscal maneuverability. Furthermore, it is assumed that
unemployment benefits constitute transfers and are equal to 2 percent of GDP (𝜑 𝑇𝑅𝐴𝑁𝑆𝑠𝑠 = 0.02)
(OECD, 2021). The automatic stabilizers (𝜙𝑧 ) are assumed to be increasing debt to stabilize the fall
in output. Different calibrations are reported in the policy relevant figures. Lastly, the shock processes
have a magnitude of 0.01 and a persistency of 0.9 (these can be adjusted to achieve a monetary or
fiscal goal).

calibrated to 2, satisfying the Taylor principle to establish determinacy. 𝛾𝑌 is the reaction to deviations

is modelled to react to the Finnish economy with a lagged structure.

5.2 The COVID-19 shocks
This subchapter returns to the effects of the COVID-19 shocks. Modelling fiscal and monetary
authorities have important implications for the shocks’ effects on the economy. Both fiscal and
monetary policy stabilize output (and inflation) and reduce the impact of the shocks. The impulse

It is assumed that the COVID-19 shock dynamics are identical across the Euro area, meaning that the ECB reacts
almost perfectly to the Finnish economy. However, there are some frictions introduced by the lagged reaction system
and the weight and harmonizing parameter (the latter sets the magnitude).

response figures differentiate between the baseline calibration with 28 percent non-Ricardians and a
setting with the share of non-Ricardian households increased to 50 percent. Furthermore, this
subchapter considers a mild and a severe shock scenario (as in chapter 4).

5.2.1 The COVID-19 shocks – non-Ricardian and Ricardian households
Increasing the fraction of non-Ricardian households has similar results as in the previous model.
Almost doubling the fraction of non-Ricardians yield insignificant changes in the variable responses
to the shocks. The rule-of-thumb consumers supply more labor and consume more products when
their fraction of the workforce increases. Other effects are negligible. Figures 5, 6 and 7 illustrate the
impulse response functions to the labor, consumption, and productivity shock, respectively.

5.2.2 The COVID-19 shocks – shock scenarios
This subchapter examines the overall effects on the economy given a mild and a severe scenario. The
former assumes that the shock processes follow typical Finnish business cycle data, and the latter
presumes double the magnitude of the former and a two-year persistency (the strength is low in the
last year of the shocks). It is also assumed that tax rates and public spending are constant. The only
active automatic stabilizer is transfers, which increase due to the economic downturn. Costa (2016)
explains that public spending is – relative to the other fiscal alternatives – rigid. Hence, only transfers
and public investment function as active stabilizers, leaving only transfers in this version of the
model. Figure 8, 9 and 10 reveal the labor supply shock, consumption shock and productivity shock,
respectively. 𝑅ℎ𝑜 is the autoregressive coefficient (persistency) and 𝑠𝑡𝑑. 𝑒𝑟𝑟 is the magnitude of the
shock.
Both the labor supply shock and the consumption preference shock find significantly increased effects
in the severe scenario. This is mainly due to the higher persistency of the shocks. The impact of the
productivity shock is smaller when the persistency is lower (0.8 from 0.9), even though the magnitude
of the shock is doubled. The inclusion of fiscal and monetary policy results in a faster convergence
to the steady state. The economy requires a 5-year recovery period to reach its steady state after a
productivity shock. However, in the severe case, the labor and consumption shocks generate
(approximately) a 10-year recovery period. In the more severe scenario, and by adding the effects on
output from all shocks, output falls by about 4-5 percent (from the steady state) in the first year.
According to the Bank of Finland (2021), Finland’s GDP fell 2.8 percent in 2020. Given a mild
scenario and considering a lower productivity persistence, economic activity could fall by around 2
percent in the first year. Hence, the mild scenario seems better fitting for forecasting the
macroeconomic effects in Finland. However, there is still great uncertainty about which shock to
emphasize as there are several shocks hitting the economy, some of which are excluded in this model
(e.g., trade). Considering a broad aggregate demand shock in parallel with some smaller supply-side
shocks or emphasizing the consumption preference shock could potentially fit the current pandemic
dynamics better. Nonetheless, it is imperative for policymaking to study different shock dynamics
that might occur, depending on the stage of the pandemic and the dominating shock.
Furthermore, the consumption shock is the only shock that yields deflationary pressures (demandside shock). The two other shocks generate stagflation, causing an unfortunate trade-off for monetary

policy. The Eurozone experienced a fall in inflation during the pandemic in 2020 (ECB, 2021).
However, some consumer products such as food, alcohol and tobacco have indeed encountered some
inflationary periods in the early stage of the pandemic (Ebrahimy et al., 2020). Ebrahimy et al. (2020)
deliberate that if the early stage of the pandemic is characterized by supply distortions (e.g., a labor
supply shock), inflation could increase. Furthermore, in emerging markets, currency depreciation in
parallel with supply shocks is inflationary. However, in advanced economies, such as Finland, the
zero lower bound for interest rates, unemployment, and a fall in aggregate demand, seem to dominate
the inflation dynamics. Ebrahimy et al. (2020) do not find an increase in inflation other than on food
items. Additionally, most of the current literature finds that aggregate demand falls more than supply
(Ambrocio and Juselius, 2020), yielding deflationary pressures. Hence, emphasizing the demand-side
shocks seems more appropriate for analyzing the macroeconomic effects of the current pandemic (at
least in the current stage). Figure 32 in the appendix shows the macroeconomic effects of a
consumption preference shock that yield a 2.8 percent fall in output in the first year. The issue with
the consumption preference shock is that it results in an increase in private investment, which is why
an aggregate demand shock is better fitting. Shocking the demand for investment in parallel with the
fall in the utility of consumption exacerbates the fall in economic activity, as the Ricardian households
also reduce investments (compared to the baseline case). Another nuance in the extended model is
that the increase in the real interest rate has a positive effect on the utilization of installed capacity,
as households wish to use more capital when interest rates are higher. However, the initial spike in
the level of utilization quickly reverts. Furthermore, the real interest rate is more influenced by
marginal costs than in the baseline model, meaning that changes in wages and technology also affect
the outcome of the real interest rate. Higher wages during the labor supply shock entail larger
marginal costs, which forces the real interest rate up (initially), even though the demand for capital is
lower. Given a technology disturbance, the shock component dominates the change in wages (in the
determination of marginal costs), increasing the real interest rate on impact (see equation 25).
Note also that public debt increases significantly due to the fall in tax revenues and the increase in
transfers. A scenario mainly driven by supply shocks also entails increased interest rates, further
worsening debt sustainability. This situation makes debt-financed stimulus more problematic. In the
case of COVID-19, it seems that debt-financed stimulus is appropriate (in terms of low interest rates
in the current stage).

5.3 Monetary and fiscal policy
In the analysis above, the automatic stabilizers are mostly inactive and there is no discretionary fiscal
or monetary policy to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. This subchapter imposes a public spending
shock (figure 11) and a monetary shock (figure 12). Furthermore, as the household heterogeneity in
the model could have important implications for the dynamics of the shocks (Galí et al., 2007), a
comparison of the impulse responses of a baseline calibration and an environment with a larger
fraction of rule-of-thumb consumers (𝜔𝑅 = 0.5) is examined.
Increased public spending directly raises output. The change in aggregate demand applies upward
pressure on inflation, making the central bank raise the steering rates. The latter effect induces
Ricardians to reduce consumption and investment due to the fall in government bond prices.
However, in the baseline calibration, non-Ricardians indeed increase consumption (slightly) in the
first few quarters, though the effect is small. Hence, the model applied in this study does not yield
any significant increase in non-Ricardian consumption after a public spending shock. The same result
applies to larger fractions of non-Ricardians. However, decreasing the habit formation parameter and
increasing the price stickiness parameter induces a larger positive effect on consumption (see figure
34 in the appendix), which is in line with the results of Galí et al. (2004). Hence, in a Finnish
environment, the low price rigidity and the strong habit formation makes the public spending shock
reduce private consumption. These parameters need to the carefully calibrated, to avoid inaccurate
modelling results (Costa, 2016). Lastly, public debt increases, though the rise in output partly offsets
it.
Applying the baseline calibration to the monetary policy shock induces unintuitive shock effects, as
inflation surges, causing the steering rates to automatically increase (yielding a contractionary shock).
This result seems to be due to the calibration of a few parameters, namely the nominal rigidities of
prices and wages as well as the investment adjustment cost. In the baseline calibration, prices are
assumed to be flexible whilst wages are rigid. Quick price adjustment entails a larger inflationary
force, in the sense that firms are able to adjust their prices more quickly to shocks (inflation is
decreasing in 𝜃𝑝 , see the Phillips equation in the appendix). The monetary policy shock reduces the
steering rate, which increases the price of government bonds and shifts Ricardian bond allocations to
consumption and investment instead (or leisure). However, in the baseline calibration, investment
adjustment is slow, which puts further pressure on consumption and inflation. The wage rigidity
strongly affects labor supply. Given an expansionary monetary shock, Ricardians reduce their labor

supply, however, with high wage rigidity, they reduce it even further as wages are rigid. Relative to
the case with lower wage rigidity, wages are higher, serving as an inflationary effect. The aggregate
effect on labor supply is negative. The total effect on inflation is large, causing the central bank to
adjust interest rates upward. Figure 13 shows the impulse responses of a monetary policy shock, but
with different calibrations for the nominal rigidities. Adjusting price stickiness up and wage rigidity
down, yields more intuitive effects, with Ricardian consumption and investment increasing. Clearly,
the model is sensitive to the calibration of the nominal rigidities. The high wage rigidity causes the
Phillips equation for wages to be very forward looking and insensitive to changes in labor supply.
Considering lower values for the wage stickiness parameter seems appropriate for this model.
The main automatic stabilizer considered in this model is transfers, which constitute unemployment
benefits and other automatic transfers to households. Additionally, at least in the current pandemic,
Finland’s government responds to the economic environment with an increase in public investment
and spending as well as tax support programs (Ministry of Finance (B), 2020). Therefore, the next
consideration sets public spending and taxes on consumption to also automatically adjust according
to economic conditions. Furthermore, as the fiscal policy stance is very accommodative, debt is
allowed to increase and the government focuses on stabilizing output. Figures 14, 15 and 16 illustrate
the changes in the responses to a labor supply, a consumption and a productivity shock, respectively.
These figures visualize an accommodative fiscal stance and a neutral fiscal stance. The government
responds to the shocks by reducing the consumption tax and increasing public spending and transfers.
The automatic stabilizers increase output but also risk crowding out private consumption and
investment. The economy returns quicker to the steady state than without the stabilizers. However,
the stabilizers adjust to decrease debt (and because of the return of output to its steady state), resulting
in a later fall in output. The initial fall in output only lasts for the first year, compared to the 5-10quarter period without fiscal adjustment. As in the case with a discretionary shock, debt increases,
causing concern for debt sustainability.
To summarize, both fiscal discretionary policy and automatic stabilizers can mitigate the fall in
economic activity that ensues the COVID-19 shocks. This result is independent of the type of shock
that dominates the environment. One central issue is that Finland already has a high debt to output
ratio, which infers risk of debt unsustainability, reduced future fiscal maneuverability and increased
burden on future generations. Monetary policy may also stimulate output via discretionary policy, at
the risk of inducing inflation (which may lead to a strong future rate hike). The type of shock is central
for monetary policymaking. If the supply-side shocks dominate, it could lead to stagflation, leaving
46

monetary authorities incapable of stabilizing output and inflation simultaneously. Furthermore, a
quick recovery in economic activity in parallel with risks such as anti-globalization and reduced
productivity as well as a highly accommodative monetary stance (negative interest rates and
quantitative easing), may lead to high inflation. To adhere its price stability mandate, the ECB would
be forced to increase its steering rates, causing further pressure on the Eurozone debt sustainability
issue (both public and private).

5.3.1 Welfare analysis and optimal policy
Examining optimal policy requires an assessment of welfare losses. A welfare loss function can be
derived from the utility functions of households as in Galí (2008). He finds a quadratic welfare loss
function of output gap and inflation. Zhang et al. (2021) build a similar welfare loss function based
on utility functions of both Ricardian and non-Ricardian households and investigate the welfare losses
in a DSGE model estimated on the Chinese economy. They consider the quadratic deviations of
consumption and labor supply from the steady state, which fits the model in this thesis well. The
function considers long-run welfare, as opposed to short-run welfare, which can be directly derived
from the instantaneous utility function in equation (3). This subchapter assumes the welfare loss
function used in Zheng et al. (2021)27 and analyzes the welfare effects on heterogenous households
in a Finnish environment. Additionally, it derives some conclusions about optimal policy.
Equations (5.9)–(5.11) show the welfare loss functions. They depend on the percentage deviation of
consumption (𝐶̂𝑡𝑅 ) and labor (𝐿̂𝑅𝑡 ) from their respective steady state values. 𝜙𝑐 is the habit formation
parameter, 𝛽 the discounting factor, 𝛼 the sensitivity of output to changes in capital, 𝜑 the inverse of
the Frisch elasticity and 𝜔𝑅 the fraction of Ricardian households. Note that given high consumption
habit formation (0.95), the welfare function in this thesis emphasizes deviations in consumption more
than in Zhang et al. (2021).

Given these equations, figure 17 shows the welfare effects of the COVID-19 shocks. Figure 18
illustrates welfare losses with different central bank policy responses. Lastly, figure 19 reveals the
welfare losses corresponding to different fiscal policy adjustments (automatic stabilizers). NonRicardian households experience a stronger welfare loss than the Ricardian counterpart. This result
27

The inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution parameter is assumed to be equal to one, resulting in the
same welfare function as in Zheng et al. (2021).

supports the conclusion of Zheng et al. (2021), who find that the COVID-19 shocks cause a larger
impact on poor families. Hence, fiscal and monetary policy may need to support the poor (nonRicardian) households further, given that the shocks affect households asymmetrically. The same
result applies to the baseline model (see appendix, figure 34).
Zheng et al. (2021) find that increasing the reaction to deviations in output in the Taylor rule can be
welfare improving in some circumstances. According to the model and calibration used in this study,
the central bank is unable to reduce the welfare losses of households by reacting more strongly to
output. This is mainly due to the strong inflation and labor supply effect of the COVID-19 shocks,
which causes steering rates to increase. Setting more weight to the output term exacerbates the welfare
loss of the labor supply effect. The sharp initial decline in welfare for non-Ricardian households also
stems from the labor supply effect. Other calibrations can yield different results, as the model is
sensitive to parameterization. However, given the current calibration, optimal monetary policy
focuses on stabilizing prices. This conclusion is particularly important in supply-shock dominated
environments.
Increasing the stabilization coefficient of transfers can mitigate the welfare losses associated with the
COVID-19 shocks. By increasing transfers to households in the economic downturn, households can
recover some of their lost consumption. However, a crowding-out effect could worsen the welfare
losses if realized (public consumption and investment).

6. LIMITATIONS
The results rely on several assumptions. To narrow the scope of the thesis, several channels and
frictions are excluded, which may be relevant to the macroeconomic effects of the pandemic. Angelini
et al. (2020) show that financial amplification effects and hysteresis effects impose further pressure
on the economy and may reduce long-term growth. Falling asset prices, increased uncertainty,
strained cash flows and unemployment increases credit risk and exacerbates default rates, which
deepens the recession. Zhang et al. (2020) conclude that the pandemic severely disturbs global
financial markets and increases volatility. These amplification channels can be modelled via a
financial accelerator (Bernanke et al., 1999), investment shocks (Angelini et al., 2020) or similar
approaches. Moreover, the macroeconomic effects of COVID-19 propagate via several additional
channels, such as a trade channel and more complex investment and capital channels. Firm pricesetting mechanics may also depend on short-term debt financing, as emphasized by Christiano et al.
(2005) and Gilchrist et al. (2017). Furthermore, the model constitutes a simplified approach to
modelling a banking sector in Finland, excludes public investment and assumes a simple welfare
function that depends on the quadratic deviations in consumption and labor. Additionally, the central
bank is unaffected by the zero lower bound.
Costa (2016) illustrates the importance of deciding which elements to include in the model. The
presence of non-Ricardians and habit formation shifts the pattern of the substitution and income
effects and affects households’ intertemporal resource allocations. Additionally, modelling price and
wage rigidities in a New Keynesian framework may entail greater economic effects of the shocks.
Hence, these considerations are imperative for policymaking. The DSGE model also carries the
assumptions and potential shortfalls of most current DSGE applications. The model is solved in a
linear form, which only remains accurate in the neighborhood of the steady state and risks excluding
important non-linear dynamics. Blanchard (2016) lists several issues regarding DSGE-modelling in
the current literature. However, the frictions introduced to adhere the adjustment principle help
account for some of the shortfalls. Blanchard (2016) also argues that an ad hoc welfare function based
on deviations of output and inflation may be more fitting in some circumstances than a welfare
function derived directly from the model. Hence, an extension of the welfare analysis may need to
examine the results of several welfare functions. Future research may also need to focus on different
shock combinations (e.g., an aggregate demand shock).

Furthermore, the results are sensitive to parameterization. The calibration of the model directly
applies the results of Kilponen et al. (2016), which may, at least to some degree, be unfitting given
the differences in the models. Opting for a Bayesian estimation strategy would allow for the
parameters to be estimated on a larger data set as well as the use of Kilponen et al. (2016) as prior
information. Additionally, as more macroeconomic data on the pandemic becomes available, better
identification of the shock processes can be used. Alternatively, the magnitude of the shock can be
modelled as a percentage of a steady state value.

7. SUMMARY
The soaring literature on the macroeconomic effects of pandemics provides information for
policymaking and strengthens the understanding of large exogenous shock events. This thesis
contributes to the literature by examining the dynamics of the COVID-19 shocks in a Finnish
environment as well as studying policy responses and welfare. Chapter 4 outlines the dynamics of
the labor supply shock, consumption preference shock and the productivity shock in the baseline
model and provides an interpretation of the impulse response functions. All three shocks negatively
affect output, consumption and labor supply. The consumption preference shock induces Ricardian
households to allocate more resources to investments whilst the rule-of-thumb consumers emphasize
leisure. The fall in output and the real interest rate causes the level of utilization of installed capacity
to fall below the steady state as long as capital adjusts downward and output recovers. Investment
adjusts sluggishly to the shocks, as adjustment costs are high in Finland. Adjusting the nominal
rigidities may alter households’ income and substitution effects and makes the wage inflation
equation less forward looking. Setting both price and wage rigidities to 0.75 (from 0.39 and 0.94,
respectively) in the baseline model induces Ricardian households to increase their supply of labor in
response to a negative productivity shock, given a large enough fall in wages.
Adding a government and a central bank with fiscal and monetary policy rules generally reduces the
economic impact of the COVID-19 shocks. However, a supply-side dominated shock scenario (e.g.,
a productivity shock, labor supply distortions and supply-chain disruptions) generates stagflation and
hence a difficult trade-off for the central bank, forcing monetary authorities to combat inflation in
parallel with a drop in economic activity. Ebrahimy et al. (2020) argue that the inflation mechanics
depend on the phase of the pandemic. Given stagflation and increased steering rates, the debt
sustainability problem in Finland is worsened. However, in terms of COVID-19, the aggregate
demand side distortions seem to dominate the effects (Guerrieri et al., 2020). The demand-side
55

consumption preference shock yields deflationary pressures, as aggregate demand falls more than
supply. Appending a channel or shock to the demand for investments (e.g., via a fall in Tobin’s
marginal q) further exacerbates the recession. Furthermore, increased marginal costs in the extended
model implies a higher real interest rate on impact during the supply-side shocks.
The scenario analysis of the expanded model reveals that economic activity in Finland falls 2 to 5
percent and takes 5 to 10 years to recover, depending on the magnitude and persistency of the shocks
as well as the combination or choice of shocks. In the baseline model, high wage rigidity increases
economic effects of the COVID-19 shocks, as wages adjust less to the shock. Furthermore, almost
doubling the fraction of non-Ricardian households yields no significant changes to the COVID-19
shock dynamics.
A public spending shock directly increases output, but risks crowding out private consumption and
investment. In a Finnish environment with high wage rigidities, low price stickiness and high
consumption habit formation, the effect on private consumption is only slightly positive on impact,
and negative afterwards. Hence the parameterization applied in the model illustrates the potential for
a crowding-out effect of a public discretionary shock in Finland. The calibration also induces large
changes to the dynamics of a monetary policy shock. Due to the high wage rigidity, wages adjust
sluggishly, allowing Ricardian labor supply to fall drastically as they reallocate resources from public
bond purchases to other items, simultaneously as prices are relatively flexible, altogether causing a
large inflationary force on the economy. The central bank responds in the second period by increasing
steering rates, which staggers economic activity. Decreasing the wage stickiness parameter induces
more intuitive shock effects, namely an increase in consumption and investment, stimulating the
economy.
The results also show that the automatic stabilizers of the fiscal policy rules (e.g., transfers to
households, consumption taxes and government spending) alleviate the negative effects of the
COVID-19 shocks, as output falls less. However, increased public spending may entail some
crowding-out effects. Additionally, the government has to increase future tax rates and reduce
spending to adhere the public debt brake rule, causing output to fall slightly in the long run. Increased
public debt, both from the discretionary shock and the automatic stabilizers, worsens the debt
sustainability problem and shifts responsibility to future generations.

56

Moreover, the welfare analysis finds that the rule-of-thumb consumers suffer more from the COVID19 shocks compared to the Ricardian households (in both models). Hence, optimal policy may need
to consider the asymmetric welfare effects of the pandemic. Zhang et al. (2021) show that the central
bank can reduce the welfare losses of the pandemic in some circumstances28 by reacting more to
deviations in economic activity. Given the assumptions of the model and the welfare function in this
thesis, the central bank is unable to improve welfare by increasing the reaction to deviations in output
in the Taylor rule. Optimal policy in this model emphasizes price stability. However, further
assessment of the welfare function is required to yield a more complete picture of the welfare
implications of pandemics and optimal policy responses. The results also reveal that the government
can improve welfare in the short run by assuming more debt and increasing transfers to households
(e.g., unemployment benefits).
Given a demand-side shock and falling interest rates, a debt-financed stimulus package may be fitting.
However, if supply-side dynamics dominate in the long run (Ebrahimy et al., 2020), consumers spend
previously saved money and monetary policy is initially very accommodative, a surge in inflation
and interest rates in the long run may exacerbate debt sustainability (though inflation also erodes
debt). Some government stimulus might still be required to avoid or alleviate hysteresis, doom-loop
and domino effects and to evade negative short-term effects of (potential) fiscal austerity. Relying on
inflation-based stimuli is only feasible in demand dominated environments and may be insufficient
to combat the large fall in economic activity induced by the pandemic. However, focusing on
inflation-based stimulus or money-financed fiscal policy may alleviate indebted countries by
allowing debt levels to remain unchanged in parallel with implying no future tax increases (Gali,
2019).

aggregate demand fall.

Faria-e-Castro, 2020; McKibbin och Fernando, 2020; Zhang et al., 2021). Studierna visar att både
utbuds- och efterfrågechocker karaktäriserar pandemin. Ambrocio och Juselius (2020) sammanfattar
att den aggregerade efterfrågechocken överväger utbudssidechockerna, vilket skapar deflationstryck
och mindre ekonomisk aktivitet. Däremot innebär covid-19 också starka förvrängningar på
utbudssidan. Minskat arbetsutbud, lägre produktivitet, störningar i försörjningskedjor och finansiella
problem orsakar utbudssnedvridningar, som kan innebära inflationstryck. Vilken sida som dominerar
kan bero på pandemins skede. Ebrahimy et al. (2020) visar att utbudschockerna kan dominera i det
initiella skedet av pandemin.
Denna studie undersöker de makroekonomiska effekterna av covid-19 i Finland genom att tillämpa
en DSGE-modell som parameteriseras enligt finländska förhållanden. Likt tidigare litteratur utnyttjas
en nykeynesiansk grund för modellen. Grundmodellen baseras på Costa (2016) och innefattar
nyttomaximerande hushåll och vinstmaximerande företag. Hushållen konsumerar produkter,
investerar och arbetar. De antas forma konsumtionsvanor, erbjuda differentierat arbete
(monopolistisk konkurrens) och kan endast ändra lönen givet de nominella rigiditeterna (Calvo,
1983). De delas upp i ricardianska och icke-ricardianska hushåll, där de sistnämnda inte har tillgång
till de finansiella marknaderna och inte kan utjämna konsumtionen över tid. Företagen opererar också
på en monopolistisk marknad och säljer differentierade produkter. De utsätts för investerings- och
kapacitetanvändningskostnader och prisrigiditet. Covid-19-chockerna modelleras som en positiv
chock i onyttan av arbete, en negativ chock i nyttan av konsumtion och en negativ
produktivitetschock. Modellen kalibreras främst enligt resultaten från Kilponen et al. (2016).
Kalibreringen skiljer sig från tidigare litteratur eftersom prisrigiditeten är låg, lönerigiditeten är hög,
konsumtionsvanorna är starka och investeringskostnaderna är stora (Kilponen et al., 2016). Vidare i
den expanderade modellen tillsätts en stat som beskattar befolkningen enligt policyregler, ger
transfereringar, tar lån och konsumerar produkter samt en centralbank som antas justera styrräntan
enligt en taylorregel.
Avhandlingen bidrar till litteraturen genom att undersöka den nuvarande pandemins
makroekonomiska effekter och dynamik under finländska förhållanden och genom att bygga en

implikationer för dynamiken av chockerna och för optimal penning- och finanspolitik.
Enligt grundmodellens resultat utmynnar covid-19-chockerna på utbudssidan i att produktionen,
arbetsutbudet och investeringarna faller. Däremot stiger investeringarna givet en konsumtionschock,
eftersom de ricardianska hushållen skiftar resurser från konsumtion till investeringar.
Produktivitetschocken leder till att produktionen faller mellan 10 och 20 procent under det första året,
(milt respektive svårt scenario). Effekterna av de övriga chockerna är jämförelsevis små och genererar
en minskning av produktionen mellan 0,04 till 2,5 procent (beroende på styrka och persistens).
Däremot är resultaten beroende på kalibreringen av modellen och chockprocesserna. Kapitel 5 visar
att utbudschockerna genererar inflationstryck, vilket endast stämmer överens med data på enskilda
produkter (Ebrahimy et al., 2020). Därmed verkar konsumtionschocken passa bättre för att undersöka
dynamiken av covid-19-chockerna.
Vidare utmynnar en ökning av andelen icke-ricardianska hushåll från 28 procent till 50 procent endast
i små skillnader i effekterna. Däremot är modellen känslig för förändringar i de nominella
rigiditeterna, den intertemporala substitutionselasticiteten och vanebildningsparametern. En
minskning av lönerigiditeten kan göra att de ricardianska hushållen ökar arbetsutbudet, givet att
lönenivån faller tillräckligt (inkomsteffekt).
Modelleringen av finans- och penningpolitiken minskar chockernas effekt på ekonomisk aktivitet.
Staten antas stabilisera produktionen och statsskulden genom automatiska stabilisatorer medan
centralbanken fokuserar på prisstabilitet. Givet det svåra scenariot orsakar arbetsutbuds-,
konsumtions- och produktivitetschocken en minskning av BNP på 0,3, 1,5 respektive 2 procent.
Vidare utmynnar en chock i den offentliga konsumtionen i att produktionen stiger, den privata
konsumtionen stiger (insignifikant) och högre inflation. Ökad prisrigiditet och minskad
konsumtionsvana gör att inkomsteffekten avtar och att den empiriskt etablerade positiva effekten på
privat konsumtion av en finanspolitisk chock blir tydligare. Däremot i de finländska förhållandena
försvinner denna effekt, vilket kan vara centralt för politiskt beslutsfattande. En penningpolitisk
chock är stimulerande givet att prisrigiditeten ökar och lönerigiditeten minskar. Grundkalibreringen
leder till en stark reaktion i arbetsutbudet och inflationen, vilket innebär att centralbanken är tvungen
att höja styrräntan. De automatiska stabilisatorerna stöder ekonomin genom att minska
konsumtionsskatten, öka transfereringar och höja den offentliga konsumtionen. Däremot riskerar
59

politiken tränga ut privat konsumtion. Dessutom leder både policychocken och de automatiska
stabilisatorerna till att den offentliga skulden stiger kraftigt, vilket förvärrar skuldhållbarheten.
Däremot underlättar den låga räntenivån skuldhållbarheten. I en pandemisituation som domineras av
utbudschocker kan stagflation innebära ökade räntor och ytterligare försämrad skuldhållbarhet.

välfärdseffekterna

genom

att

framställa

en

välfärdsförlustfunktion enligt Zheng et al. (2021). Resultaten visar att covid-19 orsakar en större
effekt på icke-ricardianska hushåll. I motsats till Zheng et al. (2021) kan centralbanken inte minska
välfärdsförlusterna genom att sätta skarpare fokus på att stabilisera ekonomisk aktivitet. Däremot kan
staten förbättra välfärden genom att öka effekten av de automatiska stabilisatorerna, exempelvis
genom en ökning av transfereringarna (som gör att hushållen kan återfå en del av den förlorade
konsumtionen). Policychockerna är också välfärdsförbättrande.

Appendix
This chapter presents some mathematical derivations, shows the linearized version of the model and
illustrates several figures (mostly related to the sensitivity and scenario analysis).
The following equations reveal the partial derivatives of the household maximization problem with
respect to capital, utilization of installed capacity and investment.

Next the linearized model is presented. The equations are shown only in their final form, exact
derivation can be provided upon request (most of the steps are also given in Costa (2016)). Variables
are written in log-deviations from steady state (𝑥̂) and steady state variables have the ss-notation. The
log-linearization procedure follows the approach of Uhlig (1999)29: after finding the equilibrium
conditions (e.g., the optimality conditions for households and the budget restrictions) and the steady
state conditions (by normalization 𝑃𝑠𝑠 = 1 and dropping the time indices), the model’s equations are
log-linearized around the steady state, yielding a linear approximation of the variables in the
neighborhood of the steady state. After the linearization process, the model solution can be found
using the method of undetermined coefficients (Galí, 2008), however, in this thesis, the linearized
equations are fed to Dynare (MATLAB), where the solution is defined and the impulse response
functions displayed.

Linearization of the pricing decision equation and the aggregate price equation yields the Phillips
equation for prices. Solving it forward (to eliminate the forward-looking term) shows that inflation at
time 𝑡 depends on previous inflation (due to price indexation) and the current and expected real
marginal costs. Furthermore, inflation is decreasing in the parameter for price rigidity (𝜃𝑝 ) (Bergholt,
2012).

Lastly, the steady state of the baseline model is given below. The procedure follows the example set
by Costa (2016). First, the steady state values for prices are configured, that is, goods prices, the gross
interest rate, marginal costs and wages. Steady state price is normalized to 1, whereby the other steady
state variables follow by dropping the time index.

Next several figures from the scenario and sensitivity analysis are listed. Figures 20 to 31 stem from the
baseline model, showing the impulse responses of changing the parameterization of the model. Impulse
responses for the extended model are provided in figures 32 to 34. The last figure illustrates the welfare
implications for the Ricardian and non-Ricardian households in the baseline model.
