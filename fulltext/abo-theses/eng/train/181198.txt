Title: The impact of increased stakeholder pressure on the transparency of CSR reports in
Finnish listed companies
Supervisor: Matti Skoog
Abstract
This study adds to the growing number of papers in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and
accounting research areas. This study aims to explore to which extent to the
implementation of the accounting act 1376/2016 accounting act amendment has had an
effect on the transparency of CSR reports in large Finnish listed companies affected by the
legislation’s implementation. The pressure from various stakeholders such as customers,
legislators, and investors on companies to appear as transparent as possible in their
sustainability actions and operations’ effect has all but increased over the last decade.
The theoretical background chapter covers all of the important terminology necessary to
understand the paper, such as CSR, and its different areas, the CSR reporting frameworks,
the Finnish legislation on sustainability reporting, and finally, the concept of simulacrum.
The study was conducted by doing a qualitative content analysis on data consisting of both
text and image material in Finnish-listed companies’ CSR reports, all reports being
submitted to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework for classification. Negative
passages and recurring rhetoric have been identified in the text data and the image material
has been categorized into different forms of recurring simulacrum. The categorization of
the recurring reporting rhetoric methods in the text data has been adapted from Rüdiger
Hahn and Regina Lülfs 2014 study “Legitimizing Negative Aspects in GRI-Oriented
Sustainability Reporting: A Qualitative Analysis of Corporate Disclosure Strategies”, and the
categorization of simulacrum is based upon the findings of Olivier Boiral’s 2013 paper
“Sustainability reports as simulacra? A counter-account of A and A+ GRI reports.
The results of the study show that there has been no significant increase or decrease in
the reporting of negative disclosure or simulacra to determine it as an effect of the new
legislation. The study does contribute to the growing number of papers that critically
analyze the transparency of CSR material, both in text and image material.

1 Introduction
1.1 Research problem
In a noticeably short amount of time, the discussion surrounding sustainability has
reached a new peak. Hardly a day passes without one hearing a newscast related
to sustainability in some form. Increasingly extreme weather conditions and crises
have accelerated the debate to previously unseen levels. The fact that there in this
day and age exist those who would deny any form of climate change and its effects
only add as an incentive to raise the awareness surrounding sustainability and
what we as a society can do to prevent the issues from growing even more
widespread.

Financial business and accounting are no exception, especially

considering the decision-making of the coming decade. This intensive debate has
led to companies and their stakeholders to take an increased interest in the
sustainability and most of all, how companies account for negative externalities
such as carbon emissions and other ecological footprints. In a modern firm,
sustainability is linked with the overall financial strategy of the firm. (Lan, Yang and
Tseng, 2019) Economic sustainability, such as allocating resources properly and
evenly among financial operations, has always been vital to a firm’s success and
sustainability, but now, social, and environmental pressure and their negative
effects have become as great of a concern for company stakeholders. Ballou et al.
(2018) explain that nearly two-thirds of the largest 250 global companies have had
their CSR reports independently assured to ensure their validity, which shows the
importance of the quality of the sustainability reports.

Researchers have long argued for how sustainability impacts should be quantified
and measured. Another issue arises when comparing the impacts between firms,
as sustainability accounting has not been a requirement until very recently.
Furthermore, Baker and Schaltegger (2015) argue that corporate sustainability
reporting has largely been applied because of pragmatism and ideologies
surrounding stakeholder capitalism and not for the greater good. Baker and

2

Schaltegger note that researchers need to tread carefully when analysing
corporations from a sustainable perspective and note, that they are often prone
to painting them as the devil, as they tend to embark on “more radical social
accounting projects” without them “influencing the core purpose of the
organizations and making them more sustainable” (Baker and Schaltegger, p. 278).
According to them, corporations’ sustainability perspective is all about improving
relationships with what they call, “involuntary” stakeholders, meaning that no
common “shared truth” within the organization with regard to sustainability
exists. This raise concerns over the motive of the sustainability reports, in
particular prior to them becoming obligatory, particularly whether they can be
trusted and seen as reliable using the conceptions that Baker and Schaltegger
present.

On an international level, The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) has been one of the
trailblazing organizations in sustainability reporting since their funding in 1997.
Over the last few decades, the issues regarding sustainability have exponentially
increased and sustainability-based issues have been subject to increased media
exposure, which in turn, poises increased pressure on companies to be as
transparent as possible in their reports on sustainability effects and causes.

Finnish companies had not been required to report on their corporate social
responsibility until as late as 2017, which in turn means that the first reports on
corporate social responsibility in Finland were required to be published as late as
2018 for the corresponding fiscal year. This, however, does not mean that
companies had not been publishing reports earlier, as sustainability reporting has
been seen as a form of reporting to increase relations with company stakeholders.
In late 2016, EU directives made it obligatory for entities such as listed companies,
credit institutions and insurance companies to report CSR. Certain conditions, such
as an employee rate of 500 and a greater than 40 million euros turnovers were
still conditions for this reporting obligation. In addition to a description of the

3

company’s business model and risk management, firms were asked to report on
environmental and social policies including their employees, corruption, and
human rights. This could either be done via a separate CSR report, or as has
become more common, include it in the operation reports.
This raises the question as to why sustainability has not been a more significant
reporting question, even if the issues of sustainability have been known for
decades. Why have we only during the most recent years begun to notice its
importance and impact?

1.2 Research question

The main research question of this paper is to determine whether there has been
a significant change in the transparency of CSR reports in Finnish listed companies
after the change in the bookkeeping law through the implementation of the
1376/2016 accounting act amendment. Specifically, the aim of this study is to
determine whether the impact of the accounting act amendment can be seen in
the amount of negative disclosure being reported in the CSR reports by Finnish
listed companies. This will be achieved through a qualitative content analysis
following previous research’s frameworks. As an addition to the reporting of
negative disclosure, this paper will analyse the picture material of the CSR reports
as a transparency measure to determine whether there has been a significant
decrease or increase in transparent content following the implantation of said
accounting act amendment. This research question can prompt further questions
or areas of discussion, such as whether there are incentives for companies to
manipulate the real effect their operations have on sustainability in their favour.

1.3 Research gap
The research on the impact of accountings acts on sustainable reporting in Finland,
and even in the Nordic countries, is generally limited. Only a handful of studies
conducted in the Nordic countries can be found through various economics
databases such as EBSCO, using keywords such as “accounting”, “sustainability”
and “quality” and filtering through studies conducted through 2010 to 2019.

4

Needless to say, this area requires further research and since sustainability has
become an increasingly important topic, it demands further research on a national
level, which is why the study of this paper is done with Finnish firms in mind.

1.4 Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to examine how companies report on adverse actions
and negative events surrounding their operations. In order to compare the
differences in the reporting measures of negative and/or adverse effects before
and after the implementation of the accounting act amendment in late 2016, the
sample of this study will be limited to Finnish listed companies affected by the
1376/2016 legislation.

1.5 Disposition
The paper is divided into seven parts. The first chapter is the introduction to the
research area, the research gap, purpose, and disposition. The second chapter will
review all of the important key terms necessary to understand the research area,
such as CSR, sustainability, transparency, and simulacrum. Additionally, the
frameworks for sustainability reporting standards will be introduced. The third
chapter covers previous research and particularly the studies used as a basis for
this paper’s study. The fourth chapter includes the methods used to conduct the
study. In the fifth chapter the results of the study will be analysed, the sixth
chapter will analyse the results and provide discussion based on them. The final
chapter will be focused on concluding remarks, limitations, and suggestions for
further research.

2 Theoretical background
In this chapter, the relevant theory and the central terms needed to understand
the area of study will be presented. The terms will in turn connect to the method
and the result analysis. Different forms of sustainability (economic, social, and
environmental), Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), and Integrated Reporting
(IR) among other definitions, will be discussed. This will be followed by reviewing
both international and Finnish legislation for sustainability accounting and
reporting and which options there are to account for sustainability.

2.1 Corporate Social Responsibility – CSR
According to Chung and Cho (2018) the notion of Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) has existed for well over 20 years but hasn’t until recently been developed
as a term in business research. They mention that the notion of corporate social
reporting being considered a requirement dates all the way back to the 50s, but
the concepts used and described in these studies were abstract and uncertain.
Due to the fact that society has, as previously noted, become more aware of
corporations’ effects on the environment and more demanding of increased
visibility and transparency in their financial reports, the number of studies related
to CSR has heavily increased over the last decade. Further, they mention the
importance of corporations being aware of the frameworks and most importantly,
the importance of them, as the regulation of CSR is only going to grow in
importance going forward. For a corporation to remain sustainable, it needs to
account for its responsibility issues, according to Chung and Cho (2018).
Furthermore, they mention that social and financial sustainability has become
closely tied together in recent years, due to social responsibility being linked with
economic sustainability through forward-thinking strategies. Chung and Cho argue
that this is essential for the survivability and the financial performance of the
corporation.
Yu, Kyo and Kao (2017) concluded in their study that the motives behind CSR
reporting varies depending on the size of the corporation. Their hypothesis was

6

that the corporations’ size is a depending variable in the corporation’s hunt for
competitive advantages surrounding CSR reporting. According to their results,
smaller sized corporations usually had a greater emphasis on the competitiveness
of human capital than corporations greater in size. Corporations larger in size
seemed to value compliance with governments, laws and making sure that all the
regulations were followed properly. They add that managers who want their
corporation’s characteristics to comply with the regulations, should also make
sure that they go beyond these regulations and seek further ways to increase
reporting standards. Lastly, they note that CSR strategies should be incorporated
with the vision, mission, culture, and values of the organization.
Gallou et al. (2018) mention that CSR reports also require assurance from auditing
firms, KPMG being one example. They mention that a CSR report is deemed restated when it contains an omission, error or is otherwise written as to not show
the complete overview of the company, usually to improve key ratios. They do
note that since CSR reports are a relatively new concept, and somewhat abstract,
they are expected to have errors of some form. They also mention that firms which
financial statements are based on Global Reporting Initiative standards have a
positive correlation with non-error assurances, implying that firms that construct
their CSR reports in relation to the GRI will receive positive assurance and hence,
are more valid.
CSR reporting has also been subject to criticism. Taylor, Vithayathil and Yim (2018)
asked the question whether CSR initiatives and environmental policies enhance
company value or whether they are simply “window dressing”. They argue that
CSR initiatives are more prominent in industries where companies have a direct
communication link with their consumers and where increased firm value can be
achieved through incorporating social responsibility measures in the company’s
strategy. They argue that while companies have embraced increased levels of
conscious capitalism as they call it, companies should also seek to pursue other
sustainable values rather than generic environmental ones to produce benefits.
They further argue that CSR is an important part of corporate strategy due to the

7

previously mentioned stakeholder pressure such as consumer demand and
investor attention.
2.1.1 Driving forces of sustainability
Herremans and Nazari (2016) use institutional theory and institutional logics to
analyse the behavioural characteristics and context of a business to comprehend
the businesses culture and structure and how it relates to stakeholder
relationships. They mention that behavioural change is related to the fear of
penalization, but it can also be driven by the opportunity for profit or a selfimposed obligation to do so. In relation to sustainability reporting, they argue that
it is usually a mixture of all these characteristics. However, they also note that even
though an industry or business might appear to have the same types of external
influences and pressure, an important factor in internalization remains their
stakeholder relationships and how they choose to approach them. This is of
importance to understand the management’s attitude towards their stakeholders
and what type of management control systems they use to control them,
according to Herremans and Nazari (2016).
In their study, Herremans and Nazari have researched the development of both
formal and informal forms of sustainability reporting controls and how they affect
different stakeholder relationships. The informal types of control include company
policies and procedures such as company culture, ethics, and beliefs. Herremans
and Nazari note that both informal and formal types of control are required to
achieve organization objectives. They argue that without informal controls, it
would be near impossible for organizations to encourage cooperation, which is
why they are needed just as fundamentally as formal management control
systems. They note that even the strongest forms of formal control cannot help
with changing organizational behaviour in the sense that informal controls are
able to.
Furthermore, Herremans and Nazari (2016) state that the appropriate
combination of informal and formal controls motivates and not only improves the
learning and understanding of the sustainability reporting process. They also note
that this combination should improve the understanding of the stakeholders’

8

ethical needs and demand for change from internal and external stakeholders
alike.
Ngu and Amran (2019) state that one of the main reasons behind sustainability
reporting is the increased recognition of the risks and opportunities that arise from
sustainability reporting, and how they can influence long-term performance.
Additionally, they note that sustainability reporting has an immediate connection
to sustainable development and is a critical element for advancing sustainable
development both in the private and public sectors while incorporating
sustainability into the business strategy, as has been previously mentioned.
Furthermore, they note that the communication method used for reporting on
sustainability activities is determined by the businesses’ strategic direction
towards its stakeholders.
2.1.2 Transparency
One of the leading organizations that report on transparency is Transparency
International, whose vision is to fight corruption on both the global and local level
through different governance practices. They achieve this through a variety of
different means, mainly through reporting on corruption indexes. The following is
their definition of transparency:
Transparency is about shedding light on rules, plans, processes and actions. It is
knowing why, how, what, and how much. Transparency ensures that public
officials, civil servants, managers, board members and businesspeople act visibly
and understandably, and report on their activities. And it means that the general
public can hold them to account. It is the surest way of guarding against corruption
and helps increase trust in the people and institutions on which our future depends.
(Transparency International, “What Is Transparency?”)
Because this study focuses on transparency in Finnish listed companies, it is worth
investigating Finland’s corruption index according to Transparency International.
On Transparency International’s Corruption Predictions Index, which ranks 180
countries and territories by their perceived levels of corruption within the public
sector, according to businesspeople and experts, Finland has consistently had

9

small amounts of corruption. Northern and Middle European countries, such as
Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway, have a generally low corruption
index in relation to the rest of the world. New Zealand ranks as the least corrupt
country in the 2019 Index. Finland ranks at the third least corrupt country on the
2019 index, which is the same position as in 2018 but the corruption score has
increased by one point, from 85 to 86, out of 100. The corruption score indicates
a country’s perceived level of corruption with the public sector. A score of zero
indicates extremely high amounts of corruption while a score of 100 indicated a
“very clean” corruption status.

Figure 1 Corruption Perceptions Index (Transparency International)

Figure 2 Corruption Score Index Scale (Transparency International)

Analysing these graphs and index scores, one can be safe to assume that Finland
would have a small corruption ratio and that the transparency should overall be
at a trustworthy level. To answer the research question of this paper it is also
worth investigating the definition of transparency and what characterizes it,

10

mainly in relation to sustainability reporting contents, and how higher levels of
transparency can be achieved.
According to Zsóka and Vajkai (2018), transparency can be increased “if the
company clearly introduces its goals, the present situation, and the steps of
achieving the goals.” They note that the GRI’s definition of common terminology
and clear distinction of the requirements companies need to adapt in their reports
should help to enhance clarity and transparency of the CSR reports.
Ngu and Amran (2019) argue that effective corporate governance is the key to
transparency and superior performance. They write that every manager has
different abilities and capacities to perform their responsibilities, which is
important to consider when thinking about how companies can achieve superior
performance. Increased corporate governance is one way of protecting the
interest of stakeholders. This includes aiming for increased diversity in human and
social capital and reviewing business practices, so they align with the interests of
the company stakeholders and investors. This can, according to Ngu and Amran
(2019) be achieved by holding board members accountable for their actions. This
ultimately leads to decreased information asymmetry between the stakeholders
and businesses, which in turn makes other corporate sustainability actions more
credible (Ngu and Amran, 2019). Lastly, they note that to gain public trust it is
important to build strong corporate governance and boardroom diversity based
on the stakeholders’ interests.

Yu, Gui and Luu (2017) mention that transparency can be enhanced through
reporting materiality analysis to the relevant stakeholders. They mention,
however, that few studies exist on the topic of the motive behind voluntary
disclosure of materiality related information, which can question the credibility of
the reports. According to the findings of Yu, Guo and Luu (2017), a business greater
in size, with a lower percentage of institutional investors, with better solvency
ratios and fewer insider holdings, will be more transparent with their
environmental, social and governance reporting.

11

2.1.3. Agent Theory and Accountability Lost
Research has however, also claimed that increased governance and disclosure
practices have caused organizations to be fragmented, which in turn leads to
negative effects on transparency and accountability. One researcher who claims
this is, Haraldsson (2016), who in his study investigated the effects that variations
in accounting and disclosure practices had on the Swedish municipal waste
management sector and what the cause of the variances in those practices were.
Haraldsson’s study was conducted through examining this institution’s full cost
accounting techniques and reports, as the organization have multiple stakeholders
and obligatory tasks that requires it to use full cost accounting. Haraldsson
mentions that a full cost accounting report includes the results of an accounting
system which separates the operations directly related to the direct and indirect
costs of a specific operation. Haraldsson argues that few researchers have
examined whether changes in accounting practices or municipal restructures have
influenced disclosure negatively. Haraldsson has chosen to examine these reports
as the full cost accounting report is referred to with the term “disclosure
transparency”. Haraldsson concludes that based on the descriptive results of his
study, the transparency levels of full cost accounting reports are weak, and so are
the institutional forces that regulate the reports, since the variances between the
municipal Swedish waste management sector are so large. He argues that the
greatest reason for these variances is market competition. Lastly, he mentions the
agent theory to support his claims. He argues that market competition has had a
negative influence on both accountability and disclosure transparency.

Beske, Haustein and Lorson (2020) investigated whether materiality analysis in
sustainability and integrated reports has led to increased transparency, which is
the reporting principle to achieve, according to the GRI and International
Integrated Reporting Council (IIIRC). They argue that a double standard for
companies which either voluntarily or involuntarily report on materiality for the
purpose of stakeholder theory exists. They mention that companies which provide
detailed explanations of their materiality analysis would be expected if they strive

12

for stakeholder management. The problem is that sustainability and integrated
reports aim to address the stakeholders on a broader scale while neglecting
specific stakeholder groups if the companies in question are seeking
legitimization. (Beske, Haustein, Lorson, 2020). Thus, legitimacy theory clashes
with managerial stakeholder theory regarding which of the company’s
stakeholders remain the most relevant group to focus on, which could possibly
harm the legitimacy efforts of the sustainability reports. They argue that both
theoretical theories encourage a company to engage with stakeholder groups but
through different means. Thus, they conclude that legitimacy theory better
explains sustainability reporting on materiality rather than managerial theory.
They conclude that poor assessments of materiality issues raise concerns with
company stakeholders that are interested in this information. Additionally,
concerns over the reliability of the information may arise if the accounting
processes remain unclear.

2.2 Sustainability reporting
Isaksson, Garvare and Johnson (2014) note that the term sustainability, even
sustainable development, was for a long time considered irrelevant. Researchers
had a difficult time deciding on how to define the subject and what it
encompasses. According to them, sustainable development and sustainability are
about finding flexible and diverse conceptual approaches to develop strategies
that might lead to a better society and harmony with the environment.
Sustainability accounting, according to Hiss (2013), refers to the integration of
non-financial aspects into financial accounting statements. Furthermore, Hiss
explains that sustainability reports are nowadays integrated into the annual
company reports as opposed to being separated, which was usually the case when
sustainability was a relatively new and emerging topic. The problem surrounding
sustainability reporting is that the information is non-financial, which makes it
difficult to measure, and comparison between corporations can thus prove to be
a challenge. The core issue, according to Hiss, is how to present and integrate key
performance indicators (KPIs) into the corporate’s financial annual reports, thus

13

making the variables and sustainability effects comparable on a quantitative scale.
Hiss argues that “phenomena” that were previously unaccounted for must first be
measured and categorized. This includes natural, environmental, sustainable, and
social dimensions. Hiss explains furthermore that the measurement of such
dimensions usually relies on assumptions and hypotheses, which can in turn lead
to highly different results depending on how the effects have been measured.
Bradford, Earp, Showalter, and Williams (2017) state that the traditional definition
of corporate sustainability, which included meeting the demands of a company’s
indirect and direct stakeholders, is outdated and neglects the importance of
proactive decision-making and processing. This is one of the reasons why
companies have adopted the triple bottom line way of thinking to balance
environmental, social, and economic impacts. They note however, that terms such
as “sustainable development”, “sustainability” and “corporate responsibility” are
used inter-changeably, and they further argue that managers are not fully realizing
the difference between the terms.
O’Dwyer, Owen and Unerman (2011) add some insight into why companies would
have chosen to report on sustainability before such reports became a requirement
for companies of certain size. According to them, companies are pursuing
legitimacy of their actions through assurance with third parties. They also
acknowledge that seeking assurance on sustainable reporting is a relatively new
practice and thus the validity and reliability process remains unclear in certain
cases. They mention that the key audiences who support the assurance seeking
process are managers, key stakeholders of the firm and internal technical divisions
that approve the final wordings of the reports.
2.2.1 Challenges and risks
Bradford, Earp, Showalter, and Williams (2017) raise concerns over how company
stakeholders’ perceptions of corporate sustainability might differ from the
company’s own visions on the topic. In their study, they found that the areas of
interest that stakeholders perceive as the most important, sustainability factors
being the most important, did not always align with the company’s own vision.
According to them, the GRIs dimensions for reporting on sustainability should only

14

be used as a starting point and they may not provide the complete overview when
reporting on corporate sustainability activities. They found that the area of most
importance to consumers was the ‘risk and compliance activity’, which includes
employee education on how to reduce risks. Through a content analysis they
investigated whether the companies they chose to study were reporting on the
issues that are closely related to their stakeholders, which is important since the
CSR reports are meant for the company stakeholders to read through.
2.2.2 Economic sustainability
Economic sustainability is the more traditional form of sustainability-thinking in a
company that has recently been linked with social developments, according to
Lan, Yang and Tseng (2019). Economic sustainability equals a fast inventory
turnover, a stable cash flow and a low number of receivables, among other
accounting principles. Additionally, they explain that the main goal of economic
sustainability is to achieve financial efficiency through asset management. Not
only can economic sustainability prove that the firm has the ability to pay back its
debt to credit institutions, it also shows that the companies are able to make profit
in the future. The risks related to financial management are part of every activity
and process of a company, according to Lan et al. These risks, in turn, affect the
income and the expenditures of the company and as such are important, as poor
management of these in worst cases can lead to insolvency. Economic
sustainability-thinking aims to lower these risks. Lan et al. (2019) try to convey that
economic sustainability leads to stability and minimizes risks.
According to a recent paper written by Ngu and Amran (2019), businesses have
recently switched from shares-based economy to a stakeholder-based economy.
Because of the rapid technological advancements, stakeholders are now more
connected than ever to businesses, which puts pressure on them to adapt their
strategies in response and to provide sufficient sustainability information.

15

2.2.3 Environmental sustainability
Qin et al. (2019) explain that organizations have been pressured by different
stakeholders to make greater contributions to the environmentally sustainable
development goals (SDGs) through further sustainability practices and better
environmental performance. Further, they mention that the limited previous
frameworks have failed to account for organizations’ responsibility to reach these
goals and how to link them to corporate environmental behaviours and the
externalities caused by the corporations. To categorize externalities, Qin et al.
(2019) propose a framework that accounts for the use of “public goods”. Orazlin
et al. (2018) expands on this, claiming that environmental performance indicators
show a firm on both living and non-living natural systems, such as energy and
water (inputs) and emissions, waste etc. (outputs). Additionally, they add that the
quality of sustainability information in emerging markets such as the gas and the
oil industry is not necessarily as improved upon as in other markets, which further
proves its importance.
Qin et al. explain that corporate environmental responsibility (CER) is one of the
three aspects of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Through the use of CER, the
corporation seeks to decrease pollutions and improve the values of its supply
chain. However, they also mention that there is no generally accepted definition
of the terms CSR and CER, while some researchers see CER as a negative economic
factor instead of a separate term for improving its sustainable values.

2.3 Reporting Frameworks
In this subchapter the relevant frameworks for reporting on sustainability will be
explained and reviewed on an international as well as a national level.
Yu, Guo and Luu (2017) acknowledge that government regulation of sustainability
reporting is the most important framework, however, voluntary disclosure of
environmental, social and governance areas has been more common recently.
They use the EU directive issued in 2014, the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, as
one example of a regulation that does not outright state that businesses are

16

required to disclose information, although it does encourage it. They name
Germany as an exception to this, where they introduced the German Sustainability
Code as early as 2011, which includes 20 voluntary guidelines on how to report on
sustainability performance. The guidelines follow the Global Reporting Initiatives’
guidelines.
2.3.1 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
The GRI is an independent international organization that has pioneered
sustainability reporting since 1997. According to their websites, their mission and
vision is as follows:
The GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards) are the first and most
widely adopted global standards for sustainability reporting. Since GRI's inception
in 1997, we have transformed it from a niche practice to one now adopted by a
growing majority of organizations. In fact, 93% of the world’s largest 250
corporations report on their sustainability performance. *
The practice of disclosing sustainability information inspires accountability, helps
identify and manage risks, and enables organizations to seize new opportunities.
Reporting with the GRI Standards supports companies, public and private, large
and small, protect the environment and improve society, while at the same time
thriving economically by improving governance and stakeholder relations,
enhancing reputations and building trust.

We work with the largest companies in the world as a force for positive change –
companies with revenues larger than the GDPs of entire countries and supply
chains that stretch the globe. As a result, the impact of our work on social wellbeing, through better jobs, less environmental damage, access to clean water, less
child and forced labor, and gender equality has enormous scale.

17

Figure 3 The steps outlined in the GRI's report on how to integrate SDGs into corporate reporting

The figure above shows all of the steps included in the GRI’s report on how to
integrate SDGs into corporate reporting. The figure is divided into three steps, step
one being how to define priority SDG targets. This step is important, as it is vital to
review which SDGs relate to the business in question to avoid that unnecessary
time is spent on SDGs unrelated to the firm’s business. The recommendation is
that the firm should assess risks with each SDG before choosing which to prioritize
in their corporate reporting. This can be done by critically analysing risks
associated with the operational business and the value chain and additionally, by
identifying unanticipated goals that could be achieved by applying them to the
company in question. Based on these assumptions, priority SGD targets can be
chosen with two entry points:
1) Risks to people and the environment
2) Risks to beneficial products, services, and investments
The second step of the GRI’s report includes how to set objectives, measure, and
analyse SDGs. The guidelines state that both quantitative and qualitative
measures should be used for disclosure of this information. Qualitative disclosures
provide the motivation behind the quantitative ratios (numerical, ratios and/or

18

percentages), and why the firms have chosen to given SDGs and how the decisions
impact the firm.
Arthur, Wu, Yago and Zhang (2017) write that the GRI’s guidelines are among one
of the main principles for achieving reports with transparency and credibility with
complete disclosure.

2.3.2 World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)
Even though the GRI framework provides the most commonly used guidelines for
sustainability reporting, other frameworks such as the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development exist. However, the approach of the WBCSD is quite
different from the GRI. While the GRI focuses explicitly on sustainability reporting,
the WBCSD advocated for different business models and circular economy, among
other management systems, not just sustainability from an accounting
perspective.
The WBCSD is a global organization led by over 200 leading business CEOs to
accelerate the transition to a sustainable working environment through a focus on
shareholder value, the environment and society. Global enterprises such as Canon,
Bloomberg and Ikea are only some examples of the members. Most of the
members are European based businesses followed by Asian and North American
businesses.
The WBCSD’s Vision 2050 program reviews what is expected from businesses to
reach the sustainability goals of the future. Further, their Action2020 program has
adopted this vision into a road of solutions and steps necessary to reach the goals.

19

Figure 4 The WBSCD’s six programs for achieving system transformation

Written on the image above are the six different programs that the WBSCD have
identified to help businesses approach new business solutions. While not all of
these programs are essential for every business, they do have a broader impact
when considering the circular economy concept. As the WBSCD state on their
webpages, the future of business is circular.
Among the WBSCD’s visions are also guides for their members, specifically CEOs,
to use. The goal of these guides is to help CEOs understand terms such as circular
economy and how to apply them to their own business practices. One of these
guides is the “CEO Guide to Circular Economy”. The guide was published in 2017
and contains five business models and additional technologies that companies are
encouraged to implement in order to achieve the circular economy goals. The
guide describes how the opportunities of a circular economy.
Additionally, one of their projects includes guidelines on credible assurance and
internal control and how companies can work to achieve greater transparency and
trust in their corporate reports.

20

2.3.3 Triple Bottom Line (TBL)
The triple bottom line (TBL) accounting model for sustainability can be seen as an
extension to the previously noted social, economic, and environmental areas of
sustainability. Bewley & Schneider (2013) write:
“A TBL perspective involves identifying, measuring, and evaluating financial,
environmental, and social costs and benefits.” (Bewley & Schneider p 106).
The Triple-Bottom-Line expands upon traditional economic dimension of the firm,
according to Ho & Taylor (2015). They mention that the TBL effectively shows the
firm’s economic interactions with all its stakeholders such as shareholders, the
general public, and customers. Intangible assets are also of greater importance in
TBL reporting, according to them.
The TBL has also received criticism as Bewley & Schneider (2013) mention. They
argue that in practice, anything other than a financial bottom line is difficult to
implement and the goal should be to maximize effectiveness across all of these
aspects. As has been previously mentioned, social and environmental aspects of
sustainability are often complicated and abstract definitions that are difficult to
measure. That is why, according to Bewley & Schneider, the TBL model should be
seen as philosophical rather than merely a practical one. In their study, they have
defined sustainability aspects as costs/negatives and benefits/positives.
The results of studies such as the literature overview done by Isil and Hernke
(2017) suggest that the TBL is overwhelmingly discussed in a positive light rather
than a negative one. In their study, they concluded that only eight percent of the
studies mentioned the TBL as something negative.
According to them, this proves that the TBL is largely popular but that it is also a
challenge to implement it in practice. Some researchers have mentioned that the
TBL allows managers to pick and choose what areas of sustainability they should
focus their report on. Additionally, some only choose to do the least required
methods, according to Isil and Hernke’s results.
According to Isil and Hernke’s literature overview, there exists two core
assumptions of the TBL, the win-win assumption and the firm-level sustainability

21

assumption. It should be noted that they have chosen to analyse the TBL from an
ecological perspective. The win-win assumption can be used to understand
economic growth without degrading the environment, and without taking tradeoffs into account. The firm-level sustainability assumption explains that planetary
sustainability will be achieved through each firm being sustainable.
Additionally, Isil and Hernke (2017) argue that there is a difference in
interpretations between the TBL win-win and firm-level sustainability
assumptions. This is one of the limitations of the TBL. Furthermore, Isil and Hernke
note the dangers of examining the firm-level sustainability as isolated, and not
comparing it to other companies. They use the ecological bottom line and the
chemical industry to illustrate how such thinking can damage the environment.
They describe that while two independent companies may work in the same
industry, they have completely separate operations from one another but still
produce chemicals that are harmful when they intreact with each other. Thus, one
company’s decrease in ecological waste will not necessarily lead to a more
sustainable environmental impact. Isil and Henrke thus propose increased cooperation between firms as opposed to the somewhat dangerous selfish way of
thinking that the TBL can imply for companies.

2.4 Finnish legislation
This subchapter will cover the Finnish legislation on sustainability reporting and
the contents of the 1376/2016 accounting act amendment.

2.4.1 The 1376/2016 Accounting Act amendment
Quoted below is the official statement from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and
Employment of Finland on CSR reporting:
“An Accounting Act amendment approved on 29 December 2016 requires certain
types of company to report on their corporate social responsibility (CSR). The
reporting obligation applies to large undertakings that are public-interest entities,
i.e. listed companies, credit institutions and insurance companies with an average

22

of more than 500 employees during the financial year. In addition, the company’s
turnover must be greater than EUR 40 million or its balance sheet total more than
EUR 20 million.”
“The legislation is based on an EU directive and obligates the companies to report
on their policies concerning the environment, their employees, social issues,
human rights and tackling corruption and bribery. The reporting should also
include a brief description of the company's business model and explain the risks
related to its policies and how the risks are managed.”
The first sustainability reports published that had to be written with these new
directions in mind were issued in 2018 for the 2017 fiscal year. Further, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment of Finland notes that prior to the
legislative changes, companies that operate in the forest industry, mainly those in
the operation of harvesting wood, were required to publish a statement
accounting for payments made to national governments. This statement has to be
published six months after the end of the financial year.
Furthermore, according to the official 1376/2016 legislation, the non-financial
information included in the report should at least include the following areas:
1) The environment
2) Social relationships and staff
3) Human Rights
4) Actions against corruption and bribes
Another definition can also be found in the third chapter of the legislation’s second
paragraph. In brief, the paragraph says that information relating to negotiations
or events does not need to be provided, if there is good reason to believe that the
publishing of such information could have a serious negative impact on the
commercial status of the one required to account. A perquisite is, however, that
the exemption of such information makes it more difficult to assess a fair view of

23

the company’s operations or its financial situation. (Bokföringslag 1376/2016. 3
kap 3§)

2.5 Simulacra definition
The final definition the theoretical chapter will cover is simulacra, as it is one of
the key terms that one of the studies used as a basis in this paper is based upon.
The definition will be kept brief as it is based upon social theories that are not
greatly relevant for this paper or the accounting research area.

Jean Baudrillard, a French philosopher and sociologist, describes the notions of
simulacra in his 1981 treatise “Simulacra and Simulation”. In the treatise,
Baudrillard scrutinizes the relationship between imagery, reality, symbols, and
their significance. The key notion is that images can take on several different
realities or meanings.

Baudrillard thus proposes the image to have four successive phases:
•

It is the reflection of profound reality

•

It masks and denatures a profound reality

•

It masks the absence of a profound reality

•

It has no relation to any reality whatsoever; it is its own pure simulacrum

The first phase is as Baudrillard describes, the image’s sacramental order, a good
appearance, and a direct reflection of reality. The second and third phases have
connections to the profound reality, albeit masked. In these phases, the profound
reality can be seen but it is not apparent. Images in the final phase have no
connection to the profound reality and are therefore pure simulacrum.

24

Additionally, Baudrillard defines the three orders of simulacra as the following:
•

Simulacra that are natural, naturalist, founded on the image, on imitation
and counterfeit, that are harmonious, optimistic, and that aim for the
restitution or the ideal institution of nature made in God’s image;

•

Simulacra that are productive, productivist, founded on energy, force, its
materialization by the machine and in the whole system of production – a
Promethean aim of a continuous globalization and expansion, of an
indefinite liberation of energy (desire belongs to the Utopias related to this
order of simulacra)

•

Simulacra of simulation, founded on information, the model, the
cybernetic game – total operationality, hyperreality, aim of total control

Baudrillard continues to discuss the definition between the imaginary and reality,
and that is the core of the treatise and simulacrum in general; to try and define
what belongs to reality and what does not.

25

3 Previous Research
This chapter will cover previous research within the research area and provide
some insight into which studies the methodology of this paper was based.
Transparency in CSR reports has been researched regarding both the text material
and the imagery used in the reports. Thus, this chapter includes studies that
analyse both of these contents.

Fernandez-Feijoo and Romero (2014) conducted a study on how increased
stakeholders’ pressure affects transparency of sustainability reports within
companies that use of the GRI’s framework. Their research question was to
determine whether pressure from primary company stakeholders affects the level
of transparency that companies wish to achieve within their reports. They
categorized companies on three different levels. The first level included
companies in environmentally sensitive industries. The second level included
companies that operate in industries well-known by the consumers, which they
call high consumer proximity. The third level includes companies that face high
pressure from stakeholders and finally one group of companies that is pressured
from company employees. The data they analysed were collected from all the CSR
reports registered in the GRI database from the countries that they had selected
for their study. Their results revealed that there is a positive and significant effect
that stakeholder pressure has on CSR transparency. Furthermore, additional
regression analyses revealed that a greater number of employees within the
company correlates with a higher demand for transparency.

The results of a study conducted by Borkowski, Welsh and Wentzel (2012), shows
that the size of the sustainability report, and the overall number of words in the
reports, have increased within Johnson & Johnson, which was the company within
which they studied the evolution of sustainability reports. They used a content
analysis methodology to examine whether significant differences such as the
number of pages had increased over the years, and whether stakeholder pressure

26

had increased. Additionally, content such as employee gender diversification was
examined, which is part of the social responsibility of a firm. They note that there
has been an increased emphasis on health and safety issues and not just
environmental impact. Lastly, they note that companies are able to use the
sustainability reporting to their advantage when they start to incorporate
sustainability goals into their strategies to gain competitive advantages.

The study which has been previously mentioned, conducted by Herreman and
Nazari (2016), they investigated an issue not directly related to transparency but
rather the underlying motivations for sustainability reporting and how stakeholder
pressure correlates with these motivations. They do note, however, that one of
the characteristics of a cognitive company is transparency, which is to be desired
when reporting on sustainability. The sample used in their study was limited to
companies that operate within the petroleum industry and which are subject to
similar institutional pressure while having differences in attitudes towards
stakeholders and sustainability reporting. The petroleum industry’s trade
association, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, initiated the
Stewardship Program in 1999, which not every company initially supported. Only
those companies that were already reporting on sustainability were quick to enlist
to the program. According to their findings, Herreman and Nazari suggest that
companies that utilize sustainability reporting should first develop formal control
systems as a foundation to develop informal, value-based control systems. They
note that managers should find a reporting mentality beyond just fulfilling the
industry’s reporting requirements and take the overall situation into
consideration, mainly in relation to how sustainability reporting creates value for
their own company. The most difficult part, according to them, is encouraging the
employees to adapt the learning process and to have them realize the importance
of it. Peer reviews can help to ease some of these difficulties, according to
Herreman and Nazari.

27

Demir and Min (2019) conducted a research on the reporting quality on CSR
reports in the pharmaceutical industry, with transparency as one of the key
dimensions of analysis. The pharmaceutical industry’s CSR reports are, according
to Demir and Min, still greatly limited by the company management in terms of
what is disclosed, which leads to large variations and discrepancies among them.
The variations are even greater when taking into consideration the different
reporting policies that each company use during the reporting process and
additionally, how their CSR strategy is defined. They analysed the CSR reports of
fifteen of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies in which they compared
the comprehensiveness between the reports using the measurements of
coverage, detail specificity and third-party integrity assurance of key CSR
attributes disclosed in CSR reports, provided by the CSR-Sustainability Monitor
(CSR-S Monitor or The Monitor). The main observation of their analysis was
whether pharmaceutical companies that report on materiality and externalities,
such as environmental impact (erosion etc.), are more comprehensive than those
that are not reporting on it. The transparency score that has been previously
mentioned, ranged from zero to 100. Demir and Min formed a legitimacy theory
which explained that companies in the pharmaceutical industry are inclined to
disclose as great amount of information as possible due to the scandals that the
industries have faced and as such there is increased pressure on disclosing
information. Their analysis includes multiple steps but focusing on the results of
the study is what is important in this case. One of their analyses compared
transparency scores between companies that had conducted a disclosure of three
topics compared to one topic. The results showed that the companies that had
reported on several topics had a lower transparency score compared to
companies that had done a full disclosure on one topic. Thus, they argue that this
raises the question whether full disclosure over several topics in practice lead to
higher transparency when it could be hypothesized that disclosure on several
topics is to be preferred over disclosure on just one topic. All of the companies
included in Demir and Min’s study used SASB accounting standards.

28

Additionally, Hahn and Lülfs (2014) have in their study, “Legitimizing Negative
Aspects in GRI-Oriented Sustainability Reporting: A Qualitative Analysis of
Corporate Disclosure Strategies”, mapped which rhetoric methods companies use
to report on the negative effects that their operations have. They question the
legitimacy of CSR reports, as reporting of negative aspects can endanger the
legitimacy if stakeholders perceive it wrong. According to their findings and
conclusions, there are six legitimation strategies that can be found in the content
of the reports analysed. They note that a few of these rhetoric methods for
reporting content, such as “marginalization” and “abstraction”, are mainly used
by companies to alter the stakeholders’ perception instead of truly altering
corporate processes and approaches to sustainability for the better.
Marginalization refers to the use of judgmental phrases and adjectives, such as
“no”, “small”, “insignificant” etc. Abstraction in turn, refers to the use of vague
and ambiguous statements, “some” and “various” are some of the words used in
this type of rhetoric reporting. They used their findings to develop a schema for
how corporations should report negative aspects to appear as transparent as
possible. All of these rhetorical methods in text material will be reviewed in detail
in the methodology chapters as they are used in this paper’s analysis.
Olivier Boiral has in his 2013 study “Sustainability reports as simulacra? A counteraccount of A and A+ GRI reports”, conducted a content analysis of 23 sustainability
reports from firms in the energy and mining sector. Boiral examined to which
extent to sustainability reporting can be viewed as a simulacrum, which in this case
means the extent to which companies project their own idealized view of a
situation on to the reader of the report. The overarching theme of the paper was
to question the reliability of the optimistic rhetoric of the report. Images in the
sustainability reports were categorized into recurring themes of simulacrum and
the information disclosed in the sustainability reports was compared with
significant news event that should have been addressed by the firms in question.
Boiral’s method for analysing images in the sustainability reports is used in this
paper as one of the key sources.

29

Boiral’s framework for how simulacra can be defined in images of corporate social
responsibility reports contained a total of five different definitions. These
categories are:
•

Unspoiled nature

•

Innocence and happiness

•

Caring and stewardship

•

Cooperation and external recognition

•

Ingenuity and innovation

I will now review each of these categories, as definitions of them are needed for
the methodology and analysis of the reports used in the analysis of this paper. All
definitions are courtesy of Boiral (2013).
The simulacra of unspoiled nature include images of rare animals, tropical forests,
waterfalls, rivers, and other environments. Among the represented photos in the
studies Boiral analysed were pictures of endangered species such as jaguars, but
there were also more ordinary elements of nature included that still conveyed an
image of purity, according to Boiral. Among those images were depictions of clear
water, green leaves and so forth. Boiral also mentions that these types of images
were most often included in the part of the report which focused on
environmental impacts of operations, or the environment as such.
The second simulacrum is innocence and happiness. This simulacrum depicts
images of children or adults having fun, laughing, or otherwise taking part in
recreational activities. Boiral mentions that these types of pictures are not
restricted to one single part of the report, but he does mention corporate
governance as one section where such pictures may appear more frequently.
The simulacrum of caring and stewardship depicts images that reflect the
companies’ willingness to protect the environment and caring for people in
general. These types of images depict people doing realistic, sustainable activities,
such as measuring the water quality from a facility, performing medical care
actions, and so forth. Boiral (2013) notes that most of these images seemed to be
staged as part of the graphic design process. Pictures were identified of symbolic

30

acts that had no association with the company’s own mission or relation to the
text material. In some instances, this simulacrum could be shown on the cover of
the report. This simulacrum was the most prominent across the reports analysed
in the study and was ultimately found in all of the reports that were analysed and
was found as the most frequently appearing simulacrum in about a third of the
reports.
The fourth simulacra, cooperation and external recognition, was observed in
about 13% of the reports. This simulacrum is based upon the firm’s recognition of
excellence, cooperation between workers, photos from meetings, training
seminars and so forth. This simulacrum also includes photos in which
collaborations with other companies and communities are shown. Boiral also
mentions that many of these pictures were related to awards-like sustainable
development achievements. Photos of group award presentations or certificates
were typical for this simulacrum. This type of photos can portray the company as
a model organization, according to Boiral.
The fifth and final simulacrum is ingenuity and innovation. These types of images
include depictions of certain areas such as science, innovation, and creative
solutions for sustainable-development related problems. According to Boiral,
most of these images followed a standard pattern of images of laboratories, such
as images of test tubes, technical drawings, and so forth. Images of prototypes and
presentations were prominent in the pictures categorized in this simulacrum. This
simulacrum was, however, the least frequent one across the images analysed.
These are the exact definitions by which the images analysed in this study will be
categorized as well, which is why the simulacrum have been reviewed in greater
detail here.
Boiral concluded in his final findings that the omnipresence of positive images
reinforced the omnipresence of positive statements in the reports, and that the
absence of negative images paralleled the lack of information surrounding the
negative events.

31

Finally, Boiral mentions additional measures which he hopes companies will
consider. He mentions that research focused on CSR reports mostly have focused
on the information that is disclosed in the reports and not the information that
has been potentially omitted, such as disclosure related to negative events.
Regarding the pictures analysed, Boiral mentioned that the results show that the
pictures were based on a few recurring “image-spectacles”, namely the simulacra
previously mentioned. While these simulacra could be identified, Boiral mentions
that his research did not contribute to an overall understanding of the simulacra
promulgated through the images in the CSR reports, but it did contribute to the
classification through the 1250 images analysed.

32

4 Methodology
Ryan et al (2002) explain that in order for a research methodology to be chosen,
the researcher must first have defined a clear research question and the purpose
the research. These have already been explained in the first chapter of this paper.
Additionally, in this chapter, the benefits of using content analysis as a research
method and it can be applied to sustainability reporting will be reviewed. The
validity and reliability of using content analysis as a research method will also be
presented. Lastly, the sample of the study that has been used to collect the data
from will be presented.

4.1 Content analysis
Content analysis has been applied in this paper as it is a suitable method for
comparison of reports between the sampled companies. This method has been
chosen to analyse how annual sustainability reports have changed during the
recent years and to investigate whether there are any significant changes in
reporting methods. As is evident in the study conducted by Yu, Kuo and Kao
(2017), content analysis can be used as a method to gather qualitative data, in
their case CSR information, and transform it into quantitative figures. They also
note that most researchers have used content analysis as a method to evaluate
data in CSR dimensions and to further investigate the information disclosure level
of the company, which is within the aim of this paper as well. Additionally, they
mention that content analysis allowed them to investigate the topic deeper,
bringing increased depth to the results.
Bryman and Bell (2011) define content analysis as a research method used to
gather data objectively and systematically. Rules are clearly specified in advance
for how the data should be categorized and handled. They mention that the
researcher should aim to be as objective as possible. They mean i.e., that the
researcher should avoid personal bias as greatly as possible, which is achieved
through systematic methods for examining data. Additionally, they mention that

33

content analysis has mainly been used to examine mass media items available to
the general public.
If the sample contains data stretching several years or other timeframes, the
timeframe is oftentimes decided around a phenomenon that the researcher wish
to study, according to Bryman and Bell (2011). This paper aims to examine how
transparency in CSR reports has been affected due to the increased stakeholder
pressure, in this case mandatory disclosure of CSR effects for companies that are
affected by the 1376/2016 that have been previously mentioned. Bryman and Bell
further mention that what data should be included in the content analysis is
dependent on the research question. In this study, the focus of the content
analysis will be on certain words, phrases, and images as the main areas of analysis
in the CSR reports. Analysing the frequency of certain phrases, words or images
can prove beneficial in qualitative research. Alternatively, the researcher can focus
on a categorization of a phenomenon of interest. Themes that should be
considered are ones that fit within the framework of the paper. The focus of this
paper is on transparency, which is set to be the key theme of the content analysis,
both for the text and image data. The analysis might require the researcher to
investigate further than merely on a surface level, according to Bryman and Bell,
to gain a more profound, contextual insight into the topic.
When taking CSR reporting into account, one can review previous studies on how
to define transparency and what dimensions should be considered when doing the
content analysis. Demir and Min (2019) have defined two key dimensions of
transparency that should be considered, namely scope of coverage and specificity
of detail. They have chosen these two dimensions based on previous academic
research on CSR. It should be noted that their study was conducted in the US and
thus all the methodology may not be suitable for a study done outside of the US,
but the content-analysis methodology is still appliable.
In Hahn and Lülfs (2014) study, they specify the content analysis method used to
conduct their study, stating that it was of the interpretative, qualitative sort to be
used for further quantitative research.

34

4.1.1 Content analysis flowchart
Neuendorf et al. (2017) provide a flowchart for how content analysis should be
conducted and its various steps. The flowchart is divided into nine steps.
1. Theory and rationale
2. Conceptualizations
3. Operationalizations (measures:)
4. Coding Schemes (Human coding)
5. Sampling
6. Training and pilot reliability
7. Coding
8. Final reliability
9. Tabulation and reporting
I will go over each of these steps in more in-depth detail to gain a greater
understanding of the content analysis work process, all information on this subject
is according to Neuendorf et al. (2017).
Theory and rationale refer to the content that will be examined and why. The
purpose and the research question of this paper which explains this part of the
analysis have been defined previously. The second part, conceptualization, is
defining what variables will be used in the study as well as how to conceptually
define them. The keywords and key terms that are used in the content analysis
process will be explained later in the chapter. Neuendorf mentions that these can
be defined by the researcher, or alternatively the researcher can base these upon
previously done research. The third step, operationalizations, refers to the
measures taken to match said conceptualizations, this is also called internal
validity. Neuendorf mentions that the researcher should define what unit of data
collection should be used to prove the study’s internal validity, which is primarily
achieved through the researcher’s coding scheme, which is the fourth part of the
analysis.

4.2 Data gathering and sample
In this chapter the initial and final sample, which are the fifth step in Neuendorf’s
(2017) flowchart for content analysis, will be presented. To determine the initial
sample, two databases have been cross-referenced. As the aim of this paper is to
study the transparency in Finnish listed companies, the first database used in this
study is NASDAQ. NASDAQ is the world’s leading electronic stock market and
contains thousands of company listings. This database is used to determine which
the largest listed Finnish companies are. These can be found through the shares
page of the website, which provides the share prices for all the companies listed
on Nasdaq Nordic. Filtering by the Helsinki market and the large cap segment,
these are the largest Finnish listed companies, depicted on the table below.

Now that the sample of the Finnish listed companies greatest in size have been
identified, it is safe to assume that most of these companies have a large enough
turnover that they are required to publish CSR reports according to the new EU
directives and legislations. The next step involves cross-referencing the initial
sample with the GRI’s database to confirm which of the companies report on CSR
and submit their reports to the GRI for classification. Lastly, the final sample can
be determined from these companies.
Through the Global Reporting Initiative’s database, one can filter the search of
companies in the database according to the desired region. For the purpose of
achieving the most appropriate sample, the companies have first been filtered by
their size, “large”, country, “Finland” and region, “Europe”. Below, the companies
listed in bold, green text are the ones that were found in the GRIs database with
the previously mentioned search criteria, and they should be considered while
determining the final sample of the study. The companies listed in red were not
found through these search criteria.

Figure 5 Initial sample

In order to determine the final sample of the study, it is of importance to consider
how many companies are enough to ensure the study’s validity and reliability, as
the initial sample list is quite large and would contain a great number of
sustainability reports to analyse. As was stated in the purpose chapter of this
paper, the sample of this study will be limited Finnish listed companies affected
by the 1376/2016 legislation. All of the companies listed have been affected by
this legislation. Therefore, to fulfil the purpose and the research question, the
timeline for the sustainability reports chosen for analysis will be 2015-2018. This
timeline will include reports that have been published both before and after the
new legislation was introduced, and thus this timeframe is suitable for the paper’s
purpose and research question. As has been previously stated this paper aims to
analyse the effects on transparency caused by the 1376/2016 legislation.
•

Kesko’s 2015 and UPMs 2015 and 2018 Annual / Sustainability Reports had
to be downloaded from their own websites as the PDF was unavailable
through the GRI’s database. The reports have however, been submitted
and given a GRI rating according to the GRI standards and thus they can be
used in the analysis.

4.2.1 Final sample
According to Neuendorf (2017) no generally accepted set of criteria for the final
sample selection exists, but she notes however, that it is often based upon the
work of others in the same area of research. This has also been the case in this
study to determine the final sample. In order to not make this content analysis too
time consuming, the final sample has been narrowed down to a total of four
companies, which would make the number of sustainability reports needed for
analysis 16 total, as the time span is 2015-2018. The final sample of companies is

38

listed below, and all their sustainability report, except for the three mentioned
above, are available for download through the GRIs websites. A smaller sample
allows for greater scrutiny of each case, and it will also enhance the validity when
the analysis is done manually. It is also worth noting that the companies operate
in different industries. As all reports have received a GRI application this makes
them comparable and suitable for analysis.

4.3 Validity and Reliability
Neuendorf (2017) states that methodologists have made a distinction between
external and internal validity as far as content analysis is concerned. According to
Neuendorf, when thinking of validity, it is important for the researcher to ask
whether the question “are we measuring what we want to measure?” can be
answered.
According to Neuendorf (2017), reliability is the extent to which a measuring
procedure procures the same results on repeated attempts. This can be achieved
through internal consistency, for example whether the researcher uses a scale or
an index to measure their variables. Without a measure of reliability, the content
analysis measures are deemed practically worthless, according to Neuendorf.
Neuendorf further notes that a good measurement tool is to make sure that the
coding scheme isn’t limited to just one individual. The coding scheme should
rather, yield similar results when used by multiple individuals. Interceding
reliability in theory requires multiple human coders. By using frameworks from
previous research studies, reliability will still be ensured as they have already
provided the framework and the necessary reliability tests in their studies to make
this study reliable as well by using similar methodology methods.
Hahn and Lülfs (2014) clarify in their study that their validity is based upon
discussion between the researchers, which in turn, adds reliability to their findings
and furthermore, confirms that their findings can be used in other studies.
Hahn and Lülfs have furthermore conducted their reliability tests with two
methods. Holsti’s method and Krippendorff’s alpha metrics were used to measure
reliability. Neuendorf (2017) notes that the reliability test should be conducted
using both a pilot and final reliability metric. The Holsti coefficient of reliability was
0.86 and the conservative Krippendorff’s Alpha was 0.834 in their inter-reliability
tests. Furthermore, they specify that their inter-reliability was enhanced by
repeatedly cross-checking the cases against the source data (the CSR reports), and
additionally, having discussions in the research team. Based on these statistics,
Hahn and Lülfs’ study should be considered reliable, even though a content
analysis program is not used in this study, but rather done manually.

41

5 Empirical analysis
For the purpose of this study’s content analysis, a template is first needed. In this
study, Boiral’s 2013 study, titled “Sustainability reports as simulacra? A counteraccount of A and A+ GRI reports” and its methodology has been used as a
template. Additionally, Hahn and Lülfs’ 2014 study “Legitimizing Negative Aspects
in GRI-Oriented Sustainability Reporting: A Qualitative Analysis of Corporate
Disclosure Strategies”, has been used as the second basis for the research. The
studies have different purposes as for what content is analysed. The methodology
used in Boiral’s report will be used as a basis for analysis of the picture material of
the CSR reports, while Lühn and Hahn’s study will be used as a basis for analysis of
the text data of the reports. The focus of the analysis is to determine whether
there is any reason to believe that the images in the CSR reports that have been
published have any hints of simulacra in them. The other focus of the analysis will
be to determine whether any specific rhetoric methods can be found in the text
material, particularly in text where companies have reported on negative aspects
of their operations. Hypothetically speaking, one would assume that sustainability
reporting being a requirement for the companies in question would raise their
willingness to report on negative events more extensively to raise transparency
and trustworthiness towards their stakeholders even if such disclosure is entirely
voluntary.

5.1 Key negative topics
Hahn and Lülfs (2014) have in their study, analysed, and discussed the
communicative legitimation strategies companies use to report negative aspects
in their sustainability reports, by doing a qualitative content analysis of the data.
The data they used in their study was GRI-oriented sustainability reports, similar
to the sample of this paper, which is why their paper has been chosen as a basis
for the study done in this paper.
Hahn and Lülfs specify negative aspects of sustainability reporting as the following:

42

“any corporate statement referring to factual and/or potential corporate conduct
that had or has a (potentially) negative impact on the realization of
sustainability).”
They mention that this definition is quite broad, which is why they have used the
GRIs performance indicators to further specify what the negative impacts are.
Negative aspects include e.g., toxic waste and harmful emissions from production
facilities. Negative aspects may also include aspects from the social dimension in
form of discrimination, bribery, work-related accidents and so forth. They did not,
however, cover economic aspects as they deemed that the IFRS and US GAAP rules
would make the aspects non comparable in the way that social and environmental
aspects could be analysed.
In their study, they have defined several key negative keywords when filtering with
a search for negative topics, passages, and aspects of sustainability reports, such
as “negative”, “incident”, and “adverse”. As the 1376/2016 accounting act
amendment specifically mentions that companies should report on their actions
taken towards bribery, corruption etc., one would presume that the CSR reports
would include further information on these topics than mentioned in the previous
CSR reports before the legislation was modified. The findings of Hahn and Lülfs will
be used in this study’s analysis of the results to draw conclusions of the text data
analysis. The same keywords as used in Hahn and Lülfs study will be used to define
the negative passages of the data in this study, with the exception of this study
being done manually instead of using a content analysis program as Hahn and Lülfs
did. A manual analysis is achievable with the number of reports chosen for the
sample. In addition to negative keywords, Hahn and Lülfs defined concrete,
negative topics such as “corruption” and “discrimination” to further ascertain
these passages. One of their research questions was to investigate how companies
legitimize negative incidents in their sustainability reports and how their reporting
strategies can be judged in a “true and fair view”.
The full list of keywords and concrete topics used to identify the negative passages
of text in this study’s analysis are the following:

43

Generic keywords

Concrete topics

Negative

Corruption

Incident

Spill

Adverse

Child Labor

Emission(s)

Conflict

Sustainability

Figure 7 List of negative keywords used to identify negative passages

Additional negative keywords have been used based on the industry and how
frequently they appear in the reports, albeit these were the most frequent ones
among all of the reports.

5.2 Text data analysis
In this study the text analysis methodology used by Hahn and Lülfs (2014) in their
research will be replicated, with the exception the methodology in this study being
a manual content analysis. The methodology will be explained before moving on
to the methods used in this study.

In Hahn and Lülfs study, they used a qualitative content analysis to extract the text
data. Afterwards, as has been previously mentioned, they identified the negative
aspects and keywords with the help of the GRI’s indicators. This allowed them to
identify the number of negative passages in the text material. In the next step,
they discussed on a case-by-case basis which of these passages covered negative
aspects to lastly determine the total sum of negative passages. Finally, they
discussed the recurring patters in the text to deduce which rhetoric had been used
in the reporting of negative aspects. Their formulation of the rhetoric was not
based upon any predefined concepts, as the researchers defined the final
categories of text themselves. On the topic of reliability, they mention that the
greatest challenge in the qualitative analysis of text data among coders is to make

44

the judgements of the coders intersubjective across coders. They achieved this by
comparing the “mental schemes” of the coders.

The analysis of the text material has been done in several steps in order to ensure
the highest level of reliability. The first step is to ensure that the sample is of an
appropriate size, this has already been argued in favour of above. The second step
was to identify the negative keywords and topics, those have also been defined
above. The third step involved finding the passages where mentions of the
aforementioned keywords and topics occurred. The total number of such passages
can be found in the second column in the graph below. The fourth step involves
identifying which parts of the reports are relevant to the study in question. In this
study’s case, the task was to scrutinize and evaluate the passages where negative
aspects of sustainability performance were reported. Like Hahn and Lülfs
explained, this involved independent scrutinization of the material to evaluate
whether or not the passages were relevant to the research question.

Figure 8 Number of passages identified in CSR reports

The results of the text analysis will now be review on a company-by-company
basis, and the evolution of reporting of negative events surrounding CSR will be
analysed. It should be noted that Hahn and Lülfs make no mention in their study
of what characterises a passage. In this study, a passage has been defined as a
paragraph of text, without taking the length of it into consideration. Furthermore,
Boiral (2013) mentions that passages which refer to adverse events often are
combined in statements where positive statements are also made, which make
them more difficult to identify if the researcher is not specifically investigating
them.

5.2.1 DNA
On the topic of DNA’s reports, it was evident that the legitimization of negative
aspects mostly appears in the form of legitimizing the emissions caused by their
operations. Therefore, the analysis has mostly been restricted to this subject as it
is the adverse effect that is the most widely reported overall by DNA in the reports
analysed in this study.
The bulk of DNA’s text regarding reporting of negative or adverse actions related
to sustainability efforts can be found in their GRI content index pages. The greatest
negative aspect from sustainability practices in DNA’s case seems to stem from
the increase of mobile data volumes, which is in direct conflict with the actions to
increase energy efficiency.

The following passage is repeated throughout all of the analysed DNA reports:

46

“Increased mobile data volumes challenge the energy efficiency of the radio
network, because the continuously growing volumes require more equipment,
which in turn increases energy consumption. On the other hand, 4G network
reduces the relative per-data energy consumption through improved technical
performance of LTE.” (DNA 2015: 12)
According to the findings of Hahn and Lülfs, this statement can be seen as a
rationalizing legitimization strategy. This exact same passage is used in 2016’s
report. In the 2016 report, an additional passage confirms that the emissions are
in direct conflict with energy consumption.
“DNA consumes a large amount of electricity, which means that the indirect
greenhouse gas emissions from DNA’s own energy consumption are significant. In
the spring of 2016, DNA signed up to Society’s Commitment to Sustainable
Development and continued to work towards achieving the climate objectives set
in 2015:”
This is another example of a rationalizing statement, acknowledging the adverse
effects that the electricity consumption of the company has. In 2017’s CSR report,
DNA reports that the total of DNA’s emissions have increased from 2016, which is
not a desirable direction given the company’s mission to reduce emissions, but it
is reported on with a justification as to why there has been an increase. The
passage is quoted below.
“DNA’s total emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) in 2017 were 208,000 tonnes (201,000).
The increase in 2017 was due to higher level of IT equipment purchases for
example.”
This is another rationalizing statement from DNA, as Hahn and Lülfs would
describe this language; it is an explanation of cause and effect, with factual
reasons. The increase in emissions is due to the purchases made. DNA is therefore
acknowledging the purchase and the adverse effects it had on the total emissions.
5.2.2 Kesko
Kesko’s CSR reports have in all of the reports been integrated in the company’s
annual reports. The greatest challenges for Kesko in the recent years regarding

47

sustainability have been the reduction of plastics, how to combat food waste, and
climate change. Kesko also wants to provide the customers with circular economy
solutions, making these changes even more apparent in the newer reports. An
authorization statement, as it has been defined by Hahn and Lülfs, regarding risks
relating to climate change is quoted below.
“Climate change may result in regulation-related risks, such as permit procedures
or costs arising from emission pricing and taxation.”
Hahn and Lülfs mention that an authorization strategy aims at legitimization by
referring to authority, which in this case in an impersonal reference in the form of
regulations. They further mention that the effectiveness of this type of
legitimization strategy is directly linked to the legitimacy of the authority the
statement is referring to. Investigating this statement from a critical perspective,
one can assume the mentioned authority has a high level of authority, since
government regulations are mentioned.

As is the case in most of the CSR reports analysed, rationalizing statements often
include a reasoning behind an adverse sustainability effect, particularly in regard
to mentions of an increase in energy consumption or an increase in emissions. A
passage from the 2015 report is quoted below.
“The electricity consumption of the K-food stores in Russia has nearly doubled
since the previous year due to the growing number of stores in recent years.
During 2014-2015, five new K-food stores were opened in Russia to reach a total
of nine stores. Excluding the Russian K-food stores, the electricity consumption of
Kesko’s properties in the other operating countries decreased by around 10%.”
(Kesko 2015, 233-234)

A similar statement regarding the expansion in Russia is quoted below.

48

“Kesko’s emissions from purchased energy in the other operating countries
increased by 7%, which was mostly affected by the growing number of K-food
stores in Russia.” (Kesko 2015, 244)
Additionally, a statement from the 2017 report is quoted below.
“The relative emissions had decreased by 1.9% from the base level. In 2016,
emissions increased by 3.8% compared to 2015.. The increase in emissions can be
attributed to the increased number of stores caused by the acquisition of Suomen
Lähikauppa…”
In Kesko’s 2016 CSR reports, the use of plastic bags is important in Kesko’s strategy
on how to combat the environmental impact of their operations, particularly
during the later stages of the supply chain. The production of plastic bags leads to
littering of water bodies, mainly the Baltic Sea and other greater lake bodies. One
passage in the 2016 reports is quoted below.
“At least 45% of the recycled plastic used as a raw material for the Prikka ESSI
circular bag economy consists of plastic packaging waste from households. At least
45% of used recycled plastic comes from industry. As such, circular economy bags
considerably reduce the use of virgin raw material consumption and greenhouse
gas emissions.”
While the issue of food waste in the end is dependent on the final consumer of
the food, for example, the very end of the supply chain, Kesko believes it is part of
their mission to raise awareness of it as it directly impacts their operations in a
negative way if the food purchased goes unused. A passage from the 2016 report
is quoted below.
“Minimising food waste along the entire food supply chain from agriculture all the
way to the end-consumer reduces the need for primary production and thereby
impacts on biodiversity. When food ends up in waste, all emissions from its
production, transportation, selling and preparation have been useless. Minimising
food waste also reduces related emissions. Climate change also impacts
biodiversity, especially as areas of drought expand.” (Kesko 2016, 129)

49

5.2.3 Kone
As is explained in KONe’s 2015 CSR report, “reducing the impact urban areas make
on the environment is essential for a sustainable future.”
Emissions is also for KONE’s part the adverse effect from operations that is the
most prominent one. In their 2015 CSR report, Kone acknowledges that the
operational carbon footprint is the greatest contributor to their output of
greenhouse gas emissions.
KONE refers to the adverse effects of their operations for the most part in the
“Logistics” parts of their sustainability reports. The language used is for the most
part rationalizing and quantitative in nature. Referring once more to the theories
of Hahn and Lülfs the following passage can be read as a rationalizing statement,
as they explain the cause and effect behind the increase in emissions. A passage
from the 2015 report is quoted below. In the 2016 report, this statement is slightly
altered to that fiscal year’s operations and its impacts.
“Logistics accounted for ktCO_2e, or 48% of KONE’s operational carbon footprint,
making it the biggest contributor in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. KONE’s
logistics greenhouse gas emissions data has been externally assured since 2013. In
2015 KONE’s logistics carbon footprint relative to units delivered to customers
increased by 1.0%. The main reasons for not meeting the 3% reduction target are
increased intercontinental deliveries, the ramp-up phase of the distribution center
in India, and the challenges posed by volume growth in North America.” (Kone
2015, 14)
In 2017’s report, the Logistics part of the report has been slightly modified. The
first part of the statement is essentially the same, but there is an additional
category with bullet points referring to what the greatest contributors to the
increased logistics carbon footprint are.
“The biggest contributors to the increased logistics carbon footprint in 2017 are:

50

•

Ocean freight increase due to longer distances to sites and an increased
weight per delivered elevator / escalator

•

Increased air and courier freight from the supply;one of KONE’s suppliers
had delivery issues in 2016 with the situation improving during the year

•

Increased road freight emissions in China due to longer distances to
customer sites and changes in our material supplier base.” (Kone 2017, 11)

In the 2018 report however, it is stated that the logistics related greenhouse gas
emissions decreased from 2017, the year in which they did not meet their targets.
As such, the bullet points refer to the greatest contributors in the decrease of
emissions, rather than an increase that did not happen from 2017 to 2018.
However, one passage mentions an instance where the emissions did increase.
“On the other hand, our road freight emissions in Europe and Americas increased
due to longer distances and higher number of shipments.”
Although this is a brief statement, it is acknowledging the fact that emissions did
increase and the cause of the increase, another rationalizing statement from
KONE.
Another key point of KONE’s carbon footprint is its Vehicle Fleet. In 2018’s report,
the vehicle fleet part of the report has been expanded to recognize the fact that
the 2018 development had been unsatisfactory as they called it. It also contained
action on what they are currently doing to achieve the new annual emission
reductions.
“The carbon footprint of KONE vehicle fleet increased by 2.7% in absolute terms
and by 1.4% relative to our maintenance base compared to 2017. The main reason
for the increased carbon footprint related to the vehicle fleet is the increase of
kilometers driven, which in turn results from an increased number of elevators,
escalators and automatic building doors under KONE maintenance contracts.”
(KONE 2018,18)
“In 2018, KONE Norway purchased several electric bicycles for their maintenance
operations. KONE is collaborating closely with its leasing partners to anticipate the

51

development of low emission zones, especially in European cities. Our aim is to shift
from fuel cars to electric vehicles in our fleet as soon as the leasing contract
renewal periods allow and the required infrastructure is in place. As an example,
KONE Norway ordered 40 new electric vehicles during the reporting year along
with the other European county organizations, such as France and the Netherlands
ordering both electric and hybrid vehicles. (KONE 2018, 19)
Overall, this statement comes off as a more descriptive one than the rather vague
statement written in the 2017’s report, wherein they referred to the 2030 longterm goals, but not any concrete actions.

5.2.4 UPM
In 2015’s report, UPM acknowledges that the pressure from their stakeholders in
their demand of transparency on sustainability actions is increasing.
Environmental performance is one of the greatest challenges for UPM regarding
the adverse effects of their operations. Passages from the 2015 report are quoted
below.
“Stakeholder demand in sustainability and product safety issues is growing in all
markets offering new opportunities for value creating partnerships.” (UPM 2015,
26)
“No major environmental incidents occurred at UPM production plants in 2015,
and UPM was not ordered to pay any significant fines due to non-conformances.
A total of 28 (37) temporary deviations from permit limits or major deviations from
the environmental limits set by UPM occurred at the company’s pulp and paper
mills during the year. The most notable of deviations were either small oil leaks to
nearby waters or biological sludge losses from wastewater treatment plants. UPM
immediately reported deviations from permit limits to the local authorities and
undertook corrective measures to normalize the situation and prevent similar
situations from occurring in the future.” (UPM 2015, 57)

52

In 2016’s report, the above paragraph was also used, but no total number of
deviations were given, instead, in the report it was stated that “several minor
temporary deviations from permit limits did arise.”
“No significant environmental incidents occurred in 2016. However, several minor
temporary deviations from permit limits did arise. These deviations were reported
to the relevant authorities immediately, and corrective and preventive measure
were taken.” (UPM 2015, 87)
The 2016 report is a bit more sparce on legitimization rhetoric from adverse
effects of operations. However, another rationalizing statement appears in the
2016 report, regarding UPM’s fossil carbon dioxide emissions, quoted below.
“In 2016, on-site CO2 emissions (Scope 1) decreased mainly because of change in
energy supply at UPM Hürth mill. Co2 of purchased electricity (Scope 2) increased
mainly due to higher CO2 factors in Germany and Finland.” (UPM 2016, 67)
The 2017 report that has been submitted to the GRI from UPM includes only the
GRI Content Index, which is why the report is drastically shorter in length and data
to analyse. While passages related to negative disclosure around adverse events
are nearly non-existent for this data, it does include their social responsibility
disclosure data measurement techniques. The most important ones will be
mentioned here. The most important environmental disclosure data
measurement, and the most relevant to the paper, being air emissions. In the GRI
content index, it is stated that direct fossil CO2 is calculated based on fossil usage
and done according to the European Emissions Trading System, or other national
requirements, which adds to the validity of their calculation methods.
Once again, the importance of boundaries outside of the organization, namely the
supply chains, are raised to be of importance. In particular, the energy supply from
jointly owned connected power plants and other relevant environmental
parameters (fuels, waste, air emissions), are mentioned. Additionally, the report
states that all downstream and upstream processes are covered in their disclosure
of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).

53

Energy consumption continues to be a challenge for UPM, as reduction in energy
consumption, mainly as the amount of kwH electricity/ tonne of paper produced
continued to be reported.
A passage of interest can be found in the material topics chapter, in part with the
“Economic Performance 2016” metric, is that UPM mentions the omission of some
material. A statement from the 2017 report is quoted below.
“UPM is not disclosing financial implications of any risks or opportunities or related
costs due to commercially sensitive nature of the data.” (UPM 2017, 3)
In contrast to previous years’ reports, the 2018 CSR reports has seen a rebranding
from UPM. The new tagline of the annual report is “Beyond Fossils” and it is overall
more extensive. There is a more expansive section dedicated to climate change
and more specifically, the risks and opportunities related to it. Regarding the
supply chain matters, UPM states the following.
“If any discrepancies are discovered, the supplier is required to take corrective
measures.” (UPM 2018, 61)
One of the adverse effects mentioned of UPM’s hydro plants are the effects on
the watercourses, mainly the fish colonies.
“UPM has been a hydropower producer for over one hundred years, and UPM
Energy is the second-largest electricity producer in Finland. While hydropower
represents cost-effective, renewable and CO2-free means of generating
electricity, it can also have an adverse impact on the watercourses and their
habitats. In order to minimize these impacts, we work closely with authorities and
other stakeholders.” (UPM 2018, 72)
This is yet another statement that can be analysed as both rationalizing and
authorian, as they mention their cooperation with authorities and other
stakeholder to reduce the negative impacts that these operations have.

The method for analysing images is different from how the text content is
analysed. Boiral (2013) has categorized the content of the images for the different
companies across the entire sampled years rather than categorizing the content
on a yearly basis. According to Boiral, images can be viewed as simulacrum if it
represents a disconnected view from the critical issue that is being presented in
the report.
The images included in the analysis have all been individually scrutinized and then
categorized into the five different form of simulacrum if any could be interpreted
from the image. The picture material analysis is based upon Boiral (2013) own
construction of the simulacra table.

Figure 9 Analysed sustainability reports, Boiral 2013, p. 13

In the study conducted by Boiral (2013), “1258 pictures included in sustainability
reports were categorized into recurring themes from an inductive perspective.”
(Boiral 2013, p. 1). According to Boiral, the pictures included in the reports
included a clear disconnection from the impact of the business activities. Boiral
further mentioned that neutral pictures, such as pictures of production processes,
products, company executives etc. had been excluded to simplify the analysis, as
they were not directly related to sustainability issues. The photographs included
were among others, pictures that illustrate various sustainability issues covered

55

by the GRI indicators, such as health and safety, biodiversity etc. The pictures
Boiral had chosen for analysis were i.e., used to convey a message that could
contain possible simulacrum.
5.3.1 Simulacra defined by the images analysed

Figure 10 Total simulacra identified from the analysed images

When the total number of simulacra has been defined, it is time to decipher
whether there has been any significant decrease or increase in simulacra in the
last two years’ analysed reports. The total percentage of simulacrum per year is a
good starting point for the analysis. In the study conducted by Boiral (2013), he
first accounted for all of the percentages of the simulacra found. The total
percentages of simulacrum are defined in the table above.
On the results of the image analysis, Boiral (2013) had the following to report.
“This near absence of realistic images of the negative impacts of activities stood in
sharp contrast with the proliferation of images projecting a rather idealized and
artificial vision of the firms’ sustainability. These idealized and artificial visions
resembled simulacra, that is, representations that were disconnected from reality,
but which tended to artificially inflate the companies’ image and social
legitimacy.” (Boiral 2013, p. 23)

57

5.4 Results from the image analysis
Boiral (2013) mentioned in his results that companies could use better guidance
to increase the realism of the CSR reports particularly the image content. Out of
ca. 556 total images analysed across all of the CSR reports included in this paper’s
analysis, 242, or 43.84%, were categorized into the simulacra that have been
defined according to Boiral. It needs to be mentioned, however, that some of the
images appeared multiple times in a single report. Furthermore, some of the
images included close-up images of members of the board and other executives
which were not relative to any of the negative CSR topics that were the focus of
this image analysis.

Figure 11 Analysed simulacra in DNA's CSR reports

In DNA’s CSR reports, one can analyse that the simulacrum of Innocence and
Happiness is the most frequently appearing one. The categorized pictures in this
simulacrum featured for the most part images of children or adults engaging with
their various electronic devices such as phones, tablets, and such. These images
conveyed the image of innocence due to the persons in the images often smiling
and being carefree. Smiling people were present in two of the four reports
analysed.

58

Of all the images containing simulacra that have been identified in DNA’s reports,
the simulacra of Cooperation and Recognition accounted for 30% of the total
images categorized.

In DNA’s 2018 reports, the two images above are showcasing celebratory pictures
from the Great Place to Work Institute’s awards ceremony where DNA won the
Great Place to Work certification for the second consecutive year. The first image
is part of a DNA’s Highlights in 2018 section of the CSR report while the second
picture is adjacent to text data describing their workplace values and their

59

commitment to increasing employee satisfaction in the workplace, detailing their
plans for work-life balance. The presentation of these images correlates with
Boiral’s finding of the images being used to present the company as a model
organization and the awards they have received being proof of the strength of its
commitment and external recognition (Boiral, 24).

Figure 14 Simulacra identified in Kesko's CSR reports

Interestingly, Kesko chose to include two pictures in their 2016 report that had
direct correlation with the events described, namely energy more particularly, the
assemble of solar panels at K-stores. (Kesko 2016, 66) According to Boiral’s
findings, these types of images connect to the ingenuity and innovation
simulacrum, as it shows a concrete, scientific action taken to improve
sustainability efforts. Overall, however, Kesko’s reports are relatively sparse on
images that are not graphs or other statistics.

60

Figure 15 Assemble of solar panels (Kesko 2016, p. 66)

Furthermore, analysing the results of the categorization of images in Kesko
reports, the simulacra of caring and stewardship can be found in the 2018 report.
The image shows the concrete actions of the K Fishpaths collaboration, engaged
to restoring habitats for endangered fish. The photo shows volunteers or Kretailers who took part in the event of the collaboration between K Fishpaths and
WWF Finland. According to the report, the K Fishpaths collaboration aims to
create spawning ground for migratory fish populations, and also removing barriers
which prevent the migratory fish from swimming upstream.

61

While Boiral indicates that these types of images can be presented as a disconnect
from reality, one could argue for this not being the case in Kesko’s report, as they
have extensively reviewed for the cooperation between them and WWF Finland,
detailing the objectives and progress of the collaboration. The image has thus not
just been used for bolstering purposes.

Figure 17 Simulacra identified in Kone's reports

From the table it can be read that the 2016 report has the greatest number of
simulacra as defined by Boiral.

Additionally, the statistics shows that the

simulacrum of Ingenuity and Innovation and Innocence and Happiness are the
most frequently appearing ones across the reports. The image below is taken from
the chapter titled “Striving for resource efficiency”, in which KONE’s sustainability
actions among their business activities are stated, such as aiming to use efficient
low-carbon operations. While the image below doesn’t say anything in particular
as to what the particular innovation is, it stands in context to text material
describing KONE’s wish to be the leader in low-carbon solutions for smart
buildings, which is what the operation shown below could possibly refer to.

Figure 20 Simulacra identified in UPM's CSR reports

The absence of images in UPM’s 2017 report is explained by the version submitted
and available through the GRI’s database only includes the GRI context index.
Images are completely absent from that particular data. In UPM’s CSR reports the
simulacrum of ingenuity and innovation can be found in all but one of the analysed
reports. Among the analysed reports, this simulacrum is the most prominent in
UPM’s CSR reports. One of the images is, for instance, a fairly typical image of a
scientist in a laboratory, although it does have some connection to the text in the
report, as it’s placed next to a section about Innovations and R&D, one quote being
the following.
“The aim of UPM’s R&D programmes and business development is to create new
technologies and products, provide support to and ensure the competitiveness of
its businesses.” (UPM 2015, p. 34)

64

Figure 21 Image depicting a laboratory (UPM 2015, p. 34)

Figure 22 Image depicting laboratory equipment (UPM 2016, p. 39)

These types of images, according to Boiral, enforces trust in the companies’
scientific knowledge and their devotion to seeking solutions to environmental
issues. The images above depict laboratory personnel and equipment; however,
this could be any given picture and does not actually convey any particular
instance of what is it their R&D division actually develops. It needs to be stated,
however, that some of the later text data highlights their efforts to offer
sustainable solutions to fossil-based fuels, such as biochemicals which require
laboratory work. These particular images are in this case not entirely misleading
as they do stand in context to laboratory-based work mentioned in the text. In the

65

2018 report, similar text can be found in context to circular economy and their
effort to improve resource efficiency using innovative technology. The 2018 report
does not include any similar laboratory pictures as the ones found in the 2015 and
2016 report however, despite having overall text data similar to the sections found
in the other reports.

Figure 23 A vehicle being tanked with biofuels (UPM 2018, p. 35)

The image above of a vehicle being tanked with biofuels is taken from UPM’s 2018
annual report. The image stands in relation to the part of the report focused on
UPM’s increased production of biofuels, such as low-emission renewable diesel.
According to the report, their 2UPM Bioverno Diesel” lowers greenhouse gas
emissions by up to 80%, offers cleaner combustion than fossil diesel and lowers
tailpipe emissions on the road. Additionally, from the text data of the report one
can analyse that the biofuels they develop are a genuine attempt to lower
emissions and provide more sustainable options in biofuels, even though the
previously mentioned picture itself does not tell of any concrete actions other than
showing the product in use.

66

Even though images of unspoiled nature accounts for about 12.5% of the total
images containing simulacrum found, they are present mostly in UPM and KONE’s
reports. UPM’s 2016 and 2018 reports included photos of undisturbed forests. The
photos were shown in relation to their commitment to sustainable forestry.
Among the significances of their sustainable forestry strategy, they mention that
renewable wood is the most important raw material to UPM. Analysing the images
in the context of the text, one can derive that the images are there to convey the
image of UPM as a responsible forest owner, which they also use in one of the
headlines in the 2016 report. Photos such as these paint a more positive picture
than for instance, photos that could convey the effects of deforestation in the
tropics, which they also acknowledge as a challenge that the paper industry faces.

6 Discussion
In this chapter the results of the research will be discussed critically.

6.1 Discussion of text analysis findings
The results from the text analysis were largely expected based on the findings of
Hahn and Lülfs. Early on in the analysis, it became clear that legitimization of
adverse and/or negative effects of CSR are reported in relatively brief passages
relative to how companies choose to report on actions take to combat climate
change. Hahn and Lülfs claim that biased and influenced reporting about negative
events could harm corporate legitimacy, something that companies could avoid
by reporting on adverse effects.
The greatest challenge for all of the companies analysed in this study involved is
in fact emissions and decreasing the amount of fossils fuels used in their
operation, which is why the analysis has mostly been restricted to this topic.
Electricity consumption and the consumption of plastics were also adverse effects
that were among the most frequently mentioned topics, as has been reviewed in
the result analysis of the text data. These results were all expected from the initial
sampling.
“Fourth, the rationalization strategy depicts negative aspects as being either
economically necessary or a normal fact of life”. (Hahn and Lülfs, 2014, p. 413)
Both can be used to influence readers’ perceptions. Presenting a negative effect
(e.g., increasing CO2 emissions) as either “necessary” or “normal” aims at
connecting it to already institutionalized and legitimate practices (e.g., pursuing
economic growth) to signal conformity with established practices. The intended
transfer of legitimacy to the negative incident could thus influence stakeholders’
perception of the incident’s legitimacy in society.
Very similar to the findings of Boiral (2013), it’s apparent from the results that the
companies disclose on adverse events in very short form. Fewer than ten examples
of passages that mentioned negative events or aspects as a direct effect of a

68

company’s operations were found in the reports from reading through only those
specific passages. Boiral indicates that the rate of acknowledgement in the energy
sector was particularly low. Boiral also indicates that the adverse effects were
usually reported in passages that were mostly focused on longer, positive
passages, which made these types of disclosure data difficult to find. This also
leads to the passages being easier to overlook if one is not actively investigating
them, according to Boiral. This was all also the case with this study, and it became
clear early on in the analysis. None of the reports were struck as having been
written in order to cause confusion or evasion with the reader, but the adverse
effects were reported on in extremely brief form in comparison to how frequently
the different CSR topics were mentioned in the reports.
Furthermore, Boiral mentions that an over-emphasis on positive disclosure is
possible, such as acknowledging accolades and overemphasising a company’s
positive achievements in relation to CSR, which borders on what he calls corporate
narcissism. He does indicate that such “self-promotional tendencies” may seem
legitimate, but that they can be harmful for transparency and strengthen the
simulacra of the text or images.

6.2 Discussion of image analysis findings
When discussing the results of the image analysis, it is important to remember
what the companies try to achieve with these images. As Boiral (2013) mentions
in the discussion of his study, he advocates for better guidance on the use of
images in the sustainability reports to increase the realism of them. While it may
seem like a reasonable idea to enhance the attractiveness of the reports with
pictures of undisrupted nature, children etc., Boiral mentions that realistic images
that present the company’s real impacts on the environment should also be
present for balancing purposes. Boiral claims that this would ensure that the
reports reflect the reality of the companies’ impacts rather than the images being
present for public relations purposes only.

69

In this case, it should be noted that the data used in Boiral’s 2013 study included
reports from only one single year, 2007. This is mentioned as a limitation in the
study itself. This paper has in turn, focused on four years, and thus several other
approaches can be taken into the discussion. Among the approaches to the
discussion Boiral mentions are the company’s history, strategy, and events.

From the table of simulacra derived from the images analysed, one can analyse
some statistics from the four-year period of reports analysed. The most apparent
one being that the simulacrum of Innocence and Happiness accounted for 40.7%
of all the images that were categorized. Almost half of these images, namely
47.8%, could be found in the 2018 reports. Kesko and DNA account for the greatest
increase in simulacrum in this category compared to their previous reports. The
increase in images is partly due to the reports analysed being longer than the 2016
and 2017 ones. DNA’s 2018 annual report is over 70 pages longer than the data
analysed from 2017 and 2016. Additionally, in DNA’s case, there has been an
increase in the simulacrum of cooperation and recognition, due to the images
from award shows that have been previously mentioned in the results section of
the paper. This is, however, not necessarily a cause for concern, since DNA’s
reports are overall transparent in other sustainability areas.

Another observation from the statistics is that the simulacrum of Caring and
Stewardship was only present in Kesko’s and UPM’s reports, while no such
simulacrum could be identified in DNA’s and Kone’s reports. Different to the
findings of Boiral, however, I would argue that the inclusion of images categorized
into this section not necessarily should be interpreted as “falsifications”, as they
do show genuine actions that the companies take in regard to sustainability, such
as the fish path project or the installation of solar panels mentioned in the earlier
Kesko section. While the images themselves could certainly be interpreted as
staged to a certain degree, I do not believe that this discredits the actions shown
in the images.

70

6.2.1 Critical analysis of Boiral’s findings and whether they can be applied to this
study
The key observation to mention while discussing the simulacrum of the images is
that this paper has only taken images taken with a camera into consideration for
the image analysis. This means that other graphical illustrations such as tables,
flowcharts, and such which are often detailing environmental impact of
companies’ actions in measurable statistics, have not been considered as data for
the analysis, as they were not included as data in the study that this paper used as
a foundation. Thus, analysing other graphical illustrations included in the reports
could thus possibly lead to other conclusions, as they are evidently more certain
to show the realistic effects of companies’ actions, rather than the images that are
displaying real life objects and environments.

Furthermore, I personally do not think that all of Boiral’s conclusions can be
applied to this paper’s results. One of the reasons behind my reasoning on this is
that the data which were used in Boiral’s study included sustainability reports
from 2007, which are reports from over a decade ago. This makes the results of
Boiral’s study not directly comparable with this study. Additionally, the CSR
reports analysed in Boiral’s study included reports from different parts of the
world, including the UK, Brazil, Spain, South Africa, and Indonesia to name a few.
The focus of this paper is therefore more direct since it focuses only on one
country, Finland, and thus the results of Boiral’s study may not be directly
comparable with the results of this study. Fernandez-Feijoo, Romero and Ruiz
(2014), mention in their study that Finland can be seen as environmentally
conscious while Brazil is a growing economy and has a different outlook on CSR.
According to them, it is important to consider the importance of the CSR reporting
in the countries according to the GRI’s standards. This is an important part to
consider when analysing the effects that a reformed legislation has had on
transparency, as the purpose of this paper was to analyse whether there had been
a difference in transparency after the implementation of the new legislation.

71

6.3 Implications on transparency of CSR reports
To connect the results back to the research question and the theory surrounding
transparency, it needs to be said that Finland has a relatively low corruption index
and overall high transparency in the reporting practices, as was previously
examined in the transparency section of this paper. Based on the results of the
text analysis, a significant decrease or increase in transparency cannot be
established, which is in line with Boiral’s and Hahn and Lülfs’ findings. However,
the change in simulacrum can be defined and that has been established in the
image analysis results.
One thing of importance is to remember that the particularly the examples from
the text and image data shown in this study were selected across hundreds of
pages filled with CSR text data. The negative passages and the images chosen for
analysis that contained a certain simulacrum of course do not discredit all of the
other text material or images in the reports. Investigating all of the analysed CSR
reports and the companies’ progress over the years, it is clear that sustainability
and CSR have become increasingly important topic, which is noted by their
sustainability efforts on how to tackle climate change, and the amount of material
disclosed has in most cases increased annually.
Finally, referring back to the statement of the accounting act amendment that is
at the core of this paper.
“The legislation is based on an EU directive and obligates the companies to report
on their policies concerning the environment, their employees, social issues, human
rights and tackling corruption and bribery. The reporting should also include a brief
description of the company's business model and explain the risks related to its
policies and how the risks are managed.”
Based on the results of the text and image analysis, I do not think that the
implementation of the accounting act amendment has had a direct effect on
companies’ willingness to disclose more negative disclosure. The question cannot

72

at the very least be answered based on the results of this study. That being said,
disclosure regarding sustainability and CSR overall has as previously been
mentioned, increased during the most recent years. Based on the results of this
study, a direct correlation between the implementation of the accounting act
amendment and increase or decrease in transparency cannot be clarified.
Furthermore, it is worth investigating the paragraphs of the legislation that adhere
to the information that should be disclosed and the exceptions to the disclosing of
information. As clarified in the theory chapter of this paper, the third paragraph
of the third chapter of the 1376/2016 accounting act amendment states that some
information can be omitted if there is strong reason to believe that the publishing
of information that adheres to negotiations, issues etc. of non-financial
information would damage the company’s commercial status significantly.
Analysing this passage of the legislation, it does make sense as to why companies
would rather not disclose every negative effect that their operation may have and
judging by this paragraph, it is entirely within their rights to do so if it would harm
their commercial status. This may be one of the reasons why negative or adverse
events are not reported on as actively as on other methods to combat climate
change.

6.4 Validity & Reliability
Reliability at its core is the idea of how secure the data used in the study is. All of
the data gathered for this study has been submitted to the GRI for classification,
which means that the database has a high reliability in terms of accounting data.
The choice to conduct this study manually, however, decreases the overall
reliability of the results. Due to the study being conducted manually, the possibility
of human error in the composition of results is increased. It cannot be guaranteed
that some examples have been missed in terms of the negatives passages
previously mentioned in the data section of the paper, that might have been
discovered using a content analysis program. The risk of error is therefore larger
when doing a qualitative content analysis manually.

73

That being said, the reliability of replication in the methodology process test done
by Hahn and Lülfs ensures that the methodology in this study is still reliable
despite the internal validity of it not being as strong considering this paper was
done by one person.

74

7 Concluding remarks, limitations, and future research
This chapter will review the conclusion of the thesis and mention possible future
research topics for how this study can be expanded upon.
This paper contributes to the growing number of papers focused on CSR,
sustainability, and transparency in CSR reports, providing a deeper understanding
of how transparent CSR reports are. The aim of this paper was to shed light on
whether corporate sustainability reporting had become more transparent from
the increased stakeholder pressure, in particular the reform of the 1376/2016
accounting act amendment. The CSR reports were analysed, and legitimation
strategies and simulacrum were identified in the reports.

7.1 Limitations
The limitations of this study have directly affected the results and the conclusions
that can be drawn from the results. The most apparent limitations are that the
companies included in the sample were limited to Finnish listed companies, which
makes the ability to compare the results with studies conducted with data from
other countries difficult. Even though the GRI gives generalized guidelines, the
levels of general transparency and corruption within the countries may differ, and
the levels of which the companies will choose to include negative disclosure and
present their image material in the reports may wary, both between sectors but
most apparently countries.
Another limitation which had an effect on the outcome of this study is that the
sample of this study was limited to four total companies in relatively similar
sectors, which comparatively to other studies done in the same research area
where a content analysis program has been used, is a relatively low sample. In this
study, the text material was analysed manually without a content analysis
program, which makes the risk for human errors larger than if a content analysis
program had been used. Furthermore, the results in this study may lack
significance due to the relatively small sample. Additionally, since the aim of this

75

paper was to measure an increase / decrease in transparency, that in and of itself
is a limitation, since some researchers have argued for transparency not really
being measurable with quantitative variables.

7.2 Suggestions for further research
Further studies may wish to include a greater sample or compare the effects in
different countries to achieve more significant results. Research focusing on CSR
in the Nordic countries and the effects of transparency continues to be sparce and
there is definitely cause for improvement in that research area. Furthermore, it
could also be interesting to make comparisons across different sectors to
investigate whether the results would differ based on the negative effects that
surround their operations and whether the legitimization strategies used in these
reports have any correlation with each other.
As this study has only referred to “increased stakeholder pressure” as legislations,
further studies could include other stakeholder pressures such as investors,
customers, and such to see whether the increased pressure from them has had an
effect on transparency.
Similar to what Hahn and Lülfs account for as future avenues for research, future
studies could make use of external opinions to validate the findings, since the
perception of the text and image material analysed in this report is dependent on
the researcher themselves. It would also be interesting to do a similar study such
as this and connect with the companies themselves as to investigate their
motivations for sustainability reporting and the amount of information
surrounding negative events or effects they tend to report.

8 Hur ökad press från intressenter har påverkat CSR
rapporters transparens i finländskt börsnoterade bolag
8.1 Forskningsområde
På en märkbart kort tid har diskussion kring hållbarhet nått nya höjder. Det går
knappt en dag utan en nyhetssändning relaterad till hållbarhetsfrågor i någon
form. Allt vanligare extrema väderförhållanden har fört debatten till nya höjder.
Faktumet att det än idag finns de som förnekar ens någon form av
klimatförändring och dess effekter enbart ökar incitamentet för att fortsätta
sprida medvetenheten kring hållbarhetsfrågor och vad vi som ett samhälle kan
göra för att förhindra att problemen ökar. Företag som arbetar inom redovisning
är givetvis inget undantag till detta, speciellt beträffande beslutsfattandet under
det inkommande decenniet. Denna intensiva debatt har lett till att bolag och deras
intressenter har ökat intresse för hållbarhet. Intressenter har fått ett speciellt
intresse för hur bolag rapporterar om negativa externaliteter som deras
verksamhet leder till, exempelvis genom utsläpp av växthusgaser. I ett samtida
företag är hållbarhet länkat till företagets finansiella strategi. (Lan, Yang och Tseng,
2019). Ekonomisk hållbarhet, vilket inkluderar att allokera resurser på rätt sätt
genom verksamheten, har alltid varit en viktig fråga för ett företags fortsatta
framgång och hållbarhet. Nu har dock samhällelig hållbarhet och hållbarhetsfrågor
som kretsar kring miljön fått en allt större betydelse för intressenter, inte minst
beroende på hur företag rapporterar om dessa. Ballou et al. (2018) förklarar att
revision har utförts på företags CSR-rapporter för nästan två tredjedelar av de
globalt 250 största företagen. Detta visar på hur viktigt kvaliteten på CSRrapporter är.

The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) har på en internationell nivå varit en
banbrytande organisation vad hållbarhetsrapportering beträffar sedan de
grundades år 1997. Över de senaste decennierna har problem kring hållbarhet och
miljöfrågor ökat exponentiellt och fått mera utrymme inom medier, vilket i sin tur
lägger tryck på företag att vara så transparenta som möjligt med vilka effekter

77

deras verksamhet har på miljön, samt rapportera om vilka övriga negativa effekter
som förekommer.
Finländska bolag var inte tvungna att rapportera om samhällsansvar ända fram till
år 2017, vilket i sin tur betyder att de första obligatoriska rapporterna utgavs år
2018. Detta betyder givetvis inte att det inte har förekommit hållbarhetsrapporter
för tidigare räkenskapsår. Enligt ett EU direktiv som utgavs sent år 2016 blev det
ett krav på börslistade bolag, kreditinstitut och försäkringsbolag att publicera
rapporter över samhällsansvar. Företag vars antal anställda överskrider 500 och
vars omsättning överstiger 40 miljoner euro är inom ramen för den nya lagen.
Bolag ombads nu att som ett tillägg till deras affärsmodell och riskhantering även
rapportera om samhällsansvar och deras policy gentemot deras anställda,
korruption och mänskliga rättigheter. Detta kunde utföras genom en separat CSR
rapport, eller en integrerad rapport som en del av bolagets övriga årsberättelse.

8.2 Forskningsfråga
Avhandlingens forskningsfråga baserar sig på att undersöka om det har uppstått
en signifikant förändring inom transparensen i CSR-rapporter vid börsnoterade
finska bolag efter att bokföringslagen 1376/2016 trädde i kraft. Målet med studien
är att klargöra om förändringen i bokföringslagen har haft en effekt på andelen
negativa externaliteter som redogörs för i CSR-rapporterna. Detta analyseras som
tidigare nämnts genom en kvalitativ innehållsanalys. Ytterligare granskas CSRrapporternas bildmaterial för att klargöra om det finns en signifikant skillnad i
antalet skenbilder före och efter det att förändringen i bokföringens trädde i kraft.

8.3 Syfte
Syftet med studien är att undersöka hur företag rapporterar om negativa
externaliteter som verksamheten leder till. För att kunna undersöka skillnaderna i
rapporteringsmetoder före och efter förändringen av bokföringslagen så kommer
samplet bestå av finländskt börslistade bolag vars rapportering påverkas av den
förändringen i bokföringslagen.

78

8.4 Metod
I denna avhandling har innehållsanalys tillämpats som forskningsmetod eftersom
den passar för att besvara forskningsfrågan, dvs. huruvida transparensen i CSRrapporter har förändrats efter den nya lagstiftningen. Detta utförs genom en
jämförelse av företags CSR-rapporter före och efter införandet av den nya lagen.
För att kunna utföra denna jämförelse behövs en analys av text och bildmaterial,
varpå innehållsanalys är den mest logiska, och användbara, forskningsmetoden.
Yu, Kuo och Kao (2017) antyder i deras studie på att innehållsanalys är en god
metod för att samla in kvalitativa data för att sedan rapportera det kvantitativt.
De nämner ytterligare att innehållsanalys har använts som en forskningsmetod för
att undersöka CSR-data, vilket är applicerbart även på denna studie.

Samplet i denna studie utgörs av fyra finska börsnoterade bolags CSR-rapporter
från 2015 till 2018. Bolagen är DNA, Kesko, UPM och KONE. Denna tidsram lämpar
sig för studiens syfte, eftersom det möjliggör att jag kan kontrollera effekterna
före och efter förändringen i lagstiftningen, vilket är syftet med studien. Det
slutgiltiga samplet är begränsat till fyra bolags rapporter eftersom det säkerställer
att analysen inte är allt för tidskrävande och det möjliggör även analys av
rapporterna så noggrant som möjligt, eftersom analysen utförs manuellt och inte
med hjälp av ett program specifikt gjort för innehållsanalytiska syften.

8.5 Empirisk analys
I studien har som tidigare nämnts både text och bildmaterial använts som data i
innehållsanalysen. Beträffande analysen av textdatat har ramverket använt av
Hahn och Lülfs (2014) i deras studie replikerats, med undantaget att denna studie
har utförts manuellt och inte med hjälp av ett innehållsanalytiskt program. Målet
med textanalysen var att identifiera passager i textmaterialet som hade
anknytning till negativa externaliteter förorsakade av bolagens verksamhet. För
att identifiera dessa passager har i studien likt Hahn and Lülfs (2014), uppgjorts en
lista över negativa aspekter och nyckelord som man förknippas med CSR och

79

hållbarhet. Efter att det totala antalet textpassager hade identifierats var nästa
steg att individuellt granska dessa passager och retoriken i språket för att klargöra
på vilka ställen i rapporterna som negativa aspekter av verksamheten nämns. För
analysen av bildmaterialet i CSR-rapporterna har varje bild analyserats individuellt
och sedan i mån av möjlighet kategoriserats in i skenbilder med hjälp av
definitionerna av Olivier Boiral (2013).

Resultatet av textanalysen visar på att rapporterna av negativa externaliteter
rapporteras

i

korta

textpassager

och

några

av

de

retoriska

rapporteringsteknikerna som Hahn och Lülfs identifierade förekom även i dessa
rapporter. Mindre än tio passager per CSR-rapport kunde identifieras till den grad
att negativa externaliteter av verksamheten nämndes. Den vanligaste negativa
externaliteten i alla CSR-rapporter var minskningen av koldioxidutsläpp. De flesta
av de textpassager som hade negative klang och som kunde identifieras, var dock
rationella i retoriken, dvs. orsak och påverkan av händelserna, exempelvis en
ökning av koldioxidutsläpp, rapporterades i de flesta fallen. Detta resultat var
väntat med tanke på samplet och det överensstämmer med resultat som Boiral
(2013) samt Hahn och Lülfs kom fram till i sina studier.

Beträffande kategoriseringen av bildmaterialet i skenbilder så förekom det inte en
väsentlig ökning eller minskning av dem före eller efter förnyelsen av
bokföringslagen. Utifrån totalt 556 analyserade bilder kunde 242, dvs. 43,84 %,
kategoriseras i skenbilder definierade av Boiral (2013). Den vanligaste
skenbildskategorin var naivitet och lycka (eng. Innocence and Happiness), vilken
bestod av 40,7 % av alla kategoriserade skenbilder.

8.6 Sammanfattning av resultat
Baserat på resultatet av studien kan det inte klargöras om transparensen har
signifikant ökat eller minskat som en följd av reformen av bokföringslagen. Det bör
poängteras att Finland har ett relativt lågt korruptionsindex och därmed borde
transparensen i de finansiella och icke-finansiella rapporterna överlag vara god.

80

Det kan inte heller genom resultatet av denna studie fastställas att bolagens vilja
att rapportera om negativa externaliteter har ökat eller minskat som en följd av
förnyelsen i bokföringslagen. Men däremot har hållbarhet och CSR fått en allt
större betydelse i bolagen vilket syns genom textdata och ökade mängden data i
rapporterna. Det finns inte heller skäl att misstänka att de exempel som har lyfts
fram i studien skulle skada transparensen allvarligt. Detta är fallet eftersom de
enskilda exempel som har nämnts naturligtvis inte understryker vikten av all övrig
rapporterad information så som vilka handlingar bolagen utför för att bekämpa
klimatförändringen och i allmänhet öka hållbarheten i sin verksamhet. Dessutom
är det värt att komma ihåg att bolagens vilja att rapportera om negativa
externaliteter, enligt ändringen i lagen, är valfri om det finns sannolika skäl att
misstänka att rapporteringen av sådan information skulle skada bolagets
kommersiella status avsevärt. Detta är möjligt enligt bestämmelserna i 3 a kap. 3
§ i lag om ändring av bokföringslag 1376/2016. En förutsättning för detta undantag
är dock att uteblivet offentliggörande av sådan information inte utgör ett hinder
för att den bokföringsskyldige uppvisar en rättvisande bild av verksamheten och
resultatet. Detta kan vara ett skäl till att förändringen i andelen information om
negativa externaliteter inte är signifikant.

8.7 Begränsningar och förslag på vidare forskning
Syftet med denna studie var att öka förståelsen av hur bolagen rapporterar om
CSR, hållbarhet och transparens i CSR-rapporter. Målet med studien var att
undersöka om förändringen i bokföringslagen 1376/2016 hade haft en effekt på
transparensen i CSR-rapporter genom att analysera text och bildmaterial i
rapporterna utgivna år 2015–2018. Strategier i retoriken och skenbilder
identifierades och kategoriserades. En begränsning med studien är att den har
utförts av en person och utan ett innehållsanalytiskt program, vilket ökar
felmarginalen för möjliga mänskliga fel. Det kunde vara intressant att i fortsatta
studier mäta effekterna över länder, exempelvis de övriga nordiska länderna och
att utöka samplet. Detta skulle dock förutsätta ett innehållsanalysprogram.
