Abstract
Dissolution of different EPS qualities and the re-use of these qualities in a suspension polymerization
process and their effect on the characteristics of EPS material characteristics were studied in laboratory scale. The studied EPS qualities were off-spec EPS qualities obtained from BEWiSynbra Raw’s
conventional suspension polymerization process, namely undersized and oversized off-spec EPS,
and extruded recycled EPS (fish-box material). Up to 30 weight percentages of EPS were successfully dissolved into MS, and batches containing up to 20 weight percentages of reused EPS were
successfully suspension polymerized in a batch reactor with the different EPS qualities.
Solubility of the different EPS qualities into MS as a function of time at different temperatures
namely room temperature (c. 25°C), 50°C, and 70°C, at different EPS mass concentrations, namely
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30, were experimented in laboratory scale. The solubility and the dissolution
times for total dissolution were determined visually and results compared. The obtained results gave
the following ranking orders for the different EPS qualities regarding the dissolution times that increase to the right: undersized off-spec EPS < extruded recycled EPS < oversized off-spec EPS.
The suspension polymerization was performed mainly by predissolving EPS into virgin MS, but
dissolving EPS into MS directly in the batch reactor’s suspension prior to the polymerization was
experimented with batches containing 5 weight percentages of off-spec EPS, as well. The quality
and properties of the beads obtained from different batches were studied by the means of sieving
(PSD), residual monomer and molecular weight experimentation. In addition, some of the batches
were pre-foamed and subsequently molded into slabs in order to test the foaming power, mechanical
(compressive and bending strength) and thermal properties (lambda). Based on the obtained results
the following ranking in the bead quality between the different EPS qualities in general was obtained:
off-spec EPS > extruded recycled EPS.

Abstrakt
I denna avhandling undersöktes möjligheterna att återvinna polystyren i en konventionell suspensionspolymerisationsprocess för framställning av expanderad polystyren (EPS). I första skedet kartlagdes det återvunna polystyrenets löslighet i styren vid tre olika temperaturer som funktion av upplösningstid.
De undersökta EPS-kvaliteterna bestod av två olika ”off-spec”-EPS-kvaliteter från BEWiSynbra
Raws konventionella suspensionspolymerisationsprocess, nämligen under- och överdimensionerad
”off-spec”-EPS, och ytterligare av en extruderad återvunnen EPS-kvalitet (material som använts som
fisklådor). Resultaten visar att upp till 30 viktprocent av cellplasten kunde upplösas i styren. Lösligheten minskade enligt följande: underdimensionerad ”off spec” EPS> extruderad EPS> överdimensionerad ”off-spec”-EPS.
I det andra skedet tillfördes det återvunna och upplösta expanderade polystyrenet i en satsreaktor för
framställning av pentan impregnerade polystyrenpärlor. Resultaten visar att PS-pärlor innehållande
upp till 20 viktprocent av de olika återvunna EPS-kvaliteterna kunde tillverkas framgångsrikt. Vid
högre halter av återvunnen EPS uppstod problem med agglomeration av pärlorna pga. instabiliteten
hos den bildade suspensionen.
Suspensionspolymerisationen utfördes huvudsakligen genom att först lösa den återvunna EPS:n i
styren, och utöver detta utfördes experiment att tillföra 5 vikt procent av återvunnen EPS direkt i
satsreaktorn utan att först upplösa cellplasten i styren. Kvaliteten och partikelstorleksfördelningen
för de erhållna pärlorna undersöktes sedan med hjälp av sikt (fördelning av partikelstorlek, PSD),
och restmonomerhalten bestämdes med gaskromatografi samt molekylvikten och dess fördelning
analyserades genom att passera polymerlösningen genom en gelkolonn (SEC). Därtill konverterades
de framställda PS-pärlorna till skivor för att bestämma materialegenskaper såsom skumningsstyrkan,
och mekaniska (kompressions- och brytningsstyrka) samt termiska (värmeledningsförmåga, lambda)
egenskaper. Sammanfattningsvis kan man säga att båda de återvunna ”off-spec” EPS-kvaliteterna
gick lättare att återvinna än extruderad återvunnen EPS.

Literature Analysis
The theoretical parts of the thesis are extremely general in nature, giving general education particularly on EPS, its recycling and suspension polymerization. In addition, the basics of recycling strategies for plastics, polymers and styrenic polymers in general are briefly discussed. The thesis may
work as an educating tool for inexperienced readers, but the more advanced readers should stick to
the experimental parts discussing the research, the results and goals of the project. The sections of
the thesis that are the most interesting that may have the most practical importance are Abstract, and
chapters 2 Purpose, Goals and Guidelines, 7 Solubility Experimentation, 8 Suspension Polymerization Experimentation, and 9 Conclusions. Still, chapters 3.5 and 6.4.4 may be interesting, as well. In
general, the biggest issue with the literature that was used in the thesis is the fact that most of the
sources are relatively old and not the most recent.
The only relevant literature regarding the research is the patents that describe incorporation of graphite into EPS particles with the help of dissolved EPS and/or PS into MS [11,12]. The patents were
found by chance as they were mentioned in Update on Mouldable Particle Foam Technology [4] in
which new modifications on EPS were discussed. These patents were relatively old and, in the future,
a search for more recent graphite EPS patents could be a good direction for literature sources. Some
attempt at the literature search touching the subject of the Master Thesis, EPS/PS recycling in suspension polymerization, was done, and headwords that were used included, for example:
•

‘dissolution of polystyrene’ and ‘dissolution of EPS’,

•

‘solubility of PS into styrene’ and ‘solubility of EPS into styrene’,

•

‘recycling of EPS’ and ‘recycling of PS’,

•

‘recycling of PS/EPS in suspension polymerization process’, and

•

‘EPS suspension polymerization’, to name a few.

The search engines that were used were used included Google Scholar, Google Patent, Alma (ÅA &
Aalto), Scopus, Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), ScienceDirect, SpringerLink and Wiley. However, the effort in the literature search was not maximal, and the time that was scheduled for the
literature search was relatively restricted. It is certainly possible that the author did not use the right
headwords and did not browse thoroughly enough the search results. In addition, the spectrum of PS
and EPS patents was enormous, and more beneficial patent material most certainly exists. Literature
regarding dissolution of PS in other solvents than styrene and PS solvent recycling with solvents
such as limonene was significantly easier to find than the use of styrene.

1 Introduction
The use of plastic materials and products is constantly increasing [1]. At the same time, the environmental concerns have increased, and the regulations have tightened [2]. The pressure to decrease the
amount of solid waste ending up in landfills and the environment, the amount of emissions and pollutants, and the consumption of natural resources is at its all-time highest, and recycling is a preferable option for the “conventional” waste disposal [3]. All this is also true for expanded polystyrene
(EPS), also known as Airpop®- engineered air in Europe, with a wide variety of applications especially in the construction, the packaging, and the automotive industry [4,5].
The impression that EPS can not be recycled is persistent [2]. While it is true that recycling EPS
involve many technological challenges, the EPS is still among one of the most recycled plastics in
the world [15,24]. The high cost of landfilling EPS waste (highly voluminous), high transportation
cost associated with low bulk density of EPS materials, and the public opinion have been major
driving forces for development of EPS recycling strategies [6]. Recycling is a crucial component in
waste and pollution reduction hierarchy of EPS, which includes at least four different types of waste
management strategies:
1. reduction; e.g., reduction of EPS content with optimized packaging designs,
2. re-usage; e.g., repeated use of thermo boxes for food,
3. recycling; e.g., re-use of material or its components in new products and applications, and
4. recovery; e.g., production of thermal heat and power by incineration or chemical recycling
of raw materials [7].
The recycling rates around the globe have increased drastically during the last decades [8]. Still, even
though the amount of the EPS waste ending up in the landfills has decreased, a significant share of
the EPS “recycling” is still thermal recovery of the energy, in other words incineration. Energy recycling, in which wastes are incinerated, and mechanical recycling, in which scrap polymers are
conversed into new products, are the main alternatives for treating polymer waste [9]. Dissolution of
low-density PS foam waste with suitable solvents is one of the cheapest, most efficient and environmentally friendly ways for PS waste management [9,10]. Thus, the dissolution behavior of PS foams
in different solvents has a crucial role in polystyrene recycling [9]. PS is also soluble into its monomer styrene, and up to this day, EPS has been to a large extent produced from monostyrene (MS) via
bead suspension polymerization in batch reactors. Hence, the idea of the possibility to utilize this
traditional way of producing EPS beads in recycling of PS by dissolving the waste PS or EPS into
MS is extremely tempting and would be a natural direction for the EPS industry.

2 Purpose, Goals and Guidelines
The goal of this project in general was to determine how much EPS could possibly be recycled or
reused in a suspension polymerization process of EPS in a batch reactor (BR). At least a couple of
patents mention the possibility to dissolute 0.5-30% PS or EPS into styrene monomer and using it in
suspension polymerization of EPS [11,12]. It is also stated to increase the viscosity of the reaction
mixture, and presumably to help dispersion of graphite [4]. BEWi is weighing between different
alternatives to recycle both EPS and PS in the future.
The fact that undersized and oversized EPS beads produced via suspension polymerization have limited technical applications make it obvious that something must be done to reduce the production of
underutilized off-spec material, and reusing it directly in the suspension polymerization process is
an attractive alternative for BEWISynbra Group. It is still unclear how and if the off-spec EPS and/or
waste EPS and PS will be utilized in BEWiSynbra RAW’s EPS suspension polymerization manufacture in the future. The two most obvious alternatives would be pre-dissolving EPS before suspension or letting it dissolve into MS directly during the suspension polymerization process. Either way,
the actual polymerization with EPS content must be successfully carried out before any practical
technical applications or solutions are seriously considered or planned. If the suspension polymerization process with a traditional or slightly altered manufacturing system could be carried out successfully at BEWiSynbra, it could be an asset on the highly competitive EPS market since the profitability could increase by lowering the total EPS manufacture expenses with lower consumption of
virgin MS (more cheap raw material waste PS and EPS), by giving the possibility to reuse produced
off-spec EPS (less waste product), and by providing a more ecofriendly high-status product attracting
more customers (more sold product).
Finding approximate limits for EPS content in MS resulting in successful polymerization was the
primary focus in this project rather than optimizing PSD at different EPS wt-% dissolved into MS
due to the strict time schedule that was set for the project (6 months). Most of the polymerizations
were carried out with pre-dissolved EPS-MS-liquid mixture to make sure that the PS has dissolved
into MS properly, and supposedly, optimal process conditions are met. Defining or finding out the
minimum dissolution time in suspension for different EPS concentrations would also have been very
time consuming, taking into consideration that three different EPS products were tested, and less
effort was placed on this due to the limited time frame. In order to determine possible dissolution
times preliminary solubility tests were also done.

3 General Technical Background
3.1 Polymers, Plastics and Polymerization
3.1.1 General Overview
The ideal goal in chemical industry is to design chemical processes which follow steady-state operation conditions. However, particularly in the field of polymerization reactions, process operations
are often forced to run in batch. In addition, uncertainties in measurement and process disturbances
are common in real-life operation, preventing the steady-state conditions to be met. There is plenty
of reasons for a dynamic behavior of polymerization plants, including for example, necessary operation policies, such as process start-up, shutdown, and grade transition, and unpredictable perturbations and failures. Thus, controllability of the process is a crucial part of the plant operation, and the
aim should be in maintaining specified operation conditions despite the unknown and unwanted uncertainties and disturbances, which is not a trivial task [14]. Some classical polymerization control
problems include control of reaction and of reaction temperature, monomer conversion and polymer
production, molecular weight averages and MWDs, copolymer composition, and particle size and
PSDs [15].
Polymers are macromolecules consisting of many monomeric covalently bonded repeating units, that
can be synthetic or naturally occurring (e.g., starch, cellulose, etc.) [16], being suitable for use in a
variety of products and having a wide range of applications due to among other things, their chemical
inertness and optical, barrier, thermal and mechanical properties [17]. The polymeric material includes both the polymer and the additives with which it is compounded, and can be a for example, a
polymer blend (copolymer) or a composite [10,11]. Monomers, or mers, are molecules possessing
functional groups or elements which react with each other to form large molecules. Monomers are
commonly simple organic molecules containing a double bond or a minimum of two active functional groups [18]. The size of the polymer is determined by the degree of polymerization (DP),
which is the number of monomers, or more precisely the number of repetitions of the monomer [17,
18]. The total number of structural units is the polymer size, including the end groups. The polymer
size is also related to both chain length and molecular weight [17]. Polymers unique chemical and
physical properties can be largely attributed to their large molecular size. The common ordinary
organic compounds such as alcohol, ether, chloroform, sugar etc., are made up of small molecules
having molecular weights usually less than 1,000, while the molecular weights of polymeric materials vary from 20,000 to hundreds of thousands [18]. The polymers molecular and morphological

3

Jani Korkiamäki
characteristics depend on the formulation (e.g., monomers, catalysts, initiators, etc.), the polymerization process (e.g., reactor, polymerization technique) and the process conditions (e.g. concentrations, temperature, time) [19]. Polymers can be categorized according to one or more of the following
criteria:
i.

chemical nature of monomers,

ii.

molecular structure of polymers,

iii.

polymer chain growth mechanism, and

iv.

type of polymerization process.

This is not a unique way of classification, though, and several other alternatives have been proposed
in the literature [14].
The classes of polymerization mechanisms are classically divided into two main groups: chaingrowth polymerization or addition polymerization and step-growth polymerization or condensation
polymerization [3,13]. In chain polymerization, the molecule chain grows by reacting an active polymer chain with single monomer molecules, which are connected to the chain. In step-growth
polymerization, the molecule chain growth involves reactions between macromolecules. Both
polymerization mechanisms may produce non-polymeric byproducts [13]. A multitude of reaction
mechanisms can be utilized for synthetization of polymers from monomers, and many of these can
be included as subclasses in addition polymerization (e.g., free-radical, ionic, group transfer, and
catalytic Ziegler-Natta polymerizations) and step-growth (e.g., polycondensation) polymerization
[19]. Some newer polymerization classes such as supramolecular polymerization have been established more recently. Supramolecular polymers are a newer class of polymers in which monomeric
repeating units are held together with highly directional and reversible (noncovalent) secondary interactions that result in polymeric properties in dilute and concentrated solution as well as in the bulk,
in contrary to conventional macromolecules that have mainly covalent bindings [18,20]. The playground for polymer scientists has grown enormously and is no more limited to macromolecular species only [20].
The various industrial polymerization processes can be generally classified roughly into two main
categories, homogeneous and heterogeneous polymerization processes. The former class (homogeneous) consists of polymerization processes that are carried out in a single phase. In the latter class
either the polymer is insoluble in the monomer phase (e.g. bulk precipitation polymerization of
acrylonitrile), or the polymerization involves the presence of different phases (e.g. suspension, emulsion and solid-gas catalytic polymerization). The most common polymerization processes employed
to produce various polymers are

bulk,

ii.

solution,

iii.

precipitation,

iv.

suspension,

v.

emulsion,

vi.

solid catalyzed,

vii.

interfacial polycondensation, and

viii.

solid state polymerization [14].

This work will mostly revolve around suspension polymerization and the expanded polystyrene
(EPS) produced with it, and a description and the general features of each of these other processes is
given in the Glossary & Concepts section. Especially the heterogeneous types of polymerization
processes including precipitation and its subclass dispersion polymerization, and emulsion polymerization are interesting since they resemble suspension polymerization a lot. The monomer that is the
most interesting in respect of this work is styrene and the PS polymers produced with it. The styrene
monomer can be readily polymerized to PS via free-radical mechanism, while the polymerization is
initiated either thermally or with initiators (peroxides or azocompounds). However, it is also possible
to polymerize styrene via anionic and Ziegler-Natta mechanisms by using organometallic initiators.
By using free-radical and anionic polymerization results in a polymer with somewhat random position of the benzene ring of the monomer units of regular polystyrene, and in this way, inhibits crystallization. On the other hand, advances in metallocene polymerization catalysts has made it possible
to develop syndiotactic polystyrene with a semi-crystalline structure, a melting point of 270 °C and
a great environmental stress crack resistance [21]. Different commercial polymerization methods for
PS production with advantages and disadvantages are summarized in the Table 1 below [21].

Table 1. Commercial polymerization methods for PS production [21].
In the initial state when polymers are produced, the polymers are usually viscous liquids or, in the
case of a solid, are granules (powders) or flakes. It is also possible, that the granules of flakes are
5

Jani Korkiamäki
formed into some intermediate shape, such as for example, small pellets. Even so, these can also be
called resins since they later formed into a shaped plastic part. The terms resin, plastic and polymer
are often used interchangeably, although correctly used there are differences. As a summary can be
stated: polymers are any material consisting of large molecular chains, plastics are synthetic, longchain polymers that can or have been shaped, and resins are solids or liquids that are later shaped
into a plastic product. [3]
Plastics, whether made by addition or condensation polymerization, can be generally divided into
two groups: thermoplastics and thermosetting resins. In addition, a third group, engineering plastics
has been established [3,14]. Thermoplastics are solid materials at room temperature, that can be
melted or soften upon heating. This makes it possible to place them into a mold or other shaping
device to be cooled, and as a result, the thermoplastic solidifies and takes the desired shape. The
thermoplastics can be reshaped by reheating many times [3]. Commodity thermoplastics are manufactured in large volumes and consist of polymers such as polyethylene (low and high density), isotactic polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The thermosetting resins harden
(curing) irreversibly through chemical crosslinking, and hereby, cannot be remelted or shaped [14].
They can be either liquids or solids at room temperature and will only soften a little bit after curing
[3]. Thermosets consist of phenolic resins, amino resins, epoxides, alkyd resins, unsaturated polyesters, polyurethanes, cross-linked polyethylene, etc. The engineering plastics, on the other hand, consist in general of thermoplastics with improved mechanical or thermal properties compared to commodity plastics. Polyethylene terephthalate, polyamides, polycarbonates, some modified polystyrenes (e.g., Styrene Acrylonitrile (SAN) and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS)), various polyetherketones, polyamides, polysulfones, and some thermosetting resins are examples of this class of
specialty plastics [14]. A short summary of the differences between thermoplastics and thermosets
below in the Table 2, for example PS versus PU.

3.1.2 Worldwide Demand and Production of Plastic Materials
The worldwide demand for polymeric materials is enormous. The statistics below shows the distribution of polymer demand by major polymer in 2016 (Figure 2) and the global plastic production by
region in 2017. In 2016, the total demand for polymeric materials worldwide was equivalent to 243
metric tons, while the total production of plastics in 2017 was equivalent to 348 million tons [22,
23]. PP had the highest demand by a share of 26 percent of the total global demand for polymers in
2016. Regarding styrenic polymers, the highest demand was for PS (4%), ABS (2%) and EPS (2%)
[22].

3.1.3 Polymerization Mechanisms and Reactions
Classically, there is two fundamental polymerization reactions differentiated as addition polymerization and condensation polymerization. The important differences between these two classes are
summarized below in the table below (Table 3):

Table 3. Summary of the differences between the main polymerization mechanisms [3].
Only addition polymerization and its mechanism are discussed in detail because its relevance for this
work. Of the subspecies of the main classes, the free-radical polymerization is the most essential for
this work.

Step-growth Polymerization (Condensation Polymerization)
In step-growth polymerization stepwise reaction happen between functional groups of reactants.
The reaction leads successively from monomer to dimer, trimer, tetramer, pentamer, and so on, finally resulting in a polymer with a large DP. The reactions occur randomly between the intermediates (e.g., dimers, trimers, etc.) and the monomer, and among the intermediates themselves. Most
of the step polymerization processes involve poly-condensation (repeated condensation reactions),
therefore, the terms step polymerization and condensation polymerization are used interchangeably.
Condensation polymerization can be defined as polymerization in which polymers synthesis involves elimination of small molecules or the repeating unit lack certain atoms present in the monomer(s). The eliminated molecule could be water, for instance [18]. In step polymerization, the molecular weight increases continuously with time, and the formation of polymers with adequately
8

Jani Korkiamäki
high molecular weight for practical applications requires very high conversions of the reactive
groups (over 98-99 %). This leads to strict requirements for step polymerization processes, such as
the need for a favorable equilibrium and the absence of side reactions. Many of the most important
step-growth polymerizations such as amidation (e.g., nylons), esterification (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate) and transesterification (polycarbonate) are reversible. In addition, the equilibrium constant decreases with temperature, since it is an exothermic process [13].

Addition Polymerization (Chain-growth Polymerization)
In addition polymerization, a simple, low-molecular-weight molecule with a double bond, ideally a
monomer, is treated so that the double bond opens up, resulting in free valences to join with those of
other molecules, ideally monomers, to form a polymer chain. The identical composition of repeating
unit of a polymer and its monomer(s) is in most cases a strong indication that the polymer is formed
by chain polymerization process [18]. Either a catalyst or an initiator generates the activity of the
chain [13]. Chain-growth polymerizations can be divided to several classes according to the type of
active center:
•

coordination polymerization (active center is an active site of a catalyst, Ziegler-Natta catalysts),

•

free-radical polymerization (active center is a radical),

•

anionic polymerization (active center is an anion), and

•

cationic polymerization (active center is a cation) [13].

The addition polymerization mechanism, or chain-reaction mechanism, progresses by several sequential steps. The four main steps in addition polymerization are
1) chain initiation,
2) chain propagation,
3) chain transfer, or chain branching, and
4) chain termination [18].
In the initiation step, a monomer containing a carbon-carbon double bond as an active center (πbond), or reactive site, is attacked by free radicals. The interaction between the free radical and the
monomer converts the monomer to a free radical. This newly formed unstable new radical is willing
to form a bond and attacks another monomer molecule that links the atom, the carbon (active center)
and the monomer to the growing chain. The most convenient source of available electrons is the πbond of another monomer molecule, which is especially true for high monomer concentrations. This
sequence of lengthening the chain with a new monomer is referred as the propagation step. The
process of creation of a free radical, attack on π-bond of the new monomer molecule, and formation
of new free radical can continue as long as monomers are available to react, assuming other readily
9

Jani Korkiamäki
available electron source does not interfere with the process by reacting with the newly formed free
radicals. Thus, the chain can become very long, often growing to several thousand units of the repeating unit, the monomer. Eventually the polymer chain is ended, and this step is called the termination step [3]. There are several reactions that can result in chain termination, but the two most
important termination mechanisms are termination by combination or coupling and disproportion
[18]. One of the simplest of these is that the carbon free radical meets another radical, either peroxide
or carbon (termination by combination). As a result, two unpaired electrons, free radicals, form a
covalent bond between them. However, there is another possibility that the carbon free radical would
extract an electron from a bond other than π-bond (termination by disproportionation). This is far
less likely to occur because the electrons in other bonds are generally less reactive and much more
tightly held. The odds are higher especially at high temperatures due to increased activity and excitement of the electrons. The most likely place for a free radical to extract another electron would be
from a carbon-hydrogen bond in another polymer chain. When this occurs, a bond between the two
carbon atoms in the two separate chains would form and a hydrogen free radical would be released.
This process is called branching, or chain transfer, which terminates the chain, but the active center
is transferred to a new chain [3]. Chain transfer may be regarded as a combination of chain termination and chain initiation [18]. The released hydrogen free radical could react with other π-bond or for
any other reaction common for free radicals. It could for example, terminate some other chain. There
are other possibilities resulting in termination, but these are in general of less importance [3].

3.2 Recycling and Handling of Plastic Waste
3.2.1 Introduction
Plastics have become extremely common materials in our lives, and are often used in disposable,
one-time use applications that increase solid waste loads [3]. The use of plastics in disposables is
considerably lower than paper-based products, but still, the use of plastic-based products grows constantly [3]. Although plastics have been major contributor in revolutionizing many technologies, applications and in creating new novel materials, the increasing volume of plastic wastes, coupled with
their low biodegradability, generates a serious environmental problem [24]. Even though source reduction is not a direct recycling method, it is important to mention as a strategy to decrease the solid
waste. Source reduction is defined as the reduction in amount of material used in an application,
which in this way reduces the amount of discarded material when the use is completed [3]. Plastic
recycling can be described as “the process of recovering scrap or waste plastics and reprocessing the
material into useful products, sometimes completely different in form from their original state” [25].
The different plastic recycling methods can be classified in different levels, depending on the classification of the final product, for example, in the following way:
•

Primary recycling: The recovered plastic can be used in a product with equivalent performance characteristics to that made using virgin plastics.

•

Secondary recycling: The recovered plastic can be used in a product having less demands
for performance than the original application.

•

Tertiary recycling: Plastic waste can be used as the feedstock in a process generating chemicals and fuels.

•

Quaternary recycling: Energy can be recovered from plastic waste by incineration [25].

This type of recycling, referring to material that has been discarded and used by a consumer, is
called postconsumer recycle (PRC). It is opposed by recycle that is created as a normal part of
normal waste (e.g. off spec) generated by production process, generally called regrind or plant
recycle [3].
The reuse and various recycling of waste residues and plastics leads ideally to reduction in the
use of non-renewable material and energy resources, while the energy savings are generally
ranked in the following order: reuse > material recovery > energy recovery (energy from waste)
[24]. Incentives for the usage of recycled plastics include for example, ecological, consumer
demand, recycle-content legislation and lower cost [6]. The tree essential elements in plastics
recycling are:

11

Jani Korkiamäki
i.

stable supply source involving adequate collection and sortation,

ii.

a recycling process that is economical and environmentally sound,

iii.

end-use applications/properties for the recycled polymer offering economic market values and consumer attraction [14].

Recycling of plastics or polymers can be challenging and may require greater processing than glass
and metal [25]. There are 10-12 main polymer types and thousands of different resin grades and
blends. On top of that, the polymers are often multicomponent systems using multi-layers, laminates
and composites. Furthermore, plastics contain often one or more additive, formulant, or modifiers,
such as fillers, pigments, antioxidants, and antioxidants which readily interfere with the recycling
process. It is also possible that a single polymer (e.g., PE) can be found in several different melt flow
indexes and thermal stabilities. As a result of all this, recycled polymers are often by their nature
contaminated with foreign materials compared with virgin polymers, such as paper, metal fragments,
fibers, glass and incompatible polymers [6]. This can limit the choice of applications in several ways
(e.g., poor mechanical properties). The available and technically viable recycling methods can be
categorized in the following groups:
I.

Mechanical recycling, which consists of reprocessing of plastic residues into new products
(different or like the original product). The origin of the raw material may be a manufacturing
process or post-consumer product. The simplest way of recycling plastic material with the
lowest initial investments needed.

II.

Chemical or feedstock recycling (tertiary recycling), which involves breaking down plastic
material into its basic monomers or other products with the help of heat or chemical treatment, which can be recombined into polymers or used for other applications. Hydrolysis and
pyrolysis are typical examples of tertiary recycling. The biggest disadvantage is the demand
of huge investments, and hence, is most viable for large-scale operations with volumes (thousands of tons annually) compared to those in petrochemical industry

III.

Energy recycling or quaternary recycling, which includes the recovery of energy from the
plastic by combustion. The emissions of volatiles must be controlled during the processing
in order to avoid environment being contaminated by other paths. This type of operation is
often seen as a wasteful underutilization of the energy stored in the plastic [24].

Even though all the methods of material and energy recovery from waste plastic is technically possible, they encounter other barriers [24]. First and foremost, the recycling isn’t often economically
profitable, other limiting factors include for example legislative and market barriers [3,24]. The Figure 3 below presents the evolution of the amount generated plastic waste and plastic disposal practices from 1960s up to recent years.

3.2.2 Plastic Waste Handling Strategies
Solid plastic waste can generally be handled with six different strategies or ways, which are discussed
shortly below, including:
1. source reduction,
2. recycling,
3. regeneration,
4. degradation,
5. landfills,
6. incineration [3].
Each of these are important as a means of minimizing negative environmental effects. Especially
recycling is a crucial method for this work as solvent recycling is applied by solving a polymer, PS,
into a solvent, its monomer styrene.

13

Jani Korkiamäki

Source Reduction
Some simple examples include using fewer waste causing products, choosing sizes and types of
products with minimal waste, and for the manufacturers, to reduce the material requirements of the
product. The most extreme case would be substituting plastics with other materials completely, for
example substitution of plastic grocery sacks with paper sacks [3].

Recycling
Even if source reduction would increase drastically, materials continue to be discarded, and thus,
recycling will continue to be an important way of reducing the amount of material ending up in
landfills and other waste streams. The amount of recycled materials grows constantly, and according
to some reasonably estimates that between 8 and 17% of all plastic product are recycled. Both PCR
and plant recycle material reprocessing and refabricating requires several stages: collection, handling/sorting, reclamation/cleaning, and end-use fabrication. These steps are often expensive and
challenging, and in this way, recycling is not necessarily the most tempting option. Regrind that is
reused or consumed within a manufacturing process is of course not a problem, however, the unused
part will most likely become a part of waste stream [3].
The ideal way to use recycled material is the same as the original or some other high-value application. The plastic can be used in the original application, if it has been thoroughly sorted. However,
most plastic resins have some minor changes after the reprocessing, typically a reduction in molecular weight accompanied with drop in melt viscosity and an increase in the melt index. These changes
are often minor and are not present throughout the melt, but result in in many physical and mechanical properties, including for instance yield strength and elongation. It has been noted that some
products made from PCR that the small changes in molecular weight and other changes complicate
the processing. A blend ratio of 20 PCR is typical regardless of that some fabricators have found that
up to 50 % PCR may be used without drastic changes in processing and product performance. However, contamination and disease risk prevent the use of PCR in medical and food-contacting applications [3].

Regeneration
“Regeneration is the process of breaking down the polymer molecules in the plastic material into
more basic chemicals [3].” These basic components or chemical can be used to create new polymers
or materials. Regeneration is also known as chemical recycling [3]. The regeneration is done by using
depolymerization and decomposition reactions [24]. Condensation polymers such as PET and nylon
(most common methods glycolysis and methanolysis) are the easiest polymers to regenerate [3,24].
With the help of heat and pressure in the presence of a reacting agent the polymers can be depoly-

14

Jani Korkiamäki
merized, also known as unzipping, monomers can be regenerated. Depolymerization of addition polymers such as PS, PE, and PP is more challenging. Much higher temperature is needed and generally
the regeneration is done in large facilities a lot like oil refineries. Here cracking is used to separate
large crude oil molecules into smaller units. Thermosets are the most problematic of all to regenerate.
Typically, the regeneration is done with pyrolysis, which is the decomposition of a material using
heat processes in the absence of oxygen [3].
Regeneration has its benefits and downsides. The advantages of regeneration compared to traditional
recycling is that regeneration is typically more efficient for mixed recycle. Each of the fractions,
more specifically, condensation polymers, addition polymers, and thermosets, can be selectively regenerated. This results in much higher value for the waste compared than from the conversion of a
product with lower intrinsic value. The disadvantages compared to traditional recycling is the higher
potential for air pollutants and the loss of thermal and chemical energy that was already expended to
polymerize the monomers. Additional thermal and chemical energy is needed to break the polymers
apart, and after that energy is needed to connect the structural units back together [3].

Degradation
Another strategy to reduce or eliminate especially solid waste is to use/develop biocompatible materials that are degradable. The term ‘degradable’ refers to the plastics ability to “break down into
smaller molecules by natural means, usually by some biological agent or by action of something in
the environment (e.g., sunlight) “[3]. The timing for degradation of a plastic is crucial. Neither should
it take too long to degrade, like in the cases of many conventional plastics, nor should it degrade too
rapidly for the intended use. Another crucial issue is the degradation products. Even if the plastic
would decompose quickly, the degradation products can be hazardous, and hence, can damage environment. One should also take into consideration that there is no certainty that even easily decomposing materials decompose in landfills, and the permanent repository should be carefully well
thought out. Achieving degradable polymers that degrade quickly, and at the same time could compete with conventional plastics with respect to cost and properties or abilities is challenging [3].

Landfills
Sanitary landfills are the most way common way of solid waste disposal. Plastics share of the total
amount in landfills is about 20 % by volume and 8% by weight. For comparison, the amount of paper is largest in landfills, ca. 34 % by volume and 40 % by weight. In landfills, the waste is simply
dumped and buried in the ground. The popularity of landfills is due to the low price versus the
other waste disposal methods. No sorting or processing is needed. It is crucial control the landfill
process in order to protect the site and its surroundings from problems of odor, fire, vermin and
pollution from seepage. Plastics are relatively inert and risk-free materials in landfills. Most of the
plastics are not readily degradable and do not contribute to water-soluble residues, however, but the
15

Jani Korkiamäki
components in them such as plasticizers may contribute. This overall inertness favors plastics since
the degradation of mass is tried to prevent. Absence of air and organisms necessary for degradation
to occur lack in landfills. The main issue with landfills is that the capacity is limited, and available
space for landfills is dwindling. [3]

Incineration
Incineration refers to controlled burning. This strategy is used for disposal of a large percentage of
municipal waste. This method makes it possible to use plastics along other flammable materials, such
as paper. The plastics and other flammable materials are separated from the rest of the waste stream.
The easily sorted high value plastics, such as PET bottles, are manually separated. The flammable
materials are chopped into flakes and later on pressed into pellets in order to ease the handling and
economical transportation to the from the recycling center to the burning facility. The general purpose for burning, in addition to the elimination of solid wastes, is the generation of electricity. The
efficiency of the burning of waste is related to the energy content of the materials and is often
weighed against the energy content of more traditional fuels like natural gas and oil.
The main issues and disadvantages associated with incineration include the formation of hazardous
emissions, the problems with as disposal, and the release of carbon dioxide gases that could accelerate the global warming. The following pollutants have been the main concern:
•

particulates: heavy metals including lead, cadmium, zinc, chromium and mercury,

•

acid gases leading to acid rain including trace concentrations of sulfur, chlorine and fluoride,

•

NOx,

•

trace organics, especially chlorinated dioxins and furans that may be carcinogenic.

Even though experts on incineration technology are convinced that most of the hazardous components and emissions can be efficiently limited to safe levels with the existing technologies, there
could be some risks associated with incineration, and source reduction and recycling are often preferred over incineration and regeneration for management of solid waste. However, incineration is
often preferred over landfills. [3]

3.3 Styrenic Polymers
3.3.1 General Information
Styrenic polymers are as a group one of the economically most important plastics in the world, right
behind polyolefins, PVC and polyethylene terephthalate, with an annual production capacity of approximately 25 million tonnes per year (2011) [26]. Styrene is an important feedstock in several
polymer products [15]. Of the total amount of styrene produced, almost 50 % is used for manufacture
of polystyrene, 20 % for elastomers, thermosetting resins and polymer dispersions, 15 % for ABS
and SAN copolymers, 10 % for expanded polystyrene (EPS), and the rest for different copolymers
and specialty materials (before the year 2000). These plastics majorly determine the worldwide
growth in styrene production capacity and plant utilization [15]. Styrenic polymers combine effective
processing with a wide variety of properties, ranging from stiff and transparent to tough and durable.
In addition, the fact that styrene can be polymerized by many different polymerization mechanisms,
including radical, ionic and metal catalyzed (coordination), makes this family of products unique and
attractive for many applications [15].
The first representative of styrenic polymers was polystyrene, which was in fact, the first synthetic
polymer to be prepared and the earliest reports of its existence are as early as 1839 [21]. The family
of styrenic polymers has continued to grow to this day, and will most certainly, continue to grow in
the future, too [21]. Different styrenic polymers can be made generally by copolymerization, alloying
and blending or mixing (see Glossary) [3]. The key feature of polystyrene that has led to its huge
commercial success is the low cost. The unwillingness of polystyrene fabricators to pay additional
costs for improved performance and the intense competition on polystyrene markets has led to highly
optimized and huge PS production facilities (a typical world PS plant has production capacity of 230
000 tons/year product). The costs accompanied with the introduction of new improved PS products
must be low enough so that profits can be realized by the manufacturer without raising the sales
price. This limitation and the trend to minimize the R&D budgets together challenges industrial polystyrene researchers. On top of that, other pressures on PS industry include environmental and regulatory issues [21].

3.3.2 Basic Structure and Properties
The term styrenics, or styrenic polymers, describes a major family of major plastic products that have
styrene (see Figure 5) as the key building block. Styrene polymers can be processed with ease over
a wide temperature range well above their softening point, in other words the ‘glass transition tem-

17

Jani Korkiamäki
perature’ (Tg). The partly crystalline polymers, such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyamides (Pa), polyesters, styrenic polymers (except syndio- and iso-tactic polystyrene) do not have
a distinctive melting point. Thus, no extra thermal energy is needed for melting of polymeric crystals
(melt enthalpy) is needed during processing. As a result, the processing is easier and faster under the
same conditions, but at the same time, high dimensional stability and majorly constant mechanical
properties up to Tg can be obtained. Relatively slow change of melt viscosity with temperature is
characteristic for styrenics. This favorable rheological behavior benefits the processing, too. [15] The
actual styrene monomer, around 90 %, is produced by the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene.
This reversible endothermic reaction is performed in gas-phase, resulting in conversion of ethylbenzene into styrene in the following way (Figure 4.):

Figure 4. Conversion of ethylbenzene into styrene [26].

Figure 5. Molecular structures of styrene (left) and polystyrene (right).
The styrenic polymers with the most economical importance are
•

polystyrene (PS) with 4% share, which is used as crystal clear, but brittle homopolymer
‘general purpose polystyrene’ (GPPS) or as stiff but opaque, impact modified ‘high impact
polystyrene’ (HIPS),

•

expandable polystyrene (EPS), which is GPPS beads containing pentane. EPS beads expand under heat. EPS is lightweight, strong, and us an excellent thermal insulation, which
makes it an ideal material for packaging and construction industries (as insulation), and

•

styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer (SAN), which is a transparent, stiff and thermoplastic polymeric material characterized by high stress cracking resistance. SAN comprises of the styrene and acrylonitrile monomer [15].

An overview of the major styrenic classes and their building blocks are presented below (Figure 6), and some of the unique value propositions of styrenic polymers as well (Table 4).

18

Jani Korkiamäki

Figure 6. Major styrenic polymer classes and their connection to petrochemical value chain [27].

Table 4. Some unique value proposition of styrenic polymers [28].
Styrenic polymers have many beneficial qualities that can be utilized in different kind of applications, including:
▪

Lightweight, water resistant, and magnificent thermal insulation.

▪

High strength-to-weight ratio, rigid structure offering energy-savings in transportation and
a great cost performance.

▪

Possibility to shatterproof and transparency.

▪

Great electrical insulation.

▪

Easy processing and manufacturing in a range of different colors.

▪

Easy recycling [15].

Styrene based resins are used in many every day goods ranging from computer housings to food
packaging. Some common applications include, for instance, extruded polystyrene (XPS) foam
boards for insulation, kitchen appliances, toys, electronics, automobile parts and a wide variety of
durable lightweight packaging. As summary, styrene polymers are utilized in many very demanding
applications, and their strengths lie in the combination of cost efficiency, high performance and easy
processing. [15]

3.4 Suspension Polymerization
3.4.1 Introduction

In this chapter the main concept and features on suspension polymerization in chemical industry is
introduced. The term suspension polymerization is describing a process in which water-insoluble
monomers in are dispersed as liquid droplets by combined action of steric stabilizers and vigorous
stirring in order to produce polymer particles as a dispersed solid phase inside the droplets [13,21,27].
The monomer is in a liquid state in which monomer-soluble initiators for polymerization are employed. During the polymerization, the droplets are quickly transformed into sticky, viscous monomer-polymer particles, finally resulting in rigid, spherical polymer particles larger than 1 µm (smaller
droplets/particles are generally known as emulsions), and the upper limit for suspension can be regarded as 1-2 mm or larger [8,29].
Suspension polymerization belongs to the class of heterogeneous polymerization. Heterogeneous
polymerization processes, or particle forming processes, are typically two-phase systems. Other common commercial heterogeneous polymerization processes used in manufacture of addition polymerization of vinyl monomers are emulsion, dispersion and precipitation polymerization. In these processes the starting monomers and the formed polymers are in the form of fine dispersion in an immiscible liquid. Some general components, and their role and nature of heterogeneous polymerization can be distinguished. The monomer is normally referred to as the “monomer phase” or “dispersed phase”. The liquid phase, which contains the dispersed monomer, is defined as the “polymerization medium”, or just “medium”. It is also common to call the polymerization medium as “continuous phase” or the “outer phase”. Besides the monomer(s), the polymerizing medium and the
initiator, another liquid known as “monomer diluent”, or just “diluent”, which must be miscible with
the monomer and immiscible with the medium may be added to the system, and in addition, additives
are added to the polymerization system, too, in order to emulsify the monomer and/or to stabilize the
monomer droplets. Polymerization mixtures consisting of an aqueous and nonaqueous phase are
classified into oil-in-water (O/W) or water-in-oil (W/O) systems [29]. Suspension, emulsion, dispersion, and precipitation polymerization can be clearly distinguished based on the following four criteria:
1) initial state of the polymerization mixture,
2) kinetics of polymerization,
3) mechanism of particle formation, and
4) shape and size of the final polymer products [29].
20

Jani Korkiamäki
Suspension polymerization is the most widespread method for commercial manufacture of plastic
resins both in the tonnage, and number of polymers manufactured, such as poly(vinyl chloride),
poly(methyl metacrylate), a variety of ion exchange resins, and specific grades of polystyrene,
namely expandable polystyrene (EPS), high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) and various styrene copolymers (e.g. SAN, ABS) [13,14,28]. For the suspension polymerization processes where particle porosity is not required, the terms pearl and bead polymerization are also used [27]. In general, there is
two types of suspension polymerization that can be distinguished from one another:
•

“bead” suspension polymerization in which the polymer is soluble in the monomer resulting
in smooth spherical particles (e.g. EPS suspension polymerization), and

•

“powder” suspension polymerization in which the polymer is insoluble in its monomer resulting in precipitation and formation or irregular grains or particles [13].

3.4.2 Main Components and Additives
The following main ingredients, or components, are present in a suspension polymerization system
in general:
1) monomer(s);
−

building blocks/material for polymers dispersed in the continuous medium,

2) agitated stabilizing/dispersing medium or continuous phase;
−

usually consisting of water,

−

acts as heat-transfer medium and disperses the monomer,

3) small amount of suspension agent(s) or surface-active agent(s) or drop stabilizer(s) (0.01 to 0.50
% of the weight of monomer);
−

organic substances are commonly used, and also finely divided particulate inorganic solids
are possible such as calcium phosphate or metal hydroxides are used,

−

absorption of stabilizing molecules between the monomer and the dispersing medium reduces the

−

tension, thus reduces the energy needed to form drops,

−

crucial to successful control of the polymerization process and the uniformity of the product
by stabilizing monomer drops in aqueous suspension, in absence of a drop stabilizer the
suspension would be unstable, and the monomer/polymer drops would coalesce and grow
too large,

4) initiator(s);
−

soluble in liquid monomer, that is usually of peroxide type, but azo and ionic compounds are
used in some degree, too.

−

used to initiate free-radical polymerization reactions. [13,27-31]
21

are, for example:
5) chain transfer agent(s);
−

may be restrict the average MW of the final polymer product,

6) surfactant(s);
−

may be used to reinforce stabilizers function/activity or to decrease viscosity

7) dispersant(s), or dispersion agent(s);

−

often a volatile hydrocarbon, such as pentane for example,

−

used to form foam when the drops are subsequently heated,

−

chemicals that may be used to decrease viscosity. [13,27-31]

10) diluents;

3.4.3 Process Description
Industrial suspension polymerizations are often described as “batch” processes, but in reality, they
are often semi-batch processes, and usually proceed via free-radical mechanism producing polymer
beads [27,28]. The major goal in suspension polymerization is to produce as uniform as possible
dispersion of monomer droplets in the continuous aqueous phase with a control over coalescence of
the droplets during the polymerization process (PSD) [27]. Polymerization drops in the reactor are
generally of the same size distribution to that of the polymer beads (0.1-5 mm) [13,27]. The initiator,
usually of an organic peroxide type, is soluble in the monomer, and these two are insoluble in the
polymerization medium, usually consisting of water. The ratio of the monomer phase to the polymerization medium is usually kept 0.01–0.5, but it can also be higher, and the typical concentration of
polymer is between 30–50 % in a fully converted suspension system [14,29]. The monomer phase is
suspended in the medium in the form of small droplets, “microbeads”, with the help of a stirrer and
a suitable droplet stabilizer, or a suspension agent. The coalescence of monomer droplets and the
adhesion of partially polymerized particles during the polymerization process is hindered by suspension agents (stabilizers). The actual polymerization is initiated at the desired process temperature,
usually in the range of 20–100 °C. The polymerization process is then usually allowed to proceed
into completion (~100%). These conditions make possible the monomer “microdroplets” to be con-

22

Jani Korkiamäki
verted directly to the corresponding polymer “microbeads” of approximately equal size [30]. Subsequently, the yielded beads can be isolated from the continuous phase simply by filtration and/or
sedimentation [27].
It is generally assumed that the kinetics in suspension polymerization are similar to those of bulk and
solution polymerization, depending on the absence or presence of a monomer diluent in the monomer
droplets. In this sense, suspension polymerization can be considered as “microbulk” or “microsolution” polymerization, since the individual monomer droplets act as tiny bulk or solution polymerization reactors [30]. Each droplet act as a tiny “microreactor”, but with dimensions small enough so
that heat removal is not an issue, and the suspension medium surrounding the “microreactors” acts
as an efficient heat transfer agent. Adequate agitation of the reactor content makes sure that the heat
transfer via the aqueous phase into the reactor walls is sufficient, and a two-phase dispersion is maintained. As a result, high rates of polymerization can be maintained resulting in high yields of polymers in a relatively short time. [27,29]

3.4.4 Evolution of PSD and Effect of Operating Conditions
The control of PSD is one of the most important issues in suspension polymerization [13]. Generally,
both the initial monomer droplet size distribution (DSD) and the polymer PSD is dependent on the
concentration of the surface-active agent, the quality of agitation (e.g. reactor geometry, impeller
type, power input, etc.) and the physical properties (e.g. densities, viscosities, interfacial tension) of
the continuous and dispersed phases [13]. The dynamic PSD evolution is a manifestation of the rates
of two physical processes, namely the drop/particle breakage and coalescence/agglomeration
[13,30]. The dispersed phase can be broken into small drops when its surface is disrupted (drop
breakage) in agitated suspension and can be caused either by frictional forces (via viscous shear) or
by inertial forces (via turbulence). The overall rate of drop coalescence is dependent on the collision
frequency of the drops and to the coalescence efficiency [31]. Drop breakage occurs mainly in regions of high shear stress such as near the agitator blades or as a result of turbulent velocity and
pressure fluctuations along the drops surface. Turbulent flow field either increasers or decreases the
drop particle coalescence. However, if the concentration of surface-active agent is adequate, it can
be assumed to be negligible for dilute suspensions [13]. The Figure 7 below summarizes some of the
drop breakage and coalescence mechanisms.

Figure 7. Drop breakage and coalescence mechanisms [13].
Suspension undergoes following developments during the polymerization, and can be divided into
three different stages [13,31]:
i.

An initial low-viscosity period/stage at low monomer conversions, in which drop breakage
is the dominant mechanism and DSD shifts to smaller sizes and is generally narrow.

ii.

The sticky stage with an accelerated viscosity increase, and a decrease in breakage rate while
coalescence becomes dominant mechanism. As a result, the average particle size increases,
and the PSD becomes broader.

iii.

Identification point. If stability is achieved, during this stage at higher monomer conversions
the particles are hard enough so that the collision between them are elastic and, hence, the
particle coalescence ceases and the final shape of PSD is acquired [13,30].

The quality of polymer particles by suspension polymerization depends besides the reactor design
on operational parameters that govern the overall stability of the system [29]. Efficient management
of the process is as much empiricism as it is based on exact scientific principles [27,29]. A lot of
empirical and theoretical studies have been published on the effect on different operating conditions
and parameters on PSD. The average size of the monomer droplets, and thus, the resulting polymer
particles, can be controlled by alternating operating conditions such as the stirring speed, volume
ratio of the monomer to suspension medium, concentration of the stabilizer, and the viscosities of
both phases according to Eq (3) [30]. The following equation gathers up most of the empirical relationships reported by Arshady and Ledwith, Hopff and coworkers, Kavarov and Bakanov, Mersmann
and Grossman, and Sculles [29]:
𝐷 ×𝑅×𝑣 ×𝜀
𝑑̅ = 𝑘 × 𝐷 𝑣×𝑁×𝑣 𝑑×𝐶
𝑠

𝑠

(3)

where 𝑑̅ = average particle size; k = parameters such as apparatus design, type of stirrer, self-stabilization etc.; Dv = diameter of vessel; Ds = diameter of stirrer; R or φ = volume ratio of the droplet
phase to suspension medium; N = stirring speed (or power of mixing); vd = viscosity of the droplet
or dispersed phase; vm = viscosity of the suspension medium; 𝜀 = interfacial tension between the two
immiscible phases; and Cs = stabilizer concentration. However, Eq (3) is only a guiding equation that
24

Jani Korkiamäki
works as a semi-quantitative basis helping to understand particle size data of produced products.
Stirring speed is by far the most practical means of controlling particle size (see Figure 8) [29].

Figure 8. Dependence on Sauter mean diameter on the agitation speed for a) various PVA grades
and b) concentrations [13].
By increasing power unit mass by such means as increasing agitation speed or the impeller diameter
the turbulent intensity and the pressure and velocity fluctuations increase and, hence, the drop breakage rate increases leading to formation of smaller and more uniform particles. However, the increased
liquid circulation rates lead to more drop collisions increasing drop coalescence rates. Depending on
whether drop breakage or coalescence dominates, an increase of the input power may lead to an
increase or decrease in mean particle size (see Figure 8 above). In addition, it has been noticed that
the mean drop particle diameter follows a parabolic (U-shape) regarding the impeller speed or impeller diameter [13].
Increasing the dispersed phase viscosity (vd), in general, increases both breakage and coalescence
rates [13]. Generally, the increase of holdup fraction of the dispersed phase (φ) decreases the turbulent intensity (i.e., the average energy dissipation rate per unit mass) and, hence, the drop breakage
rate. But then again, the coalescence rate also increases because of higher amount of monomer droplets, but the coalescence efficacy decreases because off the lower average dissipation rate. Still, the
effect of φ or R affect coalescence rate more and, hence, if the input power is kept constant, as φ
increases the droplet size increases [13].

3.4.5 Suspension Reactors
The most common reactor type used in industrial suspension polymerization is agitated batch reactor
(see Figure 9), or possibly semi-batch, and the continuous phase is aqueous (for additional information about batch reactors see Glossary & Concepts) [28]. The reactors are generally vertical, agitated (or stirred tank) vessels, that are usually made of stainless steel or glass-lined carbon steel. They
are typically equipped with agitators with a paddle or anchor-type stirrer of speed in the range 20 to
60 rpm. The stirrer can be provided with baffles to enhance dispersion since the use of baffles limits
nonuniformity in turbulence and vortex formation [31,32]. Heat transfer to the aqueous phase is high
because of the relatively high ratio of surface area to volume for small drops. The temperature control
is crucial for the suspension polymerization process in order to keep polymer conversion rates high
and is one of the most important design for the reactor. The design of the reactor must ensure a close
degree of accuracy for temperature control for optimal processing conditions, and in addition, be
capable of removing the heat of polymerization process, since the process is usually exothermic. In
addition, suspension polymerization usually requires relatively large reactor volumes, larger than for
example bulk polymerization reactors, since the vessels are usually half filled with water. Reactor
geometry becomes important when large stirred vessels are used since it influences the internal liquid
flow. Some other reactor types have been used for suspension polymerization, too. These include a
loop reactor, an oscillatory baffled reactor and a continuous-flow tubular reactor (CFR) [28].

3.4.6 Scale-up of the Process – Laboratory → Pilot → Industrial Scale
Suspension polymerization has been studied for decades, and still, the industrial practitioners are
continuously facing problems within their processes in controlling the PSD. Problematic phenomena
that may cause problems and are not fully understood, include, for example, polymerization kinetics,
rheological behavior of the monomer/polymer particles, interfacial properties, suspension stability,
and the inhomogeneity of the vessel and mixing [27,30]. This naturally leads to a situation, where
industrial practitioners overemphasize some effects, while neglecting others when process design or
models are developed [27].
The step of scaling up a suspension polymerization process, or a reactor, from lab to pilot and then
to industrial scape is not straightforward or well established, and much empiricism is still used in
developing new products and to scale the production from pilot level up to production level, and
expensive and time-consuming experimental programs are usually required [13,27]. Often it is impossible to achieve a complete dynamic, chemical and thermal similarity in a scale-up procedure,
and the differences must simply be accepted at some point. This has been noted both by the researchers and the commercial manufacturers [27]. The most significant issue in scale-up is probably when
different physical processes become limiting factors at different scales. An industrial-scale reactor
must perform well several functions such as dispersion, reaction and heat transfer simultaneously
that do not scale-up in the same manner. For example, at large scales the heat removal can become a
limiting factor, while the heat removal is rarely a problem for lab-scale reactors [13].

3.5 Solubility and Dissolution of Polymers
3.5.1 General Information
Solubility of polymers is a crucial parameter in many applications. For example, in the plastic-recycling industry large-scale processes are applied in which either one solvent is used at different temperatures to selectively dissolve different sorts of polymers or several solvents are used to selectively
extract polymers from the recycled mass. In some cases, polymers are required to be insoluble, such
as in fuel tanks or solvent lines [33]. Solubility is defined as “the maximum amount of an analyte
that can be dissolved in a particular solvent or mixture of solvents at well-defined conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.)” [33]. Solubility describes the equilibrium state and should not be confused
with the term dissolution, which is the actual kinetic process of the polymer going into the solution.
The dissolution process is slow for polymers. In the beginning of the process, solvent molecules
gradually diffuse into the polymer molecules and a gel is formed, which may be followed by the gel
developing into a true molecular solution [33].
The solubility of polymers is affected by many chemical and physical parameters, such as temperature, nature of the solvent, average MW, PDI, degree of branching, crosslinking, crystallinity, etc. A
temperature increase may either increase or decrease polymer solubility. However, the dissolution
rate usually increases with increasing temperature. With increasing MW solubility and the rate of
dissolution tend to decrease. Disperse polymers with a broad MW distribution will dissolve more
rapidly than less disperse polymers with narrowly distributed MW. Increasing degree of cross-linking and crystallinity decrease both the solubility and dissolution rate. In general, branching of the
polymer increases the solubility. As a rule of thumb, similarity in the structure between the solvent
and the polymer contributes to solubility as ‘like dissolves like’ [33]. This is also true for PS that is
soluble into its monomer, styrene [59]. Polymer solubility can be predicted with the help of solubility
parameters. It is possible to estimate these quantitative parameters that are defined as the square root
of the cohesive density of a solid or liquid by measuring physical properties, for example, by means
of using differential scanning calorimetry, laser-light scattering or viscometry, swelling tests or from
cloud-point measurements (turbidimetry) [33].
Precise and accurate studies reporting solubilities of different polymer in specified solvents or mixtures of solvents at specified temperatures, etc., is limited. Basically, the polymer solubilities can be
readily measured with the help of concentration-sensitive detectors, such as differential refractometers (differential refractive index, dRI) or ultraviolet (UV) spectrometers. However, these methods
are slow and may suffer from interferences (e.g. low molecular weight additives or polymers), they
are only suitable for restricted solvent (e.g. non-UV active) and may be restricted by a limited range
29

Jani Korkiamäki
of concentrations. Still, many common methods have problem with detection, and are not suitable
for only slightly soluble polymers. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography (Py-GC) is used in an increasing
extent as a quantitative tool. It offers low detection limits and new opportunities for measuring physical data in the form of dissolution curves and solubilities of polymers [33].

3.5.2 Dissolution Process and Extraction with Solvents
Plastic recycling by solvent extraction generically consists of removal of impurities (e.g. SFE, MAE,
ASE, and other plastic additives, see Table 5), either homogeneous or heterogeneous dissolution, and
reprecipitation or devolatilization. The polymer(s) are dissolved in the solvent(s), and subsequently,
each of the polymers is selectively crystallized. In an ideal situation, the solvent is able to dissolve
either the target polymer or all the other polymers except the target polymer, and can be used for
selective dissolution. Finding selective solvents is crucial for the dissolution process [1].

Table 5. A summary of some extraction techniques of additives or impurities in waste plastics [1].
The actual dissolution process is influenced by many things, such as the types of polymers and
solvents, polymer size, MW, dissolution temperature, and concentration. Two thermodynamical
transport processes are involded in polymer dissolution, solvent diffusion and chain disentanglement.
The self diffusion of the polymer has an important role during chain distangglement. An increase in
the MW of the polymer results in dissolution becoming more disenttanglement controlled instead of
diffusion controlled. In general, the polymer plasticizes during dissolution and a gel-like swollen
layer appears with two separate interfaces. The separate interfaces form between the gel layer and
between the gel layer and the solvent. The solvent pushes the swollen polymer into the solvent, and
as the solvent is further infiltrated into the polymer the swollen surface layer increases until a quasistability state is reached. Solvent dissolution depends kinetically on the free volume of the gel phase
and the solvent size. Decrease in particle size and increase in the diffusivity of polymers result in
increased mass transfer rate, and thus, decrease the dissolution times [1].
The sructure of glassy polymers and the dissolution process is illustrated in Figure 10 below. The
glassy polymers consist of an infiltration layer, a solid swollen layer, a gel layer, and a liquid layer.
The polymer at glassy state contains channels and holes of molecular dimensions. The empty spaces
are filled with the solvent molecules annd the diffusion process is started without creating new holes.
30

Jani Korkiamäki
All layers are present in “normal dissolution”, whereas the gel layer disappears as a concequence of
the decrease in stress energy, which indicates a transition to cracking. The assumption is that the
insoluble polymers act as an additional layer decreasing the diffusion of both solvents and polymers.
Normal dissolution involves typically the penetration of the solvent, followed by swelling of the
polymers and diffusion into the solvent [1].

Figure 10. The different surface layers during the dissolution process [1].
The optimal solvents and non-solvents applied in the dissolution/reprecipitation method are primarily
selected by the principles listed below [1].
1) ‘Like dissolves like’. Highly polar polymers are dissolved in highly polar solvents, whereas
low-polar polymers are dissolved in low polar solvents. The lesser the gap in polarities between the polymer and the solvent, the easier the dissolution becomes [1].
2) Interaction between the polymer and solvent exceeds the cohesion of the polymers results in
easy dissolution of the polymer into the solvent [1].
3) Solubility parameters, such as for example, δD (dispersion energy), δP (dipolar energy) and
δH (hydrogen bonding energy), of the polymer and the solvent should be similar or equal in
order to the polymer to become more readily dissolved. Several solubility parameter systems
have been developed to estimate the solvation ability, such as Hansen, Kamlet Taft, Gutmann, Swain, and ET(30) systems [1,35].

4 Expanded Polystyrene – EPS
4.1 Introduction
4.1.1 General Information
Particle foams based on expanded polystyrene (EPS) are one of the most important PS applications
[19]. These foams have the technical name Expanded Polystyrene, but are known with various other
names, as well. For example, in Europe EPS is called Airpop®- engineered air [36]. The first processes for making EPS were developed in the 1950s using the conventional suspension polymerization process, which has been in use to this day as the predominant production route for EPS [4]. EPS
is widely used for different kinds of application, including for instance, disposable drinking cups,
fast-food containers, picnic plates, wall insulation, packing material for delicate instruments, etc. The
wide use of foamed PS has awoken some environmental concerns since it has not traditionally been
recycled to the full extent. However, other competitive materials have also met some environmental
difficulties [3].
EPS foams have a closed cellular structure and the usual density range is 10-80 g/l. However, densities of 10 g/l or lower are possible but require several pre-foaming operations [21]. Unexpanded EPS
beads are typically in the size range of 0.1-2 mm, while the expanded beads by heating will expand
up to 20 times their original value, and subsequently with passing steam through the mold beads
further expand to double the size of partially expanded size (approximately 40 times the size of the
original beads) and fuse together [3,4]. The beads are charged with a volatile organic blowing agent,
often a mix of isomers of pentane, in the final stage of the process before dewatering and drying. The
beads are also coated with organic coating working as antistatic to prevent agglomeration and assisting in the later processes and sieved to different size fractions to suit particular application, before
they are stored in silos, or filled in into gas-proof bags or octabins. Smaller bead sizes are commonly
used for thinner-walled products, and correspondingly, the bigger for thicker-walled products [4].
Different EPS production plants have typically their own recipes and process settings for the
polymerization. This depends partly on the designs and size of the reactors, and on the desired product. Even though EPS industry evolves in the same general direction, there is still a lot of proprietary
secret information about suspending agents, bead size control and cell nucleation additives, blowing
agents, bead coatings, etc. [4]

32

Jani Korkiamäki
Extrusion processes have been developed more recently. These processes yield “microbeads” with
more of a uniform size directly from a melt of polystyrene that may contain a blowing agent by using
an underwater micro pelletizer. The PS melt is supplied form either one- or two-stage extrusion line,
or directly from a polymerization reaction, which is performed in a series of static mixers and melt
pumps. These extrusion processes have the advantage over suspension polymerization in the ability
to efficiently incorporating additives, which may create problems during suspension polymerization.
The uniform size of the beads reduces the waste or off-spec when only a specific product size fraction
is desired. The subsequent processing of extruded beads is identical with polymerized beads. [4]

4.1.2 The EPS Market
The total global market value of EPS was 13 871.7 million U.S. dollars in 2016. The value was
forecasted to increase to 18 797.6 million U.S. dollars by the end of 2021 (see Figure 11) [22]. The
EPS market has become highly competitive since the regular grade EPS has been modified. The
‘modified’ EPS segment has been introduced by addition of additives such as flame retardants and
graphite. Grey and Silver EPS are used in increasing extent (see Figure 12) and dominate the market
in Europe. The grey and the silver EPS are gray to black colored products that contain graphite,
which increases its refractive and reflective properties in order to provide better thermal insulation.
The graphite already at low concentrations increases the refraction of IR light making the path for
escaping heat less direct. The thermal conductivity is decreased by 20%, and hence, while still maintaining the same properties, reduces the board thickness by 20%. It is also possible to produce grey
EPS using the same equipment used with traditional EPS. Even though the price for gray EPS is
higher than for white EPS, the possibility to reduce power costs through better insulation may increase the demand for EPS gray in the construction industry even more in the future, and most probably, will lower the price for gray products (see Figure 12 and 13) [37].

emissions,

4.2 Applications and Properties
4.2.1 Applications

Figure 14. Global EPS market volume shares by different applications in 2016 [5].
Packaging industry had the highest share of the total market, accounting for a 42.5% of the total
market volume in 2016, and 46% in 2018 [5,40]. However, there are large differences regarding the
main application of EPS in different regions [8]. For instance, in Europe building and construction
related applications’ market share accounts for approximately 70-80% [8,40,41]. The automotive
industry is forecasted to grow at a volume CAGR of 32.8% from 2017 to 2025 globally. The driving
factors for the growth are the strict requirements for lightweight, safe and fuel-efficient vehicles. The
construction industry is forecasted to account for 21.4% of the global volume in 2025 [5]. The two
conventional application areas of EPS, namely packaging and construction are shortly discussed below.

Packaging
EPS is used widely in packaging for many high-value industrial products [8]. It can provide adequate
protection and safety against mechanical and thermal damage during transport, storage and handling.
In general, small EPS particles (0.4-0.9 mm) are suitable for packaging best since the produced foam
molding parts produced can have very complicated shapes and structures. Examples of packaging
applications include packaging materials for machines and machine parts, glass, china, optical, electronical and electronic equipment, toys, pharmaceuticals, and for edge and surface protection [21].
In addition, EPS packaging is used for food packaging. The material keeps the conserve the food and
provides protection against hazards, breakages and wastage in the different stages of production,

36

Jani Korkiamäki
transport, and in consumer usage [8]. However, this requires special type of EPS with food certification. The advantages compared to other materials include low weight, resistance to water, good shock
absorption behavior, excellent heat/cold insulation and easy processing and handling [21].

Construction
EPS is used for many building projects for thermal insulation, and in increasing extent for soundproofing buildings and modernization and renovation work as well. Slabs of EPS foam are used for
insulation of walls, roofs, floors and ceilings. Bigger particle size ranging from 0.9 to 1.6 mm are
preferred for construction insulations [21]. EPS geofoam can also be used as an easy-handling, lightweight filler in roads, for example, in order to facilitate land drainage [8]. Foamed PU, PIR and XPS
are all popular plastic foams that compete against EPS in construction as an insulation material. Both
EPS and XPS are rigid, closed-cell, thermoplastic materials, while PU and PIR are thermosets. The
main competing non-plastic insulation materials are fiberglass and mineral wood [42]. A comparison
of thermal and vapor barrier properties of common insulation materials used in the construction industry in the Table 6 below.

Table 6. Typical thermal and water vapor properties of common insulation materials used in construction industry [42].

37

Jani Korkiamäki

4.2.2 Properties
The primary focus in EPS development has been in the construction and packaging industries where
the properties of thermal insulation and mechanical protection are of paramount importance. Insulative construction applications such as underfloor and wall insulations benefit from the very high
levels of thermal insulation, while packaging of fragile goods requires high mechanical (impact)
protection. For transportation applications (e.g. food transportation), both the mechanical and thermal properties are important [2]. Beneficial properties of EPS for different applications include for
example good shock absorption, compressive resistance, low thermal conductivity, chemical resistance, humidity resistance, low water absorption, low weight, durability and resistance against
decomposition, acoustic properties, recyclability etc. [3,4,8,43]. In the tables below an overview of
a number of EPS properties per EPS type at different densities according to EN 13163 is given except
for the Table 9.

Table 7. A compilation of several EPS properties at varying qualities (densities) according to EN
13163 [44].

Table 8. A compilation of moisture properties of EPS properties at varying qualities (densities) according to EN 13163 [45].

Table 9. A compilation of several mechanical EPS properties at varying densities [2].
The properties above are for the traditional white EPS. A grey product with an addition of graphite
has a better insulation property than the traditional white EPS, more specifically, approximately a
20% better insulation value (lambda) than the traditional white EPS. This enables thinner insulation
boards, savings in volume, lower transportation costs and ultimately, reduced energy consumption
[46].

5 EPS Production – Processing and
Processes
5.1 Introduction
There are generally two basic processes for making foamable polystyrene (EPS):
1. suspension polymerization of styrene into spherical beads containing a blowing agent, and
finishing of the beads in a multi-step process (Figure 15 and 16),
2. extrusion process where incorporation of a blowing agent is incorporated in bulk PS, in
which the polymer strands are quenched in a water bath to avoid foaming and the resulting
strand cutting [21].
These processes result in a raw material in the form of beads or granules, which is called EPS. Usually the EPS beads or granules are produced in one location and transported to other locations for
processing, that is, for expansion and molding into their final forms. This has the advantage that the
cost of shipping high-volume foam is minimized, and molding can be performed directly without
post-processing. The conversion of EPS particles produced with suspension polymerization into
foam is done in three steps:
1. pre-foaming/pre-expansion of EPS particles,
2. maturation or temporary storage of pre-expanded beads, and
3. final foaming (molding or blocking process) [21].

Figure 15. Schematic diagram of the manufacture of EPS particle foam [21].

5.2 EPS Manufacture Based on Suspension
Polymerization Process
5.2.1 EPS Raw Material Production
EPS Suspension Polymerization
EPS suspension polymerization produces spherical beads that are expanded into foam with the help
of heat or steam in the presence of blowing agent. The water in-soluble styrene monomers are dispersed as liquid droplets with suspension stabilizer(s) while vigorously stirring the suspension mixture, consisting of water and monomer, in order to produce polystyrene particles as dispersed solid
phase. The actual polymerization takes place in styrene monomer droplets. The initiators (e.g., organic peroxides, azo compounds) are soluble in oil. Suspension stabilization agents are present in the
suspension that help with obtaining and stabilizing the desired droplet size distribution of the dispersed phase. Commercial EPS is focused in a particle size range of 0.1-2 mm, but 0.4-1.6 mm is
preferred. The monomer/water phase ratio is often kept between 40:60 and 60:40 [21]. The most
important issue in suspension polymerization in general, and in EPS, is the control of the particlesize distribution (PSD) [13]. More detailed general information about free-radical suspension
polymerization can be found in the Chapter 3.4 Suspension Polymerization.

Technological Steps and EPS Manufacture Procedure
The commercial suspension polymerization for EPS production is carried out in a jacket batch reactor
equipped with a stirrer and often two or more baffles. The reactor volume is typically between 20
and 100 m3.
In the beginning of the production, the water phase and monomer phase are placed in the reactor
vessel. The additives are fed either before or during the polymerization into the reactor. These components are typically soluble into water or the monomer and solved or dispersed in separate vessels.
The filled reactor is heated up to the desired reaction temperature, typically gradually and in steps,
since the polymerization is generally carried out in two or more stages. A blowing agent, typically
pentane, is added under pressure during the polymerization. Once the desired conversion of the styrene monomer droplets to EPS beads is obtained, the reactor is cooled and the suspension is transferrer, typically into a stirred mixing vessel. The following finishing process is normally continuous. Centrifuges or rotating sieves separate expandable beads from water. EPS beads may then be
washed and partly pretreated with different methods. Afterwards they are dried by flash-, fluid bed-

40

Jani Korkiamäki
, and/or silo dryers, and then sieved/screened in various bead size fractions and coated, depending
on their size and application. Batch or continuous blenders using solid or fluid coating materials are
applied for coating. The used coatings and the size of the beads affect the processing properties of
the EPS foams produced from these EPS beads. Finally, the different types of EPS are packed separately, usually in octabins, IBCs or silo trucks for use by EPS foam manufacturers. [21]

Figure 16. Technological steps for production of EPS with suspension polymerization [21].

Particle Formation and Stabilization
Particle formation starts with the dispersion of the styrene in water. Under the influence of agitation,
fine drops with a definite distribution are formed. The general assumption is that the hydrodynamic
forces in the turbulent field of the reactor, which is at its strongest in the stirrer region, cause droplet
break-up as a result of turbulent fluctuations. If the tension available energy dissipation is adequate
enough to overcome the surface tension and viscoelastic resistance of the droplets, the drops break
up. Coalescence takes place if “drops collide with each other with sufficient energy to distort the
drops to a degree that the liquid film between the drops can drain away before the flow field separates
the drops again” [21]. Increase in stirrer speed, decrease in hold-up fraction and stabilizer concentration decrease the average drop size. In addition, the impeller type has been found to have an effect
the drop size distribution (DSD) [21].
There are procedures for freezing particle size growth and DSD up to the end of the polymerization,
but these particle sizes are not suitable for the target size range of EPS. Generally, by increasing
conversion in the dispersed phase, the viscosity increases strongly, like do the properties of the interfacial layers as well, and the density changes a bit, and a change in equilibrium takes place between
breakage and coalescence as it shifts more towards coalescence. As a result, the PSD becomes wider
with a larger particle size. This phase is known as the sticky phase. During this phase a lack of
suspension stabilizer leads to a total instability. For a successful EPS suspension system, it is crucial
to find a suitable stabilizer system, flow conditions and procedures for shifting the particle size into
right direction. [21]
41

Jani Korkiamäki

Particle Size Control and PSD
Suspension polymerization yields more or less, a wide PSD [21]. Manufacturer’s interest is pointed
towards manipulating the PSD to satisfy the market requirements. The narrower the PSD the better
[21]. Some procedures that have been invented for particle size control listed below.
•

Controlling of the average diameter by using pickering stabilizer systems, such as TCP, in
combination with an extender, such as ABS.

•

Particle size control with the use and different timing of macromolecular suspension stabilizers, such as PVP, PVA.

•

Final PSD control by geometric factors of the reactor and the hydrodynamic conditions
affecting the drop break-up and coalescence during the suspension polymerization. More
specifically, these include agitator type and dimensions, vessel geometry, operating parameters and the stirrer speed.

•

Through sudden or stepwise reduction of stirrer speed during polymerization when pickering stabilizers are used [21].

Stabilizing Agents and Mechanism
Typical suspension stabilizers used in EPS manufacture are surface active and water-soluble macromolecules. Common stabilizers include:
•

PVA (poly(vinyl alcohol)),

•

HEC (hydroxyethylcellulose),

•

PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidine),

•

natural products, such as insoluble organic powders, such as TCP (tricalcium phosphate),
also known as ‘pickering stabilizer’, mostly in combination with surfactants called extenders
[21],

Surface-active macromolecules suit best for stabilization of large particles (e.g. PVA, PVP, gelatin,
alginate, carboxy- or hydroxyethylcellulose, etc.). The reason to this is the large thickness of the
adsorption layer and a multitude of good attachment points of the hydrophobic chains in the monomer
drops. The scope of the forces of the macromolecular absorption layer is often larger than the effect
of the electrical interactive forces. In general, the preferred macromolecules have a more or less
blocky structure with one block or group has a hydrophobic nature acting as an anchoring component
on the droplet surface, while the other block or group needs to be good solvate with water and provide
the steric repulsion, together giving a train-loop chain arrangement. According to HVO (developed
by Hesselink, Vrij, and Overbeek) theory “the steric repulsive force penetrating adsorption layers
during anchoring of two particles can be essentially be attributed to the change in the volume restriction effect of macromolecules in the area of tails and the osmotic at its additional anchoring”
[21]. High molecular weight chains such as gelatin, alginate and carboxy- or hydroxyethylcellulose,
42

Jani Korkiamäki
also known as protective colloids, give high viscosity in the water phase and a good protection against
coalescence. [21]
The pickering systems consist of water soluble inorganic solid particles and an amphiphilic cosurfactant (a.k.a. extender). TCP with an average diameter in the range of 0.2-0.4 µm in the form of inorganic powder. ABS (sodium alkylbenzenesulfonate) is often used as an extender. The stabilizing
mechanism is based on the ability of the solid particles to form mechanical barrier between the monomer drops that reduces the probability for coalescence [21].

Polymerization and Impregnation Process
Polymerization
The polymerization process is usually carried out in two or more stages (see Figure 17). In the first
stage, the final particles are formed, and in the second stage a blowing agent that penetrates the beads
is added. The residual monomer concentration that is required, normally < 1000 ppm, is preferably
the determining factor for the duration of the second polymerization stage. In both stages, initiators
with suitable decomposition characteristics are used to initiate the polymerization. The reaction progression probability greatly depends on the monomer conversion reactions. The viscosity of the dispersed phase is low during the first stage and the quantity of styrene is sufficiently high, the decomposition process of peroxides occurs only up to benzoyloxy radical, with the ability to start a kinetic
chain reaction directly. The purely thermal initiation of chain formation with reactive dimers to styrene (Diels-Alder) reaction can be ignored in suspension polymerization due to low temperatures, in
contrary to the bulk styrene processing. Two common peroxides that are used in EPS manufacture
in order to complete the polymer conversion are:
1) BPO (dibenzoyl peroxide) for initiating the first stage of polymerization at a temperature of
circa 90 °C,
2) TBPB (tert-butyl peroxybenzoate) for initiating the second stage of polymerization in the
temperature range of 115-130 °C [1]. TBEC is very popular amongst EPS producers these
days. Another possibility is TAEC (tert-amylperoxy-2-ethyl) [21].
The kinetic reaction route with constant reaction of the polymer/monomer droplet starts to dominate
relatively quickly with conversion, resulting in decrease of the mobility of the polymer chain rapidly
below the mobility of the monomer. This will cause a reduction of live polymer chains in the droplet,
which will reduce the rate of termination of polymerization. This can be linked to drastic increase in
the numbers of radicals that will cause a rapid increase in the polymerization rate. This phenomenon
is known as the gel effect (Trommsdorf). The gel effect results in growth of the polymer chain length
and broadening of the MWD. In order to decrease the viscosity at this stage of polymerization requires either continuous or stepped temperature increase. Addition of small amounts of bifunctional
monomers or chain transfer agents (ktr > 2) will also result in more desirable MWD (flat low Mw side
43

Jani Korkiamäki
and sharply decreasing high Mw flank). The preferred procedure is to add chain transfer agents later
before the gel effect ends. [21]
The result of a low concentration of branched macromolecules should result in higher melt flow rate
during the pre-foaming step of the EPS beads. There is literature that states that earlier addition of
blowing agent reduces viscosity of the droplets. Hamielec and co-workers have pointed out that temperature increase, while simultaneously, earlier addition of blowing agent, n-pentane, with monofunctional initiators lead to a limited conversion and plasticizing effect by pentane, resulting in enhanced coalescence and total instability of suspension. They suggested that by using bifunctional
initiators in which enhanced coalescence is totally overcome due to the very short duration of the
particle growth and high polymerization rates. On the other hand, towards the end of the polymerization the chance for primer radical to initiate polymerization is reduced. The amount of highly reactive benoyloxy radicals that can react with the polymer chain under abstraction of hydrogen will
increase with the consequent formation of benzene. This has led to substitution of tertBuPB with an
initiator without aromatic groups, such as TBEC. Another interesting replacement of TBPB is TAEC
(e.g. Luperox TAEC). This initiator’s radicals have slightly faster decomposition rates, better diffusion into the high conversion matric of an EPS particle, and better selectivity for adding styrene
monomer. [21]

Figure 17. A traditional temperature-time regime for a two-stage polymerization process of EPS
[21].
Impregnation
The process step of addition of a blowing agent is called impregnation. It is possible to add the
blowing agent to the batch before or during the suspension polymerization [21]. In this work, the
blowing agent, pentane, is added during the process. It is also possible to incorporate the agent into
polystyrene that has been re-suspended into water [21]. Too early addition of blowing agent has the
disadvantage of stunting polymerization due to a dilution effect. In practice, addition of the blowing
agent after the polymerization is only used for the recycling of waste materials and side bead fraction
(not for sale). Impregnation of the blowing agent at conversion between 65-85 % is currently the
44

Jani Korkiamäki
norm for commercial EPS production. Procedures with addition of the blowing agent at about 66 %
conversion, the moment when PS particles surpasses the density of the water phase are preferred
[21].
Blowing agents in use are halogen free CnHm compounds with n = 4-6, such as n-butane, isopentane,
n-pentane, neopentane and hexane. Mixtures of iso- and n-pentane, however, are preferred for standard EPS production. Both pentane isomers have considerably different diffusion rates at a given temperature. If the content of isopentane is high, the pre-foamed beds are able to expand over a long
period of time during temporary storage, but on the other hand, also longer cooling times are required
for the demolding process. The correct composition of pentane mixture is always a compromise between good foamability and fast diffusion behavior [21].
The reactor’s pressure increases and its progression during impregnation depend on conversion time
and the temperatures of the added pentane and the composition of the pentane mixture. Later addition
of pentane leads to an asymptotic decrease of pressure which conforms with the Fickian diffusion.
In the case of n-pentane, it has been shown that when it is added in suspension, the diffusion into the
periphery of the beads occurs first rapidly to almost a completely pentane uptake, and stalls afterwards (depending on the degree of conversion). If the addition of pentane occurs at 60-70 % conversion, the following two effects are noticed: an increase in pressure because of arranged loss of
soluble styrene with increasing conversion, and a decrease in pressure due to increased diffusion of
pentane into the beads. The equilibrium pressure for the quaternary system styrene–polystyrene–
isopentane–n-pentane has been calculated by Wolfart for different conversions, temperatures and n/isopentane ratios [21].
The expansion capacity can be influenced by adjusting the pentane concentration in the beads [21].
Typically, standard EPS contains 5.5-6.5 wt-% pentane, and low-pentane types less than 4.5 %
[21,47].

Additives
Either during or at the end of EPS manufacture additives are often incorporated into the beads in
order to improve process and application properties. Additives that appear in EPS products include:
•

nucleation agents,

•

flame retardants,

•

fast-cool agents,

•

anti-lump and anti-static agents,

•

stabilizers,

•

plasticizers,

•

pigments, etc. [21]
45

Nucleation Agents
Substances that can initiate and control cell formation and growth are called nucleation agents, and
these substances are often incorporated into the polymeric structure on purpose for cell control. Still,
some unwanted nucleation effects can appear from other substances such as water, suspension stabilizer or HBCD (hexabromocyclodecane). It is important that nucleation agents have the ability to
control nucleation independently without disturbances of other effects and to mask the bubble initiation of other sources. Examples of nucleation agents appearing in EPS industry include paraffins,
chloroparaffins, Fischer-Tropsch waxes, and also esters and amides of fatty acids. In addition, finely
divided phase-incompatible polymers, such as low-molecular weight PE, are used for cell control
(above its melting point, low-molecular weight PE is soluble in styrene) [21].
Flame-Retardant Agents
Small quantities of certain additives are used for fire retardation in EPS that markedly improve the
behavior of the foam in the presence of mild fire sources. Traditionally bromine compounds, and in
general, with at least two bromine atoms and a bromine content higher than 40 wt %, basically a
suitable linear aliphatic brominated organic compound and a bromo-substituted cycloalkane. The
final product should contain 0.6-3 wt % bromine. The flame retardation is intensified by using synergists, that enables usage of much less of bromine containing compounds. The most common synergist is DCP, and other alternatives include less volatile and more temperature stable -C-C initiators,
such as 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-diphenylbutane [21]. HBCD was a very common bromine-based flame retardant, but as well as other bromine-containing compounds, the usage has started to become restricted due to environmental concerns. For example, in Europe, the usage of HBCD is completely
prohibited [48]. A new replacement, pFR (polymeric flame retardant), was brought to the global
market by Dow Global Technologies LLC (DGTL). The key advantage is that pFR is a plastic itself
like EPS, is not water soluble and will not be taken up by organisms. In addition, it can maintain the
reaction fire properties while other desirable properties such as thermal conductivity and mechanical
strength are unchanged [46]. Currently, fire retardation is one of the most important field of studies
for foams and much effort is set on finding alternative flame retardants for the existing ones.

Coatings
Poor processing characteristics would follow from untreated surface of EPS beads. A number of
coating components are used to improve characteristics such as foaming, aging, blocking performance and the final application performance of the foam. PS beads and pre-foamed particles often
tend to acquire various quantities of static charge. These charges are often long lasting, causing agglomeration. In order to avoid this, anti-static agents are added before or after screening. Besides to
the flowability problems during the finishing steps, the static charges impact negatively the homogeneous filling of block forms and, especially, the molding equipment. Many effective anti-static
agents in use include small quantities of esters of fatty acids and amines, quaternary ammonium salts,
alkylphosphates, and fatty alcohol with ethylene oxide on propylene oxide. [21]
Compounds that protect against the propensity of particles to fuse together during the prefoaming
process at temperatures above the transition temperature are called anti-lumping agents. Utilized
anti-lumping agents include, for example, metal stearates, inorganic powders (e.g., SiO2 and CaCO3),
and powders of polymeric materials (e.g. polyamide waxes). These agents can influence the fusion
quality during molding, and the concentration and the composition should be adapted to in both steps
in foam production. [21]
Modern EPS types have been, and are also in the future, developed to so that molding operation
capacity is improved providing short aging and cooling times. External fast-cooling agents are commonly a various mixture of glyceride esters of higher fatty acids, usually with carbon chain lengths
in the range of 14-20. It is assumed that the cooling effect time reduction is because of the formation
of fine canals in the bead surface which allows faster diffusion of pentane out of the beads. The more
rapid loss of pentane during the pre-foaming process generally leads to foamability loss with a reduction in cooling time. As a result, the balance between both properties must be matched to suit the
desired application. The cooling time is more important than the increase in density and thickness of
the foam. Properties of different particle sizes for different applications are provided by variating
compositions and concentrations of components in a mixture. [21]

5.2.2 Pre-Foaming Process or Pre-Expansion Process
In the pre-foaming stage, the EPS beads are heated by saturated steam to above the Tg of PS, at the
temperatures of between 80-100 °C, in a pre-foamer [8,21]. This causes the in the PS matrix dissolved
blowing agent, typically pentane, to expand and boiling off the EPS beads, and as a result a system
of spherical systems are formed [8,21]. During this stage, the EPS bead volume can increase by a
factor 40-80.

5.2.3 Maturation or Conditioning
The pre-foamed beds are cooled after the pre-expansion stage. As a result, the remaining blowing
agent (about 4 wt-% pentanes, and air at atmospheric pressure) in the EPS cells condenses and creates
a vacuum in the beads [8,21]. In this stage the particles are very brittle. A definite time for maturation
is required in order to avoid problems in the molding stage [21]. The pre-foamed are usually stored
in aerated fabric silos (large fabric storage bags) [8,21]. During the maturation, process air penetrates
the cells, and eventually, the internal pressure of the cells approaches atmospheric pressure [21]. The
beads are also dried at the same time [8]. If the foam is heated again, the expansion will go further,
and can be used for a second or third expansion process in a continuous pre-foamer, or directly in
final molding process [21].

5.2.4 Final Foaming Procedures
From temporary storage the pre-foamed beads are entered molding stage [8,21]. The beads are
welded into a homogeneous foam in a perforated mold by a renewed steam supply. The foaming
occurs in molds, molding machines or special units (slab units, belt units). The different stages in
molding can be divided into mold filling, steaming, cooling and demolding [21]. Steam is injected
into the mold, and the beads are allowed to expand further, melt together and fill the mold fully. The
system is cooled after a completed foaming process. The expanded beads are molded either into foam
blocks or uniquely shaped products such as food boxes, waffle pods, packaging materials, etc. [8].

6 Environmental Aspects, Sustainability,
and Recycling/Recovery of EPS
6.1 Environmental Aspects
Environmental legislation is constantly developing in the world, affecting EPS along many other
materials. For instance, the packaging industry in Europe has been in the crosshairs of the tightening
legislation (Packaging and Packaging Waste – 94/62/EC) [2]. Targets for the recycling of all packing
materials have been established. However, thanks to intensive cooperation in the EPS industry and
shared information on recycling and best practices, in most European countries the levels of recycling
are already exceeding targets and are amongst highest of any plastic materials [2]. EPS and PS is
relatively inert in landfills which is positive, but dumping it is costly and consumes a lot the landfill
capacity (EPS highly voluminous) [2,6]. Regulations of volatile organic compound (VOC) are also
a potential threat to EPS industry, especially since the most used blowing agent pentane for EPS has
a critical global warming potential (GWP), potentially leading to extra taxes [48]. Luckily, the ozone
depletion potential (ODP) is low for pentane [21], unlike for chlorofluorocarbon-based blowing
agents, such as CFC and HCFC [21]. The brominated HBCD was used for decades as a proven flame
retardant in EPS insulation materials but have been prohibited in Europe since 2016 due to environmental concerns [39,49]. After years of research and development a polymeric flame retardant, pFR,
that was able to replace HBCD was invented. pFR is not bioaccumulative or toxic, and hence, is a
sustainable option for flame retardation in EPS [50].

6.2 Sustainability and Life Cycle Assessment of
EPS
Evaluating environmental impact of EPS as a packaging or insulation material include many aspects.
It is necessary to take into consideration its application performance, environmental impact during
itslifecycle, and end-of-life options [51]. A good environmental performance of products has become
an asset for manufacturers. This is the reason for industries to investigate and find ways to operate
with minimal effect on the environment. One tool that is used to measure the environmental impact
of a product is life-cycle analysis or life-cycle assessment (LCA). A significant amount of time and
resources have been invested in LCA by the EPS industry [52]. A number of studies and reports have
been made to promote facts about EPS and its environmental implications, especially for EPS packaging and insulation. The most obvious advantage of EPS in regard of sustainability, and for making
it a unique material, is its effect relative to its low material consumption (98% air, 2% PS) [29]. A
typical life cycle of an EPS product (packaging) from “cradle to grave” can be seen in Figure 18.
EPS materials consume fossil fuels in the production of plastic materials and its blowing agent (pentane), in processing, finishing, and transportation. Crude oil and natural gas are also used for raw
material inputs. The production and transportation processes also consume energy and emit emissions, such as greenhouse gases [53]. The manufacturing emissions can be categorized into solid
wastes, airborne emissions, and waterborne emissions [54]. The energy consumed and the emissions
produced can be seen as “investments”. Energy savings and emission reductions can be seen as “dividends” or return on investments (ROI) of the energy used and emissions produced for the production
and transportation of the product [53]. For example, the use of EPS foam insulation in walls increases
the R-value of the walls drastically, and hence, saves energy and reduces greenhouse gas emissions
over the total life of the building by reducing the energy needed for heating or cooling [52,53]. In
fact, structural insulated panels have been estimated to have an energy payback period of less than
17 months and a recapture of greenhouse gas emissions in less than 10 months. The total return in
investment is due to the long lifespan of insulation materials (e.g. in a building 50-100 years) and
ability to reduce energy consumption needs [53]. In addition, insulation materials can be recycled
again after use. For EPS packaging, EPS industry alliance states that:

50

Jani Korkiamäki
•

water and air emissions can be reduced by 2-9 % (with increasing recycling content atmospheric and waterborne emissions decrease or remain the same),

•

energy use 3-14 % (with increased recycling content, energy use decreases), and

•

solid waste 5-21 % net reduction (with recycling, increases in industrial waste are offset by
larger decreases in post-consumer waste) [52].

Figure 18. Lifecycle of an EPS packaging [54].
EUMEPS states that the EPS manufacturing process is energy efficient. The manufacture of EPS
overall requires less energy than the manufacture of “ecological alternatives” such as mineral foam
and wood fiber due to the low input of raw material (98 % air, 2 % PS) and the energy-efficient
manufacturing process. A comparative table of total energy requirements in production processes of
certain materials in an insulation for ETICS, including the total renewable and non-renewable
(“fossil”) primary as well as from secondary sources, in the Table 10 below [55].

Eco-properties of EPS are excellent. The Table 11 below summarizes an analysis of the current EPD
regarding three different values “Input of Non-Renewable Primary Energy (PED n.r.)”, “Global
Warming Potential (GWP100)” and “Acidification Potential (AP)” which are summarized in the
∆OI3 index (the lower the value the better) and shows that EPS is very close to the “ecological
alternatives” mineral foam and wood fiber [55].

6.3 Recycling of EPS – Reduction, Re-Use, Recycling & Recovery
6.3.1 Introduction
The impression that EPS can’t be recycled is persistent [2]. Even though it is true that EPS recycling
involve many technological challenges, EPS is these days among one of the most recycled plastics
[2,6]. The low weight of EPS is an advantage during its use but can be disadvantageous for its recycling. The highly voluminous material can be difficult to transport over any distance. A typical (12
m) container with uncompacted EPS is filled with less than half a ton of material, which is not economical for transport. However, EPS industry and companies have invested in densification machinery and effective collection in order to ensure that recycling is viable [2]. The high cost of landfilling
EPS waste and high transportation cost associated with low bulk density of EPS materials, and public
opinion have been major driving forces for development of EPS recycling strategies [6].
EPS can be recycled several times without significant deterioration and it usually starts with grinding
the EPS which can be recycled either as EPS or PS (the air is removed) [56]. However, the small
margin in price between virgin and recycled EPS represses the desire for recycling [6]. Post-industrial
waste consists of recycled EPS facility scrap that will never serve its planned purpose. This waste
can be directly recycled by grinding and be combined with virgin material during EPS production.
Any EPS material that is recycled after its planned use is referred to as post-commercial and postconsumer recycling [51].
A lot of research has been done working on recycling of EPS waste and some of the proposed available methods include melt extrusion, pyrolysis and solvent dissolution [57]. Among the first and
second method there is still some significant disadvantages. In melt extrusion high temperatures up
to the degradation temperature are required, and in pyrolysis, the styrene extraction from pyrolytic
products is difficult, the process from polystyrene to styrene is complicated, and the cost of production is very high, and as a result, more and more attention is given to solvent dissolution [57]. Solvent
recycling is also the goal in this work, in which the EPS or PS materials are recycled or re-used by
directly dissolving them back into the suspension polymerization of EPS manufacturing process
without any extraction and filtration steps. More specifically of different recycling activities in the
Chapter 6.4 Recycling and Recovery Technologies.

6.3.2 Recycling Rates
Recycling rates of EPS around the globe have increased drastically during the last decades, while the
rates continue to grow more moderately, but still steadily today. For example, in United States the
post-consumer EPS recycling increased from 1.7 % in 1990 to 30 % by the end of 2012. In Japan the
recycling rates of EPS grew from 12.6 % in 1991 to 87.5 % by the end of 2009 (mechanical 56.8 %,
thermal 30.7 %), which is also the highest recycling rate in the world. In South Korea the rate increased from 33.1 % in 1996 to 75.1 % by the end of 2011. However, the recycling rates in some
countries are still not at desired levels. For example, in Australia recycling rate during 2011-2012
was only 6.9 % (2,775 tons collected and recycled), and in Brazil recycling rate grew from only 6.7
% in 2007 to 9.3 % by the end of 2009 [8]. More recent EUMEPS (the association for European
Manufacturers of Expanded Polystyrene) estimated data shows that in Europe total amount of EPS
waste (construction and packaging) was 527 kilotons in 2017. Of the total amount EPS waste, energy
was recovered of 40 % of the waste, 26 % was recycled, and 32 % was disposed in landfills. For
comparison, the total amount of waste in 2009 was 498 kilotons, of which the corresponding rates
were 35 %, 20.6 % and 43 % [56]. The recycling rates in the U.S., which have since 1991 demonstrated consistent growth, are indicated to continue an upward trend in the future thanks to newer
EPS recycling technologies to facilitate EPS collection and reprocessing launched in 2018. Recycling
is driven by market shifts and commodity price fluctuations, and the decline in recycling rates in
2017 was due to China’s import restrictions that had severe impacts on all recyclables [42]. Comparative figures (Figure 19 & 20) below of Europe’s and the Northern region’s recycling situation, and
the recycling development in the U.S. from 1990 to recent years below (Figure 19-23) in the Chapter

6.4. Recycling and Recovery Technologies
6.4.1 Densification of EPS Foam
Densification or compacting of the EPS foam is one of the most important part of the most EPS
recycling processes in order to effectively transport, meter and convey it. Densification of EPS is
partially or completely collapsing the cell structure. Expelling the air from the cells is crucial in
obtaining the desired bulk density increase of the material. The biggest problem with densification
is the polymer and property degradation. This occurs since most of the densification methods utilize
melting or compression of the foam by means such as hot air, IR lamps, friction, heated rotatory
drum etc. One typical example of densifications systems is a system that employ only hydraulic
pressure and no heat. These systems, such as a pellet mill, can convert EPS up to densities of 400
kg/m3 without material degradation (caused by heat). The non-thermal EPS with no applied heating
result produce PS blocks in such a density range that 20 ton of densified material can be carried in a
single truck. Another possibility is to use baling devices in order to increase the bulk density of EPS
for protective foam packaging. The bulk density can be increased from 15 to 30 kg/m3 with a typical
downstroke baler. With horizontal baler units, however, it is possible to produce densities as high as
250-400 kg/m3 but problems with cleaning of the recycled content can be very difficult. Hence, all
contaminants should be removed before the bailing process [6].

6.4.2 Size Reduction of Waste EPS
The simplest approach in EPS recycling is to reduce the size of the foam. Size-reduction of scrapexpanded PS from packaging can be utilized in production of graded PS foam fragments. PS foam
fragments produced vary between 1-50 mm depending on which type of rotary cutter is used. Different size grades are used for different applications. Typical examples with demands in different
size ranges are lightweight concrete (1-4 mm), soil improvers (4-8 mm), composting aids (6-12 mm),
field drainages (8-25 mm) and cladding drainage pipes (25-50 mm) [6].

6.4.3 Mechanical Recycling
Post-consumer PS foam is often shipped to mechanical recycling facilities in bags by semi-trailers.
The EPS waste is first unloaded and inspected and manually sorted in order to remove contaminants
such as paper, metals, other polymers and food. After this the polymer is grounded into powder and
transferred to washing and drying processes. The drying of the powder is done by centrifugal drying
followed by convective heat drying. Finally, an extruder is used to compress and heat the powder up
to circa 205 °C. Since EPS foam consists mainly of pure PS, it may be recycled by means of compacting, melting and degassing. This is obtained with commercial rotary compacting and sintering
machines. Twin screw machines are also utilized for degassing. In mechanical reprocessing of waste
PS, it is crucial that the material suffers as little as possible shear (a function of the screw geometry)
and short residence times. In addition, it is important to perform the degassing of the melt adequately,
and to automatically filter the contaminants. Mechanically recycled PS application utilization include
building insulation, egg cartons, coat hangers, etc. [6]
Recycling systems that directly convert EPS foam into purified, degassed granules that can be used
directly in the production of new EPS (e.g., Erema systems). In the beginning, the system densifies
the EPS foam in a shredder drum and meters this into a single screw vented extruder with melt filtration and degassing facilities. The molten PS is then transferred from the extruder into a dynamic
mixer for degassing. These systems are especially attractive for EPS packaging and insulation [6].
Mechanical recycling is not always problem free. There is some risk for degradation of the polymer
during mechanical processing due to localized over-heating in the densifying process or because of
the heat histories during re-compounding. This results in discoloration (yellowing) and formation of
odor due to the formation of aldehydic degradation products. Discoloration is particularly problematic with flame retardants containing EPS products. In addition, degradation and corrosion problems
can occur during processing due to additives such as halogens [6].

6.4.4 Solvent Recycling
Usually in dissolution processes or solvent recycling, the polymeric material is first dissolved and
afterwards different processes are applied in order to recover the polymer and the solvent. The applying of solvents in recycling of foamed polymers such as EPS offer some advantages. For example,
insoluble contaminants can be removed by filtration enabling the clean polymer to be further reprocessed. In addition, selective dissolution process allows separating plastics from other types of nonsoluble waste and polymers depending on their chemical nature [58]. Finally, dissolution of the foam
in suitable solvent will results in remarkable volume reduction up to volume reductions of more than
100 times without degradation of polymer chains, reducing transport costs [9,58].
58

Jani Korkiamäki
Dissolution of PS in several different solvents, such as toluene, xylene, benzene chloroform, acetone,
cyclohexane, butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, d-limonene, terpinenen, terpinolene,
p-cymene, and phellandrene, has been studied [58]. It is generally well known that some aromatic
compounds, such as d-limonene, are good solvents of PS foams [9]. The proposed processes for
solvent/polymer separating in PS recycling include dissolution-precipitation, separation by supercritical extraction, and solvent evaporation. For solvent vaporization, there are studies reporting the
use of steam distillation, vacuum evaporation, vacuum distillation, and drying in a drum dryer [58].
A couple of promising solvent recycling applications for PS or EPS are presented later in this chapter.
Dissolution times and solubilities of PS in different solvents below in Table 12.

Table 12. Comparative table of Merrifield resin swelling and rate of polystyrene dissolution times
in different solvents [35].

d-limonene
EPS can be recycled by dissolving it into limonene. Limonene is a biodegradable solvent derived
from citrus fruits. The solvent is sprayed on EPS foam, degassed, and converted to a gel with a higher
density (volume reduces up to 90 %). D-limonene dissolves EPS safely and without significant degradation of the performance properties. In gel-like form the PS material transportation is much more
efficient since larger quantities can be transported to recycling plants. The gel can be purified by
filtration through screen filters that removes contaminations such as dirt particles and other polymers
that are not soluble in the solvent. After filtration PS is precipitated with another solvent (a nonsolvent in reality) to the mixture. Finally, centrifuging is used to separate the two solvents and PS.
PS is then degassed, and the solvents are circulated back to the process. The final product can be
converted back to PS or EPS by PS recyclers. Solvent recycling enables economical recycling of
foamed PS boxes used in food, catering and horticultural industries [6].

Styrene
EPS can be recycled by dissolving it into its monomer, styrene [59]. There is for example patents
mentioning the possibility to use PS/EPS dissolved into styrene in suspension polymerization
[11,12]. EPS recycling in suspension polymerization process is also the major goal in this project.
However, no filtration of the insoluble components or extraction of EPS, which is typical for solvent
recycling, will be present.

PolyStyreneLooP
PolyStyreneLoop is a new physico-chemical recycling process for construction PS foam based on
CreaSolv® Technology combined with the destruction of HBCD (legislated contaminant) [60,61].
A specific proprietary solvent formulation is used to selectively dissolve plastic wastes. The pretreating technology has the potential to recover high quality PS recyclate that can be used as raw material
for EPS production and separate it from legislated additives (e.g. HBCD). PSLoop applies recent
technology (Creacycle) and propriety solvent. In contrast to the alternatives tested in the past, the
solvent is not carcinogenic or flammable. PSLoop is superior from environmental, health, safety and
technical perspective compared to the alternatives in the past. These include processes such as Polystyvert and the Sony process based upon limonene. These processes have not been able to separate
HBCD from PS at levels less than 100 ppm of HBCD in the recycled PS [61]. The process consists
of following three steps, in which the steps 1 and 2 are pre-treatment for step 3 [60]:

60

Jani Korkiamäki

1. “PS foam waste is dissolved in tanks containing a PS-specific liquid. The solid impurities
(dirt, cement and the like) are separated through filtration and then incinerated.”
2. “Another liquid is added, which transforms the PS into a gel, while the additive (HBCD)
stays in the remaining liquid. The PS gel is then separated from the process liquids. Once
cleaned, this gel is transferred into granulated polymer and the liquid, together with the additive, is distilled and re-used in a closed loop; the additives remain as sludge”
3. “Finally, the HBCD additive within the sludge is destructed in a high temperature incineration process. During this last step the elemental bromine is recovered and can be reused to
produce new products (e.g. modern flame retardants), thereby closing the loop.”

Figure 24. A schematic demonstration of PSLoop process [39].

6.4.5 Depolymerization (Pyrolysis)
Pyrolysis is the most well-known method for depolymerization of PS and EPS into styrene monomer.
Still, the resulting yields are relatively low and carbonization yields are high. A large amount of coke
and gas with little commercial value is produced during pyrolysis However, some techniques have
been invented to make the pyrolysis recycling of PS more efficient. For example, by dissolving PS
in heavy oil has been found to reduce coke and gas formation, and the yields of distillation. It has
been found that waste PS decomposes completely to distillate products at 400 °C in the presence of
heavy oil (Mars et al). When waste motor oil was used as a medium, the resulting distillate contained
styrene monomer (52 wt-%), methyl-styrene (19.5 wt-%), toluene (13.6 wt-%), ethyl benzene (11.7
wt-%) and cumene (3.3 wt-%). These products are valuable chemical intermediates in new polymer
manufacture. While dry pyrolysis of PS leads to considerable loss of PS to gas and coke formation,
for example in temperature range 470-600 °C using screw-type reactor large amounts of hydrocarbon
gas is produced, in heavy oil pyrolysis of PS can be done at lower temperatures resulting in lower
formation of low-molecular weight gases. The heavy oil method also does not require hydrogen gas
61

Jani Korkiamäki
or high pressures that are crucial for hydrogenation recycling process (Anderson and Berger). Another approach is to use acid or basic catalysts to improve pyrolysis yields of styrene and to reduce
carbonization from the pyrolysis of PS. Liquids composed of mostly styrene and dimer (90 %) have
been managed to produce with the help of catalysts at 350 °C (Zhang et al) [6].

6.4.6 Energy Recovery
Incineration with energy recovery of PS waste is viable when volumes of PS waste are not economically profitable for mechanical recycling operations. It is also justified if the energy consumed in
collection, sorting and transporting recycled PS exceeds the energy needs in virgin production. Even
though burning PS in open air produces copious amounts of sooty black smoke, in modern incinerators operating at temperatures around 1000 °C the burning is complete with no significant amounts
of ash or soot. PS has a caloric content of 46 000 kJ/kg beating that of heating oil (44 000 kJ/kg). In
practice, this means that one kilogram of EPS foam is equivalent to 1.2-1.4 liters of fuel air. This has
led to a practice where some large users of EPS use ground scrap and offcuts for steam generation.
Halogenated fire retardant containing EPS foam from construction insulations have a very little effect
on the composition of the exhaust gases from EPS combustion itself [6].

7 Solubility Experimentation
7.1 Purpose and Guidelines
Even though it is still unclear how and if the off-spec EPS will be utilized in suspension polymerization in BEWI Synbra Raw’s EPS manufacture, the time needed for complete dissolution of EPS
into MS is a very important information. Solubility experiments were done as preliminary tests as
guiding EPS dissolution times for polymerization experimentation. However, as earlier stated, preliminary solubility tests in water suspension were impractical. A conclusion was drawn that the extent and time required to fully dissolve EPS in suspension could be determined more effectively
directly in the suspension polymerization process. It seemed that inadequate dissolvement disturbs
the polymerization and increases the particle size and oversized off spec formation (e.g. 5 % EPS
dissolved in suspension for 30 minutes versus 15 min, Figure 51).

7.2 Description of the Procedure
Two different BEWI Synbra RAW’s EPS qualities, namely
•

standard EPS off-spec material made with traditional suspension polymerization, upper (K110) and lower (K-1310), which are still chemically quite the same but differ in size, and

•

extruded recycled EPS material (fish-box material),

solubility into styrene was studied at different temperatures, namely
o

room temperature (c. 25 °C),

o

50 °C, and

o

70 °C,

with the following EPS mass concentrations (wt-%): 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30%. At least three parallel
samples were made of each concentration at the different temperatures. The two-component system
or mixture consisted of MS and EPS with a total weight of 180 grams. Targeted stirring speed was
500 rpm, but at higher concentrations of EPS such as over 20 %, the viscosity increase limited the
stirring speed to a range of 150-400 rpm, especially at room temperature. At 70°C the solution was
running enough without limitations in stirring speed, however, the mixing on the surface was nonexistent at all temperatures. Regarding solubility tests in this work in general, the capacity of the
magnetic stirrer was simply not adequate to stir the mixture, and the stirring magnet stagnated especially at higher EPS concentrations except for at 70 °C.

63

The progress of dissolvement was determined visually, which was problematic, naturally. Hence this,
the obtained results were treated only as guiding results. The standard for fully dissolved state was a
clear liquid/mixture without obvious EPS particles present. The solubility times were collected, and
an average time of the parallel samples were calculated. A mobile phone camera was used as an
accessory in order to visualize the dissolvement and to help determine the time needed to reach the
fully dissolved state. The temperature was adjusted manually with the help of a thermometer and a
thermostat, and heat fluctuation was impossible to avoid. An estimation for the heat fluctuation is +/5°C of the desired temperature.
The initial plan was to test the solubility of the EPS into MS in water suspension, too, but it was
practically impossible to reliably discern if EPS had been dissolved or not in the MS drops visually.
The assumption was that the dissolution will take longer in water suspension’s MS droplets than in
pure MS. Some testing for maximum solubility of off-spec EPS into MS was also done, but the
information from patents mentioning the possibility to use up to 30 % dissolved EPS in styrene were
used as a base for the upper end of the test scale [11,12]. In addition, according to previous tests at
BEWI Synbra Group 30% of EPS had been managed to dissolve into MS.
The actual dissolution system included a 400 ml beaker, a magnetic stirrer plate with a thermostat, a
stirring magnet, thermometer (not at room temperature) and a baffle(s). The system was either totally
open or semi-open with a folio cap, leading to evaporation of styrene especially in higher temperatures. Tests at 50 and 70 °C were carried out in a system (Picture 1, System 1) with two baffles, in
which the thermometer acted as one baffle and a plastic stick as another. The tests at room temperature were carried out in a system (Picture 2, System 2) with only one baffle, a glass rod, in the middle
of the beaker. A different system at room temperature was used since the tests were run parallel with
the tests at 50 °C in order to save time. However, the System 2 should have been made as identical
regarding reactor geometry as possible with the System 1 in order to obtain results falling in line
better with the other system. It is also important to mention that the magnetic stirring plate used at
room temperature was more effective than the other magnetic stirrer used for 50 and 70 °C, which
was useful since the viscosity is higher for the non-warmed mixture. The main reasons for baffle
installments was to mimic real batch reactors in EPS production, to gain more homogeneous and
improved agitation, and to prevent air bubble formation, which would make the follow up of the
dissolvement significantly harder. Finally, while the brownish extruded recycled material dissolves
into MS, it will color the mixture, and in this way may complicate the follow up of dissolution.

7.3.2 Discussion
Dissolution of EPS into MS results in a viscous and sticky gel-like solution. The higher the EPS
content the higher the viscosity, naturally. The solution tends to make a mess, to plasticize and to
form layers on surfaces and containers. The following problems may arise especially at higher concentrations of EPS such as 20 or more wt-% and low temperatures significantly slowing down the
dissolution of the highly viscous and sticky mixture:
•

tendency for coalescence and to stick together into lumps, and

•

uneven agitation and agitation problems in general, especially at the surface and top set bed
(formation of surface layer and particle float on the surface).

The points discussed above were highlighted at room temperature since the viscosity is even higher
at lower temperatures. Still, up to 30% of EPS qualities were successfully dissolved into MS at room
temperature, at 50°C and 70°C. All the solubility experimentation data and comparison of the proportions of the dissolution times of EPS qualities’ to each other are gathered in the tables in the
Appendix Dissolution data section.
The obtained results were in general somewhat consistent and logical, but not completely. The undersized off-spec EPS dissolved the fastest, which was expected since it was in a much finer, almost
sand-like form, compared to oversized off-spec and extruded recycled EPS. ERE dissolved in general
the second fastest and the HOF EPS the slowest. The ERE’s significantly lower MW value compared
to LOF and HOF EPS could explain the relatively good-natured dissolvement [59]. Figure 26 and
Table 14 collect all the average dissolution times for the different EPS qualities at different EPS wt% and temperatures. In general, as expected, an increase in temperature decreased the time needed
for complete dissolution [61]. However, there were some anomalies in which the dissolvement on
average was even slower at 70°C than 50°C as the Tables 21 and 22 show. According to the results
the average ratio between the dissolution times at 50°C and 70°C was 1 for HOF, which is weird to
say the least (see Table 22). In addition, regarding LOF and HOF EPS dissolution, there were inconsistencies with the evolution of dissolution times with increasing EPS mass concentration. In certain
cases, the dissolution times were decreasing with the increase in EPS wt-% (see Figures 27 and 28),
for example, LOF 5% versus 10% and LOF 10% versus 15%, and HOF 10 % versus 15 and 20 %.
The amount of variation was also relatively high in LOF and HOF samples, and especially at room
temperature as the Figure 26 and Table 15 shows.
There were many issues, aspects and inconsistencies in solubility experimentation that should be
taken into consideration while the results are examined:

72

Jani Korkiamäki
1. The dissolution system was either open or semi-open, and the evaporation most probably
affected the results strongly. For example, when 30% LOF was dissolved at 70°C, during a
time span of 1.58 hours (heating + dissolving) 10.54% of the total mass had vanished (18.95
g of the total mass of 180 g), or 15.04% of the total mass styrene in the system if it is assumed
that all of the evaporated mass was MS. The assumption that all evaporated mass was styrene
indicated that the evaporation rate of MS was 11.97 g/h and a decrease of 9.95 % in an hour.
These values are only guiding but prove the fact that evaporation was significant during the
solubility experimentation. On the other hand, this may be a positive sign that even more of
EPS can be dissolved into styrene since the loss of styrene in the course of time resulted in
higher EPS concentration, and still, the dissolvement seemed to be successful.
2. The extent of dissolution was determined visually which does not give reliable results. Many
different factors make it difficult to determine the state of dissolvement such as trapped air
bubbles, impurities and very fine EPS particles. There was no constant standard for a fully
dissolved state other than a visually relatively clear mixture.
3. The agitation was not adequate. The magnetic stirrer stagnated at higher concentrations as a
result of the highly viscous mixture, and the movement of the mass in the topset bed was
nonexistent. Especially at room temperature the viscous mixture may have impacted the dissolution in a negative way.
4. The heat fluctuation was significant with an estimation of a temperature range of +/- 5 °C of
the desired temperature.
Concluding remarks, and propositions regarding solubility experimentation in the future:
1) The experiments must be carried out in a closed vessel in order to restrict evaporation with
a powerful agitation. This will most probably help with the dissolvement remarkably and
better results can be achieved.
2) The evolution of dissolvement and the fully dissolved state must be monitored and defined
with the help of transmittance or viscosity measurement.
3) At least 30% of EPS can be dissolved into MS. However, another important question is if
the dissolution of EPS is carried out in MS-W suspension or in MS prior to suspension
polymerization of EPS. Since the dissolution time in MS-W suspension will presumably take
significantly longer times to occur, low concentrations of LOF EPS such as 10 wt-% or lower
could be dissolved in suspension. Other EPS qualities and especially higher EPS mass concentrations may be better to predissolve in a vessel. However, it all depends on how much
extra time BEWi is willing to add or invest in the production process.
4) A better automatic temperature control should be applied, probably automatic. The manual
temperature control with the help of a thermometer and thermostat was not very accurate.

8 Suspension Polymerization
Experimentation
8.1 Polymerization Procedure
8.1.1 Raw Materials, Chemicals and Additives
Raw materials, chemicals and additives used during EPS suspension polymerization experimentation in the Table 15 below.

Table 15. Raw materials, chemicals and additives used in the project.

8.1.2 Procedure and Operating Conditions
All the polymerizations during this project were done in laboratory scale, namely in a BR called the
M-reactor (M1). The M-reactor is equipped with two baffles, an agitator, an integral heating/cooling
system (oil), and a reaction vessel with a volume of 5-6 liters. The lid is tightly sealed not until the
impregnation step, and until this, the development of the suspension can be monitored, and samples
can be collected.
The mass relation of MS to W or MS+EPS to W, in other words polymerization medium to dispersion
medium, was kept constant during this project. The added EPS was treated as virgin MS as a polymer
building raw material, replacing a certain wt-% of virgin MS so that the mass of EPS+MS blend was
always equal with the amount of virgin MS in the reference batch(es). Hence, the amount of peroxides was also kept constant during this project. EPS was blended into MS by means of dissolution,
either directly by pre-dissolving the mixture in a glass bottle before charging the BR with ingredients,
or by directly dissolving it in suspension prior to the actual polymerization stage (Polymerization
74

Jani Korkiamäki
stage I). The EPS qualities that were used were the same that were used in solubility testing, K-110
(HOF), K-1310 (LOF) and extruded recycled EPS (fish box, ERE). However, mostly K-1310 and
ERE were used.
The process variables that were altered during this project were primarily the concentration of stabilization agents and the agitation speed. Changing the timing of the stabilizing agent A was also used
as option. The reactor is washed with toluene (dissolved) and water (rinsing) if the need arises (e.g.
excessive buildup, blockage, unsuccessful polymerization, etc.). The washing, and on the other hand
the repeatedly carried out polymerization batches with a “dirty” reactor, however, may have an impact on the resulting beads. Still, the fact that consecutive polymerization procedures without constantly washing of the reactor between batches is the norm in industrial scale, and is thus, considered
acceptable also in the laboratory scale, especially since the washing is very time consuming and the
time is limited.

8.2 EPS Bead Analyses
Residual monomer (RM) and molecular weight (MW) analyses were done for all the successfully
polymerized EPS batches. RM is an important indicator of the grade of polymerization, in other
words how much unreacted MS (nonconverted) is still present in the beads. The goal is generally to
reach RM values less than 1000 ppm. MW gives additional interesting information about the size of
the polymer chains in the EPS beads and how it differs in samples that are partly polymerized out of
reused EPS compared to the reference samples made purely out of virgin MS (tested with SEC). A
sample of all the successfully polymerized batches were sieved in order to find out the PSD and the
average particle size (d-50). Pentane content was also tested in samples that were potentially going
to be molded.

8.3 Preparation & Molding and Mechanical &
Thermal Testing
Some of the polymer batches were molded into foamed slabs or blocks in order to test the foaming
power, mechanical properties/strength and insulation properties (lambda). The chosen samples were
prepared by pre-foaming them and subsequently molding them into slabs. This was followed by
compression stress, bending strength and lambda testing. The compression stress was measured in
accordance with standard SFS-EN 826 and the bending strength with SFS-EN 12089.

8.4 Results and Discussion
8.4.1 General Overview
Besides the bead analyses, the table in Appendix (Table 26) summarizes and shows all the polymerization attempts during this project including both the successful and the failed ones. Maybe the most
importance during this project was stressed on PSD, the average particle size (d-50), and the amount
of formed off-spec EPS, especially undersized off-spec (LOF) EPS. Other particle sizes have more
value than others, while LOF EPS is the least desirable product giving the most technical problems
and having the lowest market value. The pentane content and MW related values of the different EPS
qualities used as polymerization raw materials measured with a spot test are collected in the Table
27 in Appendix. The pentane content in HOF EPS was higher than in LOF EPS, 4.00% versus 2.62%,
and the ERE pentane content was nonexistent, only 0.02%. The MW of ERE was lower than in LOF
and HOF EPS, 156516 g/mol (ERE) versus 179286 g/mol (LOF EPS) and 181883 mg/mol (HOF
EPS). As a summary can be stated, HOF and LOF EPS are chemically the same, but differ in pentane
content and particle size.
The goal was to proceed to higher EPS mass fractions as quickly as possible after successful polymerizations. One major problem in the project was the lack of parallel samples. Having several parallel
samples would have helped to eliminate uncertainties (e.g. reactor cleanness, possible weighing errors, etc.) and variances. As a result, the conclusions were heavily relied on assumptions. On top of
all, a lot of mistakes and miscalculations were made during this project, unfortunately. The most
important listed below.
1) Peroxide input miscalculations. Since the dissolved EPS was incorrectly treated as virgin
MS in the process, the peroxide was fed in a surplus.
2) The reactor’s air valve was not used until the sample M-172. The valve evens out pressure
differences, allows gases to exit the reactor, and in this way inhibits foaming.
3) Both the agitation (rpm) and stabilization were increased simultaneously in some cases in
order to improve the PSD and d-50, which complicates the conclusion which parameter had
more impact on the particle formation.
4) Inadequate monitoring of the stabile point and the sticky stage in different batches.
5) Inadequate monitoring of the quality of the beads by the means of microscope pictures and
foaming power testing.
6) The mass of beads (yield) that were successfully removed out of the reactor was not monitored. This would have given information about how much of the batch was lost as buildup
in the reactor.

Dissolving the EPS directly in the suspension prior to the polymerization stage was experimented
with 5 wt-% undersized and oversized off-spec EPS with different dissolution times based on the
results obtained from solubility testing. However, based on the PSD data it seems that the dissolution
time of EPS into MS is longer in water suspension compared to pure MS-EPS solution. When particle
size distributions were studied, in the case of LOF EPS 30 minutes extra dissolution time seemed to
give similar PSD results with batches containing either pre-dissolved LOF or HOF EPS (see Figure
51 in Appendix). However, in the case of HOF EPS even 45 minutes did not seem to be enough. In
the samples in which dissolution times were not presumably long enough, the average particle size
increased, and the LOF EPS formation seemed to slightly increase while HOF EPS formation slightly
decreased (compare samples reference samples M-137, M-140, M-152, and M-141 - M-148 in the
Table 26). Due to strict time schedule, it was decided that the rest of the batches would be done by
predissolving the EPS into MS.
It seems quite clear from the results even without any graphic illustrations that in general, by increasing both the agitation (stirring speed) and the use of stabilizing agents (concentration) the average
particle size decreased, and the PSD was shifted to smaller particle sizes. Another obvious observation was the fact that the agitation must be vigorous enough for maintaining a suspension. For example, the suspension was lost during the sticky phase in the reference samples when only a 240 rpm
of stirring speed was applied (samples M-150 and M-151). The increase in stirring speed should at
least to a certain critical point decrease the average particle size according to the literature [13] as
shown in Figure 7. This phenomenon may be illustrated by the reference samples M-156 and M-157
in which the stabilization concentration was kept the same with a factor of 0.26 and the stirring speed
was increased from 350 to 400 rpm, and the average particle size according to sieving results increased and the undersized EPS formation decreased. However, while M-156 was polymerized with
a cleaned reactor, M-157 was not. This may also have impacted the particle evolution, and more
parallel samples are needed. The increasing viscosity of the reaction mixture caused problems with
the suspension, and in order to maintain the suspension the stirring speed was increased. However,
increasing agitation may increase the tendency to form fines and foam, which is problematic and
undesirable. Increasing the stabilization concentration did not seem to help, and in addition, may
have increased foaming.
If the agitation was kept the same, an increase in the stabilization concentration decreased the average
particle size in all cases except for sample M-166 (M_14%LOF_P1-370-0.38). At a mass percentage
of 14% dissolved EPS, the d-50 increased and LOF EPS formation decreased compared to sample
M-165 (M_14%LOF_P1-370-0.38). M-166 had a d-50 value of 1.15, 1.86% LOF EPS, 1.44% HOF
EPS, while the respective values for M-165 were 0.94, 5.88%, and 0.40%. The increase in d-50 and
decrease in LOF formation most probably is an indication of too low stabilization concentration. On
the other hand, at a mass percentage of 20% dissolved EPS, the d-50 and LOF formation started to
79

Jani Korkiamäki
decrease compared to sample M-171 (M_20%LOF_P1-440-0.40). M-171 had a d-50 value of 1.06,
5.81% LOF EPS, 0.43% HOF EPS, while the respective values for M-173 were 1.04, 4.09% and
0.32%. Both the LOF and HOF formation decreased. However, M-171 was done in a cleaned reactor
while M-173 was not, which may have impacted particle formation, and this may also have been
normal variation. More testing and parallel samples are absolutely needed, and either higher or lower
stabilization concentrations could be applied in the future. If one would like to lower the LOF EPS
formation, the amount of stabilization could be lowered. Decreasing the agitation is not necessarily
possible due to the increased viscosity that may lead to loss of suspension, but the possibility to do
so should not be excluded.
Interestingly, regarding off-spec formation in samples containing off-spec EPS without considering
the quality of the beads and the machining, the sample M-160 (M_10%HOF_P1-350-0.26) made
with 10 wt-% off-spec EPS gave the best result with a mass fraction of only1.43% off-spec EPS of
the total mass, even better than the best reference samples M-137 (2.89 %, M_REF1-300-0.22) and
M-152 (2.94 %, M_REF_3.2-300-0.26). The LOF formation was also lower than in the references
with a mass fraction of 0.75% versus 2.50% (M-137) and 2.15% (M-152). Of all the successful
polymerizations, the worst result was attained with sample M-161 (M_10%LOF_P1-400-0.26) also
with 10 wt-% off-spec EPS. The particle size was extremely small with high LOF formation most
probably due to too powerful agitation since the stabilization factor was the same with M-160. However, there was some differences in pentane content between LOF and HOF raw material as the Table
27 in the Appendix shows.
In order to sustain the suspension in ERE containing batches the timing of stabilization agent addition
was changed since the suspension was non-existent. Only one sample, M-147 (M_5%ERE_P1-3000.26), was satisfactory carried out with the standard polymerization procedure. Increasing the concentration of stabilizing agent in the basic polymerization procedure did not seem to help, oddly,
quite the contrary, and the suspension was lost already in the beginning (see failed samples M-174
and M-175 in Table 26). Still, the suspension was maintained successfully by earlier timing of stabilization addition (in the beginning). However, the early timing seemed to decrease the average the
particle size significantly and increased formation of fines or LOF EPS compared to the only successful polymerization that was carried out with the basic polymerization procedure with normal
stabilization timing, the sample M-147 (M_5%ERE_P1-300-0.26). This may have been a result of
either too powerful agitation and too low concentration of stabilizing agents, or both. There was no
time to study the use of ERE in suspension polymerization of ERE further, and the actual need for
stabilization and agitation should be studied more in the future.
An important observation regarding ERE containing batches was the fact that the tendency to form
rather oval shaped than spherical beads increased. However, this was also the case with the use of

80

Jani Korkiamäki
off-spec EPS, but the effect was not as severe. The higher the mass fraction ERE used the stronger
the effect seemed to be (compare Pictures in the Appendix). Once again, this may have been a result
of either too powerful agitation and too low concentration of stabilizing agents, or both. In addition,
the contaminants and the chemicals that ERE may contain most probably contributed a lot and disturbed the suspension. On top of that, the brownish ERE colored the resulting beads slightly. The
higher the ERE content, the more brownish the beads compared to EPS beads made with pure virgin
MS and/or partly off-spec EPS beads. On the other hand, in expanded state the beads seemed to
become relatively white (See Picture 40).
Studying the use of ERE in suspension polymerization of EPS is crucial since it most probably will
resemble more the possible use of EPS and PS in the suspension polymerization process in the future
compared to the traditional off-spec beads produced with standard suspension polymerization with
pure virgin MS. Recycled EPS and PS will most probably also contain contaminants and unfamiliar
chemicals that may prevent the direct use of these raw materials in suspension polymerization of
EPS.

8.4.2 Mixing, Foaming and Fouling Phenomena
As earlier stated in the solubility section dissolving EPS into styrene results in a highly viscous and
sticky, gel-like solution. The higher the EPS content, the higher the viscosity, naturally. The increase
in viscosity caused agitation problems in the reactor, especially on the surface of the reaction mixture.
The vertical agitation in M-reactor may be inadequate since the surface seemed to stagnate and the
fouling or buildups of EPS and/or MS particles and clusters seemed to be emphasized in the reactor
bottom and upper parts. Even though the suspension was maintained more effectively by increasing
the stirring speed, the buildup problems were significant already in batches in which 10 wt-% EPS
was reused, and seemed to become worse at higher mass concentrations (see Pictures 44-46). In the
reference samples made with pure virgin MS, the problem did not exist. The following problems
were manifested during the polymerizations:
1. excessive EPS buildups on the reactor walls and surfaces, on agitator blades, and in the
bottom of the reactor,
2. blocked bottom valve,
3. stagnating surface layer,
4. excessive coalescence and formation of EPS clusters, and finally,
5. give grounds for reactor wash with toluene.
The possibility to inadequate stabilization concentration, however, should not be excluded. Still, the
inadequately powerful agitation was crucial and the most effective way to obtain the suspension
during this project. On the other hand, too powerful agitation itself may have been counterproductive
81

Jani Korkiamäki
and increased coalescence of the particles. The suspensions were typically lost by or during the sticky
stage in the cases where the agitation was presumably not adequate. In addition, since the EPS-MS
mixture was stickier to begin with it may have increased the tendency of particles to get stuck and to
form buildups on the reactor’s surfaces. As stated in the solubility experimentation section, the MS
solution containing EPS made a mess, plasticized and formed layers on surfaces and containers.
Foaming was a significant problem when dissolved EPS was used in the suspension polymerization.
The higher the wt-% used the higher the risk of foaming seemed to be. This was especially the case
with off-spec EPS. The reaction mixture formed a layer on the surface that did not mix into the
reaction mixture since the surface seemed to stagnate. The foaming seemed to be as its strongest
during the sticky stage. An increase in the stabilization concentration seemed to increase the amount
of foam, and on the other hand, the increased agitation may have increased the foaming, as well. The
stagnated surface and foam resulted in the following problems:
1. the sticky EPS particles on the surface got stuck into the reactor walls and the stirrer’s upper
parts,
2. the thickening of the surface layer eventually led to total loss of suspension, and
3. the foaming was so intense that the reaction mixture started to foam out of the reactor, as the
Picture 41 shows with 10 wt-% off-spec EPS (LOF).
The following reasons listed below were concluded to be possible causes for the foaming phenomena.
1) While it is difficult to say if the pentane content had any impact on the polymerization process,
it should be noted that the tendency to foam between batches containing off-spec EPS versus
ERE was significant. The ERE batches did not foam during the polymerization as intensively,
and the mixture did not foam even once out of the reactor. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized
that the role of pentane content is only speculation, and the off-spec resins (LOF and HOF) made
with suspension polymerization differ in the consistency of ERE material as well. Still, even
though the EPS was dissolved into MS in a closed glass bottle, the pentane should have evaporated from the reactor since the reactor was an open system until the impregnation step.
2) Another potential reason for the foaming phenomena could have been the surplus of added peroxide in the system. The acceleration in polymerization rate may have led to more drastic heat
release, which in turn could promote foaming, uncontrollable cell growth and loss of suspension.
In addition, the foaming started to become clearer at 10 % dissolved off-spec EPS, which would
be convenient for the theory since the higher the used dissolved EPS the higher the relative surplus of peroxide added in the reaction mixture.
3) The high amount of stabilization concentration that was used may have increased the foaming.
The fact that the foaming seemed to increase immediately after addition of stabilizing agents
would support the theory. The amount of stabilization agents in batches containing higher wt-%
82

Jani Korkiamäki
EPS was significantly higher compared to reference samples, which did not foam as strongly. In
addition, the viscosity of the reaction mixture may have slightly increased due to higher concentrations of stabilizing agents.
4) The EPS itself and the additives it contains may have contributed to the foaming.
In order to solve the problems discussed above, namely agitation, foaming, and fouling problems,
and to optimize the particle size distribution the following practices could possibly be applied.
1. Decreasing the viscosity by increasing the proportion of W to MS (decreasing the amount
MS per batch). This could make the mass easier to agitate and the surface stagnation may be
hindered. However, this too would lead to lower EPS yield per batch.
2. Decreasing the batch mass overall which could help promote agitation, especially on the
surface where the problems seem most likely to occur (stagnating surface layer that may
produce clusters, lumps and foam.). The blades of the stirrer are were way below the surface
in the M-reactor. However, this would lead to lower EPS yield per batch.
3. Changing the structure of the stirrer with better vertical agitation.
4. Decreasing the viscosity or stickiness of the mass by some other means, such as for example,
chemicals.
5. Decreasing foaming by chemicals, e.g. foam inhibitors.
6. Increasing the stabilization concentration and decreasing the agitation or the other way
around. However, an increase in stabilization concentration may lead to increased foaming.
Too vigorous stirring on the other hand, could lead to increased coalescence and formation
of EPS clusters.
7. Either increasing or reducing the agitation suddenly or stepwise during polymerization. For
example, the agitation could be increased during the sticky stage.

Discussion
All the PSD related data including average particle size (d-50) and the mass fraction distributions are
collected in the Appendix in the PSD data section. The section also contains PSD curves and offspec distribution graphs of all the batches. The evolution of undersized (LOF) EPS formation and
the agitation and the concentration of stabilizing agents applied in the most “successful” batches at
different mass concentrations of reused EPS compared to the starting point, the reference sample M137 (M_Ref1-300-0.22) can be observed in Tables 18 and 19. The figures 33 and 34 portray the
evolution of the formation of EPS fines at different d-50 for the batches containing different mass
concentrations of reused EPS.
The reuse of all three EPS qualities in suspension polymerization seemed to shift EPS PSD into larger
particle sizes if the process temperature-time profile and process parameters such as agitation and
stabilization are identical with the standard or reference polymerization procedure, and in this way,
have decreased the formation of undersized (LOF) and increase the oversized (HOF) EPS formation.
For example, in the batches in which 5 wt-% off-spec EPS was reused in which same stabilization
and agitation levels were applied as the reference samples (M-152 and M-141), at the same average

86

Jani Korkiamäki
particle sizes, the LOF formation seemed to slightly decrease and the HOF formation slightly increased compared to the references (See Figures 34, 50, and 54, and Table 18). This may partly be
explained with the increasing viscosity of the reaction mixture which could reduce the grade of agitation, and hence, increase coalescence and particle size. On the other hand, without any adjustments
in stabilization input timing in the batch containing 5 wt-% reused ERE (sample M-148), the d-50
was drastically increased when the same polymerization procedure with the reference sample M-152
was used, and naturally, the amount of fines dropped very low and oversized EPS formation increased (see Table 19). However, the suspension was very weak in the sample M-148. Changing the
timing of stabilization addition had the opposite effect compared to the reference, and d-50 was significantly lowered, and as expected, the LOF formation increased and the HOF formation increased
as the Table 19 shows.
It may be difficult to draw a straightforward conclusion if or not the reuse of EPS decreases the
tendency to form EPS fines, but at least in some of the samples in which the agitation and stabilizing
agent concentration was successfully applied and adjusted, at the same d-50 particle sizes less fines
were formed compared to the trendline of the reference samples (see Figures 33 and 34), especially
in reused ERE containing batches. The fact that the increase in viscosity of the reaction mixture was
compensated with more vigorous agitation was problematic since after a certain threshold the amount
of EPS fines started to increase again (see for example Table 16). In addition, the stabilization agent
concentration may have been applied in abundance which may have contributed. This phenomenon
is well illustrated by the Tables 18 and 19. Especially in reused ERE containing batches the Table
17 shows, however, that the right ratio between stabilization and the agitation were missing and quite
randomly applied. The high amount of EPS fines may have been a result of either too high stabilization or agitation, or both. On the other hand, the amount of stabilization may have been insufficient,
as well, and more systematic research is certainly needed. On top of the LOF problem, the quality of
the beads was also an issue especially in batches containing reused ERE with oval-shaped beads.
Another interesting aspect is that the ERE batches in general seemed to result in more narrower PSD
distributions compared to only virgin MS and reused off-spec EPS containing batches (see PSD
curves in the Appendix), which could be a positive thing if the particle size could be better controlled.
It seems clear from the PSD results, that when reused EPS is used in suspension is used to significant
extents, most probably both the agitation and the concentration of stabilization may have to be increased in order to produce proper EPS beads both in size and quality. For example, in order to
polymerize EPS containing 20 wt-% LOF EPS a 91% increase in stabilization concentration and 47%
in the stirring was applied (see Table 18). Finally, the role and the effect of the surplus of polymerization initiators, peroxides, in the system on PSD remains unanswered.

the general trend at different EPS mass concentrations.

Discussion
The general trend seems to be that the residual monomer (MS concentration) decreases with increasing reused EPS content (see Figure 32). This trend would be supported by the visual observations
during the polymerization. It seemed that the stabile point was obtained earlier, and the beads were
harder at an earlier stage in the process. This seemed to be noticeable especially at higher EPS contents such as 16 and 20 wt-%. However, this is most probably resulting from the surplus of peroxides
(BPO and TBEC) in the system. The lowest RM values were obtained with 12, 16 and 20 wt-% EPS,
which also supports the theory that this was caused by the surplus of peroxide. Everything below
1000 ppm was considered acceptable. For some reason, the reference samples (M-156 and M-157)
with powerful agitation resulted in very high RM value (see Figure 35 and 36 triangles marked with
a white interior). All the RM data obtained can be found in the Appendix in the Table 29 and an
additional RM graph with all in addition, the EPS qualities (LOF, HOF and ERE) differentiated in

Discussion
All the MW value related data can be found in the Table 27 in the Appendix. The general trend in
MW value development seemed to be that the values mostly decreased with increasing EPS content
compared to the reference samples made purely with virgin MS (see Figure 37). On the other hand,
the trendline seems to be almost parable like and starts to slowly increase after approximately 12 wt% reused EPS both in the case of undersized off-spec (LOF) and extruded recycled (ERE) EPS.
Oddly enough, extremely high MW values were obtained in batches containing 5 wt-% reused ERE
with lower stabilization values (M-176 and M-177 in Tables 27 and 29 in the Appendix), even higher
than the reference samples. The question that was presented earlier in Chapter 8.4.1 General Overview that does the ERE material itself lower the need for stabilization is repeated here. Another
observation is the fact that predissolved LOF and HOF with the same recipe had identical MW values. This seems to support the presumption that LOF and HOF EPS are chemically quite the same
time, and the HOF EPS had only a slightly higher MW value compared to LOF EPS (compare M145 and M-146). However, there is a significant difference in MW values between the parallel samples M-143 (M_5%LOF_P1-300-0.26) and M-145 (M_5%LOF_P2-300-0.26). The fact that M-143
was done in a cleaned reactor and M-145 not, seems to support the presumption that the cleanliness
of the reactor impacts results. Nevertheless, the variation in raw materials, both in styrene and reused
EPS qualities may also contribute
First and foremost, in order to measure and to take into consideration the effect of the surplus of
peroxides theoretical MW values were roughly estimated with the following formula (4):
𝑀𝑊𝑇ℎ𝑒𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 =
𝑤𝑡% 𝑀𝑆 × 𝑀𝑊𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑅𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠 + 𝑤𝑡%𝑟𝑒𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑃𝑆 𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 × 𝑀𝑊𝑟𝑒𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑃𝑆 𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦
The MW values obtained were slightly on the low end. This can partly be explained with the lower
MW values of the reused EPS qualities compared to reference samples, especially ERE, that were
expected to sink the MW value of the end products. Interestingly, however, the ERE did not seem
lower the MW more than LOF EPS, quite the contrary even in some cases. Even though the peroxide
was added in a surplus in the batches, the MW values obtained in general were still relatively close
to the calculated theoretical MW values.
The polydispersity index (PDI), or just the dispersity, in general, despite a couple of anomalies, seems
to decrease with increasing reused EPS content (see Figure 39). This was expected, as well, since the
PD indexes for LOF, HOF and ERE were significantly lower than the PD indexes of the reference
samples, and the higher the concentration of the reused more uniform EPS qualities in the batches,
namely off-spec and extruded recycled EPS, the more uniform the final product presumable becomes,
hence, having a lower PDI.

Discussion
The three different compressive strength values at different densities obtained from the reference
sample comprising of M-137 (M_REF1-300-0.22) and M-152 (M_REF_3.2-300-0.26). However,
linear forecasting with such a limited data may not be trustworthy, and the reference for production
was also used. Figure 41 shows that the compressive strength might even slightly increase in batches
containing dissolved EPS. However, M-160 with 10 % HOF did not manage that well, most probably
due to very low pentane content (3.15 wt-% versus REF 4.38% and 4.51 OFF SPEC 5%). The bending strength was also very weak. The bending strength seems to decrease in batches containing dissolved EPS (see Figure 42). It was impossible to make a linear forecast with the bending strength
reference data, and the production reference was used. It should also be noted that higher steam
pressure was used for the preparation of batches containing dissolved EPS, which should improve
results in mechanical strength. The lambda value compared to production reference seems to increase, which is not desirable (See figure 43). More testing is absolutely needed, and more parallel
samples should be included.

9 Conclusions
The solubility tests of EPS into MS gave relatively consistent results as up to 30 wt-% of three different EPS qualities was successfully dissolved at three different temperatures in laboratory scale.
Clear differences between the different EPS qualities were distinguished and the contributing effect
to the dissolution of the temperature increase was confirmed. However, there was some anomalies
and according to the obtained results there is not a very drastic difference between the dissolution
times between 50°C and 70°C. My personal conclusion based on the results overall is that a separate
EPS dissolution tank would be the most practical solution in industrial scale if EPS or PS is reused
in the suspension polymerization of EPS, especially at higher dissolved EPS concentrations. This on
the other hand, could possibly cause some technical problems due to stickiness and highly viscous
mass. Small amounts of EPS fines could possibly be dissolved directly in the suspension prior to the
polymerization based on the polymerization results. Still, the fact that the dissolution times were
determined visually decreases the reliability of the results significantly. As earlier stated in Chapter
7, in the future if dissolution of the PS or EPS into MS is studied further, the following suggested
improvements should be taken into consideration:
1) The dissolution container must be a closed system, and preferably with automatic temperature control.
2) The dissolution container must be equipped with an adequate stirrer, for example a mechanical stirrer.
3) The extent of dissolution must be monitored and defined with the help of transmittance or
viscosity measurement.
Possibly, with a closed system preventing evaporation, applied with better temperature control and
vigorous stirring the dissolution times could be significantly lowered.
Suspension polymerization experimentation gave varying results as up to 20 wt-% EPS was reused
in a laboratory-scale BR (M1-reactor). In general, the reused off-spec EPS, mostly undersized offspec EPS fines, containing batches gave better results both regarding bead quality and the amount of
produced EPS fines than ERE containing samples. There was no time to study the recycling of extruded recycled EPS material in suspension polymerization comprehensively, and the stabilization
and agitation levels were quite randomly applied based on the results obtained from reused LOF and
HOF EPS. However, in order to maintain the suspension, the timing of the addition of stabilizing
agent A had to be changed, which seemed to have a drastic effect on the particle size evolution. The
average particle size was remarkably decreased, and unfortunately, the amount of EPS fines increased. In addition, the quality of the beads which seemed to decrease in both groups, both in the
reused off-spec EPS (HOF and LOF) as well as ERE containing batches, was significantly worse in
98

Jani Korkiamäki
the ERE containing batches. The ERE beads became rather oval than the desired spherical shaped
beads. Even though some relatively good results with respect to PSD were obtained in single batches
containing recycled off-spec EPS, there were many other problems that must be addressed in the
future. These problems that may prevent industrial application may include:
•

bead quality problems,

•

excess foaming,

•

buildups in the reactor,

•

agitation problems,

•

batch removal problems,

•

reactor cleaning problems, and finally,

•

interruptions in production.

It may also be possible that some sort of filtration or extraction technique(s), which is typical for
solvent recycling in order to remove for example additives and impurities from the polymer, must be
applied for the polymer-monomer mixture (monostyrene-polystyrene mixture), at least for mixtures
containing ERE material, and possibly in the future, PS or EPS waste.
The next steps for research in the attempt to recycle EPS in suspension polymerization process could
be the following:
1) Decreasing and correcting the amount of peroxides added to the system tied to the amount
of virgin MS.
2) Testing how 5 wt-% LOF and HOF EPS behave in a pilot-scale and in an industrial-scale
reactor if any significant buildups on the reactor surfaces are present and if lower bead yields
overall are achieved.
3) Finding the actual need for stabilization and concentration for ERE and optimizing the ratio
between stabilization concentration and agitation, possibly first in the laboratory-scale BR
(M-reactor).
4) Repeating solubility tests in a better solubility system as described above and in chapter
7.3.2.

10 Sammanfattning
10.1 Teoretisk bakgrund
Förbrukning av plastiska material och produkter växer ständigt i dagens samhälle (se Figur 3) [1].
Samtidigt har oron för plasters miljöpåverkan ökats och reglering för framställning och användning
av plastprodukter blivit alltmer striktare [2]. Trycket för att minska mängden fast avfall som hamnar
till soptippar och miljön, mängden av emissioner, och förbrukning av naturtillgångar är på den högsta
nivån någonsin, och återvinning föredras över den ”konventionella” avfallshanteringen [3]. Allt detta
är sant även för EPS, det vill säga partikelskum baserat på expanderad polystyren (EPS), eller
Airpop®- engineered air i Europa, som är en av de mest viktiga polystyren (PS)-tillämpningar. EPS
används brett i applikationer inom konstruktions-, förpacknings- och fordonsindustrin [4,5]. Utöver
isoleringsförmågan och kostnadseffektiviteten, har EPS ett flertal fördelaktiga egenskaper såsom bra
stötdämpningsförmåga, bra tryckhållfasthet, låg värmeledningsförmåga, god kemisk- samt luftfuktighetsresistivitet, låg vikt, en god hållbarhet samt resistans mot nedbrytning, och återvinningsbarhet
[3,4,15,43]. Den största styrkan hos EPS-materialet som gör det unikt med tanke på hållbarheten, är
dess höga effektivitet i relation till mängden konsumerat råmaterial. EPS består mellan 95–98 % av
luft innehållande slutna celler och endast från 2–5 % av PS [7]. Reducering av mängden avfall och
föroreningar som EPS genererar bygger på åtminstone fyra olika strategier:
1. reducering; t.ex. ytterligare reducering av EPS-innehållet med att optimering av förpackningsdesignens,
2. återanvändning; t.ex. återanvändning av termoslådor för livsmedel,
3. återvinning; t.ex. återanvändning av material eller dess komponenter i nya produkter och
applikationer, och
4. energiåtervinning; t.ex. produktion av termisk värme eller kraft med hjälp av förbränning
eller kemisk återvinning av råmaterial [7].
Gångbara återvinningsmetoder för polymerer kan allmänt delas i följande tre huvudgrupper som gäller även för EPS:
I.

Mekanisk återvinning som innefattar upparbetning av plastavfall till nya produkter. Ursprunget för materialet kan vara en tillverkningsprocess eller en postkonsumentprodukt.

II.

Kemisk eller råmaterialåtervinning (tertiär återvinning) som innefattar nedbrytning av plastmaterialet till monomer eller andra produkter med hjälp av värme eller kemisk behandling,
till exempel hydrolys och pyrolys. Dessa komponenter kan rekombineras eller användas för
andra tillämpningar.
100

Jani Korkiamäki
III.

Energiåtervinning (kvartär återvinning) som innefattar återhämtning av energin från plasten
med hjälp av förbränning. Denna typ av verksamhet ses oftast som underutnyttjande eller
slöseri av energin som plasten innehåller [24].

Återvinningsgraden globalt har ökat drastiskt under de senaste årtiondena [8]. Åsikten att EPS inte
kan återvinnas är ihärdig [24]. Även om det är sant att EPS-återvinning innebär ett flertal tekniska
utmaningar, är EPS en av de mest återvunna plaster i världen (se figurer 19–23) [2,6]. Dyra dumpningskostnader på soptippar samt höga transportkostnader för de högt voluminösa EPS-materialen,
och allmänna publika opinionen har varit de drivande krafterna för utvecklingsarbete av EPS-återvinningstekniker [6]. EPS kan återvinnas flera gånger utan nämnvärd försämring i materialegenskaper, och processen börjar ofta genom att krossa materialet som kan återvinnas antingen som EPS
eller PS då luften avlägsnas [56]. Emellertid, den lilla marginalen i priset mellan obehandlad och
återvunnen EPS sänker motivationen för återvinning [6]. Energiåtervinning där avfallet förbränns,
och mekanisk återvinning där avfallspolymerer konverteras till nya produkter, är de två huvudsakliga
alternativen för polymeravfallshantering [9]. Även om mängden EPS-avfall som hamnar på soptippar
har sjunkit, är en signifikant andel av EPS-återvinning fortfarande värmeåtervinning, det vill säga
förbränning.
Man har forskat mycket kring EPS-återvinning, och presumtiva möjliga metoder innefattar extrudering, pyrolys och upplösning av EPS i lösningsmedel [57]. Bland den första och andra metoden finns
det vissa kritiska punkter. I smält extrudering krävs det höga temperaturer upp till polymerens degraderingstemperatur, och i pyrolys, är det svårt att extrahera styren ur pyrolytiska produkter, och
dessutom är priset för produktionen väldigt högt. Detta har resulterat i att alltmer uppmärksamhet
har skiftats mot upplösning [57]. Upplösning av lågdensitets-EPS eller PS-skum i lämpliga upplösningsmedel är ett av de billigaste, effektivaste och miljövänligaste sätten att hantera avfall [9,10].
Sålunda har upplösningsbeteendet av PS-skum i olika slags lösningsmedel en kritisk roll i PS-återvinning [9]. Återvinningsprocess av plast via upplösningsåtervinning innehåller generiskt avlägsnande föroreningar och andra additiver, antingen homogen eller heterogen upplösning, och utfällning
eller förgasning. Polymeren är upplöst i lösningsmedel, och efteråt kristalliseras den selektivt. I en
ideal situation har lösningsmedlet förmågan att upplösa antingen målpolymeren eller alla andra polymerer utom målpolymeren, och kan användas för selektiv upplösning. Att hitta de rätta lösningsmedlen är kritiskt för upplösningsprocessen [1]. Tillämpning av upplösningsåtervinning för skummade polymerer såsom EPS har ett flertal fördelar. Till exempel icke-upplösbara kontaminationer
kan avlägsnas via filtrering som ger möjligheten att vidareprocessera ren polymer. Ytterligare, att
selektivt upplösa polymeren möjliggör avskiljning av plaster från andra icke-upplösbara avfall och
polymerer på basen av deras kemiska sammansättning och löslighet. Slutligen, upplösning av skummet resulterar i en hundrafaldig reduktion i volym utan degradation av polymerkedjorna. Detta leder
till reducerade transportkostnader av EPS [9,58].
101

Jani Korkiamäki
Ett flertal lösningsmedel för PS såsom toluen, xylen, klorbensen, aceton, cyklohexan, butylacetat,
etylacetat, metyletylketon, limonen, terpinen, terpinolen, p-cymen och phellandren har undersökts
(se Tabell 12) [58]. Det är allmänt känt att vissa aromatiska föreningar, exempelvis limonen, är goda
lösningsmedel för PS [9]. Dessutom löser sig PS i styren, som utgör monomeren vid framställning
av PS. Sedan 1950-talet, har majoriteten av EPS framställts via suspension polymerisation i satsreaktorer. Alternativt kan man även idag framställa EPS med hjälp av mera nyligen utvecklade extruderingssprocesser (producerar mikroskopiska pärlor med jämnare storlek direkt från smält PS)
[4,59]. Följaktligen, är idén om möjligheten att utnyttja det traditionella sättet att producera EPS
pärlor i PS-återvinning genom att upplösa PS- eller EPS-avfallet i styren väldigt lockande, eftersom
inga dyra tilläggsinvesteringar krävs i den själva suspensionsprocessen. Detta vore en naturlig väg
för EPS-industrin. Målet i detta arbete var uttryckligen att fastställa hur mycket EPS man skulle
möjligtvis kunna återanvända i en satsreaktors suspensionspolymerisationsprocess. Åtminstone i ett
par patent nämns möjligheten att lösa från 0,5 till 30% PS eller EPS i styren och användning av denna
blandning i tillverkning av EPS i suspension [12,44]. Ytterligare, eftersom faktumet är att antalet
tekniska applikationer för under- och överdimensionerad (LOF respektive HOF) EPS, särskilt för
underdimensionerad EPS som framställs i BEWiSynbra Raws produktion är begränsade, är det uppenbart att något måste göras för att minska mängden producerat underutnyttjat så kallad ”off-spec”EPS (material som inte uppfyller vissa kvalitetskrav). Det är fortfarande oklart hur och när “offspec”-EPS, eller EPS- eller PS-avfall ska utnyttjas i BEWiSynbra RAWs EPS-tillverkning med suspensionspolymerisationsprocess i framtiden. Det två självklaraste alternativen är antingen att förupplösa EPS i styren innan suspensionen eller att låta EPS upplösas i styren direkt i suspensionslösningen. I samtliga fall, måste själva polymerisationen innehållande återanvänt EPS genomföras framgångsrikt före några tekniska applikationer och lösningar planeras eller övervägs seriöst. Ifall man
skulle lyckas att återanvända EPS eller PS i suspensionspolymerisationsprocessen med ursprungligt
eller något ändrat tillverkningssystem framgångsrikt hos BEWiSynbra, skulle man möjligtvis förbättra konkurrenskraften på den ytterligt konkurrensutsatta EPS-marknaden eftersom lönsamheten
skulle öka genom att sänka de totala tillverkningskostnaderna för EPS med lägre förbrukning av
styren (mera billiga råvaror i form av EPS och PS avfall), möjligheten för återanvändning av “offspec”-EPS (mindre avfallsprodukt), och tillhandahålla en mera miljövänlig hög-prestanda produkt
som lockar mera kunder.
EPS tillverkning via suspensionspolymerisation producerar sfäriska pärlor som expanderas till skum
med hjälp av värme eller ånga i närvaro av ett jäsmedel [21]. Icke-vattenlösliga styrenmonomer är
dispenserade som droppar i närvaro av suspensionsstabilisatorer, medan suspensionsblandningen
som består av vatten och monomer omrörs kraftigt för att producera PS-partiklar som en disperserande solid fas. Själva polymerisationen sker innanför de dispergerade styren-monomerdropparna
efter tillsats av initiator. Initiatorer är oftast organiska peroxider såsom BPO, TBPC och TAEC, eller
102

Jani Korkiamäki
azoföreningar, är lösliga i olja (styren). Polymerisationsprocessen utförs oftast i två eller flera steg
(se Figur 17). Olika suspensionsstabiliserande tillsatsämnen (t.ex. PVA, HEC, PVP, naturliga produkter så som TCP, osv.) tillförs för att erhålla önskad droppestorleksfördelningen av den dispenserade fasen. Monomer/vatten förhållandet är ofta mellan 40:60 och 60:40 [21]. Den kommersiella
EPS-produktionen är fokuserad på partikelstorlek mellan 0,1–2 mm, men 0,4–1,6 mm föredras, medan de expanderade uppvärmda EPS pärlorna expanderar upp till 20 gånger deras ursprungliga storlek, och efteråt fördubblas de partiellt expanderade pärlorna i gjutformen med hjälp av passerande
ånga (ungefär till 40-faldigt storlek av den ursprungliga pärlan) varvid polymerpartiklarna smälts
samman [3,4,21]. Jäsmedlet är oftast en blandning av pentan. Pentanet tillförs typiskt i slutskedet av
processen före avvattning och torkning. Pärlorna beläggs även med organiska antistatmedel som förhindrar agglomerationen av de bildade partiklarna i den fortsatta processen. Sedan siktas EPS-partiklarna på basen av storleken i olika storleksfraktioner, och partiklar med storleken mellan 0,1–2
mm används för framställning av EPS. Sedan lagras EPS-pärlorna i gastäta påsar och silon. EPSpärlorna är producerade i en polymerisationsanläggning och transporteras till konverter som processar pärlorna vidare till slutliga produkter, t.ex. isoleringsskivor. Detta har fördelen att kostnaderna
för att transportera de volymmässigt skrymmande skivorna är minimerad, och formgjutningen kan
utföras utan postbearbetningsprocesser. Alla tekniska stegen i EPS-produktionen mera detaljerat är
beskrivna och illustrerade i figurerna 15 och 16 [21]. Förvandlingen av EPS-partiklar producerade
med suspensionspolymerisation till cellplast är utfört i tre olika huvudsteg:
1. preformgjutning/pre-expansion av EPS-pärlor,
2. mättning eller temporär lagring av pre-expanderade pärlorna, och
3. slutlig skumning (formgjutning eller blockprocesser) [21].
Kommersiell suspensionspolymerisation utförs typiskt i vertikala satsreaktorer eller möjligtvis i
semi-satsreaktorer med reaktorvolymer mellan 20 och 100 m3, utrustade med en omrörare av paddel
eller ankare typ och med en omrörningshastighet på mellan 20 och 60 rpm [21,3132]. Omröraren kan
förses med bafflar för att förbättra dispersionen eftersom användning av bafflar minskar heterogeniteten av turbulens och virvelrörelse [31,32]. Temperaturkontroll är en av de mest viktiga parametrerna och korrekt reaktordesign är även kritiskt för att uppnå höga polymerkonversionshastigheter.
Det är även mycket viktigt att reaktorn tillåter effektiv bortförsel av överloppsvärmet som uppstår
pga. den exotermiska polymerisationsprocessen [28].
Själva suspensionspolymerisationen framskrider via fri-radikal mekanism och suspensionspolymerisationen genomgår de följande tre huvudsteg [13,21,30]:
I.

Låg-viskositetsstadium vid låga monomerkonversioner, där droppbrott (drop breakage) är
den dominerande mekanismen och storleksdistributionen av droppen är snäv.

103

Jani Korkiamäki
II.

Klibbigt stadium med en accelererad ökning i viskositeten. Under detta stadium avtar brotthastigheten medan sammansmältning (coalescence) börjar dominera. Detta resulterar i att
den genomsnittliga partikelstorleken ökar, och partikelsstorleksfördelningen blir bredare.

III.

Identifikationspunkten. Ifall ett stadigt tillstånd uppnås, under detta stadium vid höga monomerkonversioner blir partiklarna tillräckligt hårda så att kollisioner mellan dem blir elastiska, och således upphörs sammansmältning av partiklarna och den slutliga formen av partikelstorleksfördelningen förblir konstant [13,21,30].

Det huvudsakliga målet i suspensionspolymerisation är att nå så uniform dispersion av monomerdroppar som möjligt i den kontinuerliga vattenfasen med kontroll över sammansmältning av
dropparna under loppet av polymerisationsprocessen [27]. Kontroll över partikelstorleksfördelningen (PSD) är den största utmaningen i suspensionspolymerisation, och ju snävare distributionen
är desto bättre [13,21]. Allmänt sätt är både den ursprungliga storleksfördelningen av monomerdropparna och slutliga polymerpartiklarna, beroende på omrörningseffektivitet (t.ex. reaktorgeometrin,
typen av omrörare, effekten, osv.) och fysikaliska egenskaper (t.ex. densitet, viskositet, ytspänningar)
av den kontinuerliga och dispergerade fasen [13]. Kvaliteten av de polymerpartiklarna beror alltså
utöver reaktordesignen på även operativa parametrar som styr det övergripande stabiliteten av systemet [29]. Effektiv styrning av processen kräver utöver kännedom om exakta vetenskapliga principer
också empiriska studier. Det finns ett otal av empiriska och teoretiska undersökningar på olika slags
operativa parametrar och deras effekt på partikelstorleksfördelning (PSD). Den genomsnittliga storleken av monomerdroppar, och därmed de resulterande polymerpartiklarna, är beroende av omrörningshastigheten, volymförhållandet mellan monomer- och suspensionsmedium, koncentration av
stabiliseringsämnen, och viskositeten av både den kontinuerliga och dispergerade fasen, se ekvation
(3) [29]. Uppskalning av suspensionspolymerisationsprocessen är krävande, och mycket empiriska
metoder används för att utveckla nya produkter och för uppskalning av processen från pilot till produktionsanläggning. För detta behövs dyra och tidkrävande experimentella program [13,27].
Den dynamiska partikelstorleksfördelningen är beroende av två fysikaliska processer, nämligen
droppe- eller partikelbrott och sammansmältning eller agglomeration av partiklar [13,30]. Den dispergerade fasen kan nedbrytas i små droppar när ytan sönderfaller (droppbrott) i den omrörda suspensionen pga. av friktionskrafter (via viskös skjuvning) och via tröghet (via turbulens). Den totala
droppbrottshastigheten är beroende av kollisionsfrekvensen av dropparna och sammansmältningseffektiviteten [31]. Droppbrottet sker huvudsakligen i regioner där skjuvspänningen är kraftig så som
exempelvis nära omrörarbladen eller som resultat av turbulent flöde och tryckfluktuationer längs
droppens yta. Turbulenta flödesfält antingen ökar eller minskar fluktuationer vid droppens yta. Däremot, om koncentrationen av ytaktiva ämnen är tillräcklig, kan effekten antas vara försumbar för
utspädda suspensioner [13]. Olika slags mekanismer av droppbrott och sammansmältning är summerade i Figur 7.

10.2 Experimentell del
Avhandlingens experimentella del utfördes i laborationsskala. Till en början utfördes upplösningsexperiment för att fastställa hur mycket EPS (3 olika kvaliteter) som man kan upplösa i styren. Sedan utfördes suspensionspolymerisations i närvaro av de i styren upplösta EPS-polymererna. De
undersökta EPS-kvaliteterna inkluderade två olika “off-spec EPS-kvaliteter från BEWiSynbra
Raws konventionella suspensionpolymerisationsprocess, nämligen under- och överdimensionerad
”off-spec”-EPS (partikeldia-meter <0,4 mm respektive ≥2,5 mm), och ytterligare en återvunnen
EPS extrudat (material för fisklådor).
Löslighetsexperimenteringen utfördes för att skaffa preliminär och vägledande information om tider och gränser för upplösningen av EPS till styren. Detta två-komponent systemet bestod av en
blandning av MS och EPS. Emellertid, även om det var meningen att klargöra tiden för upplösningen även i vattensuspensionen, visade sig att vara opraktiskt och omöjligt att uppfölja pålitligt
med existerande utrustningar. Lösligheten av de olika EPS-kvaliteterna undersöktes vid tre olika
temperaturer, nämligen vid rumstemperatur, 50°C och 70°C grader samt vid sex olika masskoncentrationer, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 och 30. Åtminstone tre olika parallella prov för varje masskoncentration vid de olika temperaturerna undersöktes. Upplösningssystemet bestod av ett 400 ml dekanterglas, en magnetomrörare samt ett värmeelement, en termometer och en baffel (se bilderna 1–3).
Temperaturen fastställdes manuellt med hjälp av termometern och den estimerade temperaturfluktuationen var +/- 5 °C av den önskade temperaturen. Systemet var antingen öppet eller semi-öppet
med ett folioomslag, vilket ledde till att en del oavsiktlig avdunstning av styren inte kunde fullständigt undvikas. Det eftersökta omrörningshastigheten var 500 rpm, men på grund av den högviskosa
blandningen vid högre masskoncentrationer såsom över 20% sänktes omrörningshastigheten till
150–400 rpm, särskilt vid rumstemperaturen. Vid 70°C var lösningen tillräckligt lågviskös och
kunde omröras med 500 rpm utan problem. Allmänt kan konstateras att magnetomrörarens kapacitet var otillräcklig för att blanda den högviskösa och gel-liknande blandningen effektivt längs
hela massan, och särskilt ytan hade en tendens att stagnera. Lösligheten och upplösningstillståndet
samt tiden för det fullständigt upplösta tillståndet var fastställda visuellt och med hjälp av en telefonkamera, vilket naturligtvis var problematiskt och ökade osäkerheten i resultaten. Standarden för
en fullständig upplösning baserade sig på visuella observationer, dvs. en klar lösning utan synliga
partiklar klassificerades som en fullständig upplösning.
Suspensionspolymerisationsexperimenten utfördes i laboratoriet med en satsreaktor kallad M-reaktor (M1). Satsreaktorn var utrustad med en omrörare, ett integrerat uppvärmnings/kylningssystem
(olja), och ett reaktorkärl med en volym på 5–6 liter. Locket var tillslutet först vid impregneringsskedet, och utvecklingen av suspensionen kunde övervakas och prov kunde plockas tills detta. De
105

Jani Korkiamäki
olika produktionsstegen och temperaturprofilerna vid suspensionspolymerisationen använda i projektet finns i Figurerna 31 samt 32 och Tabellerna 16 samt 17. De använda råmaterialen och kemikalierna finns listade i Tabell 15. Massaförhållandet mellan styren (MS) och vatten eller MS+EPS
och vatten hölls konstant genom hela projektets lopp. Det tillsätta EPS-materialet behandlades som
identiskt råmaterial med MS så att massan EPS+MS-blandning var alltid identisk med referensprovet innehållande endast MS. Således hölls mängden inmatade peroxid konstant i alla prov. Detta
antagande visade sig dock vara felaktigt. EPS var blandad i MS genom upplösning, antingen genom att direkt förupplösa blandningen i en glasflaska före laddning av satsreaktorn med diverse kemikalier, eller genom att upplösa EPS i styren (MS) direkt i suspensionen inför det aktuella polymerisationssteget (Polymerisationssteg I). Processvariabler justerades för att uppnå önskad partikelstorleksfördelning (PSD) genom att först och främst ställa in koncentrationen av de stabiliserande
agenterna A samt B, och omrörningshastigheten. Förändring av inmatningshastigheten av det stabiliserande ämnet A var också ett annat alternativ som studerades. Reaktorn rengjordes vid behov, till
exempel på grund av agglomeration, tilltäppning eller misslyckad polymerisation, med toluen och
vatten. Denna procedur hade möjligtvis en inverkan på de erhållna resultaten eftersom de föregående data har visat sig att PSD resultaten har i någon grad förändrats efter rengöring av reaktorn.
Kvaliteten och materialegenskaper av de framgångsrikt producerade EPS-pärlorna undersöktes
med hjälp av siktning (fördelning av partikelstorlek, PSD), och analyser för restmonomer (RM),
pentanhalt (GC) samt molekylvikt (med SEC). Partikelgeometrin och formkvaliteten granskades
visuellt. Därtill mättes för ett antal preskummade prov som formades till brickor deras skumningsstyrka, mekaniska (kompressions- och brytningsstyrka) och termiska (värmeledningsförmåga,
lambda) egenskaper. Alla de uppmätta egenskaperna jämfördes med motsvarande egenskaper hos
referens-EPS.
En lämplig partikelstorleksfördelning är ett av de viktigaste kriterierna för användbarheten av EPS i
olika slags tillämpningar. Restmonomer (RM) är en viktig indikator på polymerisationsgraden, och
målet är allmänt att nå restmonomer halter mindre än 1000 ppm. Molekylvikten inverkar på de mekaniska egenskaperna och på cellbildningen. Pentaninnehållet uppmättes också för alla prov innan
formgjutning. En del utvalda polymerssatser preskummades och konverterades via formgjutning
till brickor. Efteråt mättes den termiska förskumningsstyrkan, isoleringsförmågan (lambda, λ) och
de mekaniska egenskaperna såsom brytnings- och kompressionsstyrkan. Kompressionsstyrkan mättes i enlighet med standard SFS-EN 826 och brytningsstyrkan med SFS-EN 12089.

10.3 Resultat och diskussion
Alla relevanta resultat av upplösningstider, partikelstorleksfördelningar (PSD), restmonomer, molekylvikter, och termiska (isoleringsförmåga, λ) samt mekaniska egenskaper (brytnings- och kompressionsstyrkan) finns samlade i tabeller (se Appendix). Ytterligare finns det bilder i Appendix
bland annat av de polymeriserade EPS produkterna och agglomerationer i reaktorn.
Upplösning av EPS leder till en viskös och klibbig gel-liknande lösning. Ju högre EPS halten är desto
högre blir viskositeten, naturligtvis. Lösningen har en tendens att bli klibbig och forma avlagringar
på ytor. Följande allmänna observationer av problem som uppstod särskilt vid EPS-masskoncentrationer 20% eller högre i samband med låga temperaturer som höjer upplösningshastigheten av den
hög-viskösa och klibbiga lösningen gjordes:
•

tendens för sammansmältning och fastklistrande i klimpar, och

•

ojämn omrörning och omrörningsproblem generellt, särskilt vid ytan och de ytliga delarna
av lösningen (formation av ett ytlager och flytande partiklar på ytan).

Upp till 30 viktprocent av alla de tre olika EPS-kvaliteterna löstes upp i MS framgångsrikt oberoende
av temperatur (25 °C, 50°C och 70°C). De erhållna upplösningsresultaten var till största delen förväntade och logiska, men inte fullständigt. Underdimensionerat ”off-spec”-EPS (LOF) löste sig
snabbast, vilket var förväntat eftersom polymeren var mycket fin och nästan i sand-liknande form.
Emedan överdimensionerat (HOF) och extruderad återvunnen (ERE) EPS bestod av större och grova
partiklar. ERE löste sig generellt näst snabbaste och HOF krävde de längsta tiderna för upplösning.
EREs betydligt lägre MW värde jämfört med LOF och HOF bidrog också till det relativt goda och
snabba lösligheten av ERE i styren [59]. I allmänhet, leder en förhöjning av temperaturen till en
minskning av tiden som krävs för fullständig upplösning av EPS [61]. Däremot, fanns det nog vissa
undantag till den regeln i resultaten. Exempelvis i vissa fall var den genomsnittliga upplösningshastigheten lägre för 50°C än 70°C så som Tabeller 21 och 22 visar. Enligt resultaten var det genomsnittliga förhållandet mellan upplösningstiderna vid 50°C och 70°C 1, som är underligt minst sagt
(se Tabell 22). Ytterligare fanns det inkonsekvenser av upplösningstider med höjda EPS-viktprocenter, det vill säga, med högre EPS-koncentrationer nådde man lägre upplösningstider (se Figurer 27
och 28). Variationen var också relativt hög i LOF- och HOF-proven, särskilt vid rumstemperatur så
som Figur 26 och Tabell 15 visar. Det fanns ett flertal problem, aspekter och osäkerhetsfaktorer i
upplösningsexperimentering som bör beaktas när man analyserar resultaten:
1. upplösningssystemet var antingen öppet eller semi-öppet, och eventuell avdunstning av styren under själva experimenten kunde ej uteslutas varvid den registrerade upplösningsprocenten blev lägre än i verkligheten,

107

Jani Korkiamäki
2. upplösningsgraden fastställdes visuellt, vilket ger utrymme för tolkning av en fullständigt
klar lösning (t.ex. luftbubblor, orenheter, och väldigt fina EPS partiklar problematiska),
3. omrörningen var inte tillräcklig, och
4. värmefluktuationen var signifikant, åtminstone +/- 5 °C grader.
Målet vid polymerisationsexperimenteringen var att nå så höga återanvändningsgrader (massfraktion) av LOF-, HOF- och ERE-EPS som möjligt i produktion av nybildad EPS med korrekt partikelstorleksfördelning. Speciellt ville man undvika formation av LOF-fraktion i den nybildade EPS:n.
Utöver analyser för EPS-pärlor, sammanfattas i Tabell 26 i Appendix-delen alla polymerisationsförsök inklusive både de lyckade och misslyckade försöken. Tabell 27 listar pentanhalter (storleksordning: LOF>HOF>ERE) och molekylvikter (storleksordning: LOF>HOF>ERE) av de tre experimenterade EPS-kvaliteterna. Resultaten visar att HOF och LOF EPS är kemiskt identiska men skiljer sig
i upplösningshastigheten eftersom HOF har en större partikelstorlek än LOF. HOFs långsammare
upplösning jämfört med LOFs avspeglas även i polymerisationsexperimenten. Dvs. i försöken där 5
viktprocent av MS ersättas med HOF och upplöstes direkt i styrensuspensionen resulterade i en större
genomsnittlig partikelstorlek och en skiftning av partikelstorleksfördelningen mot större storlek i
jämförelse med LOF-experimentet under samma reaktionsbetingelser. Emedan när upplösningstiderna för HOF-proven förlängdes blev PSD-kurvorna relativt identiska med LOF-proven. De mest
centrala polymerisationsresultaten är angivna i kapitel 8. De största utmaningarna vid återvinning av
EPS i suspensionspolymerisation var skumbildning, att åstadkomma en tillräckligt effektiv omrörning, att undvika agglomeration i reaktorn och att uppnå korrekt PSD. De största osäkerhetsfaktorerna under projektets lopp är listade nedan.
1. Vid beräkning av peroxidkoncentrationen försummades mängden återvunnen EPS.
2. Både omrörningen (rpm) och stabiliseringen höjdes samtidigt för att förbättra PSD (därav
är det svårt att fastställa vilkendera parametern som påverkade processen mera)
3. Bristfällig kontroll av det stabila tillståndet.
4. Ökad kvalitetskontroll av pärlorna med hjälp av mikroskop och ökad mängd av skumningsstyrka/expanderingen försök skulle ha gett mera information om orsak och verkan.
5. Svårigheter att fastställa den exakta mängden av producerade EPS (svårt att fastställa hur
stor del av satsen var förlorat pga. agglomeration i reaktorn).
I allmänhet, framgår det av resultaten att en ökning i omrörning (varvtal, rpm) och koncentration av
stabiliserande ämnen sänker den genomsnittliga partikelstorleken, och PSD skiftar till minde partikelstorlekar. De erhållna genomsnittliga partikelstorlekarna (d-50) är samlade i de jämförande graferna i Figurerna 34 och 35. Omrörningens och stabiliseringskoncentrationens inverkan på partikelstorlekarna vid olika återanvänd EPS-koncentrationer är samlade i tabellerna 18 och 19. Under det
experimentella arbetet gjordes även följande observationer: för att erhålla en stabil suspension måste

108

Jani Korkiamäki
omrörningen vara tillräckligt kraftfull och att de stabiliserande ämnenas koncentration måste vara
tillräckligt hög. Upplösning av EPS i MS höjde viskositeten i reaktionsblandningen, och för att bibehålla en stabil suspension var man tvungen att öka omrörningen, speciellt med ökande halt av
återvunnen EPS. Emellertid, kan en ökad omrörning öka tendensen för bildning av väldigt fina EPSpartiklar och skum, vilket är icke önskvärt. Ökning av stabiliseringskoncentrationen ensam verkar
inte att markant bidra till stabilisering av suspensionen och möjligtvis ökar det enbart skumningen.
Den mest kritiska punkten för suspensionspolymerisationen var vid det ”klimpiga stadiet” där viskositeten ökar kraftigt och tendensen för agglomeration av polymerpartiklarna är överhängande. Återanvänd-ERE innehållande prov var särskilt problematiska och för att uppnå och bibehålla en stabil
suspension var man tvungen att ändra tiden för tillsatsen av det stabiliserande ämnet A och tillsätta
ämnet genast i början till suspensionsblandningen, medan HOF- och LOF-EPS innehållande satser
lyckades med det konventionella referensreceptet. Utmaningen med detta tillvägagångssätt var att
partikelstorlekarna av ERE-försök blev för små (jämför Figurer 33 och 34 och Tabeller 18 och 19).
Positivt med de mest framgångsrika försöken som innehöll återanvänd-EPS var det faktum att med
identiska partikelstorlekar med referenser nådde man lägre halter av underdimensionerad EPS så som
referenslinjerna i Figurerna 33 och 34 påvisar. Satserna som innehöll återanvänt EPS hade dock andra
problem så som till exempel ökad bildning av överdimensionerad EPS och sämre kvalitet på polymerpärlorna. Pärlornas kvalitet särskilt i de ERE innehållande proven var snarare ovala än sfäriska,
vilket sedan föranledde problem vid expandering och formgjutning. Den generella trenden verka vara
att RM (styrenkoncentration) sjunker med ökande återanvänd EPS-halt (se Figur 32). Trenden verifierades även genom visuella observationer under polymerisation där den stabila punkten hade flyttats till en tidigare tidpunkt och desto högre EPS-halten var desto tidigare nåddes punkten. Den inmatade överloppsperoxiden bidrar dock även till detta fenomen. MW-värden sjönk med ökande återanvänt EPS-halt (se Figur 37), medan polydispersiteten (PD), utöver ett par undantag, sjönk med
ökande återanvänd EPS-halt, vilket var förväntat eftersom PD-indexen för HOF, LOF och ERE var
signifikant lägre jämfört med referensprovets. Enligt mekaniska tester, kan kompressionsstyrkan till
och med växa en aning (se Figur 41), medan brytningsstyrkan minskade (se Figur 42). Lambdavärdet, det vill säga den termiska isoleringsförmågan, verka minska jämfört med referenser, vilket
också är icke-önskvärt (se Figur 43).

10.4 Slutsatser
Löslighetsförsök upp till 30 viktprocent av tre olika EPS-kvaliteter i styren gav relativt tillförlitliga
resultat. Alla EPS-proven kunde framgångsrikt lösas i styren (MS) vid alla de tre undersökta temperaturerna i laboratorieskala. Tydliga skillnader mellan kvaliteternas löslighet noterades i avseende på
tiden för upplösning och temperaturökningens positiva inverkan på lösligheten kunde bekräftas. Min
personliga slutsats på basen av resultaten är att en separat EPS upplösningstank för återvunnen EPS
skulle vara den mest praktiska lösningen i industriell skala, speciellt vid höga halter av återvunnen
EPS. Detta kan dock möjligtvis orsaka tekniska problem pga. klibbigheten hos den högviskösa massan. Emedan, små mängder av EPS eller PS skulle möjligtvis kunna upplösas direkt i suspension på
basen av polymeriseringsresultaten. De facto, är de uppmätta tiderna för upplösnings enbart är visuellt bestämda sänker pålitligheten av resultaten något. Ifall upplösningen av EPS eller PS i MS forskas vidare kunde följande förbättringsförslag beaktas:
1. Upplösningsbehållaren bör vara ett slutet system, och helst utrustad med en automatisk
temperaturkontroll.
2. Upplösningsbehållaren måste vara utrustad med en optimal mekanisk omrörare.
3. Upplösningstillståndet måste kontrolleras med hjälp av transmittans- eller viskositetsmätning.
Suspensionspolymerisationsexperimenten gav varierande resultat när upp till 20 viktsprocent av EPS
var återanvänt i reaktorn (M1) i laboratoriumskala. Generellt, gav de återanvända ”off-spec”-EPS,
mestadels LOF-EPS, innehållande proven bättre resultat både i avseende på pärlornas kvalitet och
mängden producerade underdimensionerad EPS än proven som innehöll återanvänd extruderad EPS
(ERE). Det fanns inte tillräckligt med tid för att fullständigt utreda potentialen för återanvändning av
ERE, och stabiliserings- samt omrörningsnivåerna var valda på basen av resultaten erhållna ur återanvänt ”off-spec”-EPS, antingen HOF eller LOF, innehållande proven. Däremot, för att bibehålla
den stabila suspensionen i ERE-satser var man tvungen att förändra tidpunkten för inmatning av
stabiliserande ämnet A. Tyvärr hade det stabiliserande ämnet A en drastisk inverkan på partikelstorleken. Den genomsnittliga partikelstorleken minskade och mängden producerat LOF-EPS ökade. Utöver detta försämrades partikelformen från sfärisk till oval i de båda grupperna innehållande återanvänt ”off-spec”-EPS såväl som ERE. I ERE innehållande proven var partikelformen anmärkningsvärt
sämre än i ”off-spec”-EPS.

Utmaningar för industriell produktion är:
•

partikelformen,

•

skumning och instabilitet av polymersuspensionen,

•

förorening av reaktorn (t.ex. agglomerationer på reaktorytor) samt blockeringar,

•

problem med överföring av produkten,

•

inadekvat omrörning,

•

rengöring av reaktorn, och slutligen,

•

avbrott i produktionen.

För att förbättra PS-återvinningsprocessen via suspension polymerisation vore det på sin plats att
vidare optimera partikelstorleksfördelningen (PSD) genom följande åtgärder:
1. Reduktion av peroxidmängden i samma förhållande som mängden styren i reaktorn (alltså i
minus återvunnen EPS),
2. minskning av viskositeten genom att öka förhållandet mellan vatten till styren (även om producerat EPS per sats blir lägre),
3. reducering av den totala mängden monomer i reaktorn och således förbättras omrörningen,
4. optimera strukturen av omröraren, möjligtvis med förbättrad vertikal omrörning,
5. reducering av skumning med hjälp av kemikalier såsom skumdämpare,
6. höjning av stabiliseringskoncentration eller reducering av omrörningshastighet eller vice
versa, och
7. optimera omrörningshastigheten enligt polymerisationens olika stadier (t.ex. förhöjning av
omrörningshastigheten under klibbiga stadium).
Ifall fortsatta studier för suspensionspolymerisation skall utföras, vore det ändamålsenligt att utreda
hur upplöst “off-spec”-EPS inverkar på processen i pilot- och produktionsskala. Man bör även beakta
att ERE innehåller avsevärt större mängder av orenheter i jämförelse med “off-spec”-EPS (HOF och
LOF). Därav borde man även utreda möjligheten att utveckla någon sorts filtrerings- eller extraktionsteknik för att avlägsna tillsatsmedel eller orenheter ur ERE, eller även för av PS- och EPS-avfall
i framtiden.

Glossary & Concepts
Some central and useful concepts and terms that appear in the thesis are gathered in this section in
order to ease the reading and the understanding of the text and phenomenon included, and in addition, to keep the text shorter and more consistent.
Adhesion

Adhesion is the tendency of dissimilar particles or surfaces to cling to one another
(cohesion refers to the tendency of similar or identical particles/surfaces to cling to
one another) due to intermolecular forces [Wikipedia].

Agitation

A crucial unit operation in chemical industry and key to many heat and mass transfer
operations. Movement of the components of the mass in the system in such a way
that optimal physical and chemical conditions are provided, for example, by shaking
or stirring.

Alloying

“The combining of polymers, after they have formed, or a polymer and a monomer
into a single-phase, homogeneous polymer material. Some chemical attraction between the combined polymers is usually required to form an alloy. Alloys also form
when two different metals combine [3]”.

Batch reactor (BR)
A reactor type in which all reactants are added in the beginning of the process. The reaction (polymerization) is allowed
to proceed, either for a fixed time, or until some property of the product (monomer conversion, specific gravity, residual
monomer etc.) is reached. The polymerization temperature may be kept constant, the reactor can be in a semiadiabatic
mode in which a fixed coolant load is applied and the temperature is allowed to vary, usually due to exothermic nature of
polymerization, or alternatively, a predetermined temperature trajectory is followed. The residende time distribution
(RTD) is a distribution for the fraction of total material in the reactor that remains in the reactor for the same time (the
reaction time or kettle time). For a BR the RTD is not a distribution at all (a spike) since all the materials remain in the
reactor for the same time and there is no distribution of residence times [16]. Compare to “semi-batch reactor”.
Blending (or mixing)

“The combining of polymers, after they have formed, in such a way that resultant
polymer material is in two or more phases [3]”

Bulk Polymerization
The only components of the formulation in bulk polymerization are pure monomers, the catalysts or the initiator, and molecular weight modifiers [13,14]. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous bulk polymerization are possible, depending on
the solubility of the monomer to the polymer. Monomers that are miscible in their respective polymers, and in this way
polymerize homogeneously in bulk include styrene, vinyl acetate and methyl methacrylate. Examples of typical heterogeneously bulk polymerized monomers are vinyl chloride and acrylonitrile [14]. In this case, the reaction mixture forms a
slurry as the polymers that are insoluble in their monomers precipitate. Bulk polymerizations advantages are that very
pure polymer is produced at a high production rate per unit of the reactor. The drawback is difficulties in temperature
control (thermal control) because of the high viscosity of the reaction mixture associated with the high conversion of polymer [10]. This is particularly true for homogeneous bulk polymerization with high viscosity of the reaction mixture and
the poor heat transfer characteristics. Especially in homogeneous free-radical polymerization the viscosity increases dramatically. Besides, the heat transfer coefficient can be further reduced due to polymer depositing on the reactor walls.
Intermediate conversions often result in acceleration of the rate of heat generation with conversion due to the gel effect.
This restricts the conversion to 55–65% in homogeneous bulk, while heterogeneous bulk can reach slightly higher conversion rates because of the lower increase in viscosity. The actual polymer product in bulk polymerization contains
therefore residual monomer, which can be removed by flash evaporation and steam heating [14].

Coalescence

A process in which two domain phases are combined and form a larger phase domain.

Colloid

A type of homogenous mixture that contains a dispersed phase (the suspended particles) and a continuous phase (the medium of suspension). To qualify as colloid the
mixture should not settle. The term emulsion is often used interchangeably with colloid, but emulsion should be used only when both phases, dispersed and continuous
phases are liquids. See “emulsion”.

Copolymer

A polymer that made up of more than one species of monomers, such as HIPS: a copolymer of acrylonitrile and styrene.

Copolymerization
In copolymerization the polymer is produced by polymerizing a mixture of different monomers. The polymers of this
type are called copolymers. Copolymerization is very useful for creating polymers with a combination of required
properties. For example, polystyrene is brittle and polybutadiene is flexible. Hence, by combining these two monomers, a
polymer that is more flexible than styrene but tougher than polybutadiene is created. The general-purpose rubber GRS (or
SBR), which is a combination of styrene and butadiene, is an example of a copolymer. [18]

Compounding

“The mixing of additives into a plastic, a process often done with extrusion.” [3]

Dispersion

Material comprising more than one phase where at least one of the phases consists of
finely divided phase domains, often in the colloidal size range, dispersed throughout
a continuous phase. (IUPAC definition).

Dispersion polymerization
Dispersion polymerization is a form of precipitation polymerization. The term “dispersion polymerization” has come into
general use because the technique replaced the process of polymer dispersion in the paint industry. In dispersion
polymerization both the monomer and the initiator are soluble in the polymerization medium, but the medium is a poor
solvent for the actual resulting polymer. Thus, at the onset, the reaction mixture is homogeneous, and the polymerization
is initiated in homogeneous solution. Phase separation occurs at an early stage depending on the solvency of the medium
for the produced macroradicals and macromolecules. This results in nucleation and the formation of primary particles.
These primary particles are swollen with by the polymerization medium and the monomer. This results in formation of
spherical particles in the range of about 0.1-10 µm. Typical examples of monomers polymerized with dispersion
polymerization are styrene and methyl methacrylate in hydrocarbons or in C1-C5 alcohols. [29]
Dissolution

“The process of dissolving a solute into a solvent to make a
solution.” [Wikipedia]

Emulsifier

A substance that stabilizes an emulsion by increasing its kinetic stability. See “emulsion”.

Emulsion

A mixture of two or more liquids, such as an oil-in-water emulsion, that are normally
immiscible (unmixable) where one liquid is dispersed in the other, in other words the
other liquid contains the other. The substances will stay mixed with the help of an
emulsifier. Compare with “colloid”

Emulsion polymerization
An emulsion polymerization system converts an aqueous dispersion of monomer(s) by free-radical polymerization into a
stable dispersion of polymer particles in the size range of 0.1-3 µm. Generally, an emulsion system contains the dispersing medium (e.g., water), monomer(s), a water-soluble initiator, and an emulsifying agent (e.g., sodium and potassium
salts of saturated long-chain acids) as main components [16]. Typically, the monomer is insoluble, or scarcely soluble
(e.g., solubility of styrene in water at 70 °C about 4 g/l), in the polymerization medium, but is emulsified into the medium
by the aid of a surfactant (emulsifier or soap). The volume ratio of the monomer phase is usually in the range of 0.1-0.5
and the polymerization temperature is in the range of 40-80 °C. The initiator is, unlike in suspension polymerization, soluble in the medium, but not in the monomer [29]. Surfactant excess forms micelles (ca. 5-10 mm in diameter) that are
clusters of surfactant molecules. A fractional part monomer can be found in the solution. The monomer is present partly
in the form of droplets (ca. 1-10 µm or larger) and partly solubilized in the form of soap-coated micelles (ca. 50-100 Å)
[29]. An emulsion system has normally 1018 micelles/cm3 and 1010-1011 monomer droplets/cm3. The actual polymerization does not occur in monomer droplets, and neither in interior of the micelles (micellar nucleation) nor in the continuous phase (homogeneous nucleation) when the monomer is only slightly soluble. The advantages of emulsion polymerization are low viscosity of the reaction mixture, easy thermal control of the reactor, virtually 100 % conversion are
achievable, high polymerization rates, and on top of that, the final latex may be directly usable. Disadvantages are the
difficulties in removing emulsifier and coagulant from the final polymer (e.g., high residual impurity), and the high cost
of the production compared to suspension systems. Common emulsion processing utilizing applications include copolymerization of styrene and butadiene (SBR rubber) and polymerization of chloroprene (neoprene rubber). Vinyl acetate
and several acrylic monomers are polymerized in emulsion in the manufacture of latex paints, too. [14]

Fouling

“The accumulation of unwanted material on solid surfaces to the detriment of function. Other terms used in the literature to describe fouling include: deposit formation,
encrustation, crudding, deposition, scaling, scale formation, slagging, and sludge formation [Wikipedia]”.

Free radical

A.k.a. generally as radical. Radicals are reactive atoms, molecules or ions that have
unpaired valence electrons. This makes radicals highly chemically reactive, and gives
them the tendency for initiating chain reactions, which is extremely beneficial for
producing polymer chains. Radical initiators have significant role in polymerization
manufacture and industry, and can be generated in a number of ways, including redox reactions, ionizing radiation, heat, electrical discharges and electrolysis.

Heterogeneous polymerization

A polymerization process in which the produced polymer is insoluble, leading to precipitation (powder or granular) polymerization [Wikipedia].

Homogeneous polymerization

A polymerization process in which the produced polymer remains soluble [Wikipedia].

Initiator

“A source of any chemical species that reacts with monomer (single molecule that
can form chemical bonds) to form an intermediate compound capable of linking successively with a large number of other monomers into a polymeric compound.” [Encyclopedia Britannica]

Interfacial polymerization
In interfacial polymerization system two phases are required, for instance, an organic phase with an acid chloride and an
aqueous phase with a diamine. The actual polymerization occurs at the interface between the two immiscible liquid
phases followed by a step-growth polymerization mechanism. The rate of the polymerization is high, and a high-molecular-weight polymer is produced at room temperature, which is atypical for the usual step-growth polymerization. The diffusion rates of monomers to the polymerization interface controls the rate of the polymerization [14].
Isomer

“Each of two or more compounds with the same formula but a different arrangement
of atoms in the molecule and different properties”. [Oxford Dictionaries

Lambda λ

“The heat conductivity of a material is known as its lambda value [W/mK]. The thermal conductivity of a material is defined as the quantity of heat transferred in a given
time through a distance L, in a direction normal to a surface area A, due to a temperature difference ΔT, and when the heat transfer is dependent only on the temperature
gradient. Thus, the lower a material’s lambda value, the better its ability to insulate.“

Plasticization

“Plasticization is the absorption of small chemically benign molecules that migrate
between the macromolecular chains, thus allowing the plastic part to lose stiffness.”
[62]

Polydispersity index (dispersity) “Polydisperse systems display an array of chain lengths which broaden the molecular
weight distribution. Polydispersity index (PDI) is used as a measure of broadness of
molecular weight distribution. The larger the PDI, the broader the molecular weight.
PDI of a polymer is calculated as the ratio of weight average by number average molecular weight. Information on PDI is required for improved selection of polymers
for an application.” [63]

form polymer chains.

Polystyrene

A synthetic aromatic hydrocarbon polymer produced from styrene.

Precipitation polymerization
Precipitation polymerization is heterogeneous form of solution polymerization. In precipitation polymerization the polymer is insoluble in its monomer or in the monomer-solvent solution and leads to formation of macroscopically apparent
“polymer precipitates” [29]. The polymerization begins in a homogeneous phase and quickly turns into heterogeneous
since the polymer precipitates as a second phase, the initial state of the reaction mixture is the same as that in dispersion
polymerization (homogeneous solution) [14,29]. The overall kinetics in precipitation polymerization is assumed as the
sum of independent reactions in the two different phases, that is to say, the monomer-rich phase and the polymer-rich
phase. In the former phase normal solution kinetics is followed, and in the latter monomer-filled phase, all reactions (e.g.,
termination and propagation) may become diffusion-controlled. PVC, polyacrylenitrile, and low-density polyethylenes
are some examples of well-known polymerization processes that follow precipitation polymerization kinetics under certain operating conditions [14]. See “dispersion polymerization”.
Resin

“A polymer that has not yet been formed into its final useful shape” [3].

R-value

“The R-value is a measure of resistance to heat flow through a given thickness of
material. The higher the R-value, the more thermal resistance the material has and
therefore the better its insulating properties.” [https://www.thegreenage.co.uk/article/thermal-conductivity-r-values-and-u-values-simplified/]

Sedimentation

The tendency of particles in suspension to be separated of the fluid against a barrier
due to forces like gravity, centrifugal acceleration or electromagnetism.

Semi-batch reactor

A.k.a. a semi-continuous reactor. A reactor type in which some of the reactants are
added during the process or reaction (polymerization) while others remain in the reactor for full kettle times. The added materials may be insignificant in volume, but
not in effect (e.g. free radical initiators) [16]. Compare to a “batch reactor”.

Solid Catalyzed Polymerization
Production of HDPE, LLDPE, and isotactic polypropylene is done in low-pressure reactors in the presence of ZieglerNatta catalysts. Most of the catalyst are heterogeneous, solid catalysts that can be supported or unsupported, although,
some of the catalysts are used in liquid form. The monomer can be in contact with the catalyst in different forms, namely,
in gaseous (the gas-phase process), pure liquid (the liquid solution process), or dissolved in a diluent (the slurry process).
Whatever the case, the porous catalyst fractures and fragments of the catalyst are dispersed in the polymer and become
the place for polymerization to happen. [14]
In gas-phase polymerization the system does not involve any liquid phase in the polymerization zone. Polymerization
occurs at the interface between the solid catalyst and the during polymerization with monomers swollen polymer matrix.
The role of the gas is to supply monomers, mix the polymer particles, and to remove the heat of the reaction. The gasphase polymerization is also known as dry polymerization. Solution processes unique advantages include better molecular weight control, more easily controlled process variables due to homogeneous phase polymerization, and high productivity because of high temperatures. [14]
The liquid slurry polymerization has by far the most of solid catalyzed olefin polymerization technologies. The biggest
advantage is the excellent temperature control of the process. The swelling of the polymer in the slurry medium can give
major problems as the production rate is lowered. Manufacture of propylene in n-heptane in the presence of a solid Ziegler-Natta catalyst is one example of slurry polymerization. The growing polymer chains are attached to the solid surface.
The polymer is quickly turning insoluble and precipitates forming a separate solid phase swollen with the monomer/solvent. In certain processes, every catalyst particle generates one particle (e.g., limited particle agglomeration). Many dif-

171

Jani Korkiamäki
ferent types of homogeneous catalyst systems have been developed lately for precipitation polymerization (e.g., metallocenes). Here the polymerization starts in solution, and once the polymer chains grow enough, they become insoluble, agglomerate, and finally precipitate forming a separate solid phase. [14]
Solid-state polymerization
With solid-state polymerization it is possible to produce macroscopic single crystals, and sometimes also crystals of high
optical quality. The crystal structure and the symmetry of the monomer controls the propagation reaction. Hence, sometimes propagation leads to a crystal-to-crystal transformation. Several novel polymers of perfect stereoregularity are produced by solid-state polymerization, including polydiacetylenes, crystalline 1,4-polybutadiene, ultrathin layers of vinyl
polymers, and many optically active polymers in crystalline organization [14].
Solubility

“The maximum amount of an analyte that can be dissolved in a particular
solvent or mixture of solvents at well-defined conditions (temperature, pressure,
etc.)” [33]

Solvation

“Solvation describes the interaction of solvent with dissolved molecules. Ionized and
uncharged molecules interact strongly with solvent, and the strength and nature of
this interaction influence many properties of the solute, including solubility,
reactivity, and color, as well as influencing the properties of the solvent such as the
viscosity and density. In the process of solvation, ions are surrounded by a
concentric shell of solvent. Solvation is the process of reorganizing solvent and
solute molecules into solvation complexes. Solvation involves bond formation,
hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces.” [Wikipedia]

Solution polymerization
In solution polymerization the monomer is polymerized in a solution [4]. Both the polymer and the monomer are dissolved in the catalyst containing non-reactive solvent. The monomer concentration is lowered by the solvent, and hence
the heat generation rate per unit volume of the reactor. The lower viscosity allows a higher heat removal rate than in bulk
polymerization, and the solvent allows the use for reflux condensers. The heat of the polymerization can be removed with
reflux cooling by evaporation of solvent. The condensed vapor can be recycled back to the reacting mass. On the other
hand, problems may arise from remixing the condensed solvent with the viscous reacting mass. Solution processes are
used for example in production of rubbers and LLDPE (linear low-density polyethylene) [13, 14]. The main disadvantages of the process are dealing with environmentally unfriendly solvent, making solvent recovery crucial [10], and in
addition, the separation of polymer from the solution may become expensive. The polymerization kinetics are either homogeneous or heterogeneous (precipitation) [14].
Styrene
