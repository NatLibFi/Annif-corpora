Abstract:
Along with the increase of social media usage, the consumer behavior has changed. This has
forced companies to adapt to the changes and modify their communication strategy in order
to attract customers. This change is visible as companies worldwide spend large amounts on
integrating social media marketing into their communication strategies. As globalization is a
fact and consumer trust is decreasing, companies must find ways to stand out but also stay
relevant to consumers. Culture has been shown to play a significant role in creating effective
traditional marketing, but what is still unclear is whether it plays an equally large role in social
media marketing.
This thesis explores how female consumers of the millennial generation perceive a foreign
company’s ads on social media. More specifically, it examines how brand awareness and trust
can be created with social media marketing. The Finnish cosmetics company Dermoshop was
chosen for the case study as they are expanding to new markets, i.e. Denmark and Germany,
using English social media marketing. The millennial generation was chosen based on the
assumption that they are the main group the company will reach with its marketing; they are
active social media users and might be more used to encountering English information. The
study was carried out by conducting two focus group discussions consisting of five Danish
consumers and five German consumers born between 1991-1998. The discussions took place
in Zoom where participants were to discuss social media usage, social media advertising, and
examples of the focus company’s social media ads. The examples of social media ads were
produced specifically for this purpose from the company’s material and included cultural cues
and varying types of content. Both discussions were recorded and transcribed, and the
transcriptions were later coded into central themes.
The analysis and the results show several differences between groups that can be connected
to cultural differences and the theoretical framework, e.g. Hofstede and Hall’s culture

theories. Cultural dimensions are visible to some extent and it can, therefore, be concluded
that culture affects consumers’ perception of social media ads. For instance, the study
identified innovation, informativeness and authenticity as important factors in creating
effective social media ads across cultures. The results also indicated that the millennial
generation is an informed and conscious group, which demands the communication to be
adapted to their needs and preferences. This thesis, thus, provides valuable knowledge about
the generation and what needs to be considered when producing social media ads targeted at
the millennial consumers in different cultures.

1. Introduction
While technology has become a major part of our lives, our behavior and values have
also changed. However, being or feeling socially connected has been considered a
basic human need for a longer time (Cacioppo & Patrick, 2008). Along with
technology development, this might be an explanation as to why social media have
become such an important element in modern society.
The number of social network users worldwide is expected to increase from 3.6 billion
in 2020 to 4.4 billion users in 2025 (Statista, 2020a). While social media allow
consumers to engage in social interaction, new ways to reach consumers also appear
for companies. That companies have adapted their strategy to the changed consumer
behavior is visible. This is seen as companies worldwide spent around 87.7 million
euros on social media advertisements in 2020, and the number is expected to reach
119 million by 2025 (Statista, 2020b). Furthermore, because of globalization and
increased digital usage, borders between countries are diminishing. This results in
more competition and a larger amount and variety of products. To survive, companies
must create a strategy to appear relevant to the consumer and to differentiate them
from competitors in all markets, including the home market. (Durand, 2018)
Companies are embracing social media marketing strategies to strengthen their
position on the market by engaging with consumers and gaining great amounts of
consumer insights (Hudson, Roth, Madden & Hudson, 2015). Social media have, thus,
generated ways to engage in a two-way communication, as firms can collaborate with
consumers. In the same way, users of social media platforms are collaborating by
sharing personal opinions and experience among their peers about products and
services. By doing so, they can create mass communication and group acceptance of a
product, which can benefit a company significantly (Shareef, Mukerji, Alryalat,
Wright & Dwivedi, 2018). Furthermore, it has been shown that consumers use social
media sites mainly for social interaction and information-seeking purposes (Whiting
& Williams, 2013). Social media advertising can, therefore, function as a good tool

1

for companies to quickly communicate their message to a great audience and reach
new consumers.
Although several studies have examined social media marketing strategies (e.g. Khan
et al., 2016; Dehghani & Tumer, 2015), limited research has investigated culture’s role
in effective social media advertising. Extensive research has concluded that culture
affects traditional marketing perception, as, for instance, some values are culture
specific. Yet, it is unclear whether culture plays an equally great role when advertising
on social media. The aim of this research is, therefore, to explore how consumers
encounter and perceive foreign social media advertisements. Foreign social media
advertisements can in this case be described as ads created by companies originating
from another country.
Furthermore, as consumer trust in companies and brands has declined (Chen & Cheng,
2019), it is crucial for companies to consider whether culture might influence the
perceived trustworthiness of social media ads. For example, as of February 2019, only
36% of the U.S. millennial generation indicated that they trust social media
advertisements (Statista, 2020c). The millennials, also called generation Y, is a large
generation and the foremost consumer generation (Tilford, 2018). Therefore,
companies cannot afford ignoring them and their values. This generation is also the
main driver for the growth of the cosmetic industry (Statista Research Department,
2020), which this thesis focuses on.
Additionally, millennials are known for making emotional decisions, rather than
rational, in purchase situations (Parment, 2013). However, what is still unclear is how
these consumers relate to trust in purchasing products from foreign companies, and
how much culture influences these decisions. Similarly, it is also uncertain whether
cultural adaption of a firm’s social media communication is needed to appeal to
millennials. Great questions, thus, remain: how can a company create a trustworthy
image on a market by solely using social media marketing, and what should a foreign
company’s social media marketing look like to create initial trust?

2

1.1 Research problem and approach
As the phenomenon of globalization is continuing to shape and adjust our societies, a
‘global consumer’ has developed. A global consumer culture in this sense would mean
that companies can standardize their marketing strategies, which would appeal to
consumers worldwide, no matter the culture (Usunier & Lee, 2013). However, some
say the evidence against this theory is strong. According to Usunier and Lee (2013),
purchase motivation among other factors do not globalize. They argue that consumers,
with the help of their cultural background and identity, construct the brands they meet.
This suggests that even though global consumers exist and a brand in theory is seen as
‘global’, cultural factors will greatly affect how the consumers perceive it and act
towards it.
Furthermore, a brand’s reputation will affect the consumer’s attitude towards the brand
and its social media advertising (Boateng & Okoe, 2015). Thus, a good reputation
would lead to more positive actions towards the brand. This, however, would suggest
that consumers automatically have more negative attitudes towards brands new to a
market, since they have no existing reputations. These companies would not have the
same opportunities to persuade consumers with social media ads to act favorably
towards the brand. Therefore, a company in this situation must create awareness and
trust, as buying a new brand implies risk for the consumer (Baumgartner & Steenkamp,
1996). In the cosmetics industry, millennials tend to consider authenticity, health
aspects, and the ingredients of the products before making a purchase decision (Ishak,
Omar, Khalid, Ghafar & Hussain, 2019). In this industry, it is thus important to
persuade the consumers that the company is credible and that the products can be
trusted. Additionally, because of the numerous corporate scandals which have
occurred during the last two decades or so, consumers are careful in trusting both
companies and social media in general (e.g. Gillespie, Dietz, & Lockey, 2014; Brown,
2020). Achieving consumer trust is, therefore, now more important than ever for
companies to succeed on the markets.
Limited research has examined how social media advertisement affects consumer
trust. Additionally, research analyzing factors influencing consumers to trust
unfamiliar foreign companies, as well as culture’s impact, is scarce. Extensive research
3

was done studying social media in the developmental stage (e.g. Mangold & Faulds,
2009; Akar & Topçu, 2011; Kelly, Kerr & Drennan, 2010). Fresh research is,
therefore, needed to examine the effects as social media are established in the society
and consumers have more knowledge about the platforms. This thesis intends to fill
these gaps.

1.2 Previous research
Social media marketing creates opportunities for a quick and extensive spread of
information if members of the platforms start sharing information about products and
brands in their network (Chu, 2011). Traditionally, advertising has been perceived
negatively, as it is often using an intrusive and forced approach. According to
Edwards, Li and Lee (2002), advertisement interrupts a person’s normal viewing
processing and might lead to a negative reaction. However, when the advertisement is
seen as relevant to the viewer it can be considered valuable and could, therefore,
generate a more positive response (Zeng, Huang & Dou, 2009). This also applies to
advertisements on social media. Additionally, negative attitudes towards social media
advertising are created because of the viewers’ previous negative experience with
traditional advertisements. (Kelly, Kell & Drennan, 2010)
Furthermore, the fact that culture affects the effectiveness of traditional
advertisements, as some values might be culture specific, is known. Standardized
international marketing might in this way lead to negative consumer responses. (Cui,
Yang, Wang & Liu, 2012) Foreign cues are elements a consumer associates with a
certain country. These can be used in advertisements to highlight the brand’s image as
well as adapt it to the country in which the product is advertised. It has been shown
that using cues that are congruent with the viewer’s idea of the country leads to higher
effectiveness. These cues must, therefore, be carefully considered when advertising in
a different country to avoid misunderstandings or distorted interpretations. (Aicher,
2014) However, foreign cues that are incongruent with the culture in which a product
is advertised, can be effective if used to position the company as originating from a
specific country (Cui et al., 2012). If culture also affects the effectiveness of social

4

media advertisement in the same way, it can be seen as crucial for companies to
similarly adapt those ads to culture.
According to Hovland and Weiss (1951), consumers evaluate the credibility of the
information

before

communication. Advertising credibility has, therefore, been assessed as essential in
creating favorable consumer attitudes towards social media marketing (Akar & Topçu,
2011). Jap (2010) concludes that lack of reputation, together with low trust and
credibility, have shown to make consumers prefer local brands over foreign ones (Jap,
2010). However, it must be explored whether this is still the case with millennials as
they might be more used to encountering foreign brands.
This means that small companies that use social media advertisements when entering
new markets must prioritize creating a trustworthy and credible image. This is essential
if the company is to compete with local brands and foreign brands with a reputation.
Moreover, the advertisements should be informative, entertaining, and relevant for the
consumer to be perceived positively (Taylor, Lewin & Strutton, 2011). Whether
relevancy in this context also includes cultural congruency, is unclear.
In summary, trust and credibility is crucial for a company using social media
marketing, and especially for companies entering new markets. However, more
research is needed examining how a company can achieve this image across cultures
by solely using social media advertisements. More research is also necessary to
examine which role culture plays in creating effective social media marketing.

1.3 Research setting
To illustrate the topic of the thesis, the Finnish cosmetic company Dermoshop is used.
It was founded 1977 and started as a company delivering sets of lotion, shower gel and
hand soap to hospitals with the purpose of taking care of the patients. As time went
on, the hospital staff started using the products as well and began ordering products
for their own use. The business took off and today the company has an assortment of
nearly 400 skin-friendly products. The company’s official name is Dermoshop Oy Ab,
5

but the brand is called Dermosil. The focus company will, therefore, be referred to as
Dermosil when discussing its marketing practices in the study.
The head office, which is located in Korsnäs, Finland, has around 60 permanent
employees. In addition to the business in Finland, subsidiaries are found in Sweden,
Estonia, and Russia. The parent company’s turnover in 2019 was 22.8 million euros,
and the number of active customers in Finland are approximately 90.000.
Their products are described as “a gift for the skin”, as many of the products are
allergy- and asthma friendly, containing little or no perfume or additives. All products
are mainly sold via the company’s web shop, or through an ordering form. The
ordering form is included in the customer magazine, which is sent out six times a year
to consumers who have signed up for it. The customer magazine includes information
about products, tips for using the products, and samples. To reach the consumers
further, Dermoshop is also present on both Instagram and Facebook. The company’s
main target group is women in the age 35-55, as well as people in need of sensitive
products.
Dermoshop wants to expand the business by entering the European market and
opening an English web shop. However, as it is a small company with a small
marketing budget, they are planning to only use digital marketing, i.e. advertisements
on social media and google. The issue the company is facing is, therefore, whether it
is possible to reach new consumers on new markets by only relying on digital
marketing. To succeed on the markets, their digital marketing activities must create
enough awareness to form consumer trust. Because of their small budget, another issue
they are facing is whether they can successfully reach the new consumers on the
markets with English marketing and an English web shop. (Dermoshop, n.d.; A. -S.
Strand, personal communication, November 2, 2020).

1.4 Limitations
As Dermoshop is a cosmetics company, the thesis is studying the topics and relevant
issues when marketing cosmetics products. Products in this industry includes among
6

other, skincare, makeup, hair care, and toiletries. The cosmetics industry has seen
significant growth and is benefitting greatly from the increased usage of social media
(Biron, 2019).
Dermoshop’s plans to expand to the European market involves an interest in several
markets. However, the thesis is limited to focusing only on Germany and Denmark.
These are the markets the company are going to direct most of their marketing
communication to, and they are, thus, relevant to focus on. Furthermore, in Europe,
Germany was the largest consumer of cosmetics products in 2019, with a total
consumption value of approximately 14 billion euros (Statista, 2020d). Denmark’s
consumption, however, landed at approximately one million euros. (Statista, 2020d)
As the markets indeed differ regarding the consumption of cosmetics, it is, therefore,
also interesting to compare cosmetics ads in the two markets and the consumers’
perception.
As stated earlier, the thesis examines female millennials/generation Y consumers.
Millennials are defined as individuals born approximately between 1982-1999 (e.g.
Twenge, 2010), and is seen as an important group of consumers for retailers (Parment,
2013). According to Parment (2012), this generation has a significant purchasing
power and know their rights as consumers. They have grown up in a society defined
by brands and an overflow of commercial information, which makes them a
demanding generation with limited loyalty (Parment, 2012). They are often identified
as the first digital generation, as they have grown up surrounded by various kinds of
digital communication tools. Additionally, they are used to receiving and processing
information quickly, and are characterized as multi-taskers. (Venter, 2017). Even
though Dermoshop’s target audience is women aged 35-55, they believe millennials
are the consumers they will reach on the German and Danish markets. This decision
is based on the assumption that these consumers use social media the most and are old
enough for the brand. Furthermore, consumers in the millennial generation might also
be more used to encounter foreign brands, as well as English marketing
communication.
Furthermore, as Dermoshop is only going to use digital marketing, i.e. social media
ads and google ads, on the new markets it is relevant to study these tools. To narrow
7

it down this thesis focuses only on social media, i.e. Facebook and Instagram, and the
advertising on these platforms. The focus company is present on Facebook and
Instagram and has, therefore, also chosen to continue communicating through the same
channels when expanding. Lastly, the study is limited to examining how millennials
perceive advertising on these channels. Advertising in this context means the paid
advertisements targeted at millennials. Clicking the ads will bring the consumers to
the company’s web shop.

1.5 Purpose and research questions
The purpose of the thesis is to examine how consumers across cultures perceive a
foreign cosmetics company’s social media marketing. In 2019, consumers for the first
time, spent more time on mobile devices than watching TV; the average adult in the
United States spent three hours and 43 minutes on mobile devices (eMarketer, 2019).
According to eMarketer (2019), the consumers spend most of the time using apps on
their mobile devices, listening to audio, and using social media networks. Social media
are, consequently, the channels through which companies can reach the consumers
most effectively. Due to this trend, the thesis focuses on the social media marketing.
In this case, social media advertisements are analyzed in the light of how it can be used
to create trust and awareness across cultures, with the goal of increasing purchase
intention. Previously, research has examined that cultural differences have not been
reflected in companies’ digital communication and behavior (Goodman & Goodman,
2009). However, nowadays, more attention is given especially to advertising, and the
fact that it might be perceived differently depending on culture (Usunier & Lee, 2013).
Companies are, therefore, including cultural elements in their communication to be
perceived as more relevant to the receiver. Moreover, as globalization today has
affected us and our ways of living for a longer time, it is relevant to shed new light on
the situation and study the changes it has resulted in. The thesis, therefore, analyzes
culture, and aims to provide fresh knowledge about how today’s consumers react to
foreign companies and their communication through social media marketing.

8

As the thesis is using the Finnish company Dermoshop to illustrate the situation, the
topic is analyzed from a Finnish company’s perspective and the specific issues that
might arise. The company is entering new western European markets, and cultural
issues are, thus, naturally an essential part of the topic studied. To be able to outline
cultural differences and factors influencing the perception of advertisements, the
analysis of the results is based on Hofstede and Hall’s culture theories. These theories
are widely used for analyzing culture in several types of marketing contexts, such as
advertising. The theories give a clear overview of cultures and values existing in
certain cultures. However, as these theories have mainly been used for traditional
advertising, the result of using them for social media advertising might look different.
If this is the case, it might also be possible to see whether culture still matters when
advertising on social media. The main themes for the thesis are, therefore, culture and
social media marketing, and how they interrelate in the matters of creating trust and
positive consumer perception.
Hence, the research questions that the thesis intends to answer are:
1. How can foreign companies create consumer awareness in different cultures through
social media ads?
2. Which foreign cues in social media cosmetics ads can increase positive consumer
perception across cultures?
3. What should the social media ads look like to create trust and increase purchase
intention across cultures?

1.6 Definition of key concepts
Consumer trust
Trust in this case refers to consumer trust in companies and in consumption situations.
Moorman, Zaltman and Deshpande (1992) define trust as the “willingness to rely on
an exchange partner in whom one has confidence” (p. 315). Trust thus involves a
relationship between two parts which includes a certain exchange. This exchange
entails that confidence must be built in order to successfully create trust. The authors
9

also state that trust decreases vulnerability. This means that an individual can be more
willing to act in an exchange situation if the partner, such as a company offering an
interesting product, is seen as trustworthy as the situation’s entailed risk thus
decreases.

Culture
Culture as a concept is very broad, and several factors are influencing it. According to
Usunier and Lee (2013), culture affects individual behavior but is not determined by
it. The authors state that it is about norms and rules a certain group of people feel is
correct in a given situation. Furthermore, it includes for example symbols, language,
and social organizations, which all contribute to the functioning and identity of a
society. In short, culture may then be seen as habits and customs shared by a group of
people, and how particular situations are interpreted in a specific context (Usunier &
Lee, 2013).
In marketing, culture often refers to the consumption-related behavior and consumer
values on different markets (He & Wang, 2017). According to Arnould and Thompson
(2018), it is also about market relationships as well as systems that normalize particular
consumer identities. Finally, it is of great importance to understand what is relevant
for certain cultures, as it might determine the company’s success (Cui et al., 2012).

Consumer perception
Perception is a process where stimuli is selected, organized, and analyzed. When
stimuli are encountered, meaning is attributed by analyzing them through the personal
background consisting of beliefs, disposition, and attitudes. The process includes
actively and continuously analyzing and categorizing information that our senses bring
throughout the day. By interpreting information, it creates perceptual patterns which
are eventually stored in memory. (Jansson-Boyd, 2010). This is done by linking
previous experience to the new stimuli, which makes the process of understanding the

10

surroundings easier and quicker (Payne, Bettman, Johnson, 1993). Consumer
perception then, is how a consumer perceives objects and stimuli in consumption
situations. As perception is linked to stimuli from previous experiences, the degree of
awareness and the stimuli a consumer notices also depend on this (Jansson-Boyd,
2010).

Purchase intention
Purchase intention is the desire a consumer feels to buy something (Chen, Hsu, & Lin,
2010). The concept describes the factors that motivates consumers to purchase
products or services (Azjen, 1991). It is an important part of consumer behavior, and
to fully comprehend consumer behavior it is essential to be able to interpret the
attitudes, evaluation processes, and other internal factors influencing the decision that
leads to a purchase (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1977).

Social media marketing
Social media can be described as Internet-based applications that allow creating,
sharing, and exchanging user-generated content (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010). Social
media marketing is, according to Tuten and Solomon (2018), the activity of using
“social media technologies, channels and software to create, communicate, deliver,
and exchange offerings that have value for an organization’s stakeholders” (p.19).
Social media marketing in this thesis refers to companies’ paid advertising on social
media channels, targeting a specific group of people. Additionally, many types of
social media exist, but in this thesis the concept functions as an umbrella term for
Facebook (social networking site), and Instagram (photo-sharing application).

2. Literature review
The purpose of this chapter is to examine previous research and provide a deeper
understanding of the main themes that constitutes the thesis. Relevant studies and
theories are reviewed and discussed to provide information about the topics culture,
communication, and consumer behavior. The following subchapters, therefore, shape
the theoretical framework which is used as the base of the study.

2.1 Cross-cultural communication
Companies face multiple strategic choices when entering new markets. Depending on,
for example, the individual situation, products, and possibilities, companies must make
choices regarding where, when, and how to enter. Culture has been shown to clearly
influence consumer behavior and consumption (e.g. Soares, Farhangmehr & Shoham,
2007). For example, it has been shown that consumers from different cultures interpret
corporate communication differently. Furthermore, research has also presented facts
stating that consumers prefer communication or products congruent with their culture
(Jianlin, 2008). Due to this reason, research is continuously trying to discover how
cultural factors affect consumer behaviors and certain marketing activities, such as
social media marketing (Khan, Dongping & Wahab, 2016).

2.1.1

Hofstede’s dimensions of national culture

When studying social systems, it can be difficult to understand and examine them
without a simplified visualization (Hofstede, 2001). To grasp such abstract concepts,
we use models. One of the most used models for examining culture is Hofstede’s
cultural dimensions. Typically, it has been used to identify cultural characteristics of
national markets (Song, Moon, Chen & Houston, 2018). The model can be used to
explain how culture influences advertising (Chang, Huh, McKinney, Sar, Wei &
Schneeweis, 2009), and companies can benefit from the model as it can help them
understand how advertising appeals differ across cultures (Albers-Miller & Gelb,
12

1996). Hofstede’s framework has been frequently used for these purposes, but due to
a lack of other compatible frameworks, most research focused on culture and
advertising might be restricted. It has thus received some criticism claiming it should
be renewed in order to, for instance, match modern values better. (Paek, Nelson &
Vilela, 2011) However, as numerous researchers have found support for the
framework in more modern contexts, such as electronic advertising (Saleem, Larimo,
Ummik & Kuusik, 2015), it can still be seen as valuable for studying social media
advertising.
For developing effective communication, the focus must be on understanding the
receiver. In advertising the central part must then be the consumer (De Mooij &
Hofstede, 2010). Cultural values are essential as they determine the personality and
identity of consumers (De Mooij & Hofstede, 2010). According to Hofstede (2001),
values in this case can be seen as something that subjectively defines rationality.
Furthermore, he states that a distinction has to be made between the values the desired
and the desirable: i.e. what people desire versus what people think they should desire.
Furthermore, advertising tends to aim for appealing to the desired value (De Mooij &
Hofstede, 2010).
Hofstede’s model of cultural dimensions is based on values on national level. The
model consists of six dimensions that distinguish cultures: power distance,
individualism/collectivism, masculinity/femininity, uncertainty avoidance, long/short-term orientation, and indulgence/restraint (Hofstede, 2001; Hofstede, Hofstede
& Minkov, 2010). The model positions 76 countries on scales from zero to 100 for
every dimension, in relative to the other countries (De Mooij & Hofstede, 2010).
According to Hofstede et al. (2010), power distance is defined as “the extent to which
the less powerful members of institutions and organizations within a country expect
and accept that power is distributed unequally.” (p. 61). The societies in countries that
score high on the power distance index consist of social hierarchies where everyone
knows his place (De Mooij & Hofstede, 2010). Power distance in advertising can be
visible in how people interrelate with each other. In high power distance cultures, the
elder advises the younger, but in low power distance cultures, such as Denmark, it is
the other way around. (De Mooij, 2019)

Members of an individualistic culture will identify themselves according to individual
characteristics, whereas members of a collectivistic culture are classified according to
group memberships. The differences between these cultures can, therefore, be
identified according to mindsets of “I” or “we”. (Hofstede et al., 2010) Hence,
advertising in individualistic cultures should persuade, whereas advertising in
collectivistic cultures is used for building relationships and trust between seller and
buyer (De Mooij & Hofstede, 2010).
Furthermore, masculine cultures are identified by an emphasis on the ego and
achievement, whereas feminine cultures emphasize the relationship with others and
quality of life (Hofstede et al., 2010). In feminine cultures, men tend to do more of the
household shopping than in masculine cultures (De Mooij & Hofstede, 2010). In
masculine cultures, performance and success are important, which is why status brands
and luxury products, such as jewelry or expensive cars, are used to demonstrate one’s
success (De Mooij, 2019). Therefore, when advertising products in a masculine
culture, status and class could be highlighted to appeal to the consumers.
The index for uncertainty avoidance, however, states how well members of the culture
handle the uncertainty of the future and what will happen. Needs for structure and rules
are common in cultures with high scores. Additionally, the people in these cultures are
identified as less open to change as they feel threatened by uncertainty and try to avoid
those situations. (Hofstede et al., 2010) De Mooij (2019) explains that in high
uncertainty avoidance cultures, such as Germany, purity is frequently used in
advertisements to attract consumers. This is done to lower the feelings of uncertainty
and risk.
The dimension of long-/short-term orientation describes the orientation towards the
future. Long-term orientation is seen as “the fostering of virtues oriented toward future
rewards—in particular, perseverance and thrift”, and short-term orientation as “the
fostering of virtues related to the past and present—in particular, respect for tradition,
preservation of ‘face,’ and fulfilling social obligations” (Hofstede et al., 2010, p. 239).
In other words, long-term orientation stands for investment in the future and shortterm orientation more on pursuit of happiness (De Mooij & Hofstede, 2010).
Advertising in short-term orientation cultures emphasizes urgency and typically
includes phrases such as “don’t wait” or “instant pleasure”. Advertising in these
14

cultures highlights the need to live in the present without thinking about the future (De
Mooij, 2019).
The last and most recently added dimension, indulgence/restraint, identifies the degree
of happiness, control of life, and the importance of leisure activities (Hofstede et al.,
2010). Furthermore, it includes desires and impulses, and to what extent the people in
the cultures control them; “indulgence” stands for weaker and “restraint” for stronger
control. Denmark is an example of an indulgent culture, meaning they possess
generally positive attitudes and spend their money according to their own rules.
Germany on the other hand, scores low on the index, making it a restrained culture
where, for example, saving is important. This would mean that consumers in restrained
cultures purchase only if necessary. Advertisements in these cultures should, therefore,
highlight the necessity and importance of the product, rather than quality or popularity.
(Hofstede Insights, 2020; Hofstede et al., 2010)
According to this theory, a country’s score on the scales can indicate what the
communication should look like to appeal to consumers on that market. The markets
investigated in this thesis, Germany and Denmark, are in many cases thought to be
fairly similar markets considering the geographical locations of the countries.
However, according to Hofstede Insights (2020), the cultures only score similarly on
power distance, as well as individualism/collectivism; they are both identified as low
power distance and truly individualistic cultures. On other dimensions, the two
cultures differ noticeably. Germany is clearly a masculine, restrained culture, with
high scores on both long-term orientation and uncertainty avoidance; Denmark is
undoubtedly a feminine, indulgent, and short-term oriented culture, as well as low
uncertainty avoidant. According to Hofstede’s theory, the communication in these
cultures should, thus, also differ.

2.1.2

Hall’s culture theory

In many cases, research uses several theories to achieve a deeper analysis. Hofstede’s
model of cultural dimensions is often used together with the theory of high-/low
context cultures. The theory was introduced by Edward Hall and characterizes cultures
15

according to how the people relate to each other in terms of, for instance,
communication and social harmony (Kim, Pan & Park, 1998). Although useful, Hall’s
theory classifies cultures according to one dimension only. It might, therefore, be
beneficial to use it as a complement to Hofstede’s framework. By using Hall’s theory,
the more verbal communication aspect is also taken into account.
The model suggests two extremes, high- and low context, and identifies cultures
according to the degree of context in people’s communication systems (De Mooij,
2019). In high-context cultures the communication relies on the context, meaning that
a great amount of the information is in the context of the situation (De Mooij, 2019).
According to Hall (1976), an individual with something on his mind expect others in
the discussion to understand what is bothering him, without stating it directly. Because
of this, confrontation is avoided in these cultures (Kim et al., 1998). Low-context
cultures are characterized by direct and explicit verbal messages. Effective
communication is, therefore, defined as unambiguous messages. (De Mooij, 2019)
In advertising, the differences between these two types of cultures are seen by the
choice of communication. In high-context cultures, symbols are frequently used to
deliver the message, whereas low-context cultures prefer argumentation and rhetoric.
Because of these differences Hofstede suggested a correlation between high-context
and his collectivistic dimension. He stated that information flows in similar ways, and
that there is less need for explicit communication between members of a group in
collectivistic cultures than in individualistic. (De Mooij, 2019)
According to Hofstede Insights (2020), communication in both Germany and
Denmark is very direct. By analyzing this from Hall’s theory, it would mean that both
are considered low-context cultures. De Mooij (2019) supports this as she claims that
most Western cultures are in fact low-context cultures, with Germany as one of the
extremes.

16

2.1.3

Verbal communication

Verbal communication is a large topic in research and several theories have been
developed to describe the phenomenon. According to De Mooij (2019),
communication in its most general form can be described as an information transfer
between two or more persons, where the information affects one or more of the persons
involved.
Communication styles vary across cultures and it is also known that culture affects the
process of communication in different ways. Hall (1976) states with his theory of high/low context cultures that the degree of context influences how messages are coded.
Culture influences how we communicate, and at the same time maintains the culture
we live in. Thus, communication depends on the people involved and the environment
surrounding them. Culture is, therefore, both a result of communication and a
fundamental factor for the existence of communication. (Hofstede, 2015) According
to Lifintsev and Canhavilhas (2017), several factors could affect the efficiency of
cross-cultural communication. They mention for example differences in values and
standards of behavior, lack of knowledge, language barrier, and lack of trust as some
of the obstacles for cross-cultural communication.
In North American communication theory, all communication is seen as persuasive,
and information based. The classical Western model of communication is based on the
same idea, and includes a sender, a message, a medium/channel, and a receiver.
Communication in this model is seen as a two-way process, as processes of encoding,
interpreting, and decoding are continuously happening for both sender and receiver.
Although the model is sender-oriented, the sender expects feedback after the message
has been sent to confirm that it was received and understood. However, in the East
Asian communication model both sender and receiver are responsible for achieving
effective communication. The message is seen as more indirect and nonverbal cues,
which are to be interpreted by both sides, are an important part of the message. The
process is thus a mind-reading process where evaluation plays a major role. (De Mooij,
2019) Furthermore, the communication in this model is greatly affected by the context,
which means that one message can mean different things in different situations and
contexts (Adhikary, 2010).
17

Verbal communication is significant for Western societies, compared to other
societies. Eloquence of the speaker has for example been associated with knowledge
in these cultures. (Lim, 2017) Language is a great part of culture and it can, therefore,
influence intercultural encounters. According to Hofstede et al. (2010), one must
acquire the foreign language of a culture in order to develop fundamental intercultural
understanding. Furthermore, without knowing the language, a person might miss
central factors defining the culture, for example humor; what is considered funny is
very culture specific. Hofstede et al. (2010) states that one might consequently remain
an outsider to the culture, as it is not fully understood.
Understanding how culture affects the communication in advertising is, therefore,
important. By managing, mastering, and understanding verbal communication across
cultures companies can minimize the risk of misunderstandings and confusions.
Companies targeting the European countries sometimes seek to create an “European
consumer” by using standardized strategies for the entire European market (Paliwoda
& Marinova, 2007). Although this might lower the costs while maintaining the same
volume of sales (Paliwoda & Marinova, 2007), the company might miss chances to
increase the sales. According to De Mooij (2019), distinct differences in
communication styles in the European countries can be found. The communication in
Germany and Denmark is identified as direct and explicit where no more or no less
information is given than necessary; the communication in Spain is more implicit and
indirect, and characterized by rich and expressive language. (De Mooij, 2019)
Due to variations in communication, advertising styles also vary across cultures.
According to De Mooij (2019), four elements of advertising style vary by culture:
appeal, communication style, basic advertising form, and execution. Appeal includes
motives and values, which define the central message and what make the message
interesting. Communication style describes whether the message is communicated in
a direct, indirect, explicit, or implicit way. A direct communication style in advertising
would for example be to use “you” or “we” to address the reader directly. The
advertising form defines the type of advertisement. The advertisement might, for
instance, take the form of a drama, a lesson to the viewer (e.g. demonstrating how a
product should be used), or simply as entertainment (pleases the viewer rather than
18

informing/selling). Lastly, the execution refers to the visuals, i.e. how people are
dressed or how male-female roles are illustrated.
Depending on how the sender of the communication crafts the message, the consumer
will form attitudes and responses towards it. Furthermore, De Mooij (2019) states that
a consumer must form favorable attitudes towards the communication if trust between
company and consumer is to be built. It is, consequently, essential to form the
communication according to the receivers, and what appeals to them.
Most research claims that company messages should be congruent with and adapted
to the culture in which it is communicated (e.g. Hawkins & Mothersbaugh, 2016). This
usually involves changing the language according to the ones spoken in the culture.
Piller (2001), however, claims that the use of another language than the native one in
advertisements might lead to positive outcomes. She states that the use of a language
that the reader somewhat acquires, results in longer processing of the advertisement.
Furthermore, according to Piller (2001), it arrests the receiver’s attention for a longer
time as it takes more time reading and processing the information. This in turn can
lead to stronger recall of the advertisement. However, for this to happen, the receiver
must be familiar with the language in question and must be able to manage it to some
extent (Piller, 2001).

2.1.4

Social media communication

Communication and language are large parts of culture, and this also reflects how
people use the Internet. Social media channels originated in the Western world,
making them suitable for the cultural values in these areas – sender-oriented and not
allowing dialogue. However, today social media are used globally, but the way they
are used differ across cultures. (De Mooij, 2019) Countries that are individualistic
according to Hofstede’s model, tend to use social media for information seeking
purposes (Hofstede, 2015). These cultures, like Germany and Denmark, search for
information in the form of facts and data to maximize their personal usefulness (De
Mooij, 2019).

19

Social media communication differs from communication through traditional media
in many aspects. Communication on traditional media, such as TV, has shown to have
a larger effect on creating brand awareness and might, thus, be best suited for this
purpose. In contrast, communication on social media has shown to have a greater
influence on improving brand image. (Coulter, Bruhn, Schoenmueller & Schäfer,
2012) As the amount of digital communication has increased along the increasing
popularity of social media, companies have to adapt their strategy. By focusing on
creating relationships that engage consumers, marketers expect their social media
communication to lead to interaction and loyalty (Brodie, Ilic, Juric & Hollebeek,
2013).
The increased usage of social media is continuously changing the nature of online
communication. As stated earlier, social media allow consumers to interact with
brands but also with other consumers. Because of this, companies have lost the full
control over the brand communication, as other sources of information have emerged
(Li & Bernoff, 2011). Thus, brands are today to some extent shaped by consumers, as
marketers cannot fully administer what is being said about the brand and how the
company is presented (Schivinski & Dabrowski, 2016). User-generated content on
social media is additionally seen as more trustworthy compared to traditional
advertising (Schivinski & Dabrowski, 2016). This puts companies in a complicated
situation when advertising their products as they need to build trust to sell, but also
want to be able to control the online communication concerning the company and
brand.
Social media communication is, therefore, more than companies informing consumers
about products. In addition to communicating offers, products, prices, and promotions
(Schivinski & Dabrowski, 2016), social media communication is also about creating
interaction between firm and consumer. This results in a mutually beneficial
relationship, where companies can benefit from brand enthusiasts as they are
emphasizing and strengthening positive brand attitudes (Schivinski & Dabrowski,
2016). As marketing managers have lost their role as being the sole writer of the firm’s
brand, the major goal of social media communication is to nurture customer
relationships. The firm’s role is to provide themes for conversations about the brand
among consumers and between the firm and consumers. By doing so, the firm can
20

manage the brand and integrate consumers into their communication strategy.
(Gensler, Völckner, Liu-Thompkins & Wiertz, 2013)
According to Lifintsev and Wellbrock (2019), digitalization simplifies the process of
cross-cultural communication. They state that individuals find it easier to deal with
this kind of communication as opposed to a face-to-face situation. The question is if
this theory implies that companies in general could achieve positive outcomes by
providing standardized corporate messages on social media. It has been argued that
standardized social media communication can lead to pitfalls. By using a standardized
message, consumers in some cultures might develop negative attitudes towards the
brand, as they are unable to identify themselves with what the brand is communicating.
Adapted messages might in some cases invite consumers to interact with the brand
more than standardized communication does. However, adapted messages depending
on cultures might in other cases also lead to less clarity in brand image (Hatzithomas,
Fotiadis & Coudounaris, 2016).
The effect of communication generated by the firm differs due to several factors. The
sense of the message, consumers’ response to the message, and the consumers’
disposition regarding the social media platforms have shown to influence the effect of
the communication (Kumar, Bezawada, Rishika, Janakiraman & Kannan, 2016).
Furthermore, according to Cui et al. (2012), the message’s effect also depends on how
well the strategy matches the culture in which it is communicated. They explain that
in cross-cultural communication, the congruency of the message with the culture can
determine how the message is read and received. Cui et al. (2012) explain that by
matching the culture, the company “can establish a positive association with the
promoted product or brand” (p. 357). Thus, when messages are matching the cultural
values and beliefs it can lead to a more positive attitude towards advertisements.
However, as we have seen, communication on social media is more than the kind
provided by the firms. Much of the communication is carried out by consumers
themselves as members of the social media platforms. According to Chu (2011),
consumer’s attitudes towards social media influence how willing they are to engage in
discussions about companies and their products. This would mean that the more
positive attitude a consumer has towards social media, the more they will pass on
21

product-related information. For companies, this means that they should direct their
communication towards active social media users to increase the chance of spreading
the company’s messages.

2.2 Consumer behavior in an online context
Consumer behavior is important to grasp for companies to successfully run a business.
By understanding consumer behavior, marketers can and try to influence how, when,
and what we consume (Hawkins & Mothersbaugh, 2016). The concept consumer
behavior can, according to Hawkins and Mothersbaugh (2016), be defined as “the
study of individuals, groups or organizations and the processes they use to select,
secure, use, and dispose of products, services, experiences, or ideas to satisfy needs
and the impacts that these processes have on the consumer and society.” (p. 6). In
short, consumer behavior can be described as everything associated with consumption
and the decisions we make in these situations, as well as what influences them.
Understanding this, companies can form competitive marketing strategies, which will
guide them in providing higher value to target consumers than the competitors
(Hawkins & Mothersbaugh, 2016).
The millennial generation, or generation Y, and their consumer behavior, have often
been described as unique. Except for being knowledgeable about technology and
digital tools (Venter, 2017), they are also “trustful, more tolerant, and better traveled
than many of their parents” (Valentine & Powers, 2013, p. 598). Furthermore, the
generation is defined as a complicated generation for marketers, as these consumers
are not as influenced by marketing as earlier generations (Valentine & Powers, 2013).
If millennials do, however, respond to traditional marketing stimuli, it is rarely
positively, as they are more attracted to communication on interactive media, such as
social media platforms. To reach millennials, the communication should highlight the
authentic aspect of the brand, and the communication must make the consumers feel
connected (Naumovska, 2017).
This information is necessary for a firm to understand the consumers and be able to
intervene in the consumer’s decision process. The consumer has to identify a need,
22

which can be solved by purchasing the firm’s product and become satisfied after the
purchase (Hawkins & Mothersbaugh, 2016). This decision process is divided into
several steps, and during this process several factors influence the behavior as the
consumer chooses to interact with a specific company and brand.

2.2.1

Consumer awareness

A consumer’s journey towards purchasing a product is identified by numerous steps.
In theory, the consumer moves from awareness, to consideration, to purchase, and
hopefully onwards to retention and advocacy (Berman, 2020). If a company, then,
wants to compete for the consumers’ attention on the market, it first has to make the
consumers aware of its existence. To do this, a company must communicate their
message where the target consumer can see it. Today, companies cannot afford to
create content or information online and expect relevant individuals to see it. Because
of the large increase in social media usage, consumers encounter massive amounts of
information that they have to analyze, sort, and filter (Daugherty & Hoffman, 2014).
By doing so, they decide what messages or elements to register and what to dismiss.
Furthermore, it is crucial to understand the target consumers. Millennials have, for
example, been shown to be a complicated generation as it is hard to capture and hold
their attention. Additionally, these consumers have been defined as distracted, which
contributes to difficulties in memorizing ads they encounter. (Munsch, 2021; Nielsen,
2017) Therefore, companies’ communication should be appealing and interesting, as
well as altered according to the target consumer to successfully capture the target
consumer’s attention.
According to Berman (2020), studies show that the most common characteristic for
the first stage of the consumer journey is to go online for product discovery. Depending
on the industry and the target group, the company must create suitable touchpoints
where the consumer can interact with the company. These can, for example, be
advertisements in traditional media or on social media, or placing relevant banner ads
online (Berman, 2020). Advertising, however, differs noticeably depending on the
product. Commonly, advertising is designed to move people closer to the purchase
stage of the journey. Though, depending on the type of the products, advertising might
23

need to aim to influence people at different stages of the consumer journey. Consumers
might, for example, need more time evaluating and considering expensive products
before purchasing, compared to cheaper products. (Lavidge & Steiner, 1961)
Furthermore, advertising online can stimulate electronic word-of-mouth (E-WOM),
which is when consumers discuss companies, products, and brands with other
consumers (Hawkins & Mothersbaugh, 2016). Positive E-WOM is valuable for
companies as this can inform consumers, previously unfamiliar with the company,
about its existence. The more discussion, the more awareness it creates for the
company, the brand, and the products (Dhar, & Chang, 2009).

2.2.2

Consumer perception of foreign ad elements

How a consumer perceives certain elements or products, depends to some extent on
previous experience. To simplify the information-processing, individuals focus on
several cues to evaluate, for example, the quality of a product faster. Consumers use
either intrinsic (e.g. design) or extrinsic (e.g. price, brand name) cues to process
information in consumption situations. When consumers encounter foreign brands, the
brand’s name and other cues indicating features of the brand play a major role in how
the products are perceived. It can be argued that this affects the products’ perceived
quality and expected price, even though the factors are not directly connected.
(Supanvanij & Amine, 2000)
Several factors influence if consumers are motivated to purchase foreign brands.
According to Saran and Gupta (2012), quality, prestige, brand trustworthiness, and
brand uniqueness are some of the factors driving consumers to purchase foreign brands
over local. Furthermore, Aichner (2014) states that consumers have started to choose
products based on extrinsic cues, such as unique brand names. Cues communicating
the brand’s country-of-origin has shown to have a significant effect on the consumer’s
purchase decision and attitude (e.g. Supanvanij & Amine 2000). Research also shows
that consumers might choose foreign products simply because they originate from a
different country with a positive image (Aichner, 2014). This indicates that a marketer
can use the perceived country image when marketing across cultures. Whether the
24

perceived country image is positive or negative, the marketer could decide to
emphasize or diminish the noticeability of this element to attain positive consumer
attitudes. By mentioning or underlining a product’s COO in its advertising, a company
can achieve competitive advantages in foreign markets. The cues can work as signals
for product quality and directly affect the consumer’s purchase intention (KoschateFischer, Diamantopoulos & Oldenkotte, 2012).
It is, therefore, crucial for companies to understand the consumers and their
perceptions of other countries when marketing across cultures (Moradi & Zarei, 2011).
However, if a company intends to use COO as a strategy to achieve certain attitudes,
the elements representing the country must be noticeable for the customers (Aichner,
2014). According to Aichner (2014), companies might use elements indicating
country-of-origin by using “made in…” labels on the products. However, he also states
that other cues might be enough for influencing consumer perception. For example,
when using a certain language or typical landscapes in the advertisement, the consumer
might associate the products with the desired country (Aichner, 2014).
English is nowadays a common language to use in advertisements in nonnative
English-speaking countries, and it is, therefore, no longer specifically associated with
a single culture. Instead, English has in the last decades become a symbol of progress,
as well as a modern, youthful, and global mindset. (Piller, 2003) As the language is no
longer only connected to native English-speaking countries, it can be used for a wide
range of products originating from any country. English could, therefore, be
considered an effective tool if a company chooses to standardize its marketing
communication. (Nederstigt & Hilberink-Schulpen, 2018)
Consumer attitudes towards unfamiliar foreign brands may, additionally, be affected
by stereotypes of the COO (Hamzaoui & Merunka, 2006). When a foreign brand
utilizes a foreign language rather than the native one on the market, consumers are
more willing to purchase from the company if the advertisement appears congruent
with the stereotypes and reputation of the COO (Usunier & Cestre, 2007). Considering
the Nordic countries some stereotypes exist. Traditionally the Nordics have been
associated with, for instance, welfare, beautiful nature, blond people, and
trustworthiness (The Economist, 2013; Ekstrand, 2018). A company originating from
25

a Nordic country using English in their marketing communication could then benefit
from advertising products in a way that could be perceived as congruent with the COO.
Focusing on the aspects discussed above, a Nordic cosmetics company could succeed
by creating communication emphasizing the naturalness and quality of the products.
For this particular case a blonde person could preferably be used in the advertisements.
If the stereotypes mentioned here match the consumers’ on the new market, this
communication strategy would in theory make the consumers willing to purchase
products from the company. By doing so, the company could avoid losing the
consumers’ trust when utilizing something else than a native language.
However, research has in some cases shown that consumers’ perception of COO cues
might depend on how their cultures are defined. Triandis (2018) claims that
collectivistic cultures are more inclined to rely on stereotypes when analyzing cultural
cues in messages. He argues that this phenomenon depends on the collectivistic nature
of ingroups and outgroups. Members of ingroups are typically characterized by
similarities, and outgroups are similarly determined by the fact that other individuals
simply lack these sets of features. Individuals in collectivistic cultures might,
therefore, be more prone to differentiate a group of individuals from others. They
might use this understanding to form national stereotypes, and, consequently, evaluate
foreign products or brands through the stereotypes. (Triandis, 2018). However,
whether other dimensions affect how COO cues are perceived, is still to be explored
with the help of the findings of the thesis.
Typically, different types of cosmetics are advertised with similar messages. The
majority of commercial messages for cosmetics products focus on the fact that the
products will make the consumer look “better”. By purchasing and using the products
the ad usually states that the products will make the consumer, for example, “prettier”
or “younger”. (Ringrow, 2016) The question is, however, if consumers’ find this
trustworthy or if other aspects are making them choose a certain brand. The language
in cosmetics advertising has also shown to be motivational, in that they are encouraged
to aim for better looks (Ringrow, 2016). It might be risky for a company to encourage
the consumers to buy the products in order to look in a certain way, as the image of
beauty differs across cultures. This means that the wrong choice of words, or

26

emphasizing the wrong image of beauty, might result in confusion and negative
outcomes. (De Mooij, 2019)

2.2.3

Consumer trust

The development of technology and internet made e-commerce an integral part of our
society. However, as companies and consumers started gathering online, new
behaviors and factors to consider emerged. In an online context, trust is among one of
the most important factors (Irshad, Ahmad & Malik, 2020). Consumers can feel a
vulnerability when shopping online and it is the vendor’s mission to make the
consumers feel confident. The vulnerability might be based on the fact that consumers
lack control over who has access to their personal information. Moreover, the
consumer is unable to touch, try out, or see physical products before purchasing. (Chen
& Dibb, 2010) This leads to an increased uncertainty and more risks, and trust can
mitigate these risks (Jarvenpaa, Tractinsky, Saarinen, 1999). Accordingly, online
vendors must endeavor to build trust in order to reduce the consumer’s vulnerability
(Chen & Dibb, 2010). The companies must thus successfully procure a trustworthy
image if consumers are to enter a relationship. When the consumer forms favorable
attitudes towards the company, trust is created (De Mooij, 2019).
According to a survey by PWC (2018), 35 percent of the interviewed ranked “trust in
brand” as one of top three of the factors influencing the decision of retailer when
shopping. When the consumer feels that the company is trustworthy, the consumer
will most likely also come back. The level of trust thus affects the duration of the
relationship between company and consumer. Additionally, a trustworthy company
will be discussed and recommended among consumers. (Mossberg & Sundström,
2011) Consumers’ trust is, therefore, of great importance for a brand’s success. To
achieve a trustworthy appearance, understanding the consumers and being able to meet
their expectations are crucial factors. (PWC, 2018)
Many companies use social media to share information and promote their products.
As consumers constantly encounter vast amounts of commercial information,
companies must find a way to break through the clutter (Daugherty & Hoffman, 2014).
27

As stated earlier, it is known that information and opinions from other users on social
media are more trusted than firm-generated content (Schivinski & Dabrowski, 2016).
However, firms must engage in the conversations on these channels to achieve
awareness and trust. The challenge for them is to engage in a way that is perceived as
authentic and genuine. (PWC, 2018)
The firm-generated communication must also be seen as authentic to their audience.
The communication should emphasize that the company has a genuine interest to sell
the best to its customers. It should also give a feeling that the customers’ needs matter
more than sales. (Mossberg & Sundström, 2011) But can initial trust be created with
advertising? Some researchers argue that people’s general attitude towards advertising
will affect if initial trust is created. This means that if a person in general finds
advertisements untrustworthy, he/she will not be influenced by a brand’s attempt to
build trust. Some research also shows that advertisements including clear information
about the product will lead to more positive attitudes and, therefore, have a better
chance of resulting in initial trust. (Yoo & MacInnis, 2005)
However, companies marketing across cultures might find themselves in a complex
situation. In an online context, trust has shown to interrelate with the culture involved
(Hofstede et al., 2010). Hallikainen and Laukkanen (2018), claim that “23% of the
variance in an individual’s trusting disposition is explained solely by culture” (p. 102).
Previous research has concluded that features for what characterizes a trustworthy
company vary across cultures, and some cultures also seem to have higher tendencies
to trust than others (Jarvenpaa et al., 1999; Park, Gunn, Han, 2012). Countries scoring
high on the individualistic index in Hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory, are more
likely to trust others until a reason to stop trusting appears (Hofstede et al., 2010;
Jarvenpaa et al., 1999). Consumers in individualistic cultures might, therefore,
perceive the risks of initially trusting an online company as lower, than consumers in
collectivistic cultures (Jarvenpaa et al., 1999). Furthermore, trust is essential in
business relationships in long-term oriented cultures, and trust tends to be created on
a long-term basis (Hallikainen & Laukkanen, 2018). This could imply that cultures
with short-term orientation might have a higher tendency to form initial trust towards
an unfamiliar company in an online context. Furthermore, cultures with low

28

uncertainty avoidance are also more likely to trust an online vendor (Hallikainen &
Laukkanen, 2018).

2.2.4

Purchase intention

Trust was previously discussed to be crucial for a company’s or brand’s success. One
clear reason for this is that it has been shown to increase consumers’ purchase intention
on social media (e.g. Yahia, Al-Neama & Kerbache, 2018). As stated earlier, users on
social media trust information about companies more when it comes from peers, rather
than firms (Schivinski & Dabrowski, 2016). Due to this fact, purchase intention is also
greatly affected by E-WOM (Balakrishnan, Dahnil & Yi, 2014). Furthermore,
according to Hoyer and Brown (1990), purchase intention is generally higher for
brands that are familiar to the consumer. The companies that are unable to rely on
WOM must thus somehow persuade consumers in other ways to increase the purchase
intention.
In general, consumers are more motivated to buy when a two-way and interactive
communication is used (Sundar, Bellur, Oh, Xu & Jia, 2014). Furthermore, purchase
intention is strongly affected by mobile advertising, such as social media advertising,
when the ads were evaluated as credible, entertaining, and informative. When the ads
meet these conditions, they are considered a good source of information, which could
directly increase purchase intention. In other words, consumers are more motivated to
purchase a product if the social media ads prove to be a worthy source of information.
Furthermore, the motivation to buy a product also increases if the ads are relevant
considering the consumer’s preferences, lifestyle, or interests. (Alalwan, 2018) As
social media allow targeting and creating personal ads, one could argue that ads on
these channels could have a greater influence on consumers’ purchase intention than
traditional ads.
The fact that culture has been identified to affect individuals’ values also conveys an
idea that culture will also affect how they act in certain situations. According to Kueh
and Voon (2007), culture affects the expectations a person might have of a product, as
well as how the product is perceived. Consequently, culture will also affect the
29

person’s general buying behavior, and purchase intention. For instance, some research
shows that the motivation of purchasing differs depending on the culture. De Mooij
and Hofstede (2010) claim that individuals in individualistic cultures will be
influenced by their own attitudes, in comparison to collectivistic cultures where the
social surrounding has a great influence. Additionally, cultures defined by lower power
distance prepare for the purchase by gaining information about the product or service
from media and friends, rather than basing their decision on feelings and trust (De
Mooij & Hofstede, 2010).

3. Methodology
This chapter describes the method used for the study. The chosen research design is
discussed in detail to provide clarifications of all decisions. The chapter also includes
a description of the data collection process, informants, as well as analysis process.
Lastly, a discussion evaluating the study is offered to improve the quality of the
research.

3.1 Qualitative research
Ahrne and Svensson (2015) distinguish between qualitative and quantitative research
based on the outcomes; quantitative research focus on questions such as how many,
how often or how long, whereas qualitative research analyzes factors which cannot
easily be apprehended. Qualitative research is convenient for studying feelings,
experiences, and thoughts, as well as societies and societal phenomena. These methods
commonly also study people and relationships, and how the phenomena affects them.
(Ahrne & Svensson, 2015) In other words, qualitative research emphasizes how
individuals interpret their social surroundings. Since qualitative research examines
these topics, an interpretive approach is also used. Studying the social world, actions
and contexts presuppose the researcher’s interpretation to reach a conclusive
explanation of the problem. (Bryman & Bell, 2011)
In this thesis, perception is the central issue, and consumers’ inner thoughts and
preferences are studied. The use of a qualitative research method is suitable as it aims
to gain insights about a certain topic in a specific context, rather than making broad
generalizations. Additionally, the research follows an abductive research approach.
This means that the analysis of the research constantly moves between theory and data
(Timmermans & Tavory, 2012). The analysis of such research approaches emphasizes
a close relationship between the empirical findings and theory, meaning that data
might affect theory and vice versa. It, therefore, requires a persistent reconsidering of
the central ideas connected to the theory as new theories can emerge from the empirical
data. (Timmermans & Tavory, 2012)

31

Because of the chosen research approach and the chosen research method, the nature
of this specific study is exploratory. In this case it means that the research explores the
central problem and research questions. By doing so, it contributes to increased
knowledge about the topics, which can assist in understanding the context, but it does
not, however, provide conclusive solutions to the problem.

3.1.1

Focus group method

The use of focus groups allows the researcher to collect different perspectives about a
topic. It helps the researcher understand the world through shared experiences,
personal opinions and culture. The method is useful to explore new knowledge, and in
situations where brainstorming is needed. Discussions in focus groups can also help
the participants become aware of things that otherwise might have been left
undiscovered. (Dahlin-Ivanoff, 2015) Focus groups are suitable for the study in this
thesis, as cultural values and how consumers perceive certain elements are central. A
person’s culture and values can be difficult to analyze alone, but discussing the issues
with others might help individuals discover underlying motives.
However, due to the prevailing circumstances of covid-19 and the restrictions to meet
in person, the focus group discussions are held online. According to Abrams and
Gaiser (2017), online focus group discussions can be considered the given choice for
topics concerning internet and they convey several advantages. Furthermore, online
focus groups provide easier access to participants for lower costs and the datacollection process is generally quicker. However, Abrams and Gaiser (2017) also
outline several things that must be considered when doing interviews online. These
contexts might lead to a reduced level of control for the researcher, as technical failures
can interrupt the discussion. The flow of the discussion is less natural than in face-toface interviews, and activities such as brainstorming might, therefore, have to be
adapted. To minimize the impact of the online context, these factors must be
considered when, for example, formulating questions and planning the discussion
setting.

32

In this research case, the participants are urged to use a stable Wi-Fi network, and to
test their cameras and microphones before the discussion to make sure both functions
well. Practically, the discussions are structured more as interviews as discussions
among the participants might be difficult. The participants are encouraged to raise their
hand or unmute themselves to signal that they want to speak. By doing so, the
moderator has a greater role in the discussions than in physical focus group
discussions. The flow of the discussions might be more unnatural, but the interruption
of others is avoided.

3.2 Data collection
Data derived from qualitative research is typically in the form of words. The collection
of data can be done through for example interviews or observations and is done to
understand another individual’s social reality. To successfully obtain enough data, the
research should be flexible and unstructured. By allowing a flexible structure, the
researcher can collect rich data where the participant’s point of view is in focus. The
researcher must, additionally, be in close involvement with the subjects to identify an
authentic image of how they see the issue. (Bryman & Bell, 2011)
The research is based on a comparison between two focus groups of different
nationalities, with five participants in each group. The ideal size of a focus group has
been and is still discussed among researchers. According to Dahlin-Ivanoff (2015), six
to twelve participants is an appropriate amount in focus groups, whereas other
researchers, for example Krueger (1995), argue that four to eight is ideal. In this study
five participants in each group were considered a suitable number as the discussions
were held online, in Zoom. Online, smaller groups are easier to manage, and it
facilitates a good discussion where everybody can contribute. Smaller groups are also
preferred when the participants are very involved in the topics studied (Bryman &
Bell, 2011), which also was the case in this study.
Furthermore, in this particular study, a semi-structured approach is used for the focus
group discussions. This means that the discussions focus on open questions, and the
same questions are asked during both occasions. Thus, both discussions follow the
33

same structure with a semi-structured interview guide, but participants have much
freedom in how the questions are answered. By doing so, both discussions have the
same base, but the researcher may add follow-up questions or change the order of the
interview guide depending on what the participants see significant (Bryman & Bell,
2011).
The interview guide is shaped according to a structure suggested by Dahlin-Ivanoff
(2015), which starts from general questions about topics and moves to more specific
questions along the way. The guide (see Appendix 1) includes introduction,
presentation of the moderator, and three main discussion themes: social media, social
media advertising, and the focus company. The main themes of the discussion all have
an estimated time to avoid surpassing the planned total duration of the discussion.
Time is also reserved for the introduction, a wrap up, and questions from participants.
Among the people in the discussions, only the moderator is presented. This is done to
ensure anonymity between participants. In the introduction, the aim and purpose of the
research is stated as well as practical information about the discussion; the participants
are reminded that the discussion will be recorded, they are encouraged to state their
honest thoughts and it is emphasized that everybody’s thoughts are equally important.
The participants were chosen by posting an invitation on social media, that is Facebook
and Instagram. By sharing this on these specific social media platforms, active users
could voluntarily sign up to take part in the research. German and Danish consumers
were chosen as these are the markets the focus company’s marketing communication
will concentrate on. Verbal communication is also seen as significant in Western
countries (Lim, 2017), and the chosen countries are, therefore, suitable for the topic of
this thesis. Five women of each nationality were chosen who were available on the
selected date(s), were interested in the topics, and met the criteria, namely being
proficient in English, belonging to the millennial generation, and actively using social
media. To be proficient in English was important for the research, as English was used
in the focus group discussions. Furthermore, people who possess a high level of
English are the consumers the focus company most likely is going to attract when
communicating on social media in English. As the central theme of the study is social
media, it was also significant to choose participants who are active social media users

34

themselves and have much knowledge about the topic. The participants are presented
in more detail in chapter 3.3.
Before the focus group occasions, the questions were tested on a 25-year-old student,
who is also an active social media user. This assured that the language was clear, and
misunderstandings were reduced. Both focus groups discussed general attitudes
towards social media and how the platforms are used among the participants.
Furthermore, attitudes towards social media advertisements of the focus company
were also discussed, as well as attitudes towards buying products directly from the
platforms. One day before the occasions, the participants received information about
the research topic, as well as practical information, such as a Zoom-link. To obtain
socio-demographic background information about the participants, they also receive a
link to a form, which they were to fill out before the focus group discussions. This
form asked the participants’ name, age, nationality, and profession/title. With the same
form, the participants gave their consent for the discussions to be recorded and used
for research purposes. In the form it was, additionally, stated that they are anonymous
throughout the research process. Participants were also informed that they all have the
right to receive the results of the research.

3.3 Presentation of informants
German and Danish consumers were chosen as the focus company’s marketing
communication will concentrate mainly on Germany and Denmark. All informants
participating in the focus group discussions were women representing the millennial
generation, and their titles and professions varied. As the informants’ backgrounds,
interests, and ages vary, cultural values might be easier to distinguish. This also
decreases the risk of basing the analysis on one-sided opinions. Additionally, it might
increase the trustworthiness of the study as informants represent a wider range of
consumers. Table 1 and 2 present the age and professions of the informants.

3.4 Focus group discussions
The study compared two groups, one with German participants and the other one with
Danish participants. Both discussions took place online in Zoom. The Danish
discussion occurred on the 12th of January, 2021 from 10-11:20 a.m., and the German
discussion took place on the 14th of January, 2021 from 8-9:15 p.m. (both occasions
in Eastern European time).
In the focus group discussions, the participants were first asked about their social
media usage and their attitudes towards the platforms. In the second theme, social
media advertisements were discussed and their general opinion about them.
Additionally, this theme focused on the participants’ attitudes towards unfamiliar
brands’ social media ads, and if the origin of the products/brands matters. The last
theme of the discussion focused on the focus company, Dermosil. Without knowing
anything about the company, the participants were shown the logo of the focus
company. They were asked to think about associations and thoughts when seeing the
logo. The second topic in this theme was Finland. Here, the purpose was to explore
their attitudes towards the country and if certain stereotypes exist. This is important,

36

as attitudes towards Finnish COO cues might vary depending on the informants’
disposition. After quickly presenting the company, the participants were asked to think
about a suitable slogan for the company. They were asked to specifically think about
what words they think should be included and what aspects of the company they would
like to highlight. By doing so, it might be possible to study which aspects the
participants find important. Next, the participants were shown the slogan of the focus
company and were asked to discuss which impression it gives and what their opinions
are about it.
Finally, in order to exemplify the central themes of the discussions, the focus groups
also compared ads of different kinds. The ads have been created to match the research
and the research questions. All pictures and texts are found in Dermosil’s customer
magazine or on the company’s social media accounts, but some elements have been
altered to better suit the social media format. I have also translated the texts from
Swedish into English to be able to study the effect of utilizing a foreign language. The
ads use different communication styles, as well as visual elements. The content of the
ads differ in highlighting Finnish/Nordic elements (such as nature, or Finnish words),
descriptions of products and ingredients, and the use of people. By discussing and
comparing these together in the focus groups, individual preferences and cultural
differences might appear.
The first set of ads the focus groups compared (see Appendix 2) differ in the amount
of information given. The ads were juxtaposed and presented at the same time to
successfully outline differences. They both advertise the same product, and all visual
elements are the same. One ad, however, contains more information, such as price and
a description of the product and its ingredients. The second set of ads (see Appendix
3) were presented in the same way, and differ in number and types of COO cues; the
first one contains a blonde person which, according to identified stereotypes, could be
seen as typically Nordic. She is also standing in an oat field, which might be analyzed
as nature and, therefore, also a Finnish/Nordic cue. The Finnish word kaura is
mentioned in both ads, but in the second ad the origin of the products/company is
clearly stated, as the words “Finland”, “Finnish”, and “Nordic” are used. This set of
ads is, thus, also used to compare the perception of visual versus verbal cues.
Furthermore, while both ads contain information about the product, the style of the
37

information differs. The information in the first ad uses direct language stating facts
about the product, while the other ad uses more expressive language. The third picture
(see Appendix 4) is used to study Finnish cues further. The picture contains Finnish
nature such as moss, wood, lingonberries, and sea buckthorn berries. The text also
contains information about the company itself and the ingredients used in the products,
but it does not advertise a specific product. The purpose of this picture is, therefore,
also to explore how much and which kind of information truly is needed for consumers
to trust and be attracted to a foreign company.
As some of the respondents were friends or acquaintances of mine, or of a friend of
mine, I knew some participants’ backgrounds and personalities. The groups were
mixed, instead of solely being made up of either friends or strangers. This decreases
the chance of social pressure and strengthens the fact that the opinions are authentic
and diverse. It is also important to stress that all participants were treated equally, and
an objective position was maintained throughout the focus group occasions as the
moderator.

3.5 Data analysis
In qualitative research, the analysis can be considered as the key activity in generating
an understanding. Svensson (2015) describes the analysis as the interpretation that
assigns meaning to the collected data. Also here, the focus group discussions must be
analyzed to create an overview. After this we can make assumptions and reach
conclusions, and lastly understand what the research reveals.
As the focus groups are recorded, the first step in the analysis process were to listen to
the recordings to be able to transcribe the discussions. This is useful as it is easier to
find patterns and important ideas when in text format. The discussions were
transcribed as soon as possible after the discussion occasions to increase the chance of
remembering what was said, how it was said, and why. The data was transcribed with
the help of the video recordings to see how the participants expressed their opinions
and to better follow the discussions. Furthermore, the focus group discussions were
transcribed word by word, and facial expressions, laughter, and pauses were noted in
38

the transcripts. Words that participants used frequently, that is filler words, were left
out from the transcripts if considered meaningless.
According to Bryman and Bell (2011), two main strategies of analyzing qualitative
data are typically presented. Though others exist, the analytic induction strategy and
grounded theory strategy are the most frequently used models to guide researchers
through the analysis process. The analytic induction strategy is a method in which
hypotheses are formed and tested while collecting data. If, however, a case is found
that does not match the hypothesis, the researcher either chooses to reformulate or
redefine the hypothesis to exclude the deviating case. The data collection then
continues and follows the same structure until no further deviation of the studied
phenomenon is found. Grounded theory has traditionally been seen as the creation of
new theory. In the model, theory is said to be developed from the collected data.
Furthermore, the data collection and theory construction are seen as continuously
intertwined through the entire process. (Bryman & Bell, 2011). Some researchers have,
therefore, also claimed that the modern grounded theory appears to often follow a more
abductive approach in research. This idea claims that researchers following the
grounded theory strategy keep comparing the concepts with the data in the research
process. (Timmermans & Tavory, 2012)
In this study, the analysis is based on the grounded theory. However, here, the analysis
began after the data collection was completed. The analysis is based on some of the
theory that was compiled before the data collection was initiated. The analysis process
follows the structure of the grounded theory model as the research constantly moves
between theory and data (Timmermans & Tavory, 2012). Furthermore, one key tool
of the grounded theory model is coding, which is the process of data being broken
down into segments of central themes and topics. These codes work as indicators to
possible core ideas, and they are constantly compared and evaluated to find suitable
categories or concepts. This helps the analyst interpret and make sense of the data.
Some common criticism towards coding includes arguments that the meaning of the
segments is lost when taken out of context. This strategy, however, supports the
analyst in narrowing down and reflecting on the data. (Bryman & Bell, 2011). Also in
this study, the next step is coding. The coding strategy here follows the structure
offered by Bryman and Bell (2011): read transcripts, create codes, revise codes, and
39

reflect upon general theoretical ideas considering data and codes. When transcribed,
the data is sorted with the help of the analysis software NVivo. Running the raw data
collected from the focus groups through the program facilitates the analysis process.
By doing so, important extracts are found, organized, and coded into the main
fragments that will compose the final analysis.
Focus groups as a research method is known for generating rich data (Bryman & Bell,
2011). This is of importance when trying to understand consumers, but the rich data
also makes the analyzing process more time consuming, meaning that the researcher
will spend a considerable amount of time analyzing it. Because of the richness it is
also of utmost importance to spend time scrutinizing the data to be able to make
connections and see relationships. Therefore, to create a clear overview of the central
issues, the recordings were first listened to and the transcripts were read several times.
Relevant and suitable codes were then developed that could represent the transcripts’
tone. These codes included trust, awareness, positive/negative social media attitude,
as well as consumer behavior (related to purchasing cosmetics). In the second round,
each code was given a color and marginal notes were added to mark significant
thoughts (see Figure 1). While reading, notes were also taken to mark possible factors
which may have affected the participants. Factors such as friendships or acquaintances,
were considered in order to understand whether and how these might have affected the
participants’ responses. In the third round, fundamental segments are coded according
to the available codes in NVivo, and in the last step the segments for the specific codes
are then reviewed, and lastly retrieved to be analyzed. These segments are collected in
separate documents to be able to discover a general overview of the groups’ attitudes,
and to capture key differences between groups and participants.

removed to ensure that participants remain anonymous.

3.6 Evaluating research
Executing a credible qualitative research differ from a quantitative approach.
According to Svensson and Ahrne (2015), generalizability is closely related to how
credible the research is considered. However, they explain that qualitative research is
used for other purposes than generalizing a population based on a sample. Instead,
these methods are used to gain knowledge about a certain phenomenon and increase
the general understanding of the individuals studied. It can, therefore, be difficult to
define what a credible qualitative study is. Compared to quantitative research, a
researcher utilizing qualitative methods must make careful assessments of the research
results’ transferability to other environments and fields. (Svensson & Ahrne, 2015).
Furthermore, there is no standard way of conducting studies in qualitative research. In
this type of research, the researcher, therefore, has a great impact on the outcome of
the study as he decides what to concentrate on when collecting data. Hence, some say
41

it is difficult to replicate qualitative findings and, thus, also determine the level of
credibility.
Various measures are used to evaluate different types of research, but this thesis
follows the frameworks introduced by Lincoln and Guba (1985), and Eriksson and
Kovalainen (2015). To ensure credibility and indicate the research’s trustworthiness
several criteria must be evaluated. Firstly, sufficient data must be collected for the
study to be valuable and for the research to be considered credible. In this study,
saturation was achieved after conducting two semi-structured focus group discussions.
The data is enough to attain new knowledge and information about the examined topics
and contexts, which support the research’s findings and conclusions. Furthermore, the
data was collected without influencing the participants. This results in authentic data
as it has not been altered in any way. Secondly, transferability can be reached by
comparing results to previous studies (Eriksson & Kovalainen, 2015). In the literature
review chapter of this thesis, previous studies relating to the examined topics are
outlined. Comparing the results to these studies allows contrasts to appear, leading to
enhanced knowledge about culture’s role in social media marketing. Thirdly, a limited
external audit (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) was pursued by attending master’s thesis
seminars. During the seminars, peers offered feedback, which enables the discovery
of flaws in the research for further increasement of trustworthiness. Lastly, the
research’s methodology, including how data is collected, how participants are
accessed, and which individuals are studied, is outlined in detail. Furthermore, the
thesis also provides descriptions of the focus group discussions and settings, as well
as coding and analysis procedures. This allows future research to get a clear overview
of the study for further development of the research area.
Discussing and evaluating the credibility of research improve the quality of the study.
Furthermore, by doing so, the researcher’s decisions are justified for the interest of
further research. Offering explanations and detailed descriptions of the evaluation
process ensure that the research is valuable and provide proof that the research is
trustworthy.

42

4. Analysis
This chapter displays an analysis of the data collected from the focus group discussion.
The purpose of this chapter is to present patterns, which appeared in the focus group
discussions. Comparisons of the focus groups and individuals are provided by
presenting an analysis of the data supported by segments from the focus group
discussions. Additionally, the segments are provided to further sustain the thoughts’
contexts and stress their meanings and significance. The findings presented in this
chapter culminate in a discussion in the next chapter where research questions are
answered.

4.1 Comparison of focus groups
The focus groups have been compared to each other to observe differences between
the groups. However, individual participants and their opinions have also been
analyzed to be able to outline differences on an individual level. By doing so, it is
possible to distinguish opinions influenced by culture from opinions influenced by the
individual’s disposition. The Danish focus group discussion will, hereafter, be referred
to as FG1 and the German group as FG2. Furthermore, the terms “informant” and
“participant” are here used interchangeably, as they both refer to the individuals
contributing to the data collection. The central themes discussed in this chapter have
been discovered by reviewing the transcripts and the coded segments in order to
identify general keywords and patterns. The groups’ and participants’ opinions, as well
as distinct themes, are presented in the following subsections.

4.1.1

Attitudes towards social media and advertisements

The first main themes in the focus group discussions were social media, social media
usage and social media advertising. When discussing the informants’ social media
usage, the reasons for using the platforms were of interest to gain a fundamental
understanding of the individuals’ behaviors. Informants stated different personal

43

reasons for using social media but both groups agreed that communicating and
socializing were the main reasons. All informants shared the opinion that social media
help them stay connected to friends and others in their private life but also to businessrelated acquaintances. Other reasons for using social media included informationseeking purposes, finding inspiration, and entertainment purposes. Although
informants in both groups stated similar reasons for using social media platforms, the
groups’ overall attitudes towards social media ads slightly differed. All informants
agreed on the fact that they use Instagram the most. Facebook is also being used to
some extent, but the popularity has decreased significantly over the years. One reason
for this change, according to the informants, is that Instagram suits their needs better.
Informants G5 and D5, for instance, identified Instagram as “easier, quicker, and more
fun” compared to Facebook. In the discussions, clear trends appeared regarding the
usage of different platforms; it was shown that Instagram is used for inspiration and
viewing friends’ activities, whereas Facebook is clearly used for news and
communicating solely with close friends. Depending on which platform is used,
participants in both groups implied that their behaviors also differ. It appears that
Instagram’s design makes them more receptive to stimuli, such as advertising. The
motives for using Facebook are more private and limited, and the platform is used as
a break to see “real content” (informant D2). Hence, the informants also appear to
focus more on serious matters when using Facebook, which seems to make them less
affected by marketing practices. This will, however, be further discussed in the next
subsection.
Moreover, several participants from both groups stated or implied that ads on social
media appear frequently. This would mean that individuals from both cultures
constantly encounter ads on social media, giving the groups similar circumstances for
the development of their attitudes. Informants in FG1 stated a more positive attitude
towards social media ads than did informants in FG2. Two informants in FG1 stated
that they like ads, as the ads inform them about new brands and/or companies:
I’m actually in favor of it because I love that I get more targeted ads and things that are
relevant and I discover many new brands and businesses through these ads, that I
wouldn’t have otherwise found. So yeah, I’m always curious if I get a weird ad, I’m
always questioning myself, like “what did I search, what did I like” since I’m seeing
this. I enjoy them, I have no problem with it. (Informant D3)

44

I also like that it’s targeted, and I always feel like my social media knows me so well.
They know exactly what I want and when I want it, and I think it’s really good.
(Informant D1)

In this group, two other informants had positive/neutral attitudes towards ads, stating
that they do not mind them. Only one informant in this group, D2, stated that she
dislikes ads; informant D2 said she finds them “creepy”, as she has experienced several
times that ads are shown for a specific product after mentioning the product in a
physical conversation. Other informants, for example D3 and D5, had experienced
similar phenomena, but their attitudes seem to have remained unaltered. Informants in
FG2, however, showed more negative attitudes. Two informants stated that the ads on
social media are annoying, as they interrupt them while using the social media
platforms. In this group, only one informant, G5, stated that she likes social media ads.
Regardless of their personal opinions, all ten informants in the focus group discussions
had bought products after seeing social media ads of the products. This could indicate
that attitudes towards social media ads have limited influence on the likelihood of
purchasing a product after seeing the social media ad. When discussing the matter of
being influenced by social media ads to buy a product, several informants that first
stated they disliked ads, later acknowledged the effectiveness of the social media ads.
Even though these informants previously expressed negative feelings towards social
media ads, they still prefer them over other types of ads. The following opinions were
expressed when being asked to compare other types of ads with the ones on social
media.
I feel like because my social media is so targeted at me and I’m really into… I focus
on that stuff in my daily life then I get ads that are more focused on that, and if I just
see a tv commercial or just read a magazine then I won’t get ads that are focused on
that. (Informant D2)
It’s more likely that I would buy something or at least inform myself if it’s on social
media because it’s on my phone it’s kind of closer to me other than passing by on the
street or so. (Informant G1)
I also agree [with the fact that social media ads are more effective], and I think part of
the reason is because when there’s an ad on my phone, I’m already connected to the
internet so I can just swipe up or whatever without more. And it just seems like the
distance is smaller, it’s more familiar automatically somehow. (Informant G3)

45

These thoughts display several aspects of why social media ads are preferred by the
informants. As seen in the quotes, personal-, familiar-, and easy aspects of social media
ads were discussed in both groups as significant qualities for feeling positive towards
the ads. For these individuals it, therefore, seems essential that it is easy to investigate
further whether the advertised product is of interest, that the ad seems tailored to their
personal needs, and that the ad depicts and strengthens a feeling of familiarity.
However, the abundance of ads seems to have shaped resistant consumers in both
groups. On several occasions during the discussions, participants stated or implied that
ad novelty is crucial. In the discussions, it became clear that the participants are not
easily affected by marketing. Informants in both groups claimed that an ad must be
unique in some way or the informants must be in a certain mood, to be influenced by
this kind of marketing. A mood or mindset that could make the informants, in this case,
purchase a product, would be that they, for example, already have a problem that could
be solved with a product.
Most of the times, I just ignore it [ads on social media] and I don’t really think about it
anymore, because there’s so many ads everywhere so I think many times I don’t see
them anymore because I just put them away and then forget about it. (Informant G3)
Most of the ads are… coming again and again and once and again, so maybe one time
I’m clicking if it’s really interesting but most of the time it’s always the same.
(Informant G5)
I click on them to just see what is the product actually, it’s not because I need it or I’m
going to buy it, but it definitely has to be more “something else”, something that’s
standing out in a certain way to me actually clicking on it, because [otherwise] I can’t
really get bothered. (Informant D5)
Unless it’s a brand I like and I’m the mindset that I want to buy something from them
I’m not someone who would really see something and go “oh I have to buy it”. I really
put a lot of effort into researching what is the right product I need to solve a problem.
(Informant D3)

4.1.2

Awareness and trust

As it was shown in the previous sections, the participants clearly showed that it
requires certain actions to influence them with social media ads. This section
elaborates on this topic by focusing on awareness and trust in the context of social
media marketing. These subjects were discussed indirectly in the focus groups, as it

46

might be difficult to know what makes one trust or remember an ad or company. When
asking questions indirectly related to these subjects, participants’ opinions could be
extracted.
In the discussions it became clear that awareness is needed for trust to be created.
Informants D1 and D2, for instance, stated that they became interested in trying
products after seeing ads on social media. This implies that interest in a product, brand
or company can be created by seeing ads on social media. However, these informants
also highlighted that they had seen several ads from the company before doing more
research about it or purchasing products.
As stated earlier, all informants had experienced purchasing products after seeing ads
on social media. A clear majority said that this had happened on Instagram. This would
also strengthen the theory of consumers being more receptive to stimuli on Instagram,
compared to Facebook. Another reason for this could be the layout of the platform, as
mentioned earlier. Informant D3 explained why she thinks Instagram is more effective
than Facebook:
[I] think it’s the nature of Instagram because it takes up the entire screen. So, you focus
100% on that product for a split second, so you are not distracted while looking at it.
Whereas on Facebook they tend to use carousels, so you’ll see multiple products at the
same time, so it’s easier to just scroll past it. (Informant D3)

Other informants argued similar things when talking about social media ads in general.
It was, for example, stated that these ads are more effective as it forces the viewer to
pay attention to the ads as “it’s the only thing you’re seeing right now” (Informant
G5). The setting in which an ad is presented, therefore, seems to be important for the
informants.
Another common theme that emerged in both groups was that the informants showed
to have distinct ways of examining whether the company can be trusted or not. The
majority of informants stated that they first check the company’s social media
platforms to obtain a general feeling of the company and an overview of what type of
company it is. Informants also stated that they often visit the company’s website to
collect more facts, such as the company’s origin and shipment details. Informant D2,
for instance, thought that checking the origin of the company gives an idea of what to
47

expect, primarily considering the price level and quality. Both groups agreed that a
reliable and serious impression is needed to be able to trust the company, but how this
is achieved somewhat differed. FG1 identified authentic messages, user reviews, and
friend recommendations as the most important factors. The participants in this group
emphasized that they often check Trustpilot or similar websites to ensure that the
company can be trusted. Influencers were also mentioned as an option to increase the
trustworthiness, but only vaguely.
I never buy anything from the U.S. because I know that it can probably add several cost
if you have to ship it all the way from the U.S., so that’s the stuff I think about. I also
look at if the website is scam because you hear so many stories about people taking
your credit card information and using it and you kind of get scammed that way. So
I’m very aware of that and I also like to read other people’s opinion on the website so
I get… exactly like if you go to an Airbnb or something you like to read what other
people have said about this apartment and about the product, and I really want to go
through that before I buy something to make sure that I’m like safe. (Informant D2)
I usually check Trustpilot before I buy something and at the website to see if people
have commented anything. (Informant D4)
Sometimes it also helps if you know that somebody else has bought something from
them so if you follow somebody on any social media then they say they recommend
“oh I tried to use this service” and…or a friend that tells me that “this product is really
good and you can get it there” and it definitely makes it more easy to actually go to that
website and actually think about buying it. (Informant D5)

However, participants in FG2 had a slightly different view on the matter. In general,
this group seemed to be less inclined to take risks when purchasing products online
and, therefore, needs more verification. These informants want the company to
convince them and provide proof of the product’s claimed quality/effect. The
informants are expecting the company to provide them with information about the
company and the products, so they eventually can determine the level of
trustworthiness. The informants also discussed that if they see, for example,
influencers and specialists in ads, it can make the company more trustworthy. Even
though influencers were also mentioned in FG1, it was to a considerably lesser extent
than the discussion in FG2. Furthermore, informants in FG2 seem to be more careful
regarding what they buy and from where.
For me it’s much more [if] an influencer or something like this, advertises something
with like a code or… that I’m more likely to swipe up and check it out what it actually
is (…) I would say especially when it’s important that it’s asthma friendly and allergy
friendly, I think then I would like to see some sort of specialist or something that can
say that it’s correct or it’s been tested by someone or some sort of organization or
specialist who can vouch that that segment is actually correct. (Informant G4)

48

Yeah I need to say if there’s an influencer I’m following a long long time and I think
that their products are very good, and they said that “this is like so good”, like really
authentic influencer so I think I know she’s just using very good products, then I’m
thinking “ok maybe you can try” but mostly these products are overpriced. (Informant
G5)

Thus, when the informants from both groups become aware of a company and the
interesting product, they do a company check to determine whether it is to be trusted
or not. Additionally, due to this, it is clear that all participants are used to encountering
foreign and unfamiliar companies on a daily basis. Informant G1 also stated that most
of the brands that are promoted on social media platforms are unfamiliar, which has
made her more used to seeing and doing research about these types of companies.
When discussing whether the company’s origin matter, the majority of informants
stated that they rarely check where the company originates. As said earlier, it may give
an indication of the expected quality and price level, but most of the informants’
conclusion about a company’s trustworthiness derives from the habits stated above.
Furthermore, the informants had similar associations to Finland. 8/10 informants
associate Finland with landscapes and mentioned words such as “nature”, “sceneries”,
“snow”, “cold”, and “trees”. Only one informant, G5, said she associates Finland with
blonde people, but no other distinct stereotypes appeared in the discussions. It was also
clear that the associations can be applied to other countries than Finland, and they can,
therefore, be characterized as relatively weak associations. When discussing the last
picture in the study, the informants could have connected the picture to other countries,
although it included typical Finnish elements such as nature, lingonberries, moss, and
wood/forest. However, regarding cosmetics, FG2 valued when the Finnish origin was
emphasized. Informants stated that Finland and cosmetics are a good match as they
associate Finland with “traditions” and “long history of research” (informant G1).
Emphasizing the Finnish origin in cosmetic ads might, thus, make informants in FG2
trust the products more.

49

4.1.3

Cosmetic ad perception

This subsection deals with informants’ preferences regarding cosmetics ads. As the
focus company of this thesis is in fact a cosmetics company, one of the overall themes
is attitudes towards cosmetic marketing on social media. This section will, therefore,
focus on this topic, supported by segments from the last theme in the focus group
discussions. Data presented in previous subsections will also be used to generate a
clear demonstration of the groups’ and informants’ opinions.
As seen in the previous subsections, informants in both groups state both similar and
dissimilar thoughts. When it comes to the informants’ consumer behavior regarding
cosmetics purchases, both groups were discussing similar things. Informants from both
groups, for example, claimed that they are loyal to certain products and not brands.
I wouldn’t say I’m loyal to one brand, I would say I’m loyal to products. If I find a
product that I really like I will usually stick to it, until I… only if I find something
better, I will switch. (Informant D2)
I wouldn’t say that I’m loyal to one brand but I have some products and I’m loyal to
these products, I always buy the same products. They’re not all from the same brand
but once I’ve found a product that I like it’s really hard to convince me of another
product, which is just the same but from another brand… if there was a possibility to
try it for free or something maybe [I would be convinced to switch], but I wouldn’t
order and pay the full price because there’s the risk that it’s not better than the one I’m
used to so why should I take the risk. (Informant G3)

However, the informants stating these thoughts motivated their answers slightly
different. Informant D2 said she buys the same products because of the ingredients
and that she knows that they suit her skin. Informant G3, however, emphasized the
risk of switching products more because of a potential discontent regarding price and
functionality of the new product. In FG2, informants G3 and G1 discussed this further
saying that they think it would be unreasonable to switch products and risk spending
money on something that is possibly worse, when they are content with what they
have.
The informants seem to have similar attitudes towards social media in general and
describe their behavior on these platforms in similar ways, but in other aspects the two
groups differ. For instance, the groups had somewhat contrasting views regarding what
a cosmetics company’s communication should look like in order to be appealing. Both
50

groups discussed the importance of authentic communication. FG1 defined authentic
communication in terms of reliable messages and avoidance of obvious marketing
tools. Informant D4 stated that, typically, messages in cosmetics ads claim that “they
can fix this in one minute”, and the ads are usually “too good to be true”. Informant
D2 also stressed that a cosmetics ad’s message should be reliable to be appealing.
Moreover, informants D2 and D5 further discussed that the usage of celebrities in
marketing has a negative effect on their purchase intention. Due to these reasons,
informants in FG1 agreed that ads normally do not convince them unless the
communication is perceived to be authentic.
Informants in FG2 also stressed that authentic communication is significant but
defined it slightly differently. In this group, authentic communication seemed to
signify the use of appropriate words and specific visual content. Informants in this
group clearly associate trustworthy cosmetic products with certain words, such as
“clean”, “nature”, and “natural”. Informant G5 stated that using these words can
provide proof that the products are good and harmless. Furthermore, a higher price
together with neutral colors and “no extras” (informant G1) in ads, can indicate class
and quality. The majority of the informants in FG2 also related class and quality to a
good brand. Additionally, for the ads and brand to be perceived as authentic, the
visuals must match the message and the chosen words. For these informants, it is
important to see the products, as well as real skin and real people in cosmetics ads.
Informant G1, for example, stated that using acne-prone skin instead of “perfect skin”
to demonstrate the effect of certain makeup products would indicate authenticity.
Informant G5 agreed with this as she stated that using people in ads might lead to
negative effects; unless the people in the ads match her ways of seeing herself, the ad
is perceived as less relatable and her interest in purchasing the product, thus, decreases.
Furthermore, the groups both identified the type of information as well as how it is
presented as essential factors when evaluating ads. Both groups agreed on the fact that
ads need to be informative, and the information should be presented in a direct manner.
A clear majority in both groups would prefer ads with more information. Informants
from both groups, for example, liked when the product’s price was specified in the
ads. When discussing the first set of ads, at least 3/5 informants in FG1 preferred the
second alternative as it is more appealing. In FG2 at least 4/5 preferred the second ad
51

and they motivated their choice because of a lowered risk. For instance, informants G1
and G3 stated that it feels like the brands are hiding something if they omit certain
kind of information. Therefore, when ads directly state information about, for example,
what the products contain or the price of the products, the brand is perceived more
trustworthy. However, informants in FG1 also expressed that too much information
might result in a negative experience. Informant D4, for example, said that she would
feel “lost” and would just scroll past it on social media if an ad contained a lot of
information. She explained that too much information diminishes her curiosity of the
brand or product.
The groups’ opinions slightly varied when discussing how the information is
presented. Informants from both groups stated that direct information is significant for
the ads to be appealing. The majority of informants in both groups expressed opinions
indicating that they want to be able to quickly process the ad and determine the level
of attractiveness. Informants in FG1 want the ads to clearly emphasize the most central
elements, such as “low fragrance” or “allergy tested”, to determine if it is of interest.
These informants also prefer informative communication over expressive, whereas
informants in FG2 prefer easy and relatable language. Furthermore, informants in FG2
also underlined the importance of feeling personally addressed. For example,
informant G1 stated she would be more attracted to the focus company’s slogan, if it
instead of “a gift for the skin” said “a gift for your skin”. She added that using “you”
in ads gives the impression that the products are tailored according to her specific
needs, which makes her more inclined to buy. Informant G3 also agreed and said that
she feels like the ads are talking to her directly if using words such as “you”.
Additionally, no informant commented on the fact that the ads were in English. When
asked, informants from both groups stated that English ads frequently appear in their
social media feeds. It, therefore, seems like the informants in this study are used to
encountering English communication online.
Furthermore, when discussing the ads in the focus groups, an obvious pattern in FG2
was the topic about simplicity. In this group it seems to be appreciated when the
company, which is advertising, invites the consumer into taking simple actions. During
several occasions, simplicity came up as an essential quality; for example, the ad
should provide enough information about the product, the informants are more
52

influenced by the ad if it is easy to collect more information, and the language should
be easy to understand. This means that direct, quick, and easy ads appeal to informants
in FG2. The following segments illustrate the analysis about direct language in FG1
and FG2, as well as simplicity in FG2.
There’s less text [under the left ad in the second set of ads] so it’s easier kind of to the
point, plus on the second one [the right ad] it’s kind of like “nature is filled with the
colours of autumn” and I’m like “why do I need to know this, it has nothing to do with
the products” I mean, what color the product has… has nothing to do with what… what
I need it for. The other is very, ok “products with oat flour and -oil. Oats contain plenty
of beta-glucan, which soothes and moisturizes the skin” that’s what I need to know
from this product, I don’t need to know that it’s the color of autumn to use it. So for
me, again, it’s about being relatable and talking to people on their level and not trying
to be pretentious and be something that they’re not. (Informant D2)
I actually prefer the text underneath to the left one [in the second set of ads], because
in the left one it also says “oats contain plenty of beta-glucan” I don’t know what that
is, so products contain Finnish oats and Nordic oat oil sounds easier to me. I can
associate something with it. (Informant G1)
I think the [last] picture’s beautiful but what I don’t like it’s not obvious what it’s about,
so usually when I see just a picture and some, I don’t know, slogans, and it’s not obvious
to me what kind of product they want to sell, it annoys me and I just ignore it. So I
would prefer it if it would be clear that they offer skin-friendly cream or whatever,
because I think it’s about ingredients and everything. But only in the second sentence I
think they say “our skin-friendly and caring products”, yeah, it’s still not really clear
that it’s skin care so that’s… I don’t really like that. (Informant G3)

Additionally, in contrast to FG2, one of the more distinct topics in FG1 was the visual
elements of the ads. In general, visuals seem to convince these informants more than
words do. Informant D5, for instance, stated that she is always looking for a visual
description of the product in an ad before doing more research about the product or
brand. She needs to see pictures or videos to get an impression of the size, colors, and
how it looks on the skin to be interested. Furthermore, in the discussion it was implied
that unique and innovative advertising would make them stop, but they need to feel
that they can relate in order to act. The carrot in the first set of ads gave rise to a long
discussion, where the majority claimed they disliked seeing a carrot in a cosmetics ad.
However, when asked, 4/5 stated they would stop if they saw the ad in their social
media feeds. Informant D1 explained that she would stop because a carrot is an unusual
sight in her feed, and it would, therefore, increase her curiosity. Informant D4 also
stated that the ad is something different, which would make her remember the brand.
Yet, the informants also highlighted the importance of relatable visuals, such as in the
second set of ads. Here, the informants valued the right-hand alternative as it felt more

53

common and relatable. It, therefore, seems that informants in FG1 value visual
elements that they can relate to, but innovative ads can make them stop and remember
a brand.

4.2 Summary of focus group discussions
In the focus group discussions multiple opinions were expressed. Individual
informants from both groups agreed on certain ideas, and both groups showed to have
similar attitudes when discussing specific topics. However, the discussions also
resulted in greater general differences between the groups, and these are summarized
in this subchapter.
When discussing social media ads FG1 showed more positive attitudes, than did FG2.
Informants in FG1 expressed to be content that they receive more targeted ads and
more relevant content, whereas FG2 thought ads in general were disrupting and
unnecessary. When discussing ads more specifically, different opinions were
expressed regarding preferences of certain elements. Participants in FG1 emphasized
the importance of user reviews and a reliable message as ways of gaining their trust.
In contrast, participants in FG2 require someone who can vouch for a statement
claimed by the company, such as specialists or influencers, to perceive the company
as trustworthy. This group also saw it as the company’s responsibility to convince
them about what is offered. They want to be informed about, for example, the origin
of the company in a way that is easy to understand, preferably with elements that they
feel they can relate to. Additionally, they want to feel personally addressed and want
the company to provide enough information about the brand or product. If the
informants want further information, the company should offer easy solutions to gain
more information. FG1 usually takes control over the situation themselves by studying
what other users have said about the product/brand or controlling the origin of the
company to obtain an idea of the company and if it can be trusted. Furthermore, this
group prefers informative language and stress visuals as important factors in an ad for
increasing the perceived level of trustworthiness. As a summary, it is clear that FG1
generally takes more risks than FG2, and FG2 needs more proof of statements claimed

54

by the company. Table 3 presents the main differences that appeared between the two
groups.

Table 3: Comparison of focus groups

FG1
Generally more positive towards ads
Rely on user reviews
Reliable message important
Generally take more risks
Control origin themselves if needed
Prefer informative language
Visuals important

FG2
Generally more negative towards ads
Want the company to convince them
Influencers, specialists, etc. important
Generally do not like taking risks
Want to be informed about origin
Prefer easy/relatable language
Simplicity and to be personally addressed
important

5. Results
The previous analysis section constitutes the basis of the discussion in this chapter.
The purpose of this chapter is to answer the research questions by outlining the
complete results of the study. This is achieved by comparing the study’s analysis to
previous research and compose a base for the conclusions. The research questions to
be answered are:
1. How can foreign companies create consumer awareness in different cultures
through social media ads?
2. Which foreign cues in social media cosmetics ads can increase positive
consumer perception across cultures?
3. What should the social media ads look like to create trust and increase purchase
intention across cultures?
The structure of the chapter is formed in accordance with the main themes found in
the research questions, as well as in the literature review. The chapter will, therefore,
follow the central themes consumer awareness, foreign cues and positive consumer
perception, as well as trust and purchase intention. All main themes focus on social
media marketing from a culture perspective, and the findings are, therefore, juxtaposed
with Hofstede and Hall’s culture theories at the end of the chapter.

5.1 Consumer awareness
In this subchapter, the first research question is being answered. In the literature review
it was stated that the millennial generation is a complicated group of consumers that
compel companies to rethink their communication strategies. Analyzing the study’s
discoveries, it can be seen that companies also must consider their communication on
social media to adapt to the generation’s modern needs. For social media ads to
successfully create awareness it must, firstly, be communicated in contexts where the
target group is active. Additionally, in the literature review it was stated that
millennials have developed abilities to quickly filter and sort communication, making

56

it hard to keep these consumers’ attention (Munsch, 2021; Nielsen, 2017, February 3).
Secondly, the communication must, hence, be perceived as appealing to whoever is
targeted. Informants in the focus group discussions fit the description as being
distracted, resistant and skeptical. A clear contributing factor to this is the abundance
of information and marketing communication that they constantly encounter.
Furthermore, it was discovered that the informants use Instagram as their primary
social media platform. Due to the informants’ way of using it, as well as the design of
Instagram, it can be concluded that informants are more inclined to purchasing
products when seeing ads on Instagram. Additionally, the usage of Facebook has
declined and the purposes of using this platform were shown to be limited to news and
communication, whereas the informants’ views of Instagram were more unrestricted.
This results in more open-minded mindsets when using Instagram, making them more
influenced by marketing practices. Furthermore, the design of Instagram limits the
risks of losing the viewer’s attention as one post is shown at a time. This also implies
that they pay more attention to ads on social media, meaning that awareness can be
created through this platform. In the literature review it was claimed that traditional
media might be more suitable for creating awareness (Coulter et al., 2012). However,
in the focus group discussions it was clear that the majority is more influenced by
marketing communication on social media. This, however, agrees with the findings
presented by Valentine and Powers (2013), stating that millennials find social media
communication more appealing.
Simply choosing a suitable platform is, nevertheless, inadequate to create awareness.
Because of the distracted mindset, millennials’ ad and brand memorability has been
showed to be weak (Munsch, 2021; Nielsen, 2017). This implies that it is crucial that
companies have a clear strategy for how to communicate with the generation.
Furthermore, in the literature review, three factors presented by Kumar et al. (2016)
were discussed that might affect the effectiveness of company communication: the
sense of the message, consumers’ response, and consumers’ attitudes towards the
platforms. Regarding the sense of the message, the two groups slightly differed. The
Danish informants consider an authentic sense to be an essential factor in capturing
their attention and increasing their interest in the brand. Successfully generating
authentic and reliable messages would mean that the informants are more likely to
discuss the brand with their network, leading to greater spread and increased
57

awareness. This is essential as Danish consumers showed to rely heavily on other
users’ opinions. I contrast, the German informants respond positively to a sense of
personal and relatable messages. These findings indicate that there are differences in
what consumers from different cultures notice and prefer to see in ads on social media.
More findings of how the ads should look will be further discussed in the following
subchapters. Furthermore, in the discussions it was apparent that the groups’ general
attitudes towards social media ads slightly differed. However, the groups’ attitudes
towards social media platforms in general appeared to be similar, meaning that the
informants’ attitudes towards ads on social media were independent of their attitudes
towards the platforms. Individuals from both groups had been influenced by social
media ads regardless of their opinions about social media ads. It can, therefore, be
concluded that the results of this thesis strengthen the theory presented by Kumar et
al. (2016).
In the discussions, informants in both groups agreed that the social media ads primarily
must stand out in a way that make them want to stop and engage with the company.
Even though the carrot in the first set of ads resulted in mixed feelings, it was evident
that innovative and divergent elements capture consumers’ attention. For instance, in
FG1 it could be seen that regardless of the informants’ opinions about including the
carrot in the ad, it caused a lot of discussion. Informants that disliked the carrot stated
it increased the chance of remembering the brand or induced them to do more research
about the company. Additionally, it could also be seen that informants also took longer
time to process the brand and the information when the ad included something
unexpected. This would mean that using elements associated with novelty and
originality will increase awareness significantly in both cultures.
Moreover, the focus group discussions provided strong evidence suggesting that
appearing frequently on social media create a sense of familiarity. This can be
considered important as it showed to increase awareness significantly, which directly
affects the consumer’s purchase intention and trust. Informant D1 clearly explained
that her perception of brands has changed when seeing ads from the brands multiple
times.

58

I’ve done it a few times [bought products from social media]. Sometimes. If I see the
ad a hundred times, as you sometimes do, then I just realize “okay that this product is
really cool, I have to buy it”. So I’ve done it a few times and I guess since it is targeted
it is products for me and it works sometimes. (Informant, D1)

Based on these findings it can be concluded that many factors play noteworthy roles
in the creation of awareness. It has been shown to be vital to know how the consumers
use certain platforms to understand when and how to communicate with them.
Millennials expect the brands to inform them about their existence on platforms where
the consumers are open to receiving information. The ads must stand out to grab initial
attention as the consumers are skilled at filtering and sorting out marketing
communication. The ads must further be altered according to which group is targeted,
as preferences have shown to differ depending on culture. Utilizing platforms with
suitable designs which compel consumers to stop is seen as beneficial to further
decrease risks of communicating with inattentive consumers. Additionally, frequently
appearing on these platforms can lead to a feeling of familiarity for the consumers,
which might develop into purchase intention and trust.

5.2 Foreign cues and positive consumer perception
This subchapter processes and answers the second research question. As it was argued
in the previous subchapter, the ad must look in a certain way to capture the viewer’s
attention due to the abundance of information online. In this thesis, foreign cues have
been discussed to influence consumers’ perception of the brand, product, or company.
In the literature review it was stated that cues can clearly affect the consumer’s attitude
in purchase decisions (Koschate-Fischer et al., 2012). Depending on which country is
connected to the product, it might have a positive or negative effect on the consumer’s
perception. The consumer’s attitude towards the country might determine which effect
certain cues have (Aichner, 2014). In the focus group discussions, it was apparent that
both groups had positive attitudes towards Finland. In accordance with the theory, this
would mean that emphasizing the Finnish origin would lead to increased purchase
intention. However, this only seemed to be the case in FG2, the German group. This
group clearly considered cosmetics and Finland a good match for highlighting the
healthy aspect of products. Informants G1 and G5 explicitly stated that they would like
59

to be informed about the fact that the COO is Finland already in the slogan, when
discussing the focus company. Although the Danish group’s preferences whether to
emphasize Finland as the COO were vaguer, mentioning Finland in the ads did give
rise to a neutral perception rather than negative. Furthermore, the informants in FG1
also discussed that COO in general gives an idea of what to expect in terms of quality
and price level. This agrees with the theory presented by Koschate-Fischer et al.
(2012), and the fact that COO can indicate precisely these features.
In the Danish group, however, the Finnish language was discussed. The majority of
informants in this group thought of Finland as a country with a difficult and strange
language. It, therefore, became clear that the Danish informants had rather negative
attitudes towards the language. Considering this, using Finnish words as foreign cues
in ads might lead to a more negative perception than a positive one for these
informants.
In terms of visual foreign cues, multiple opinions emerged. Usunier and Cestre (2007)
claimed that the consumer’s stereotypes of the COO will affect how the ad is
perceived. They also claimed that if the company utilizes a foreign language in their
ads, consumers are more likely to purchase products if the ad is congruent with the
consumer’s stereotypes. In the focus group discussions, informants discussed several
elements except the use of English. Only when asked, one person, informant D2, stated
that most of the content she sees when using social media is in English, meaning that
she is used to English ads. This can also be concluded for the rest of the informants as
no other commented on this fact. For these informants, the English language is,
therefore, no longer seen as a foreign cue. This corresponds to Nederstigt and
Hilberink-Schulpen’s (2018) theory that English nowadays is an effective tool when
standardizing marketing communication.
Furthermore, in the focus groups, only one person, informant G5, associated Finland
with blonde people, which is considered a typical stereotype. However, in the second
set of ads, she clearly stated that she preferred the second ad as she could relate more
to that one. Although most informants associated Finland with words connected to
nature, informants did not associate the last picture used in the study with Finland. As
the picture contained moss, wood, and lingonberries as foreign cues, it can be
60

concluded that more specific cues must be used for informants to link the picture/brand
to Finland. Whether some of the other associations that emerged in the discussions,
for instance “snow”, “ice”, and “northern lights”, would work as more effective cues,
is to be discovered in future research. It can, however, be concluded that foreign cues
must perfectly match the consumer’s associations with the COO to have a clear
positive effect on consumers’ perception.

5.3 Trust and purchase intention
In this subchapter, the third and last research question is answered. In the focus group
discussions, several examples of ads were shown to examine how informants related
to the creation of trust and increase of purchase intention.
It was apparent that ads must capture their attention in a way that is according to their
own interests and values. In the literature review, it was also stated that the ad must
create positive attitudes to be perceived as trustworthy (De Mooij, 2019). The key
question for understanding the themes processed in this subchapter is, therefore, to
identify how favorable attitudes are created. As it has been stated, the Danish group
was shown to be willing to take more risks in general compared to the German group.
It can thus be considered logical that the two groups differ in what they are looking for
in ads.
It was, however, shown that both groups prefer informative ads. This agrees with the
theory stated by Yoo and MacInnis (2005), that positive attitudes are formed when
clear information about the brand or product is provided. When this aspect is achieved,
initial trust is more likely to be created. The majority of informants in both focus
groups stated that facts should be presented in an explicit and direct manner. This
seems to make the analysis of the ad quicker, which is appreciated by this generation.
Information that the informants in general are looking for is, for instance, price. This
increases the sense of appeal for informants in FG1 and reduces risk for the informants
in FG2. However, FG1 also stated the importance of not adding too much text or
celebrities, as this will reduce their interest significantly. Both groups agreed that
stating direct facts in the ads results in increased perceived trustworthiness.
61

Additionally, emphasis should be on the consumers’ benefits from purchasing the
specific product. Both groups clearly expressed views considering the importance of
emphasizing the individual benefit and “investing in yourself” (informant G1).
Furthermore, it became apparent that both groups consider authentic communication
essential for gaining their trust. The Danish informants see authenticity as generating
reliable messages. This would entail that the consumers are informed in a trustworthy
manner, while the company is avoiding being perceived as “pretentious (…) and
something that they’re not” (informant D2). The German group defined authentic
communication as providing proof with the help of certain words or visuals. Authentic
communication is cosmetics ads in this group is thus considered to be ads using words
such as “clean” and “natural”.
Moreover, informants in FG2 also stated the fact that a trustworthy brand’s ad
highlights high class and high quality. Additionally, a trustworthy brand’s ad also
includes specialists or other knowledgeable persons who can vouch for the company’s
statements. Because of these findings it can be concluded that FG1 is willing to
purchase from or engage with new brands if the ads are informative and/or the brand
feels familiar. Familiarity and trustworthiness can be achieved by frequently appearing
on social media or from seeing user reviews. Purchasing new brands imply a great risk
for FG2, and these informants, therefore, take a great deal of convincing to increase
the purchase intention and trust.

5.4 Linking results to culture theories
Juxtaposing these findings with Hofstede and Hall’s culture theories, some
assumptions can be made. The two cultures examined in this thesis do not rely on
stereotypes when evaluating a foreign brand and its ads. This agrees with Triandis’s
(2018) theory that collectivistic cultures are more inclined to rely on stereotypes when
analyzing cultural cues in marketing communication. Germany is identified as a
restrained culture, meaning that saving is important, and they are purchasing only if
necessary. These informants discussed risks of, for instance, purchasing from a foreign
company, on several occurrences. Informants G1 and G3 both stated that they would
consider it irrational to pay for an unfamiliar brand or even try the products when they
62

are content with the products and brand they are used to. When comparing Germany
to Denmark, the indulgence/restraint index can clearly be noticed as the indulgent
Danish informants showed to be more likely to purchase products and try new brands.
This can also be strengthened by the fact that Denmark is a short-term culture and low
uncertainty avoidant culture. Hallikainen and Laukkanen (2018) also stated that these
cultures are more willing to trust online vendors and form initial trust quicker towards
unfamiliar companies in an online context. This also indicates that Germany, in
contrast, is a high uncertainty avoidant culture. Informant G2 exemplified this, as she
clearly stated that she trusts physical stores more than online vendors.
For me, I buy the makeup in the stores so I wouldn’t buy something on the internet
because I want to see what it is and I want to touch it before I buy it. Little bit crazy
but… so I only buy my makeup in the store, not in the internet. (Informant G2)

Furthermore, the German group found ads appealing that in any way reduces the risk
of buying the products. That the German group discussed ad characteristics such as
using specialists or transparent communication, also supports the fact that Germany is
a highly uncertainty avoidant culture. Additionally, German informants value ads
which are classy and emphasize high quality. This feature can according to Hofstede’s
culture theory be seen as a characteristic for masculine cultures, and it, therefore, suits
Germany.
Both cultures are identified as individualistic and low-context cultures where direct
and explicit communication is valued, and this is also seen in both groups. The Danish
informants want the ads to use explicit language and emphasize the central features of
the products. Denmark is also considered a short-term culture, meaning that they want
to decide quickly whether the brand is interesting or not. The German informants also
find explicit and direct communication appealing as they want the ads to use relatable
language and to make them feel personally addressed and safe. Lastly, the Danish
group also highly value relatable visuals in ads. However, innovative visuals are
essential to arouse interest and provoke a discussion for these informants. This also
agrees with characteristics related to low uncertainty avoidant cultures, such as
Denmark, where innovativeness is appreciated (Hofstede Insights, 2020).

6. Conclusions and discussion
In this chapter the conclusions are presented along with a discussion of the research
findings. Discussions of limitations, managerial implications, as well as suggestions
for future research are also provided. The chapter’s content contributes to a further
developed knowledge about the central topics.

6.1 Conclusions
This thesis has studied social media marketing and culture’s role in millennial
consumers’ perception of such marketing. The thesis has further examined awareness
and trust, i.e., how they are created and how the development of these factors
influences the effectiveness of ads on social media. Examining these topics showed
that companies must carefully consider how to shape the communication aimed
towards millennial consumers. After conducting two focus group discussions with
individuals from this generation, it became evident that they are demanding and
informed consumers. The focus group discussions resulted in clear indications that the
consumers respond differently to marketing practices. Because of the abundance of
information they encounter, these individuals have developed into conscious
consumers, who demand and expect marketing communication to be adapted to their
needs and behaviors. They are, therefore, expecting companies to know what they
want and how they want to be informed about it.
The participants’ consumer behavior was reflected in the way they identified
trustworthy ads and companies on social media. The participants showed to have
strong preferences for how the communication should look and where it should be
offered. Three main factors were identified in the discussions as significant for creating
awareness and trust: innovation, informativeness and authenticity. These factors all
play significant roles if awareness and trust are to be created. Innovative ads showed
to be crucial in capturing the consumers attention as they generally are not interested
in marketing messages. The participants are resistant consumers and are only pursued
by marketing when actively looking for a solution to a problem. Yet, innovative ads

64

can successfully capture the consumers’ attention by standing out in the flow of
communication on social media. Such ads encourage consumers to engage with the
company and can invite consumers to discuss the brand with others. Consumers’
likeable and dislikeable thoughts of innovative ads should be equally appreciated by
the company, as they can both lead to greater chances of consumer remembrance and
engagement. Furthermore, the results showed that marketing on Instagram will lead to
higher levels of awareness, as participants in both focus groups were more inclined to
purchase products visible on Instagram than on Facebook. Consumers’ behaviors
differ between platforms, and companies, therefore, have a greater chance of
penetrating consumers’ barriers when communicating on Instagram. Additionally,
frequently appearing on channels which are preferred by the consumers lead to a sense
of familiarity. This familiarity can be compared to the effects of having a reputation.
Previous research concluded that lack of reputation might have negative effects on
purchase intention (Jap, 2010), but the results in this study indicate that creating a
sense of familiarity on social media can have a corresponding effect.
Informativeness and authenticity play major roles when creating trust is seen as the
main goal. After capturing the consumers’ attention, consumers must feel that the
company is trustworthy. When discussing how to achieve these aspects in social media
ads, the two focus groups differed. In general, participants in FG2 were less inclined
to take risks. The individuals in this group, therefore, demand the company to provide
enough information and proof for the claimed statements to increase the
trustworthiness. In contrast, FG1 want the company to emphasize the most important
features of the advertised product or brand, to quickly be able to process the ad. These
results can both be connected to Germany as a high uncertainty avoidant culture and
Denmark as a short-term culture. Furthermore, being individualistic and low-context
cultures, both groups showed clear preferences for direct and explicit language in ads.
In the participants’ preferences, a cultural influence could, therefore, to some extent
be noted. Some dimensions from Hofstede’s culture theory are visible, but more
extensive research must be executed to fully comprehend the theory’s applicability to
social media marketing.
Moreover, participants also demonstrated clear modern mindsets. It became evident
that they are used to encountering global brands and information making them less
65

attentive to cultural details. The participants are constantly encountering new brands
and marketing messages are typically presented in English. It could also be seen that
cultural cues must be presented in a certain, obvious way to influence the effectiveness
of the communication. Therefore, Hofstede’s culture theory must be examined in
further research to determine its usefulness for studying the modern consumer in a
global context.

6.2 Discussion
As the focus was on understanding consumers and how social media marketing is
perceived, an extensive part of the results identified consumer traits for the examined
generation. Differences between groups emerged as the focus company’s marketing
was discussed. Prior research studying millennials as consumers has shown that they
are a unique group of people, which has developed a specific disposition adapted to
encountering marketing communication. This was also shown in the results of the
study in this thesis. After conducting two focus group discussions it became evident
that all individuals have clear thoughts of what can be considered trustworthy
communication on social media. It was clear that the abundance of information has
shaped the individuals to quickly identify any kind of persuasion attempt and analyze
whether more attention should be given to it or not. The individuals, therefore, showed
to be resistant consumers who demand the company communication to be shaped
according to their terms.
To capture these individuals’ attention, it can thus be stated crucial to understand their
behavior. This of course agrees with basic knowledge when aiming the communication
to a specific target group. However, the results from the study in this thesis expands
on the topic as differences were found between the groups. The two groups’ opinions
about social media marketing differed, as FG1 showed a more positive attitude towards
ads on social media compared to FG2. Yet, the results from the study showed that the
individuals’ disposition did not influence the ads’ effects; individuals from both groups
had all been influenced by ads on social media. This offers a contrasting view to
previous research saying that an individual’s general attitudes towards ads influence
how effective the marketing is (Yoo & MacInnis, 2005). The study did, however, also
66

find that the two groups’ opinions about social media in general were similar, as no
individual showed to have purely negative attitudes towards the platforms. As
individuals from both groups were shown to be equally affected by marketing
communication on social media, it can thus be claimed that attitudes towards platforms
influence the perceived effectiveness of the marketing message. This would agree with
the theory of Kumar et al. (2016) stating that the individual’s attitude towards social
media might determine the effect of the company’s communication. The results from
the study in this thesis did, however, also indicate that the choice of the platform in
which the message is communicated is significant for increasing the effectiveness of
the ads. Individuals from both groups expressed opinions indicating that behaviors
vary between platforms. It, thus, became evident that different platforms contribute to
different levels of awareness creation. Due to the motives of using Instagram and its
physical look, participants in both groups implied that they are more influenced by
marketing content on Instagram, compared to Facebook.
According to prior research, trust is created when favorable attitudes are being formed
(De Mooij, 2019). Additionally, Akar and Topçu (2011) stated that advertising
credibility is essential when favorable consumer attitudes towards social media
marketing are to be created. The study’s results indicate that this was also the case for
the examined participants. When the ads were perceived as informative and authentic,
the chances of successfully creating awareness and trust showed to be higher. Both
groups wanted to see clear and direct information about the advertised products. This
also agrees with prior research claiming that informative ads will lead to more positive
attitudes and have a higher chance of leading to the creation of initial trust (Yoo &
MacInnis, 2005). The results, thus, also strengthen the theory provided by Akar and
Topçu (2011).
However, although results show that participants were equally affected by social
media ads, differences between the groups emerged in how trustworthy ads should
look. Differences were, for example, found in how informativeness and authenticity is
achieved. Ads presenting facts with informative and to-the-point language were
perceived as authentic according to FG1, whereas FG2 preferred easy and relatable
language. Furthermore, FG1 favored reliable messages and the use of users’ opinions
and reviews. FG2 though, wanted the company to provide a significant amount of
67

information along with visuals, such as specialists or pictures of the products, verifying
the company’s claims. In general, participants in FG2 discussed the involved risks of
purchasing products online and from unfamiliar companies several times. This group
was, therefore, less likely to take risks and thus needs more information from the
company to decrease the perceived risk level. As stated in chapter 5.3, this difference
can be explained by Hofstede’s culture theory, as Germany in fact is a highly
uncertainty avoidant culture. Furthermore, FG1 emphasized the importance of stating
the main facts about the products in a direct way to quickly be able to analyze the ad,
which can also be explained by Denmark being a short-term oriented culture.
It, therefore, became evident that there are cultural differences in how social media
ads are perceived. Though, in this study, signs of the cultural dimensions were visible
only to some extent. This can be due to multiple reasons. Firstly, the individuals
showed to have global mindsets as several discussed the fact that they regularly
encounter foreign brands on social media. Moreover, it was stated or implied that most
ads on social media that these individuals see daily is in fact in English and/or from
foreign companies. On the one hand, the reason for this could be that the individuals
choosing to take part in the study have a higher English proficiency and might,
therefore, also be less bothered by English content. On the other hand, the reason could
be that individuals in the millennial generation have developed into more global
consumers. Thus, if the latter appears to be true, this generation is less influenced by
culture and standardized messages would be applicable in most cultures. However,
more extensive research is necessary to fully comprehend the reason for this
phenomenon.
Secondly, the cultures examined in this thesis, i.e. Denmark and Germany, might be
too close geographically and thus have too similar cultures to be able to notice a clear
difference. Choosing cultures that differ noticeably according to Hofstede’s culture
theory might result in clearer results. This might also contribute to stronger results
when determining which role associations and stereotypes play in analyzing cultural
messages. In this study it was, however, clear that foreign cues must be visible and
clear to have a major effect; small cues showed to have little effect for consumers’
perception and attitudes even though they to some extent matched the consumers’
associations of the country. However, FG2 did show a stronger preference of
68

emphasizing the Finnish origin. This difference might be explained by the fact that the
Danish culture is too closely related to Finland for the individuals to be able to
recognize the cultural cues. It might also be explained by the fact that participants in
FG2 also consider Finland and cosmetics a good match. Hence, it leads to a positive
perception and have a direct positive effect on the purchase intention. Further research
with additional cultures might be able to provide a strong explanation for this
phenomenon.
Thirdly, Hofstede’s culture theory might be less suitable for advertising in a social
media context. As the theory is made for traditional advertising, it might have to be
updated and adapted to a more digital format in order to suit social media marketing.
Due to the global context on social media, consumers might in general be more used
to foreign content. This would mean that the theory’s dimensions should be updated
to be more sensitive in order to discover cultural traits and be applicable to the modern
behavior.
However, as it can be concluded that the individuals in the study showed to have a
global mindset, some assumptions can be made. The results agree with the research
done by Jap (2010) saying that low credibility and low trust will have negative effects
on purchase intention and attitudes. Yet, the results show contrasting views of the
effect of the company’s reputation. Jap (2010) claims that lack of reputation also will
lead to similar negative outcomes. The results of the study in this thesis indicate that a
reputation is not needed for customers to feel inclined to purchase the advertised
products. Seeing ads from the company creates a feeling of familiarity, which can be
compared to a company reputation. It was, however, clear that the individuals become
aware of a brand when frequently seeing it on social media. This will lead to creation
of trust, which in turn leads to increased purchase intention. Moreover, the results
agree with prior research saying that millennials tend to focus on authenticity,
information about ingredients, and health aspects when making a purchase decision
for cosmetic products (Ishak et al., 2019). The study here also showed similar results
as authenticity and the healthy aspects of the products were widely discussed topics in
the focus group discussions.

69

6.3 Managerial implications
This subchapter processes and discusses suggestions for managers dealing with
situations related to the topics in this thesis. Based on the presented results, some
factors should be considered when planning social media marketing aimed at different
cultures.
When developing and shaping a company’s social media marketing, managers should
consider the generation and the culture of the target group. Communicating with the
millennial generation requires particular measures in order to reach the consumers. It
has been shown that this generation consists of impatient and resistant consumers who
easily lose interest when it comes to marketing messages. Just being present on social
media is, therefore, no longer enough to successfully communicate with these
consumers. When the goal is to increase awareness and create trust, managers must
consider the choice of platform to choose a platform where the consumers are
susceptible to marketing messages. The results indicate that Instagram is the most
suitable for the individuals participating in this study, and thus should managers
communicate with these individuals on Instagram to achieve the desired outcome.
When shaping social media ads, managers should consider the language used, as well
as visuals. Depending on culture, the style of the language should vary to better suit
the consumers’ ways of communicating. The results indicate that millennials
belonging to cultures defined as individualistic and low context prefer a direct style of
the information presented in ads. Information, such as health aspects, should be
emphasized in the ads in a clear way as millennials in general quickly process ads to
determine the level of interest. Additionally, authenticity should be highlighted in the
ads as these consumers have shown to highly value it. Though, depending on the
culture, authenticity can be presented in different ways. The Danish consumers showed
to define authentic ads as containing reliable messages and avoiding the feeling of
pretentiousness, whereas the German consumers highlighted real skin, informative
words, and the use of specialists. Additionally, managers should strive for creating
innovative and novel ads to capture the consumers’ attention. This was especially
shown to be important for the Danish participants. Informative visuals, such as pictures
of the product, were shown to be important for the German group. This can help
70

reducing these individuals’ implied level of risk that online purchasing clearly
involves. Thus, ads should be adapted to the particular culture involved to appeal to
the consumers’ preferences and capture their attention.
In summary, the ads should be informative and emphasize the central features of the
brand or the advertised products in a clear and direct way for the examined cultures.
Based on the results, it can be considered essential for managers to understand the
target culture and realize the significance of being able to effectively modify social
media marketing. The desired visuals and styles of language vary depending on
culture, and culture should thus be carefully considered when marketing across
cultures on social media.

6.4 Limitations
This thesis involves multiple limitations. These must be acknowledged and discussed
in order to deepen the knowledge of the topics processed in this thesis. Highlighting
the limitations might also contribute to a strengthening of further research while
expanding on the research executed here.
As with most research, the research design used in this study entails several limitations
that must be considered. As the aim of the research was to study millennial consumers’
perception and preferences in social media marketing, the participants had to meet
specific requirements. This limited the amount of people I could find during the
available time. Some difficulties also emerged as the goal was to find ten strangers to
be able to obtain as objective of a view of the theme as possible. However, due to this
being a master’s thesis, the limited time frame did not allow achieving such a goal.
The focus groups were, therefore, a mix of both acquainted and unacquainted
individuals. It is unmanageable to fully know how the mix of these individuals affected
the group dynamics and therefore also the results. I hope, however, to have eliminated
possible effects by mixing individuals in both groups. All individuals were also treated
equally in order to avoid feelings of inequality.

71

Due to limited Danish and German proficiency, the focus group discussions had to be
done in English. This might have influenced the participants’ attitudes towards the ad
examples. Furthermore, as the thesis was written and the study carried out during the
covid-19 pandemic, the discussions were conducted online in Zoom due to social
distancing recommendations and the informants’ countries of residence. The flow of
the discussions, as well as participants’ opinions could thus have been influenced by
the online format of the discussion and prevailing circumstances. Participants might,
for example, have started to use social media more actively during the pandemic. This
could have affected and changed their motives for using social media and their
attitudes towards the platforms.
Furthermore, as a researcher it is essential to stay objective throughout the research
process. However, as the analysis and results’ discussions require interpretation to
reach conclusions, the thesis is subject to some degree of subjectivity. As I knew which
themes were of importance for the thesis, I actively looked for indications in the
transcripts that could help me onwards in my research. I did, however, continuously
try to remain open to alternative meanings and I took all of them into account when
analyzing the results. Nevertheless, it is impossible to state with certainty that my
mindset and personal approach have not influenced the outcome of the research. Due
to the online format of the focus group discussions, I also had to take a more active
role as the moderator. This could have affected the discussions, but at the same time it
was also necessary to organize the discussions and avoid interruptions.
Moreover, it is important to acknowledge that only two focus group discussions were
conducted with a total of ten participants. It should, therefore, be avoided to use the
results as a base for generalizing a population. The study should, thus, be seen as
exploratory research, which serves as a study aiming to gain knowledge about a certain
phenomenon. This signifies that this thesis is expanding the topics and increasing the
general understanding of the examined topic.

72

6.5 Future research
This subchapter discusses possible future research in accordance with the limitations
outlined in the previous subchapter. Due to the discussed time frame of producing this
thesis, executing a larger study was unachievable. To further deepen the knowledge
about the main topic and to be able to generalize the results, a larger study could be
executed. To truly understand culture’s role in consumers’ perception of social media
marketing, further research should examine additional cultures. Examining multiple
cultures might entail richer results leading to a better overview of how much culture
in fact affects consumers’ perception of marketing communication on social media.
Additionally, further research should involve an examination and comparison of
multiple cultures that greatly differ according to Hofstede and Hall’s culture theories.
By doing so, stronger and clearer results might emerge leading to deeper knowledge
about the theme. Using cultures which considerably differ from each other should
additionally result in more obvious results of the consequences of using foreign cues
in social media marketing. Individuals from divergent cultures, which differ more from
the COO according to the culture theories, should be able to easier recognize cultural
cues in ads, and the results might, therefore, differ. This will also help in concluding
how useful Hofstede and Hall’s culture theories in fact are when applying the theories
to social media marketing.
Due to limited time and resources, only one company from the cosmetic industry was
examined in the study. Further research could, thus, benefit from studying an
alternative industry or comparing several industries. This could add knowledge of
whether consumers involved with companies from different industries act differently.
Examining this could gain insights in whether culture affects consumers differently
depending on the industry of the company which advertises. Furthermore, adding nonEnglish speaking individuals in further studies can provide a width and depth to the
research developing the theory of using English in marketing communication.
Research examining this topic should also be conducted after the covid-19 pandemic
is over, in order to comprehend whether consumers’ motives for using social media
vary. Alternatively, a comparison of consumers’ motives during the pandemic and

73

after would be a possible and convenient subject that could give valuable information
about the changes of the modern consumer’s behavior on social media.
However, executing similar studies only with more individuals from the millennial
generation would help gaining a more fundamental understanding of the issue. By
carrying out a larger, more extensive study about the same topic with the same
cultures, it would be possible to either discard or develop the results presented in this
thesis. By doing so, other cultural cues could be used to examine whether different
cues connected to Finland, such as snow, might have a larger impact on the consumers’
perception than those used in this study.

7. Summary in Swedish – Svensk sammanfattning
Konsumenters uppfattning om främmande kosmetikannonser
En tvärkulturell studie om att skapa förtroende med sociala medier
Inledning
På grund av att användningen av sociala medier har ökat märkbart under det senaste
decenniet har företag tvingats anpassa sina kommunikationsstrategier. Det kan anses
grundläggande för företag att anpassa sig enligt förändringar i konsumentbeteendet
och det är tydligt att företag idag spenderar mer pengar och tid på att integrera just
sociala medier i sin verksamhet. Under 2020 spenderade företag världen över 87,7
miljoner euro på annonser på sociala medier och siffran förväntas stiga till 119
miljoner euro år 2025 (Statista, 2020b). På grund av globaliseringen, den ökade
användningen av sociala medier och minskat kundförtroende tvingas företag att tänka
över hur de kan synas i mängden och förbli relevanta för kunderna. Denna avhandling
undersöker därför hur företag kan skapa förtroende på en ny marknad med annonser
på sociala medier.

Syfte och forskningsfrågor
Avhandlingen är en fallstudie baserad på det finska kosmetikföretaget Dermoshop och
deras plan att expandera till Danmark och Tyskland. Syftet med avhandlingen är att ta
reda på hur konsumenter i olika kulturer uppfattar ett främmande företags
kosmetikannonser på sociala medier. Avhandlingen granskar mer specifikt hur
förtroende och medvetenhet skapas när målet är att öka köpavsikten hos
konsumenterna. Omfattande tidigare forskning har visat att konsumentens kultur
påverkar hur traditionell marknadsföring uppfattas. Genom globaliseringen påstår
dock vissa att en global konsument har utvecklats och de menar därför att kultur inte
skulle spela en lika stor roll i skapandet av effektiv marknadsföring (Usunier & Lee,
2013). Således tänker man också att en standardiserad marknadsföringsstrategi skulle
vara effektiv oberoende av vilken kultur den mottagande konsumenten tillhör. Senare
forskning har dock visat att företag har börjat fokusera mer på kulturens påverkan i

75

den digitala marknadsföringskommunikationen (Usunier & Lee, 2013). Mer forskning
behövs ännu för att undersöka vilken betydelse kulturen har i konsumenters
uppfattning av företags marknadsföring på sociala medier. Utifrån syftet har följande
tre forskningsfrågor utvecklats:
1. Hur kan obekanta annonser på sociala medier skapa konsumentmedvetenhet i
olika kulturer?
2. Vilka främmande ledtrådar i kosmetikannonser på sociala medier kan leda till
positiv konsumentuppfattning i olika kulturer?
3. Hur borde annonser på sociala medier se ut för att skapa förtroende och öka
köpavsikten i olika kulturer?

Metod och datainsamling
Studien fokuserar på konsumenters uppfattningar och åsikter om marknadsföring på
sociala medier. På grund av detta lämpar sig en kvalitativ forskningsmetod där tankar,
upplevelser och samhällsfenomen är i fokus (Ahrne & Svensson, 2015). Utöver detta
används en abduktiv ansats eftersom teori och empiriska data används växelvis för att
slutligen kunna utföra en analys av alla insamlade data. Datainsamlingen gjordes i
form av två fokusgruppintervjuer med danska och tyska kvinnor. Totalt deltog fem
danska och fem tyska konsumenter som anmälde sig som frivilliga efter att jag delade
en inbjudan på Facebook och Instagram. Personerna uppfyllde alla kriterier, dvs. att
de tillhörde millenniegenerationen, var aktiva användare på sociala medier, var
kvinnor, hade goda kunskaper i engelska och tillhörde rätt nationalitet.
Innan intervjutillfällena prövades frågorna på en utomstående person som också
uppfyllde kriterierna. På detta sätt kunde jag säkerställa att frågorna uppfattades på rätt
sätt för att undvika missförstånd. Båda intervjuerna spelades in för att göra
transkriberingsprocessen lättare. Intervjuerna utfördes båda via Zoom och innan
intervjuerna inleddes hade alla deltagare fyllt i ett formulär med bakgrundsinformation
om till exempel ålder och yrke eller titel. Intervjuerna hade både en intervjudel och en
mer praktisk del. I den praktiska delen fick deltagarna se exempel på olika annonser
på sociala medier från Dermoshop, samt jämföra dem och berätta vad de tyckte om
76

varje exempel. Annonserna skapades av mig, specifikt för detta ändamål, och
inkluderade olika sorts innehåll, information och visuella detaljer. Dessutom innehöll
också annonsexemplen olika mängder och typer av ledtrådar som kunde associeras
med företagets ursprungsland, dvs. Finland. Detta fungerar som underlag för att
undersöka vad deltagarna uppfattar som tydliga kopplingar till Finland och vad som
leder till positiva resultat i frågan om effektiv marknadsföring. Material från företagets
riktiga annonser och medlemstidningar användes för att skapa trovärdig
marknadsföring.

Redogörelse för undersökningen
Fokusgruppintervjuerna delades upp i tre huvudteman: sociala medier, annonser på
sociala medier och Dermoshops marknadsföringskommunikation. Första temat gick ut
på att diskutera hur deltagarna använder sociala medier och deras attityder gentemot
olika plattformar. Det andra temat behandlade deltagarnas åsikter och attityder
gentemot

annonser

på

sociala

medier

och

främmande

företags

marknadsföringskommunikation på sociala medier, samt vad företagets ursprung
spelar för roll. Det tredje temat fokuserade specifikt på Dermoshop och deltagarnas
associationer och åsikter när de till exempel såg företagets namn, logo och exempel på
annonser på sociala medier.
Data från fokusgrupperna jämfördes och analyserades för att få fram tydliga mönster
och återkommande åsikter. Alla deltagare visade en positiv attityd gentemot sociala
medier eftersom användningen bidrar till att lättare hålla kontakten med vänner och
bekanta. Dessutom menade också alla deltagare att de använder Instagram mest, följt
av Facebook. Deltagarnas användning skiljde sig dock beroende på plattform eftersom
Facebook användes för att kommunicera med nära vänner och läsa nyheter, medan
Instagram användes för att få inspiration och se vänner och bekantas aktiviteter. Dock
visades en tydlig skillnad i gruppernas attityder gentemot annonser på sociala medier
– den danska gruppen (FG1) visade en mer positiv inställning än den tyska gruppen
(FG2). Två av de danska deltagarna menade till exempel att annonserna bidrar till att
de upptäcker nya företag och varumärken. Oberoende av deltagarnas åsikter så hade
alla någon gång köpt en produkt efter att ha sett produktens annonser på sociala
77

medier. Dessutom påpekade en klar majoritet av deltagarna att detta oftast har hänt på
Instagram.
Deltagarna antydde också att det krävs innovativa lösningar för att fånga deras
uppmärksamhet. Överflödet av information och annonser på sociala medier har
resulterat i att deltagarna lätt filtrerar bort ointressant innehåll. Om företaget däremot
lyckas fånga deltagarnas uppmärksamhet följer de specifika rutiner för att kontrollera
företagets trovärdighet. Generellt visade deltagarna i FG1 att de är villiga att ta mera
risker jämfört med de i FG2. Skillnader syntes också i deltagarnas preferenser gällande
trovärdiga annonsers innehåll. Deltagarna i FG1 visade till exempel en tydlig tendens
att uppskatta användarrecensioner och informativt språk. Deltagarna i FG2
uppskattade när specialister eller influerare används och språket är lätt och relaterbart.
Skillnaderna mellan grupperna analyserades främst genom Hofstede och Halls
kulturteorier. Detta gjordes för att kunna identifiera vilka åsikter som var ett resultat
av konsumenternas kultur och vilka som var personliga uppfattningar.

Resultat
Resultaten från studien visar att det finns tydliga skillnader mellan grupperna. Det är
tydligt att kommunikationen måste gå enligt konsumenternas villkor för att företag ska
lyckas nå millenniegenerationen. Deltagarna i denna studie hade klara tankar om vad
en trovärdig annons innehåller och hur språket ser ut. Om produkten och varumärket
är intressanta men annonsen inte i sig kan garantera att det är ett trovärdigt företag, så
visade också dessa deltagare att de har distinkta tillvägagångssätt för att ta reda på mer
information. Detta stöder tidigare forskning som visar att konsumenter i
millenniegenerationen har utvecklat tydliga färdigheter för att snabbt sortera
kommunikation som de möter (Munsch, 2021; Nielsen, 2017, February 3). Till
exempel betonade deltagare i FG1 vikten av andra användares åsikter eftersom de
gärna undersöker ett företags trovärdighet genom att läsa recensioner på Trustpilot
eller liknande hemsidor. Deltagarna i FG2 vill däremot att företaget själv ger den
information som behövs för att uppnå en trovärdig nivå. Denna grupp diskuterade till
exempel att tillräcklig information om produkten och dess kvalitet ska finnas i
annonserna och att specialister helst ska intyga att det stämmer. Vidare visade studien
78

att deltagarna från båda grupperna påverkas mer av information på Instagram, på grund
av plattformens utseende, samt hur plattformen används. Det ses därför som väsentligt
att företag för det första kommunicerar på ställen där konsumenterna är beredda och
öppna för att ta in meddelanden, såsom Instagram. För det andra kräver det också att
informationen är attraktiv och lämplig för konsumenterna.
Att grupperna de facto visade likheter och skillnader i hur de vill att annonser ska se
ut kan till viss del kopplas till hur kulturerna identifieras i teorier om nationella
kulturer. Enligt Hofstedes kulturteori kategoriseras Tyskland som en kultur med höga
värden på osäkerhetsundvikande och maskulinitet (Hofstede Insights, 2020). I studien
blev detta tydligt eftersom deltagarna i FG2 uttryckligen beskrev många risker med att
köpa från ett främmande företag. På grund av detta kräver dessa deltagare att
annonserna på olika sätt ska inge en tydlig trygghet och minska risken, såsom genom
användningen av specialister. Deltagare i FG2 hävdade också att varumärken som
skildras som högklassiga i sina annonser också kan leda till en ökad köpavsikt. Detta
stämmer överens med teorier enligt vilka status och klass ska markeras i annonser i
maskulina kulturer (De Mooij, 2019), såsom Tyskland. Däremot identifieras Danmark
som en kort tidsorienterad, låg osäkerhetsundvikande och tillfredsställande kultur
enligt Hofstedes kulturteori (Hofstede Insights, 2020). Deltagarna i FG1 var till
exempel mer villiga att köpa produkter från en online-leverantör jämfört med de i FG2
vilket kan bero på de olika nivåerna av osäkerhetsundvikande. Deltagarna i FG1 visade
också att de finner nytänkande visuella lösningar som attraktiva och viktiga för att
fånga deras uppmärksamhet. Kulturer med låga värden på osäkerhetsundvikande är
mer öppen för innovation (Hofstede Insights, 2020) som i detta fall kan ses som
originella visuella utseenden och detaljer. Båda grupperna krävde att annonserna ska
informera dem om produkterna på ett direkt och tydligt sätt. Detta kan ses som
karaktärsdrag för individualistiska och låg-kontextkulturer (Hofstede et al., 2010; De
Mooij, 2019).
Att deltagarnas generella attityder gällande annonser och sociala medier inte spelar
någon roll för hur ett företags marknadsföring uppfattas blev däremot klart. Grupperna
visade liknande attityder gällande sociala medier men visade också tydliga skillnader
i attityderna mot annonser på sociala medier. Detta tyder på att individernas åsikter
om

plattformarna

inte

påverkar

effektiviteten

av

ett

företags
79

marknadsföringskommunikation. Kumar et al. (2016) presenterade dock en teori som
hävdar att konsumentens attityd gällande sociala medier är en av tre faktorer som
skulle påverka effektiviteten. Resultaten från avhandlingens studie tyder alltså på en
alternativ syn gällande detta fenomen.
Genom diskussionen om att dessa konsumenter möter ett överflöd av information varje
dag, blev det också tydligt att man ofta stöter på främmande företag och deras
marknadsföring. På grund av detta kan man dra slutsatsen att dessa konsumenter är
vana vid annonser från både obekanta och utländska företag. Ingen av deltagarna
kommenterade det faktum att annonserna var på engelska. När det specifikt frågades
om fenomenet svarade deltagare att engelskt innehåll på sociala medier förekommer
ofta. Detta stöder Nederstigt och Hilberink-Schulpen (2018) och Pillers (2003) teorier
om att engelsk marknadsföringskommunikation kan användas för standardiseringen
av budskap och för budskap som behöver en modern och ungdomlig prägel. Däremot
verkade finska inslag, landskaps- och naturinslag, eller en stereotypisk blond person
inte vara tillräckliga för att deltagarna skulle associera annonserna med Finland. Detta
kan bero på att ledtrådarna inte var tillräckligt tydliga och inte passande in vad de
associerade Finland med. Dessutom kan det också bero på att individualistiska
kulturer, såsom Danmark och Tyskland, generellt inte använder stereotyper för att
analysera information med kulturella inslag (Triandis, 2018). Dock ville deltagarna i
FG2 att ursprungslandet Finland tydligt skulle lyftas fram i ett tidigt skede. Detta tyder
igen på att gruppen vill ha mycket information serverad så att de kan fatta ett tryggt
beslut om företagets, varumärkets eller produktens trovärdighet och kvalitet.
Uppfylls dessa krav kan företag skapa effektiv marknadsföringskommunikation
genom att skapa stark medvetenhet som kan leda till förtroende hos konsumenterna.
Det syns alltså kulturskillnader i hur marknadsföring generellt uppfattas och vad som
krävs för att uppnå effektiva resultat. Genom denna genomgång kan man också se att
kultur måste beaktas av företag när marknadskommunikation för sociala medier
skapas. Resultaten tyder vidare på att konsumenterna är relativt globala eftersom de
möter mycket information som inte är lokal. Konsumenterna har dock ännu en
preferens för att tilltalas personligen om det så gäller användningen av specifika
visuella stöd eller utformningen av meddelanden.

80

Avslutningsvis ska annonserna i de undersökta kulturerna uppfattas som äkta,
informativa och innovativa för att skapa effektiv kommunikation. Vad som anses
attraktivt i frågan om visuella aspekter och språket varierar beroende på kultur och det
bör därför noggrant övervägas vid marknadsföring på sociala medier i olika kulturer.
Mera forskning borde dock undersöka detta ämne med till exempel fler kulturer som
skiljer sig betydligt från varandra, för att få fram tydligare och starkare resultat.

Appendix 1: Focus group interview guide
Introduction
Thank you everybody for being here. I really appreciate that you take your time to help
me. I’m super excited to hear your thoughts about the topics social media and
cosmetics marketing. The discussion will take about an hour and a half, and will be
recorded. The material is only used for my own research in my Master’s thesis that
I’m doing at Åbo Akademi University. You will all be anonymous throughout the
research process. If anyone is interested in hearing more about the research, I’d love
to tell you more after the discussion. You all also have the right to receive the results
of the research when it’s completed. Have you all filled out the form that was sent to
you yesterday? If you haven’t done it, you can do it quickly now before we begin.
*Presentation of the moderator*
I this discussion, everybody’s opinions and thoughts are equally important, so please
state your opinion even though you’re not sure it belongs to the topic. If you want to
talk, I would encourage you to signal that to me, either by unmuting yourself or raising
your hand. By doing so, we can avoid interrupting each other in this online discussion.
I hope we can still have a relaxed discussion even though we can’t meet in person.
Do you have any questions?
Theme 1: Social media (10 min)
What do you think about social media? Why do you use it?

o Which social media channels do you use? Why?
o Which content do you see? Which accounts are you following – only
friends or public ones as well? Why?
Why do you use some social media channels and not others?
o Compare Facebook and Instagram: Do your activities differ
depending on which social media channel it is?
92

Theme 2: Social media advertising (30 min)
What do you think about ads on social media?
o How often do you click on social media ads? Why/why not? Which
ones?
Compare social media ads with more traditional ads, for example tv
commercials or magazine ads – what influences you and your buying
decision more? Why?
How often have you used social media ads as a reason to buy a product?
o When does it happen?
o For which products?
o From which platforms? Would you rather buy a product displayed on
certain platforms than others?
Would you be willing to buy products from an unfamiliar company after
seeing an ad on social media? Why/Why not?
What about a company from a different country?
o Do you think about the origin of the product/brand? Does it matter?
o What about makeup and cosmetics? Do you usually buy that from the
same brand or can you change?
What does an ideal cosmetics ad look like for you? What should an ad look
like for you to be willing to buy from an unfamiliar company?
list adjectives, verbal elements, visual elements…
Theme 3: Focus company (30 min)
Moving on to the next and last theme, we’re going to discuss a specific company. I
do not have any connections to the company, and I have chosen the company
myself from my own interest, so please state your honest opinion about the topics.
*Show logo* This is the logo of the company we’re going to discuss.
Which associations does it give?
Does this word mean something in your language?

And then, I would like to know…
93

What are your thoughts about Finland? what do you associate the country
with?
*Present focus company* Dermosil is a Finnish cosmetics company that focuses
on natural ingredients with little or no additives or perfumes. They have everything
from makeup to perfumes to moisturizers and deodorants. They have a lot of
asthma and allergy friendly products and the products are therefore very skin
friendly.
After getting to know the company a bit I would like you to think about a suitable
slogan for the company.
What words would you include in the slogan?
What would the slogan have to include for you to feel good about it and to
buy from it?
*Show slogan* This is the real slogan of the company – a gift for the skin.
What does this slogan tell you?
Do you like it? Why/why not?
Then, moving on to advertisements.
Compare these ads
o What do you pay attention to first?
o Which associations arise?
o Which ad is more attractive? Why?
o Would you click on these ads? Why/why not?
o Would you be willing to buy from this company? Why/why not?
o Would you change something in the ads?
Wrap up
All right, that was everything I had! Thank you again for participating, and if you want
to discuss something now or add something for the discussion, I can stay to discuss
with you, otherwise you’re free to go. Have a nice day!
