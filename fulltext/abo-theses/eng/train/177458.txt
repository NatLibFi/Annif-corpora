Title: Does the Finnish healthcare sector show signs of Baumol’s cost disease?
Supervisor: Edvard Johansson
Abstract:
Health expenditures are growing globally and the causes are somewhat unclear. Baumol’s
cost disease could potentially act as a viable explanation for rising healthcare costs. The
formalisation and method constructed by Atanda, Menclova and Reed (2018) allow the
estimation of two of Baumol’s (1967) original propositions of the cost disease, which are
seldom tested. The models measure how the healthcare sector’s share of the labour force
is affected by a) the relative productivity between health and non-health sector, and b) the
total productivity in the economy. In this thesis, the method is applied to measure if the
Finnish healthcare sector displays any signs of the cost disease.
The data are gathered from 70 sub-regions in Finland between 2000 and 2016. Subregions are by regional size between municipals and hospital districts. Primary care is
provided by municipalities and specialised care is provided by hospital regions. The
Finnish health system is exceptionally decentralised and the cross-regional variation is
rather large.
The empirical impact of the cost disease is tested with three different fixed effects models,
similar to the ones used in most of the contributions in the same field of study. The results
suggest that relative and total productivity are positively related to healthcare share of the
labour force, which are both anticipated theoretically as well. The effect is statistically
significant but economically affects only 600-850 employees annually in the health
sector, which employs around 400 000 people. Therefore, the cost disease is perhaps
noticeable after a decade-long intersectoral transition in the Finnish labour market.
This thesis strengthens the results of Ministry of Finance (2013) study of the healthcare
sector which suggests that Finnish healthcare is suffering from Baumol’s cost disease but
decreases the economical severity of the impact.
Key words: Baumol’s cost disease, the Finnish healthcare system, productivity, labour
market, panel data, fixed effects.

1. Introduction
Health expenditures have grown rapidly in the last decades in the world and they account
for a considerable amount of the national income in most developed countries. The
proportion of health expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product have
increased from roughly four percent up to one tenth of the national income in most EU
and OECD countries in the last 40 years (Medeiros & Schwierz, 2013; OECD, 2019). The
Finnish healthcare expenditures have doubled in the same period and the costs continues
to put increasing pressure on the public budget and the fiscal stability. Finland provides
universal health coverage with 90 percent coverage rate and public health spending is
expected to grow 2 % annually in the next decade (Dieleman, et.al., 2018). Today,
managing healthcare expenditures is a challenge of a global scale, which will be even
more difficult in the future.
The field of health economics has seen many detailed studies about the costs of the health
sector. One main determinant of rising costs is argued to be the income of the population.
In fact, no other variables have yielded as clear effects on health expenditure as GDP per
capita (Gerdtham & Jönsson, 2000; Baltagi & Moscone, 2010; Benavides, 2018). A key
metric that has naturally derived from the countless estimations is the income elasticity.
Growth of income increases the seeking of care. However, there is no consensus of
whether one should consider health services as necessities or luxury goods. Thus, there
are no clear estimations in this particular field of the future of health expenditures either;
will their growth continue to increase or eventually slow down. The income elasticity has
been shown to vary across different levels of income and, somewhat surprisingly, richer
countries even show a decreasing income elasticity of demand (Di Matteo, 2003).
Given that health expenditures have grown more than income in developed countries,
implies that there are some omitted factors which have yet to be tested. In recent years,
many authors have tried to explain this effect with technological differences and Baumol’s
cost disease (Hartwig, 2008; Colombier, 2012 & 2017; Atanda, Menclova & Reed, 2018).

This would explain rising costs if healthcare would be relatively unproductive compared
to the rest of the economy. Baumol’s cost disease is a theory of the evolution of market
structures, more specifically how different productivity growth rates can cause higher
costs in some sectors over time. A non-productive sector would see less cost-decreasing
innovations and be expected to make less profit and increase selling prices more than a
productive sector.
Baumol’s (1967) defining characteristics of the cost disease, however, are quite difficult
to apply in an econometric study. The sufficient data is rarely gathered and, if accessible,
it might be incomparable with other countries. The idea of using cost disease as an
explanation for globally rising expenditures might shed light on the ongoing discussion in
health economics. Even though the theory was born half a century ago, the application in
empirical research has only begun in the last decade. One difficulty is that there are yet no
explicit explanatory variables explaining the cost disease. Baumol’s theoretical work
provided only propositions of suggestible side effects, which are difficult to measure and
newer studies are constantly trying to construct new models to resolve the problem.

1.1. Research objective
The aim of this thesis is to study if the Finnish healthcare market suffers from Baumol’s
cost disease, by focusing on theory built by Baumol (1967) and following the approach
that Atanda, Menclova and Reed (2018) have reconstructed. The new approach follows
Baumol’s (1967) propositions more closely than prior studies of the cost disease in the
healthcare sector. This thesis will contribute to the discussion by applying the new model
for smaller regions in one country, instead of using it to measure effects between various
heterogeneous countries. The data are collected from Finnish sub-regions between 2000
and 2016. Finland is divided into 70 sub-regions, which each contain 2-7 municipalities,
and every sub-region belongs to a larger hospital district. Each hospital district has the
sole responsibility to provide its own specialised care and each municipality is responsible
2

Kristian Gästgifvars
for the provision of primary care, to the extent permitted by the national legal framework.
The Finnish health system is quite decentralised, which gives the opportunity to study
varying productivity measures under the same fundamental health structure.

1.2. Disposition
Chapter 2 will introduce the characteristics of the Finnish health system. The chapter
discusses the organisational structure and the problems with efficiency it faces. Next, in
chapter 3, the theory behind Baumol’s cost disease is explained and how theory can be
modified to test empirically. Chapter 3 includes a review of prior studies as from global
data sets and one study from Finnish healthcare as well. The econometrical method and
the data of Finland is presented in chapter 4. Chapter 5 presents the results of the main
estimations in the thesis as well as a discussion of the findings from Finland. Chapter 6
concludes the thesis. The appendix provides additional definitions, calculations and
estimation results, which might be beneficial for the reader.

2. The Finnish healthcare system
Chapter 2.1 briefly explains the characteristics of the health system in Finland; how it is
governed and who is responsible for provision of care. Chapter 2.2 is an assessment of the
health system and discusses the main problems with efficiency today.

2.1. Overview
Finland spends a relatively small proportion of its income on healthcare. Compared to its
Nordic neighbours and other similarly governed countries, Finnish healthcare
expenditures per capita and as a percentage of GDP have generally been less in recent
years. In 2017, the per capita health expenditures were 4 100 €, which can be translated
to a total of 9.2 % of the GDP. Health expenditures in Norway, Denmark and Sweden
have exceeded 10 % of GDP. Approximately 20 % of the total health expenditures in
Finland are paid with out-of-pocket payments, 70 % is financed with municipal and state
taxes, and the rest is from other private sources. A third of the health expenditures come
from private service providers in Finland, and the private sector has grown by 10
percentage points since 2000. In general, health expenditures have grown drastically in
the better part of the last sixty years, which much like the rest of the developed countries,
displays a concerning picture of the future. (Keskimäki et al, 2019; Dieleman, et.al., 2018).
The provision of care in Finland is quite decentralised. There are three levels of
administration: The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health (MSAH), hospital districts and
municipalities. MSAH is responsible for the legislation and direction of general health
policy. MSAH prepares key reforms in healthcare and guides the implementation. The
municipalities are solely responsible for organising the primary healthcare for their local
residents. The municipalities may cooperate with public health provision, which is
common in low-populated neighbouring regions in Finland. In 2020, the number of
municipalities is 311, of which 70 % have under 10 000 inhabitants. Hospital districts are
federations of municipalities and they are responsible for specialised medical care
4

Kristian Gästgifvars
provision. Specialised medical care includes examinations and treatments in hospitals,
which are performed by medical specialists. There are 20 different hospital districts and
every municipality must be a member of one. Three quarters of the hospital districts are
inhabited by more than 100 000 people, one of which has 30 % of the Finnish population.
Furthermore, the care of most demeaning and rare diseases in Finland is centralised into
five university hospitals, which are located in larger cities around the country. The five
university hospitals do not have any explicit decision-making powers, but they plan the
care and treatment of the most severe diseases. The flow of information and finances is
thus quite complicated. The regional differences between Finnish municipalities are
substantial as well, since the specialised care expenditures as of total health expenditures
are almost uniformly distributed between 20 and 50 percent. (Keskimäki et al, 2019;
Statistics Finland, 2019, Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, 2016a)

Every Finnish resident is covered by national health insurance and one in six of the
population have an additional voluntary health insurance. Out-of-pocket expenses have
defined price caps in each individual medical case, but the expenses are higher than in the
rest of the Nordic regions (Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, 2016b). There are three
channels for first-contact care: the municipal system, national health insurance system and
occupationally provided care. The municipal system provides the majority of all care and
acts as gatekeepers for specialised care in public healthcare. The national health coverage
system reimburses partially costs of prescribed medicines and health visits to private
facilities. Additionally, many employees are covered by occupational health coverage,
which is quite well developed in Finland. The private sector has a substantial stake in the
occupational healthcare system and private care is often obtained much faster than
publicly provided care. Occupational care is completely free of charge for the patients as
well. (Teperi et al, 2009; Keskimäki et al, 2019).

2.2. Efficiency and productivity
Healthcare system in Finland performs quite efficiently compared to other countries
around the world. Health outcomes have improved since 2000 and preventable mortality
rates are below EU average. According to Keskimäki et al (2019), technical efficiency and
productivity have grown considerably in specialised care and the pharmaceutical sector.
Other sectors in healthcare perform relatively well compared to other countries, however,
the allocation of resources between specialised and primary care in Finland is somewhat
inefficient and unbalanced. Resources for development are provided more toward
specialised care, which has been visible in the flow of medical professionals between
sectors as well. Nationally, between 2000 and 2016 the number of patients per physicians
decreased in health centres by 30 %, whereas it increased in hospitalised care more than
50 %. The decentralised nature of the health system makes it difficult to tackle this
problem, since municipalities and hospital regions are on two different administrative
levels and no clear cooperating procedure is applied. Any acts of reforms or renewals in
6

Kristian Gästgifvars
healthcare are thus difficult to achieve and the interaction between administrative levels
is considered complex by the decision makers. Public officials in healthcare and executive
members of NGOs have different perceptions of the organisational structure of the
healthcare system. The majority would prefer a more centralised system for healthcare
provision and financing. (Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, 2016a; Keskimäki et al,
2019)
The access to care is quite unbalanced in Finland and unmet medical needs are
considerably higher than EU average and the Nordic neighbours. (European Commission,
2020; Ministry if Social Affairs and Health, 2016b). Within Finland, access to primary
and specialised care varies drastically depending on the geographical region. This is
mostly due to small numbers of health centres in low populated municipalities. Waiting
times is one factor of unmet medical needs, which also is an indicator of productivity. In
economics, patients’ waiting time can be seen as a function of number of healthcare
professionals and number of patients. However, the population density is an insignificant
factor in waiting times in Finland. On average, the proportion of the patients that waited
over one week for primary care visits was 45 % in 2015 and it increased to 55 % in 2017.
In fifteen municipalities, the same statistic was less than 10 %, and in five municipalities,
every patient waited more than one week in 2017 (Finnish institute of health and welfare,
2020). There have been attempts to reach patients faster in recent years, which have turned
out to be mostly unsuccessful. One explanation for this might be that a change in waiting
times usually affects the behaviour of patients. The demand is expected to increase by
shortening queues, which, in turn, eventually increases the waiting time. Often, it is rather
difficult to determine the cause and effect of patients’ waiting times in healthcare.
However, in Atella et al (2019), the results suggest that lowering waiting times increases
productivity in healthcare more than cost containment and regulation. (Iversen & Lurås,
2002; Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, 2016a; Keskimäki et al, 2019)

Figure 2.2 displays the variation of different efficiency variables in Finnish university
hospital regions (Finnish institute of health and welfare, 2020). A large area in the
coloured hexagons indicates less efficient or unproductive regions. Generally, the Helsinki
University hospital region (HYKS) would rank as the most efficient healthcare region in
8

Kristian Gästgifvars
Finland according to Table 2.2, where waiting time in primary care is the only indicator
above the Finnish average. Expenditures per capita are relatively high in OYS and KYS,
which could be explained by the regions’ low population density. Waiting time for
primary care is highest in TYKS and HYKS, whereas the waiting time for specialised care
is shorter than average in these regions. The indicator for health care employees per capita
has perhaps the lowest regional variation and the morbidity index has the highest.

After the general election in 2015, the government actively tried to improve the health
and social care system with an extensive reform. The main objective was to centralise the
system by integrating the provision of primary, specialised and social care under the same
administrative organ within larger regions. The reform would have, presumably,
decreased the disparity in healthcare access and helped to control costs. Alongside the
structural changes, a crucial aim was to give the patients a greater freedom of choice, with
the intention of increasing the competition in the health sector. However, the size of the
reform and the partially conflicting objectives concluded with no actions taken and the
government’s early resignation. The reform was postponed and the current government
have written a similar structural reform in their Government programme. (Sinervo,
Tynkkynen & Vehko, 2016; Keskimäki, et al, 2019, Ministry of Social Affairs and Health,
2016b).

3. Theoretical Background and Empirical Review
This chapter presents thoroughly the theory and empirical research of Baumol’s cost
disease. The following sub-chapter explains how different elements in the market affect
each other and how they are expected to change. Chapter 3.2 is a review of the known
contributions for the application of the cost disease in the health sector. Lastly in chapter
3.3, the new approach to measure the cost disease is explained in great detail. The new
model is used in the empirical part of this thesis.

3.1. Baumol’s cost disease
The cost disease, commonly known as the Baumol’s cost disease, is a theoretical
framework to show why some sectors of the economy face expanding costs, even though
other sectors’ costs would remain stable. The key premise is that the output per man-hour
grows at different rates in every sector of the economy. Some sectors can apply
technological changes and innovations more naturally than others, which inevitably will
enlarge the gap in productivity between various sectors over time. The second assumption
is that the growth in wages is heavily correlated across all sectors. Wages tend to increase
at the same rate in the whole economy, regardless of the differences in productivity levels.
Growth in productivity implies that the same output volume can be produced with less
labour and, therefore, average costs (per input unit) in slowly growing sectors are expected
to increase as well.
Baumol (1967) introduced the formalised version of the cost disease and derived four
propositions for the economy that would be visible. His analysis uses a simplified version
of an economy with two sectors: a progressive and a non-progressive sector (henceforth
PS and NPS), in terms of growth in productivity. Firstly, suppose that the output ( 𝑌), in
both sectors is given by
10

Kristian Gästgifvars
𝑌𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) = 𝑎𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)

(3.1)

𝑌𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) = 𝑏𝐿𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)𝑒 𝑟𝑡 ,

(3.2)

where 𝐿 is the employment in each sector and 𝑎 and 𝑏 are arbitrary positive constants. The
productivity in the 𝑁𝑃𝑆 is constant over time, while it continuously grows at the rate of 𝑟
in the 𝑃𝑆.
Secondly, Baumol (1967) assumed that all wages in the economy grow at the same rate 𝑟
as the rapidly growing sector and remains equal in both sectors for all 𝑡. The equation is
shown as
𝑊(𝑡) = 𝑊0 𝑒 𝑟𝑡 .

(3.3)

The constant 𝑊0 is an insignificant start value for the wage equation. Furthermore, given
equations (3.1), (3.2) and (3.3), we can derive the unit costs in both sectors as

𝐶𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) =

𝑊(𝑡)𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) 𝑊0 𝑒 𝑟𝑡 𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) 𝑊0 𝑒 𝑟𝑡
=
=
𝑌𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)

and

𝐶𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) =
=
=
.
𝑌𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)
𝑏𝐿𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)𝑒 𝑟𝑡
𝑏

(3.5)

By using (3.4) and (3.5) to show the relative unit cost of both sectors, we have
𝑊0 𝑒 𝑟𝑡⁄

𝐶𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)
𝑎 𝑏𝑒
𝐶𝑁𝑃𝑆|𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) =

(3.6)

and a change in 𝑡 can be expressed as

𝜕 (𝐶𝑁𝑃𝑆|𝑃𝑆 (𝑡))

(3.7)
>0 .

Kristian Gästgifvars
P1. The first proposition: Unit costs in the 𝑁𝑃𝑆 will grow unrestrictedly over time,
while the costs in the 𝑃𝑆 will remain constant. The demand for jobs and the labour
market equilibrium will eventually produce a same rate of growth in wages in both
sectors. Assuming that the wages in both sectors grow at the same rate as the
productivity in the 𝑃𝑆, the burden of labour wage growth will be increasingly
difficult for the 𝑁𝑃𝑆. The relative costs between sectors increase, which is the key
problem with Baumol’s cost disease. Prices in each sector are in proportion to their
costs, therefore, a positive effect of prices in the 𝑁𝑃𝑆 is expected as well.
Following the issue of increasing relative costs between the 𝑁𝑃𝑆 and 𝑃𝑆, we can continue
the analysis by examining the expected demand for 𝑁𝑃𝑆 goods. Suppose that prices in the
𝑁𝑃𝑆 market would be in an equilibrium and the price elasticity of demand for its goods
would be negative1. The relative output on goods in the economy would thus be shown as
𝑌𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)
𝑎𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)
=
.
𝑌𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)
𝑏𝐿𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)𝑒 𝑟𝑡

(3.8)

Additionally, we can see that

lim (

𝑡→∞

𝑌𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)
𝑎
𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) 1
) = lim (
∙
)=0
𝑌𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)
𝑏 𝑡→∞ 𝐿𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) 𝑒 𝑟𝑡

(3.9)

if the growth rate in 𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) is less than the sum of growth rates in both 𝑃𝑆 labour and in
𝑃𝑆 productivity, which is certainly a reasonable assumption. In other words, the demand
for 𝑁𝑃𝑆 goods will approach zero over time.
P2. The second proposition: In an economy suffering from unbalanced growth, the
𝑁𝑃𝑆 will produce less and less goods and the demand will eventually vanish. Only
markets with highly inelastic price elasticity of demand will survive increasing

costs. However, the government can keep the ratio of production between these
sectors constant with transfers. Sometimes, the desired outcome is to maintain a
constant level of demand and, thus, subsidise the production. This will,
consequently, lead to higher transfer costs as well, as the difference in the rate of
growth between the 𝑃𝑆 and 𝑁𝑃𝑆 increases.
The next effect of Baumol’s (1967) cost disease is derived from the assumption that an
external part, such as the government, is subsidising the production. Given the total labour
supply
(3.10)

𝐿(𝑡) = 𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) + 𝐿𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)
and by multiplying equation (3.8) with an arbitrary positive constant

𝑏 𝑌𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)
𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)
=
.
𝑎 𝑌𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)
𝐿𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)𝑒 𝑟𝑡

𝑏
𝑎

we have

(3.11)

By keeping the production ratio between both sectors stable, we can write the right-hand
side of the equation (3.11) equal to a constant 𝛾. Now if we combine equations (3.10) and
(3.11) we can express the required labour supply in both sectors with the following steps:
𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)
= 𝛾 ⇔ 𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) = 𝛾 𝐿𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)𝑒 𝑟𝑡
𝐿𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)𝑒 𝑟𝑡
𝐿𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) = 𝐿(𝑡) − 𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)
𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) = 𝛾(𝐿(𝑡) − 𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡))𝑒 𝑟𝑡
⇔ 𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) =

𝛾𝐿(𝑡)𝑒 𝑟𝑡
.
1 + 𝛾𝑒 𝑟𝑡

(3.12)

The labour function in the progressive sector can be derived in the same way and is
expressed as

13

Kristian Gästgifvars

𝐿𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) =

𝐿(𝑡)
.
1 + 𝛾𝑒 𝑟𝑡

𝑎
𝑠
(3.13)

Finally, if we let the value 𝑡 approach infinity in equation (3.12), the analysis is quite clear:
𝛾𝐿(𝑡)𝑒 𝑟𝑡
lim 𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) = lim (
)
𝑡→∞
𝑡→∞ 1 + 𝛾𝑒 𝑟𝑡
= lim (

[
𝐿(𝑡)]) = lim 𝐿(𝑡)
𝑟𝑡
𝑡→∞
𝑒 1⁄ 𝑟𝑡 + 𝛾
𝑒

(3.14)

The required labour supply in the 𝑁𝑃𝑆 increases by time and approaches the limit of the
total labour supply.
P3. The third proposition: If we hold the produced amount of goods constant in all
sectors, the labour force of the 𝑃𝑆 will continue to shift towards the 𝑁𝑃𝑆 until the
employment in the 𝑃𝑆 is zero. Technological changes allow the 𝑃𝑆 firms to operate
with fewer employees and they must move elsewhere. There seems to be no clear
evidence that long-term unemployment has changed over time or has drastically
been affected by technological growth (Lucas & Rapping, 1969; Feldmann, 2013;
Khraief et.al., 2018). Thus, the change in the 𝑁𝑃𝑆 employees per total labour force
ought to be positive. It is highly unlikely that a market could run without human
interaction, however, it is far more important to realise the shift in the employment
distribution. Suppose that the rate of production is constant, by nature or by
transfers: now the economy will face a situation where a growing proportion of the
labour force is entering into a non-productive field of business, making it
increasingly difficult to enhance the labour productivity.
Baumol’s (1967) final proposition explores the effects of the whole economy if the ratio
of production quantities between sectors is kept constant. If the relative costs are always
rising and the total employment is moving to the 𝑁𝑃𝑆, the growth of the national income
14

Kristian Gästgifvars
is going to slow down. Given the properties of the equations above, the rate of growth in
total production is approaching zero.2
P4. The fourth Proposition: The resulting effects of the cost disease, if the rate of
production between the two sectors is kept constant, is that the transfers puts
pressure on the whole economy. The transfers required to retain the same ratio of
output increases, which will force the growth of the whole economy to slow down.
This implies that if the three prior effects of the cost disease hold, the economy
would grow to a finite limit, after which the rate of change in growth would be
zero.

Even though this formalised theory has been known for more than fifty years, it has proven
to be problematic to estimate econometrically. One concern is that it is questionable to use
productivity, or its growth, as an identical measurement between two sectors. Baumol
(1996; 2012) argues in later discussion pieces that prices are a great indicator when
analysing different markets, seemingly affected by the cost disease. The most important
effect, according to Baumol, is increasing costs, which naturally influences the prices of
the end-users. The first proposition (P1) is therefore an essential determinant of disparity

Figure 3.1 Price indices in different industries in Finland 2000-2019.

Figure 3.1 shows the evolution of the Finnish consumer price index and four other price
indices, of which the red line graphs are usually seen as part of the 𝑁𝑃𝑆 and the green
ones undoubtedly part of the 𝑃𝑆. The real-costs increases in both education and healthcare,
would thus be the difference to CPI. Additionally, it is clear that the real price changes in
progressive alternatives, vehicle and clothing industries, have been negative over the time
period (Statistics Finland, 2019). Figure 3.1 reflects the first proposition well. However,
the unbalanced price growth in an economy is only partially attributed by differences in
productivity. Sectors with low degree of competition could as easily show similar patterns,
so price indicators might be insufficient. Therefore, it is important to review the other
propositions of the theory and use logical reasoning to verify if the cost disease would be
truly a problem.

Healthcare should show signs of Baumol’s (1967) propositions for other reasons as well.
First, healthcare is part service industry, which generally shows less technical
improvements. Secondly, since many countries promote universal health coverage and
thus subsidise the sector, the demand is likely to increase rather than vanish. This makes
healthcare suitable for analysis of the third proposition, which requires third-party
subsidisation or a heavily inelastic price elasticity of demand. Finally, the distribution in
the labour force in Finland has changed and the healthcare sector has shown growth in
recent decades (Statistics Finland, 2019), which could be explained with the third
proposition.

3.2. Empirical review of the cost disease in healthcare

In the last 12 years, there has been an intense discussion about Baumol’s cost disease and
its genuine effect on the globally growing health expenditures. In empirical studies, the
dominant method is to create a variable, which will measure one of the properties of the
cost disease and see how it will affect the total health expenditures in the specified region.
Baumol (1996; 2012) argues constantly that prices are one of the best indicators to show
the cost disease. However, many other authors find the medical price indices to be
upwardly biased, due to improved quality of health production and thus troublesome
measurements of real-price increases. (Triplett, 1999; Hartwig, 2008; Colombier, 2012 &
2017).

Hartwig’s (2008) study was the first systematic approach of testing Baumol’s cost disease
in healthcare. In his study, he tests how the unbalanced growth affects healthcare
expenditures in 19 OECD countries within the time period from 1960 to 2004. His
approach follows closely Baumol’s (1967) theoretical structure, by constructing a variable
17

Kristian Gästgifvars
called the Baumol variable, which measures the essence of the cost disease discussed in
chapter 3.1. The Baumol variable is calculated by taking the difference of the growth of
overall wages and growth of total labour productivity, in each country. A positive value
of said variable indicates a greater wage growth than productivity growth. The method is
tested econometrically with numerous regression models, where the measurement of
health expenditures is the dependent variable and the Baumol variable acting as an
endogenous independent variable. The models are controlled by several known
determinants of health expenditures as well, such as growth of national per capita income
and employment. The results of Hartwig’s (2008) study suggest that Baumol’s cost
disease is a significant explanatory factor of rising expenditures of healthcare.
The Finnish Ministry of Finance (2013) estimate the Baumol variable’s effect on health
expenditures from a Finnish time series data sample between 1975 and 2011. The
econometrical approach is the same as Hartwig (2008), and the results of the estimations
show similar coefficients. However, the estimations of the Baumol variable are
problematic according to Ministry of Finance (2013). The multicollinearity in the model
is severe and the autocorrelations in the variables might distort the effect. The estimation
results are quite large which gives support to the Baumol’s cost disease hypothesis in the
health sector, but the magnitude of the variables’ effects are somewhat unreliable.
Colombier (2012) uses a similar model as Hartwig (2008) to test the increasing health
expenditures in OECD regions between 1965 and 2007, with a small but important
correction. A closer examination of Hartwig’s (2008) study reveals that it measures an
assumption where all labour is allocated to the healthcare sector, which represents the
non-progressive one. Thus, Colombier (2012) estimates econometrically the same model,
corrected by the healthcare sector’s share of total labour. As expected, the result’s
estimates show a much lower effect of the Baumol variable than Hartwig (2008), but a
significant effect nonetheless. Colombier (2012) diminishes the impact of Baumol’s cost
disease as a severe threat and determinant of the growing costs of health.

18

Kristian Gästgifvars
Bates and Santerre (2013) use the same method as Colombier (2012) to test the effect in
the United States, by using a state-level panel between 1980 and 2009. The main differing
factor from the abovementioned studies is that Baumol’s cost disease is tested only in one
individual country. The results of the estimations are quite similar to Colombier (2012); a
statistically significant but economically meaningless effect. Additionally, Bates and
Santerre (2013) extend the method by doing a two-stages least squares (2SLS) estimation
on how the Baumol variables affect health expenditures, in order to eliminate the possible
endogeneity bias that may occur in a traditional state-fixed effects method. They use the
housing-price inflation as an instrument for the Baumol variable. Wage growth is one part
of the Baumol variable and since wages generally correlate with the prices of housing, it
should perform as a reasonable instrument in the regression. The results of the 2SLSmodel yield a threefold increase in the effect of the Baumol variable, compared to the first
estimations of Bates and Santerre (2013). The authors’ study raises the relevance of the
cost disease in health production.

Colombier’s (2017) study is an addition to his earlier paper, where he follows the 2SLS
method which Bates and Santerre (2013) constructed. Colombier (2017) uses data of
twenty OECD countries from 1970 to 2010 and uses the growth of the manufacturing
sector as an instrument for the Baumol variable. The manufacturing industry certainly
affects the growth of productivity in the entire economy and is exogenous to health
expenditures. Colombier’s (2017) model produces higher estimations of the Baumol
variable than his previous study (Colombier, 2012) provided, and the coefficient is similar
to Bates and Santerre (2013).
Atanda, Menclova and Reed (2018) build a different method to characterize the cost
disease, by measuring how the healthcare share of the labour force and relative prices of
health goods react to productivity growth (method discussed more closely in chapter 3.3).
They studied 28 OECD countries in 1995-2016, and different sectors of the U.S. economy
between the period of 1947 and 2016. Their findings are neither robust nor significant.

19

Kristian Gästgifvars
In a later paper, Atanda and Reed (2019) even write that their results show “no evidence
to support the existence of Baumol’s Cost Disease” in healthcare and generally eradicate
the Baumol variable’s effect on health expenditures. Their conclusions are harshly
different from others’, which is certainly interesting given that they ultimately study the
same data as the prior studies in the field (Colombier, 2012 & 2017; Bates & Santerre,
2013).

3.3. The new model
The propositions in chapter 3.1 are seldom tested in health expenditure studies. The main
objective tends to be to test the difference in the growth of wages and the growth of total
productivity. In Atanda, Menclova and Reed (2018), the original theory was rebuilt by
examining the propositions that Baumol (1967) suggested. The underlying propositions
are tested by excluding the Baumol variable (see chapter 3.2), since their model is partially
built by using only the total productivity of the economy. The theory (Atanda, Menclova
& Reed, 2018) shows mathematically that Baumol’s propositions should be visible only
with the total productivity variable at time 𝑡, excluding the variable for difference in
productivity. The authors’ formalization uses the disparity in productivity between NPS
and PS as well, but they argue that the variable would be incomparable in cross-country
data collections. Therefore, they show how the disparity variable would change if the total
economy-wide productivity changes (see chapter 3.3.2). The formalized and testable
versions of the cost disease propositions are displayed in chapters 3.3.1 and 3.3.2.

The relative productivity method

The first assumption, similar to Baumol (1967), is that the only input factor to the
production is labour. Let the production of healthcare (𝐻) and the remaining economy
(𝑁𝐻) be written as
20

Kristian Gästgifvars

𝑌𝐻 = 𝐿𝐻

(3.15)

𝑌𝑁𝐻 = 𝜙𝐿𝑁𝐻 ,

(3.16)

where 𝜙 is defined as the relative productivity between these sectors, measured in terms
of output per labour as
𝑌𝑁𝐻
⁄𝐿
𝑌𝑁𝐻 𝐿𝐻
𝑁𝐻
𝜙=
=
.
𝑌𝐻
𝑌𝐻 𝐿𝑁𝐻
⁄𝐿
𝐻

(3.17)

The productivity of healthcare is thus generalized to one, and 𝜙 > 1 suggests that the
productivity in 𝑁𝐻 is higher than in healthcare. The variable 𝜙 measures thus the
productivity gap and is one of the key elements in this analysis.
Furthermore, by assuming an equilibrium where demand is equal to the supply in the rest
of the economy, we define the percentage of 𝑁𝐻 demand of the total output as a variable 𝑘,
so that
𝑘𝑌 = 𝑌𝑁𝐻

(3.18)

and the equation (3.16) can be substituted to (3.18) as
𝑘𝑌 = 𝜙𝐿𝑁𝐻 .

(3.19)

Naturally, the whole labour supply 𝐿 is the sum of both sectors’ labour and the production
𝑌 is a function of labour productivity, so that
𝐿 = 𝐿𝐻 + 𝐿𝑁𝐻

(3.20)

𝑌 = 𝐿𝐻 + 𝜙𝐿𝑁𝐻 .

(3.21)
21

Kristian Gästgifvars

By writing the whole 𝑁𝐻 labour supply given equation (3.19) as

𝐿𝑁𝐻 =

𝑘𝑌
,
𝜙

(3.22)

we get 𝐿𝑁𝐻 and 𝐿𝐻 as functions of each other:
𝑘
𝐿𝑁𝐻 = ( ) (𝐿𝐻 + 𝜙𝐿𝑁𝐻 )
𝜙
𝑘
𝐿
𝜙(1 − 𝑘) 𝐻

(3.23)

𝜙(1 − 𝑘)
𝐿𝑁𝐻 .
𝑘

(3.24)

𝐿𝑁𝐻 =

𝐿𝐻 =

By substituting equation (3.20) in equations (3.23) and (3.24), and dividing both sides
with the total labour, we get both sectors’ share of the labour force with
𝐿𝑁𝐻
𝑘
=
𝐿
𝑘 + 𝜙(1 − 𝑘)

(3.25)

𝐿𝐻
𝜙(1 − 𝑘)
=
.
𝐿
𝑘 + 𝜙(1 − 𝑘)

(3.26)

We have now one measurable hypothesis of the cost disease, discussed in chapter 3.1. The
third proposition in Baumol’s (1967) suggests that if the ratio of production between NPS
and PS is held constant, the employment in the economy must move towards the NPS.
The new model (Atanda, Menclova & Reed, 2018) shows this proposition as well. The
first derivative of equation (3.26) with respect to 𝜙 can be shown as

22

Kristian Gästgifvars
𝐿
𝜕 ( 𝐿𝐻 )
𝑘(1 − 𝑘)
=
(𝑘 + 𝜙(1 − 𝑘))2
𝜕𝜙
and since both 𝑘 and 𝜙 are by definition greater than zero, we get
𝐿
𝜕 ( 𝐿𝐻 )
>0 .
𝜕𝜙

(3.27)

Therefore, if the supply of health is kept constant, a change in relative productivity would
result in a growing portion of the population working in healthcare. Additionally, the
properties of the equation anticipates that a negative change in

𝐿𝐻
𝐿

with respect to 𝑘, or

𝐿
𝜕 ( 𝐿𝐻 )
−𝜙
=
2 <0 ,
𝜕𝑘
(𝑘 + 𝜙(1 − 𝑘))

(3.28)

when 𝜙 > 0. Equation (3.28) measures the market effect if the demand for 𝑁𝐻-goods
grows. The change is quite intuitive; if the production in either sector rises, more labour
is required in that sector when the production gap is held constant.
In conclusion, we express the 𝐻 proportion of the labour force as an equation of demanded
ratio of 𝑁𝐻 goods in the economy (𝑘), and a measurement of the disparity in productivity
(𝜙), with equation (3.26). This measures elements of P2 and P3 as discussed in chapter
3.1. As a result, the work done by Atanda, Menclova and Reed (2018) gives us equations
(3.27) and (3.28) as two testable consequences of Baumol’s cost disease.

23

Kristian Gästgifvars
The total productivity method

Atanda, Menclova and Reed (2018) construct their econometrical methods without the
disparity variable (𝜙). The argument is that the necessary comparable data to generate the
variable is unavailable for a cross-country panel and would consequently be pointless.
Their analysis, however, is generated from all the variables in chapter 3.3 and uses the
same theoretic assumptions, but the main variable to measure the Baumol’s cost disease
is the cross-sector productivity in each country. The mathematical proof presented in the
study is built the following way:
Given the equation (3.21), we can obtain the weighted average productivity in the
economy with

𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑 =

𝑌 𝜙𝐿𝑁𝐻 + 𝐿𝐻
𝐿𝑁𝐻
𝐿𝐻
)+
=
= 𝜙(
𝐿
𝐿
𝐿
𝐿

(3.29)

and the labour shares in both sectors are in itself functions of 𝜙, which means that
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑 = 𝑓(𝜙).

(3.30)

If we only can use the economy-wide productivity (𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑) to demonstrate the effect in
equation (3.27), we will need to prove that
𝐿
𝜕 ( 𝐿𝐻 )
𝜕𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑

=

𝐿
𝜕 ( 𝐿𝐻 )
𝜕𝜙

𝜕(𝜙)
∙
>0
𝜕𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑

(3.31)

in order to estimate that there is a positive change in the health share of the labour force if
the productivity increases. Since

𝐿
𝜕( 𝐻 )
𝐿

𝜕𝜙

is already shown before, sufficient proof of

equation (3.31) can by substitution of equations (3.25) and (3.26) be derived the following
way:
24

(3.32)

and
(3.33)

𝜕𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑
𝑘
=
2 .
𝜕𝜙
(𝑘 + 𝜙(1 − 𝑘))

The variable 𝑘 is by definition positive, which means that

𝜕𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑
𝜕𝜙

> 0 for every 𝜙 ∈ ℝ+ .

The 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑 function is unique and strictly increasing. Therefore, there exists an inverse
function 𝑓 −1 (𝜙) and it is derived as
𝑓 −1 (𝜙) = 𝜙 =

𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑 ∙ 𝑘
.
1 − 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑 ∙ (1 − 𝑘)

(3.34)

The derivate of 𝜙 with respect to 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑 is
𝜕𝜙
𝑘
=
𝜕𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑 (1 − 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑 ∙ (1 − 𝑘))2

and given the properties of the used variables,

𝜕𝜙
𝜕𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑

(3.35)

is greater than zero as well.

Therefore, the inequality in equation (3.31) holds, an increase in the total productivity will
result in a higher share of labour in healthcare as well, similar to the effect in equation
(3.27).
With this proof (Atanda, Menclova & Reed, 2018), we can measure the same effect in
healthcare labour by a change in the total productivity (𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑), as we would with the
relative productivity between health and non-health sector. This is extremely useful when
estimating effects from a cross-country data panel, since the output or labour in the health
sector is rarely available. Baumol’s third proposition will be tested in this study by
estimating if both

4. Method
This chapter presents the methodological approach to evaluate if the Finnish healthcare
suffers from Baumol’s cost disease. Chapter 4.1 describes and displays the gathered data,
and the following part shows how it is applied in an econometric analysis.

4.1. Data
The data used in this study is a strongly balanced panel of Finnish sub-regions between
2000 and 2016 (Statistics Finland, 2019; Finnish institute for health and welfare, 2020).
Finland is divided into 19 regions, which each contains between one to seven sub-regions.
The total number adds up to 70 sub-regions, 67 of which are on the mainland Finland.
Figure 4.1 shows the geographical division of Finnish sub-regions.

Figure 4.1 Population (A) and health output in EUR (B) in Finnish sub-regions in 2016.
Note: the colour distribution is divided into the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th percentiles.

26

Kristian Gästgifvars
The Finnish sub-regions, shown in Figure 4.1, contain between two to seventeen
municipalities, depending on population and land area. The dark red-coloured areas in
4.1A; Helsinki, Tampere and Turku sub-regions, represent 40 % of the nation’s
population. Finnish inhabitants are somewhat clustered around the most populated
municipalities and centred more towards the southern part of the country.
Regarding healthcare, the Finnish municipalities are responsible for primary care in their
own regions and the provision and responsibility of specialised care services are divided
into 20 Hospital districts nationally (Local and Regional Government Finland, 2020;
Keskimäki et al, 2019). Considering the regional size, sub-regions are conveniently
located between municipalities and hospital regions. This will hopefully capture elements
of both primary care and specialised care in the regressions in this thesis. In Finland,
sufficient data at the municipal level is unavailable and gathering data at the hospital level
would drastically decrease the number of observations and potentially place too much
emphasis on specialised care provision. Either way, the Finnish health-system is highly
decentralised, which allows sizeable variations in interregional health statistics.
The main variables in this study, which are used in the models in chapter 3.3, are the ratio
of labour working in healthcare, the total production of non-healthcare goods and the
relative labour productivity between non-healthcare and healthcare production. One
strength in this study is that it uses data provided by Statistics Finland’s (2019) of total
production, divided separately by industry sector in the Finnish economy. In this study,
the healthcare sector is represented by the sum of total production in human health and
social work activities (Statistics Finland, 2019). Figure 4.1 B illustrates the variation of
healthcare output per population.
As shown and discussed above, there are clear differences in health related variables
between Finnish sub-regions. Interestingly, the variation is geographically disseminated
and there are no clear differences between hospital districts. Therefore, it is useful to
measure the effects of the cost disease with a cross-region fixed effects model. Fixed
effects models are often used in health economics studies because they can measure more
27

Kristian Gästgifvars
causal effects for variable coefficients by excluding the time and cross-regional effects. In
cross-country panels, the relative productivity variable is yet to be observable, since the
data of production in each sector is unavailable and often non-comparable between
countries (Atanda, Menclova & Reed, 2018). The cross-regional Finnish data, however,
is gathered and measured by the same statistics institution.

Kristian Gästgifvars
Table 4.1 presents data on variables likely to affect the Finnish healthcare sector, for the
whole population and separately for high- and low-income regions. Most variables are
weighted by population, since the variation is larger in small sample groups, and the
regions with low population will unlikely represent the average population in Finland. The
first three variables are applied in the theoretical method of measuring Baumol’s cost
disease (see chapter 3.3). The variable 𝐿𝐻𝐿 is calculated by dividing the number of
employed individuals in the healthcare sector by the total labour force in each region. In
absolute terms, approximately 400 000 people are working in the health sector in Finland
and the variation between regions is actually quite small. The variable 𝜙 measures the
disparity in productivity between non-health and health sectors. As we can see in Table
4.1, the labour productivity in the non-health sector is considerably higher. The average
productivity in the rest of the economy is more than two times higher than in healthcare,
which gives support to the main hypothesis in this study. The variable 𝑘 represents the
demand for non-health goods. 𝑘 is calculated by subtracting the healthcare output from
total output and dividing the difference by the total output in the economy. Thus, the share
of demand for health goods is represented by (1 − 𝑘). The demand for healthcare goods
adds up to nearly 10 % of the total demand and the regional variation is rather large.
The next four variables in Table 4.1 represent the institutional variables in healthcare.
Private health production counts for almost a third of the total health production in
Finland, thereby making it a crucial factor in the analysis. In the last twenty years, the
private health sector has grown by ten percentage points. The costs of specialised care
varies substantially in different regions and the mean value is quite high, compared to the
total health outputs per capita in Figure 4.1 B. Variables Circulatory disease index and
Cancer index measure the morbidity level in sub-regions of the most common causes of
death in Finland (Keskimäki et al, 2019). Both indices differ considerably between highand low-income regions, cancer being more common in wealthier regions and circulatory
diseases affecting more low-income regions.
The rest of the rows in Table 4.1 show the demographic and economic variables. The
demographic variables are often regarded essential influencing factors in healthcare
29

Kristian Gästgifvars
system analyses (Hitiris, 1997) and especially income considered as the most important
determinant of health expenditures (Gerdtham & Jönsson, 2000; Baltagi & Moscone,
2010; Benavides, 2018). The age structure, population and income are therefore controlled
for in this study, as well. The population in Finland has grown only slightly in the last two
decades, at a yearly growth rate of 0.4 percent. Concurrently, the age structure has changed
drastically. The proportion of elderly population has grown with five percentage points
between 2000 and 2016, and accounts now for approximately one fifth of the Finnish
population. In low-income regions, the same statistic is more than a 25 %. In some regions
the ratio of over 64-year-old inhabitants is nearly 40 %. The variation in demographic
variables between sub-regions is thus quite large.

4.2. Primary empirical model
This study will use a two-way fixed effects regression model, to test Baumol’s (1967) cost
disease hypothesis, i.e. the equations (3.27) and (3.28) discussed in chapter 3.3. According
to the theoretical framework (Atanda, Menclova & Reed, 2018), there are two affecting
variables in the healthcare share of the labour force equation (see eq. (3.26)), thus giving
two endogenous variables in the regression. For the Finnish healthcare system, the
measured model is specified the following way:
𝐿𝐻𝐿𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽1 𝜙𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑘𝑖𝑡 + 𝜐 ∙ 𝑍𝑖𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖𝑡 ,

(4.1)

where the error term is sum of non-observable region-specific effects and secular yearspecific effects and individual time trends, defined as
𝑢𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝜂𝑡 + 𝜇𝑖 ∙ 𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 .
𝐿𝐻𝐿 is the proportion of the labour force working in the healthcare sector, 𝜙 is the relative
productivity between sectors and 𝑘 the ratio of production in the non-healthcare sector.
30

Kristian Gästgifvars
All endogenous variables are explained in greater detail in chapter 3.3 and Table A1.
Equation (4.1) includes also a dot product of a vector of exogenous explanatory
variables, 𝑍, and a vector of coefficients, 𝜐. The vector 𝑍 contains several variables (see
Table 4.1 & Table A1), which are used in numerous prior health economics studies, that
reviews the determinants of healthcare expenditures (Gerdtham & Jönsson, 2000;
Hartwig, 2008; Colombier, 2012; Bates & Santerre, 2013). The econometric model uses
only unique observations in region 𝑖 at time 𝑡 ( 𝑖 = 1, … , 67; 𝑡 = 1, … , 17) and excludes
the time and regional invariant effects of healthcare. Thus, any economic trends affecting
the whole country, such as inflation and price indices, cannot be controlled for and will
not be included in the model. Additionally, by allowing the model to be controlled for
individual time trends will absorb the heterogeneity that might arise with time between
regions. (Allison, 2009; Wooldridge, 2007 & 2012; Dynarski, Jacob & Kreisman, 2018).

4.3. Other variable measurements
Due to insufficient data, Atanda, Menclova and Reed (2018) measures Baumol’s cost
disease with the same model as in equation (4.1), but with different endogenous variables.
As we saw in chapter 3.3.2, proposition 3 in Baumol’s (1967) theory can be measured
with the economy-wide productivity. Atanda, Menclova and Reed (2018) utilize this
property and substitute the relative productivity variable (equation (3.17)) with the total
productivity in different countries, measured as the ratio of GDP to the number of hours
worked. In this study, the same detail will be applied i.e. substituting 𝜙𝑖𝑡 in equation (4.1)
with the variable 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑡 , which is measured as

𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑 =

𝐺𝐷𝑃
.
𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑑

(4.2)

Additionally, dividing the production by the total number of working hours might raise
the accuracy of calculating the productivity. By measuring the required time of producing
31

Kristian Gästgifvars
one unit of goods instead of number of employees in the sector, eliminates the possible
omitted effect that could emerge from differences in length of standard working days
between sectors. The standard equilibrium for working hours might even be different in
each sub-region depending on the economic incentives and demographics (Alesina,
Glaeser & Sacerdote, 2005).

5. Results
This chapter presents the results of the econometric models presented in chapter 4.2. The
results in this chapter follow closely the rebuilt theory by Atanda, Menclova and Reed
(2018), which is presented in chapter 3.3.

5.1. The relative productivity method
Table 5.1 summarises the determinants of health sector labour share with three different
OLS estimation methods: a region-fixed effect estimation (FE), a two-way fixed effect
(2WFE) estimation, which includes year dummy variables, and finally a fixed effect
estimation with region-specific time trends (FErTT). All three models show the raw effect
of the variables, which theoretically should affect the dependant variable (Atanda,
Menclova and Reed, 2018), followed by a set of control variables affecting both the
demand and supply of health production. All estimations are controlled for demographic
and economic variables as well. The logarithmic dependent variables are chosen in nonpercentage variables by tentatively maximising the coefficient of determination (𝑅 2 ) in
the model and applying it in numerically large observation values. GDP/cap growth rate
is measured with the first difference of the natural logarithm of per capita income
(𝑑. ln (𝐺𝐷𝑃 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎)), which is a standard way of controlling the effect of income
elasticity in recent health economics studies. It mitigates the problem of non-stationary
time series and spurious effects. The coefficients show the significance level with clusterrobust standard errors, which are found to be more reliable when the regression sample is
clustered by regions, much like the Finnish data set does. (Barros, 1998; Bowerman,
OConnell & Koehler, 2005; Abadie, Athey, Imbens, & Wooldridge, 2017)
In the first column in Table 5.1, both main variables are significantly different from zero.
The effect of the relative productivity (𝜙) is positive and share of demand for non-health
goods (𝑘) is negative, which is in line with the predictions in equations (3.27) and (3.28).
By adding the control variables in column 2, the coefficient of the main variables remains
33

Kristian Gästgifvars
virtually identical to the first model. All institutional variables have a small insignificant
effect. Growth of GDP per capita is negative but insignificant, which is unusual given the
strong relationship between health expenditure and income, but the effect is similar to
what Atanda, Menclova and Reed (2018) estimated. The age structure seems to have a
quite large and significant effect on the labour in healthcare. The higher the proportion of
young and elder population, the larger share of health personnel is required in the region.
The positive effect is intuitive, since high birth rate regions employ more gynaecologists
and paediatricians in maternity and child health clinics and the older population generally
require care more frequently. The estimated effect of unemployment in the second column
in Table 5.1 is statistically no different from zero. In other words, the results suggest that
the health sector is unaffected by the changes in the total labour force. High public
indebtedness should intuitively affect the spending and saving in each municipality and
thus the planning of primary care provision. However, there is no evidence that
indebtedness would affect health production in column 2 either.
The models in the third and fourth column in Table 5.1 include a set of year dummies to
exclude the time-specific effects in Finnish healthcare. The effects of the first two
variables are both in line with the tested theory and roughly the same as in the regular
fixed effect model. The effect of the share of under 15-year-old and over 64-year-old
population is slightly larger and remains significant. Otherwise, the control variables show
similar results as the first two columns. The F-test of the time dummies are jointly
significantly equal to zero, indicating that the 2WFE is more appropriate than the FE
model (Baum, 2006). However, 𝑅 2 is only slightly greater in the 2WFE alternative, which
means that time-specific changes offer only little explanation of the variation in LHL.
The third model combines the fixed effects with individual time trend effects. Therefore,
the model allows variables to grow at different rates in each region and control for
unobserved time trends that might affect health sector share of the labour force within
every region (Bates & Santerre, 2015). The FErTT models in Table 5.1 show a slightly
larger positive effect for the relative productivity variable, but ultimately the significant
coefficient remains close to the estimations in columns 1–4.

The non-health sector demand is negative and significant. Given the earlier models, the
private health production show interestingly a significant negative effect on health sector
labour force. The effect is close to those in column 2 and 4, but the standard error in the
estimation is smaller. This would indicate that the stronger private health sector would
reduce the effect of Baumol’s cost disease. The additional health variables continue to be
insignificant, which means that the population’s health status might have no effect on the
number of health care personnel. The age structure has a smaller impact on 𝐿𝐻𝐿 in the
FErTT models and the rest of the economic variables remain the same. Models in column
5 and 6 are tested for an F-test for linear time trend effects as well and the trends are jointly
significant.
The results show quite robust estimations in all columns (Table 5.1, see Appendix C). The
effects of the control variables are mostly similar to findings in other health economics
studies. The Finnish Ministry of Finance (2013) found a significantly positive relationship
with health expenditure and private production, which would indicate that private
production has an effect on contributing factor of health production. Private health
production has negative effects in estimations in Table 5.1, of which one was clearly
significant. Growth of GDP has no effect on proportion of healthcare labour in Table 5.1,
which is the case in Atanda, Menclova and Reed (2018) as well. Generally, growth of
income tends to affect health production positively (Barros, 1998; Gerdtham & Jönsson,
2000; Bates & Santerre, 2013), but the dependent variable is usually different. The age
structure seems to have only a slight effect on health production in several studies
(Ministery of Finance, 2013; Atanda, Menclova and Reed, 2018; Colombier (2017).
However, the estimations in Table 5.1 show a strong positive effect on the labour in
healthcare as a control. The age variables have obviously a high correlation with each
other which might affect the actual coefficient in Finland (see Table A3). The regional
unemployment seems to be an unimportant factor for the labour force in the health sector,
which is in line with the estimates of Bates and Santerre (2013; 2015).

5.2. The total productivity method
The model, which Atanda, Menclova and Reed (2018) use to estimate the cost disease in
their paper is applied in this paper as well. As discussed in chapter 4.3, the model in
equation (4.1) can be tested, and the expected values of the coefficients are the same. The
estimations and each variable’s effects are presented in Table 5.2, exactly in the same way
as in table 5.1 except for the first variable.
In Table 5.2, the two first columns present the fixed effect model without controlling for
year dummies. The effect of the total productivity is significantly positive and the demand
for non-health goods (𝑘) is negative. The positive effect of ln (𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑) is less than the effect
of ln (𝜙) in Table 5.1, which is actually expected in the theory (see calculations in
Appendix B2). The control variables are widely the same. More private health production
decreases the number of health care personnel in the area and the effect is significant,
unlike the corresponding coefficient in Table 5.1 which is much smaller. Otherwise, all
the institutional variables are insignificant and similar to the first estimations. The growth
of GDP per capita is negative and the age structure variables are significantly positive.
Both unemployment and region’s public indebtedness is statistically no different from
zero. The 𝑅 2 value in columns (1) and (2) are approximately half of which they are in
Table 5.1, which could be anticipated with a more generalised version of the productivity
measurement of healthcare production.
Columns (3) and (4) show the estimations with time fixed effects (2WFE). The raw model
with the two endogenous variables fades the effect of total productivity. The effect is close
to zero and insignificant. However, by adding the group of control variables, the effect of
the total productivity increases to a similar level as in column (2). The variable 𝑘 has a
negative significant effect and show more robust effects than 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑. Private health
production is close to its estimations in columns (1) and (2) and significant. Specialised
healthcare costs, sickness allowances on the morbidity indexes are insignificant in column
(3) and (4). Economic and demographic variables are roughly the same as in the first two
columns.

The third pair of estimations in Table 5.2 show the variables’ effect on healthcare share
of the labour force with the FErTT model. Compared to the 2WFE models, the total
productivity variable behaves in a similar way by having no impact to 𝐿𝐻𝐿 in the raw
estimation and a significant coefficient with the control variables. The demand for nonhealth goods has a quite strong negative effect, which is expected since the level of
demand should affect the produced quantity of health, thus, affect the labour within the
sector as well. The percent of private health output has a significant negative impact on
the health labour force in the sixth column and the age structure remain an essential part
in the estimations. Given the results in Table 5.2, a younger population requires more
health care personnel than an older population on average. The rest of the controls are
similar in columns (4) and (6), except for the level of circulatory disease morbidity rate
which appears to have a small significant impact.
The total productivity model in Table 5.2 does not show as robust effects as the relative
productivity alternative in Table 5.1. The effect of the most important variable, 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑,
varies highly in each estimation and has both theoretically (appendix B2) and empirically
a smaller effect than 𝜙 on 𝐿𝐻𝐿. The phenomenon where the estimated effect changes to
significant by adding control variables is also evidence of multicollinearity. A change in
most other variables are thus affecting the change in 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑, which in itself has a weak
explanatory power. However, the results in Table 5.2 show slightly more favourable
estimations of supporting the existence of Baumol’s cost disease than Atanda, Menclova
and Reed (2018), but the results are less convincing than the model used in Table 5.1.

5.3. Discussion
Table 5.1 seems to capture the effect of Baumol’s cost disease. Both of the expected
effects in equation (3.27) and (3.28) are visible regardless of the model. An average
change in 𝜙 would thus result in an estimated 600 – 850 jobs moving either into or from
the health sector in Finland, ceteris paribus. The yearly change in relative productivity has
39

Kristian Gästgifvars
varied each year between 2000 and 2016. Figure 5.1 illustrates the yearly change in 𝜙 and
the variation between regions.

Figure 5.1 Box graph of the yearly change in relative productivity in Finland. Note: the
boxes show variability in Finnish sub-regions.

The total number of professionals employed by the health sector is nearly 400 000, thus,
the yearly impact of the relative productivity on the labour market is modest at best. Given
the data sample used in this study, there is no clear direction in relative productivity
variable in the future. The main factor of 𝜙 is the denominator (see eq. 3.17) since the
economic downturns tend to affect more the production of the non-health sector. In the
last two decades, the Finnish GDP growth has been mostly negative at two time intervals;
2008-2010 and 2012-2016. The medium-term growth rate in Finland is 1.5 % (Economic
Policy Council, 2018). Due to the world-wide financial crisis in 2008 and the European
debt crisis which followed soon after, the data sample of the Finnish economy (Statistics
40

Kristian Gästgifvars
Finland, 2019) might fail to capture the real level or actual direction of the productivity
growth between sectors in the future. Nevertheless, if labour productivity grows with a
different rate in non-health sectors than in healthcare in Finland a change in the labour
structure is expected, which is the general idea of Baumol’s third proposition (Baumol,
1967) of the cost disease. Additionally, assuming the total production will grow with its
medium-term rate, the impact of the disparity in productivity would be economically
noticeable in a decade.
Productivity indicators are often criticised for their inaccuracy. The relative productivity
variable is an imprecise solution for measuring the real impact of the productivity gap.
Using the same indicator of productivity in different sectors tends to misrepresent the
actual effectiveness in each sector of the economy (Bernard & Jones, 1996; Van de Walle,
2008). Cowen (1996) argues in his paper that the main problem with studies of Baumol’s
cost disease is that growth in quality is often overlooked in the non-progressively growing
sector. Quality improvements certainly increase the value of the produced goods, and
sometimes the changes over time occur in an unmeasurable way. In healthcare, the
measurement of productivity is often corrected for infant-mortality and life-expectancy
(Afonso, Schuknecht & Tanzi, 2005) and there are many potential ways to improve the
indicator of the actual level of performance. However, correcting the health sector
productivity would further misrepresent the relative productivity variable, especially if the
labour productivity in the rest of the economy would be left uncorrected. Even though the
productivity values in equations (4.1) and (4.2) are somewhat flawed, the change in the
labour market is identified by a change in the relative labour productivity between the
studied sectors. Therefore, the method in this thesis measures the actual problem which
arises with disparity in labour productivity (Baumol 1967), whether the productivity
variable measures actual performance within sectors or not.
The results in Table 5.2 are derived from a more generalized model and the coefficients
between the models show greater variations. A noteworthy difference between the theories
used in the estimations in Table 5.1 and 5.2 is that the disparity in health sector
productivity and rest of the economy is merely an assumption in the total productivity
41

Kristian Gästgifvars
model. In an intuitive sense, productivity in the whole economy should not affect the
health sector labour any more than other sectors if the productivity cannot be observed
separately, even though it theoretically will (chapter 3.3.2). The difference in productivity
is excluded from the measurements, which threatens the validity of the model. However,
there seems to be some evidence to the cost disease argument with the total productivity
nonetheless, even though the effect is smaller in magnitude than the relative productivity
variable.
In Finland, health expenditures per capita have grown by 40 % between 2000 and 2016
and the real prices have grown by almost 20 % (OECD 2019; Statistics Finland, 2019).
The study by Ministry of Finance (2013) suggests that health expenditures in Finland are
affected by the difference in productivity, which is in line with the first proposition (P1)
of Baumol’s cost disease. The demand for health is kept constant with the national health
insurance and regulated out-of-pocket payments (Keskimäki et al, 2019). The
subsidisation restricts the demand for health to decline, which would be predicted by the
second proposition (P2). Given the results in this chapter, the third proposition (P3) is
visible as well. Thus, the empirical evidence in this study suggests that the healthcare
sector in Finland would suffer Baumol’s cost disease. In other words, the productivity in
health sector affects healthcare costs, prices and labour, controlled for the average
productivity in all other sectors of the economy. Despite the clear signs of the cost disease,
the effect in the whole economy is quite small. The disparity in productivity explains a
marginal part of the change in the labour market in Finland, whereas the demand for health
has a sizeable explanatory power, much like the mainstream conclusions in the field of
study. Nevertheless, the results suggest that Baumol’s cost disease cannot be excluded as
an explanation of how health sector has evolved in the past and is going to evolve in the
future. The overall results are in line with Colombier (2012, 2017) and Bates and Santerre
(2013, 2015). The effect of Baumol’s cost disease is not quite as high as in Hartwig (2008)
and Ministry of Finance (2013), and somewhat greater than in Atanda, Menclova and
Reed (2018).

6. Conclusions
The aim of this thesis is to evaluate if the Finnish healthcare sector is affected by Baumol’s
cost disease. Baumol’s cost disease proposes that a relatively non-productive sector will
exhibit four consecutive market phenomena over time: 1) the cost per input unit will
increase. 2) The demand will decline without third-party intervention. 3) The labour force
will move from the productive sector toward the non-productive sector. 4) The costs of
third-party intervention will increase and affect the overall economic growth. In countries
with universal health coverage the third party is naturally the government. The repeatedly
discussed problem, however, is to use reliable models and measurements to study the
changes in market structures. This thesis uses a model from a recent study by Atanda,
Menclova and Reed (2018), which measures the third proposition of the cost disease,
controlled by the second proposition. The most important factor is the effects of the
relative productivity variable, which is measured by dividing the labour productivity of
the health sector by the productivity of the rest of the economy.
The results of the sub-regional-level fixed effect estimations suggest that a positive change
in the relative productivity will increase the health sector share of the labour force in
Finland. Additionally, a similar estimation derived from the relative productivity model
suggest the economy-wide productivity will affect health production positively as well.
The estimates are mostly statistically significant but trivial from the perspective of the
entire labour market. Within Finland, an average change of the disparity in productivity
variable affects under a thousand employees yearly.
This study contributes in two ways to the economic field of research: Firstly, Baumol’s
cost disease can be used as an explanation for growing health expenditures. The impact is
small but visible. Secondly, despite the dispute of the theory, Baumol’s (1967) framework
seems to explain the evolution of different sectors and is relevant to this day.

7. Summary in Swedish – Svensk Sammanfattning
Finns det tecken av Baumols kostnadssjuka på den finska hälsovårdssektorn?
Hälsovårdskostnader har ökat drastiskt under de senaste 40 åren i de flesta industriländer.
I Finland har totala hälsoutgifterna ökat från fyra till tio procent av BNP och utgifterna
förväntas öka 2 % årligen under nästa årtionde. Inom 2000-talet har man gjort flera bidrag
till hälsoekonomin om vad som orsakar kostnaderna i hälsovård. Den viktigaste
determinanten som framställts till ökande kostnader är BNP per capita, vilket tyder på att
ju högre inkomst desto mer hälsovård efterfrågas. Det återstående problemet är att
inkomsttillväxten inte fullständigt förklarar fenomenet och att andra väsentliga variabler
inte verkar påverka hälsoutgifter lika kraftigt. Varierande metoder har testats för att mäta
arbetsproduktivitetens inverkan på hälsosektorn under senaste åren, med motstridande
resultat. En av dessa metoder är att undersöka ifall hälsovårdssektorn drabbas av Baumols
kostnadssjuka, vilket i teorin direkt skulle förklara hur produktivitetsskillnader ökar
hälsoutgiftera i ett land.
I denna avhandling undersöks om det finns tecken av Baumols kostnadssjuka i finska
hälsovårdssystemet, med den metod som konstruerades av Atanda, Menclova och Reed
(2018).

produktivitetstillväxt, men tillväxten i lönerna är lika. Enligt Baumols (1967)
formalisering visar sektorn med långsam tillväxt fyra olika förändringar på marknaden: 1)
Kostnaderna ökar relativt till resten av ekonomin, 2) efterfrågan sjunker eftersom priserna
måste stiga i förhållande till kostnaderna i produktionen, 3) ifall efterfrågan hålls konstant
med att en tredje part subventionerar produktionen kommer en ökande andel av
arbetskraften förflytta sig till den sektorn där tillväxten är långsam, 4) tillväxttakten i hela
ekonomin kommer att sjunka, eftersom subventionernas mängd växer kontinuerligt. Dessa
fyra effekter kallas ofta för Baumols propositioner. Första propositionen anses ofta vara
viktigast, men relativt högre kostnader till resten av ekonomin kan förekomma på flera
44

olika sätt. Därmed är det viktigt att undersöka även de andra propositionerna, så att man
med högre sannolikhet kan identifiera en bransch som en Baumolsektor. I Atanda,
Menclova och Reeds (2018) ekonometriskt tillämpbara modell är andelen som jobbar
inom hälsovård en funktion av en variabel som beskriver efterfrågan av ickehälsoprodukter och en variabel som mäter skillnaden i produktivitet mellan hälsovård och
resten av ekonomin. Efterfrågan av icke-hälsoprodukter förväntas ha en negativ effekt och
produktivitetsskillnaden en positiv effekt på andelen hälsorelaterade jobb. Intuitivt kunde
hälsovården klassas som en sektor som drabbas av kostnadssjukan, eftersom
tjänsteproduktion har allmänt långsammare produktivitetstillväxt, kostnaderna har okat
markant och Finland erbjuder allmän hälsovård, alltså en tredje part finansierar
produktionen.
Metoden som används i avhandlingen är en ekonometrisk regressionsanalys, där
huvudsakliga målet är att analysera hur skillnaden i produktivitetstillväxt påverkar
andelen av arbetskraft inom hälsovård. Produktivitetsskillnaden är i detta fall uträknad
med att dela den totala arbetsproduktiviteten i övriga ekonomin med arbetsproduktiviteten
i hälsovård. Ifall en ökning i produktivitetsskillnaden orsakar en ökning i
hälsoarbetskraften, skulle detta tyda på att hälsosektorn drabbas av Baumols
kostnadssjuka. Därutöver testas problemet även en annan regression som mäter ifall en
ökning i totala arbetsproduktiviteten i hela regionen ökar på arbetskraften inom hälsovård.
Datamaterialet är från finska ekonomiska regioner mellan åren 2000 och 2016. I studien
mäts effekten med en OLS modell med fixa effekter på regionnivå. Modellen kontrolleras
även för tidsfixa effekter samt regionsspecifika tidstrender, vilket kan minska på eventuell
heterogenitet som kan förekomma i datamaterialet. Metoden lämpar sig för finsk data,
eftersom det finns stora skillnader i hälsovariabler mellan regioner inom landet. I Finland
ansvar kommunerna för primärvården och sjukhusdistrikten ansvarar för specialvård. Det
saknas en tydlig beslutsfattningsstruktur mellan dessa nivåer och regionerna tillämpar
tillhandahållandet av sjukvård på olika sätt.

Globalt sett rangordnas det finska

hälsosystemet högt, men nationella skillnaderna är stora även om alla kommuner är
verksamma inom samma fundamentala hälsosystem.

Enligt regressionsresultaten ökar produktivitetsskillnaden på andelen arbetskraft som
jobbar med hälsorelaterade tjänster då efterfrågan av hälsoprodukter hålls konstant, vilket
tyder på att två av Baumols (1967) ursprungliga propositioner är synliga. Även totala
produktiviteten ökar på hälsoarbetskraften, vilket i teorin förutspås byggd av Atanda,
Menclova och Reed (2018). Resultaten i studien av Finansministeriet (Ministry of
Finance, 2013) av finska hälsovårdssystemet tyder också på att skillnaden i
produktivitetstillväxten orsakar högre kostnader inom hälsovård. Finansministeriets
resultat och utfallen i denna studie indikerar kraftigt att hälsosektorn i Finland påverkas
av Baumols kostnadssjuka. Relativa kostnader för hälsovård stiger och andelen av
arbetsuppgifterna förflyttas mot hälsobranschen, på grund av att produktiviteten har en
kraftigare tillväxt i resterande ekonomin. Däremot är effekten inte så stor. En medelmåttlig
årlig förändring i produktivitetsskillnadsvariabeln skulle fenomenet påverka 600-850
individer varje år. Hela finska hälsovårdssystemet sysselsätter omkring 400 000
människor (Statistics Finland, 2019). Det finns inte heller en tydlig trend hur
produktiviteten i hälsosektorn och i resten av ekonomin kommer att förändras i framtiden.
Hälsosektorn påverkas allmänt mindre av konjunktursvängningar i ekonomin, vilket
förvränger variabelvärden en del. Allmänt kan dock Baumols kostnadssjuka inte uteslutas
som en förklaring till både ökade kostnader för hälsovård och förändring på
hälsoarbetskraften.

Appendix B. Further calculations
B1: Calculations of the fourth proposition (P4) of the cost disease
The fourth proposition shows how the economy-wide growth will eventually slow down
(Chapter 3.1). The calculations by Baumol (1967) for P4 is shown in the following way:
We can measure the index of total output as an index of both sector’s weighted outputs as
𝐼 = 𝐵𝑁𝑃𝑆 𝑌𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) + 𝐵𝑃𝑆 𝑌𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) = 𝐵𝑁𝑃𝑆 𝑎𝐿𝑁𝑃𝑆 (𝑡) + 𝐵𝑃𝑆 𝑏𝐿𝑃𝑆 (𝑡)𝑒 𝑟𝑡 ,

(B1.1)

where 𝐵𝑁𝑃𝑆 and 𝐵𝑃𝑆 are the sectors’ weights. By substituting equations (3.12) and (3.13)
to (B1.1), we get
𝐼 = 𝐵𝑁𝑃𝑆 𝑎

𝛾𝐿(𝑡)𝑒 𝑟𝑡
𝐿(𝑡)
+ 𝐵𝑃𝑆 𝑏
𝑒 𝑟𝑡 .
𝑟𝑡
1 + 𝛾𝑒
1 + 𝛾𝑒 𝑟𝑡

(B1.2)

If we assume that the total labour supply is a constant over time, we can rewrite equation
(B1.2) as
𝐼=

𝑅𝑒 𝑟𝑡
, 𝑅 = 𝐿(𝑡)(𝑎𝛾𝐵𝑁𝑃𝑆 + 𝑏𝐵𝑃𝑆 ) .
1 + 𝛾𝑒 𝑟𝑡

(B1.3)

Additionally, a change in 𝐼 with respect to 𝑡 can be written as
𝜕𝐼
𝑟𝑅𝑒 𝑟𝑡
=
𝜕𝑡 (1 + 𝛾𝑒 𝑟𝑡 )2

(B1.4)

and a percentage change in 𝐼 is shown as
𝑟𝑅𝑒 𝑟𝑡
𝜕𝐼⁄

𝜕𝑡 = (1 + 𝛾𝑒 𝑟𝑡 )2 =

Finally, lim (

variables. The calculations can be shown the following way:

𝜕𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑 (1 − 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑 ∙ (1 − 𝑘))2
and the condition when equation (B2.2) is less than one is calculated by

These are the restricting conditions where

. By calculating the difference

between these restrictions and the actual data (Statistics Finland, 2019) used in the
54

Kristian Gästgifvars
econometric estimations (Table 5.1 & Table 5.2), we can see if the theoretically expected
coefficient should be lower as well. Therefore, suppose that the restriction variable
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑠 is calculated for every observation in the data set as
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑠|𝑖𝑡 =

1 + √𝑘𝑖𝑡
,
1 − 𝑘𝑖𝑡

where 𝑖 and 𝑡 are the notations for each region and year respectively (the upper limit for
the inequality (B2.3) is used, since there are no 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑 values below one). Now we can test
the difference and ratio between the actual and the restricting value to identify if the
condition in (B2.3) is true. The tests are:
𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡1 :

𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑡 − 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑠|𝑖𝑡 > 0

𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡2 :

𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑡
>1
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑠|𝑖𝑡
