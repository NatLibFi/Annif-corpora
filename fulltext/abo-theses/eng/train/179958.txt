Title: Anxiety symptoms in depression: are they related to antidepressant treatment and its
side-effects?
Supervisor: Mira Karrasch
Abstract:
Earlier studies suggest that depression with comorbid anxiety symptoms have worse treatment
outcomes, but that anxiety symptoms could be alleviated with antidepressants (AD). Depressed
patients with comorbid anxiety symptoms also suffer from more severe and frequent AD side
effects, but less is known about associations between anxiety and specific side-effects (e.g.
sexual and withdrawal side-effects). The two aims in the present study were (1) to elucidate
associations between anxiety symptoms and AD treatment, and (2) investigate the association
between anxiety symptoms and perceived side effects of AD treatment. Data for the present
study was extracted from the DETRECO project (N = 326; 18-63 years), where 137
respondents were currently under AD treatment, and 189 respondents had never been under
AD treatment. The AD users were significantly older than the non-users and a higher
percentage of the AD users had been depressed for five years or more. Women were also
slightly overrepresented in the AD users. Anxiety levels were measured using STAI-6 and AD
treatment was assessed with specific questions on usage. Perceived side effects of AD were
addressed with a questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis data from Sjöberg (2017) was
utilised for computing mean scores in four side effects factors. The results of a two-way
ANCOVA showed no significant main effect of either treatment (AD vs. no AD) or depression
duration (0-4 vs. ≥ 5 years) on anxiety symptom levels when controlling for age, but a
significant main effect of the covariate age was found. A subsequent control analysis of agematched participants revealed no differences in anxiety levels. In the second part of the study,
multiple hierarchical regression analysis found a significant negative association between
anxiety and sexual side effects, such that higher anxiety levels were associated with lower
levels of sexual side effects. Estrangement, Dependency/Abstinence or Physical side effects
were not associated with anxiety. To conclude, no difference was found in anxiety level
between those who were and were not under AD treatment. Nonetheless, an unexpected
negative association was found between anxiety and sexual side effects, which may be due to
anxiety distracting attention from erotic cues and in turn decreasing overall sexual activity and
resulting in less sexual side effects experienced.

Titel: Ångestsymtom i depression: är de relaterade till antidepressiva läkemedel och
läkemedlens biverkningar?
Handledare: Mira Karrasch
Abstrakt:
Enligt tidigare studier kan depression med komorbida ångestsymtom resultera i sämre
behandlingsutfall jämfört med endast depression, men ångestsymtom kan lindras med hjälp av
antidepressiva läkemedel (AD). Deprimerade patienter med komorbida ångestsymtom kan även
ha en ökad risk för mer och svårare biverkningar av AD. Dock är kunskapen begränsad
gällande associationerna mellan ångestsymtom och specifika biverkningar (av t.ex. sexuell och
abstinent karaktär). Syftet med denna avhandling var att studera associationerna mellan
ångestsymtom, AD-behandling och dess upplevda biverkningar. Data från DETRECO projektet
(N = 326; 18-63 år) användes för att besvara frågeställningarna. Av deltagarna använde 137
AD, medan 189 aldrig använt AD. Kvinnor var en aning överrepresenterade och signifikant
äldre i AD-gruppen än de som aldrig använt AD, men ingen skillnad mellan grupperna fanns
gällande depressionssvårighet (QIDS-SR) eller utbildningsnivå. Ångestsymtom undersöktes
med STAI-6 och antidepressiv behandling utvärderades med specifika frågor kring användning.
Upplevda biverkningar av AD undersöktes med ett frågeformulär. Explorativ faktoranalytisk
data från Sjöberg (2017) användes för att utforska medelvärden i fyra biverknings-faktorer.
Resultaten från en 2 x 2 ANCOVA fann ingen signifikant huvudeffekt av antingen behandling
(AD vs. icke-AD) eller depressionkronicitet (0-4 vs. ≥5 år) på ångestsymtom, kovariatet ålder
var däremot signifikant. En kontroll-analys med åldersmatchade grupper utfördes och påvisade
inte heller någon signifikant skillnad i ångestsymtom mellan grupperna. I andra delen av
avhandlingen gjordes en multipel hierarkisk regressionsanalys av biverkningar. Då fanns en
negativ korrelation mellan ångestsymtom och sexuella biverkningar där högre ångest var
associerat med mindre risk för upplevda sexuella biverkningar. Dock korrelerade inte
ångestsymtom med resten av biverkningarna: Utanförskap, Beroende/Abstinens och Fysiska
biverkningar. Sammanfattningsvis konstaterades att inga skillnader i ångestsymtom fanns
mellan AD- och icke-AD-gruppen. En oväntad negativ association konstaterades mellan ångest
och sexuella biverkningar vilket eventuellt kan förklaras av att ångest distraherar individens
uppmärksamhet från erotiska signaler och på detta sätt minskar sexuella aktiviteter överlag,
vilket leder till mindre upplevda sexuella biverkningar.

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
Anxiety symptoms in depression: are they related to antidepressant treatment and its sideeffects?
Depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the world, affecting about
264 million people worldwide in 2017 (GDB Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence
Collaborators, 2017). It is ranked as the single major contributor to global disability and the
largest contributor to suicide death (World Health Organisation, 2017). Finland tops the
prevalence of mental disorders in Europe with rates of 18.8% of the population suffering
from some kind of mental illness, along with depression as the most common mental disorder
in the last few decades (The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development,
2018; OECD). Various studies conducted between 1996 and 2011 have reported rates up to
9.3% of the Finnish population suffering from depression (Lindeman et al., 2000; Markkula
et al., 2015; Pirkola et al., 2005). The incidence of disability pensions has also increased until
the late 2000s (Honkonen & Gould, 2009 as cited in Markkula et al., 2015), and earlier
retirements are increasingly more due to depression (Karpansalo et al., 2005).
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition
(DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013), Major depressive disorder (MDD;
referred to as depression in the current study) presents symptoms such as depressed mood or
anhedonia, appetite or weight changes, sleeping difficulties, cognitive dysfunctions, feelings
of worthlessness and more. Although not included, anxiety symptoms are common in
depression (Montgomery, 2019), and are suggested to co-occur in up to 78% of depressed
patients (Gaspersz, Nawijn, Lamers & Penninx, 2018). The most common treatment for
depression in Finland is antidepressant (AD) medication (Honkonen, Aro, Isometsä, Virtanen
& Katila, 2007) which has been suggested to be as effective in depressed patients with
anxiety symptoms (e.g. Lyndon, Prieto, Wajsbrot, Allgulander & Bandelow, 2019).
Nonetheless, AD has been shown to have side effects (Ottosson, 2018), which are argued to
be even more burdensome when anxiety is present in depression (Ionsescu, Niciu, Richards
& Zarate, 2014). However, the extent of AD side effects are suggested to be suppressed by
publication bias, and their true prevalence has possibly been underestimated (Bet,
Hugtenburg, Pennix & Hoogendijk, 2013; Popovic, Vieta, Fornaro & Perugi, 2014; Turner,
Matthews, Linardatos, Tell & Rosenthal, 2008). The present study set out to examine whether
anxiety symptom levels would differ between depressed individuals using ADs and those
who have never used ADs. Possible associations between anxiety symptoms and side-effects
of ADs are also examined in the subset of participants who are using ADs.

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
1.1 Anxiety symptoms in depression
Trait anxiety is the stable and personality-related tendency to attend to worrisome and
fearful parts of many situations (Derakshan & Eysenck, 2009; Eysenck, 1992; Gidron, 2013).
State anxiety is defined as a subjectively high perceived threat to the individual. It is the
interaction between trait anxiety and situational stress and is experienced as strong emotions
of worry and fear. State anxiety will be of focus in the current study.
Anxiety symptoms in depression are suggested to result from, among others, feelings
of guilt, hopelessness and low physical well-being (Ottosson, 2018). Anxiety is suggested to
be a commonality in depression (Wiethoff et al., 2010) and various studies have estimated
that between 42-80% of adults with depression have anxiety symptoms of clinical
significance (Gaspersz et al., 2018; Lyche, Jonassen, Stiles, Ulleberg & Landrø, 2010;
Zimmerman et al., 2000). A recent meta-analysis suggested that all types of anxiety
symptoms predicted later depressive symptoms and vice versa; the two having a
“bidirectional prospective relationship with one another” (Jacobson & Newman, 2017, p.
1169). Nonetheless, few studies have investigated patients who have depression but also
manifest anxiety symptoms as they often are excluded from clinical trials due to their
comorbidity (Zimmerman, McDermus & Mattia, 2000). Yet, they are argued to be a more
vulnerable (as well as a more prevalent) clinical group since depression with anxiety
symptoms or anxiety disorders are suggested to present a greater challenge in treatment
(Montgomery, 2019).
Anxiety is argued to be associated with poorer clinical outcomes (Gaspersz et al.,
2018) and a higher risk of suicidality (Allgulander, 2000, as cited in Lyndon et al., 2019).
Comorbid depression with anxiety symptoms is suggested to be associated with negative
cognitive outcomes such as deficits in cognitive-emotional processing (e.g. negative
attentional bias; Mathews, Mackintosh & Fulcher, 1997), inhibitions and attention shifting
(Braund et al., 2019; Derakshan & Eysenck, 2009). Compared to patients with depression
only, patients with depression and anxiety are more likely to have greater depression severity,
longer duration of depression, greater psychosocial disability, higher risk of relapse
(Altamura, Montresor, Salvadori & Mundo, 2004; Fava et al., 2006; Lyche et al., 2010;
Weiss et al., 2016; Wiethoff et al., 2010) and reduced quality of life (Gaspersz et al., 2018;
Ionescu, Niciu, Henter & Zarate, 2013). In a relatively recent study by Cha and colleagues
(2018), the researchers found that participants with depression reported significantly more
symptoms of anxiety assessed by Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7-items (GAD-7), compared

7

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
to healthy controls. The depressed participants were however under AD treatment, thus a
comparison with a depressed group not using AD was lacking. Additionally, a longitudinal
study conducted by Weiss et al. (2016) investigated 298 women (19-90 years old) with mood
disorders and examined factors such as age, physical morbidity, hormonal status and anxiety
symptoms. Levels of anxiety in women with moderate depression were the strongest
predictor of severe depression, including thoughts of death and suicide. But age and
hormones, perhaps counterintuitively, were not significant predictors of severe depression.
These findings suggest the need for priority of addressing anxiety symptoms in the treatment
of depression.
1.2 Antidepressant treatment and its prevalence
AD medication is a common treatment for depression (Honkonen et al., 2007;
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2004). Moore and colleagues (2009)
reviewed a UK patients register of over three million people and found that about 81% of
patients diagnosed with depression received at least one prescription of AD within the first
year of diagnosis. More than a dozen different types ADs in the US have suggested
effectiveness for treatment of depression (Drobizhev, Fedotova & Kikta, 2015). Selective
Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most common medication of choice (Ottosson,
2018) and the frequency of people maintaining AD treatment for longer than five years has
increased since 1994 (Lockhart & Guthrie, 2011; Moore et al., 2009).
This long-term usage trend has also been observed in Finland and with significant
increase from 1995 to 2000 (Sihvo et al., 2010). AD as a choice of treatment is even more
common in Finland than in Europe in general (OECD, 2014). Honkonen et al. (2007)
investigated treatments for depression in Finland utilising two national representative samples
with a ten-year interval (1993-1994 to 2003-2004). They found that only about 10.6% of the
patients with depression had received psychotherapy weekly, while 85.6% got AD treatment,
leaving AD treatment as the most utilised depression treatment in Finland. On the same note,
a later study found that 8.3% of the general Finnish population had been prescribed ADs
(Vilhelmsson, 2013), with AD being the seventh most prescribed type of medication in
Finland in 2016 (The Social Insurance Institution of Finland, 2016, as cited in Sjöberg, 2017).

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
1.3 Antidepressant treatment, depression and anxiety symptoms
Varying levels of anxiolytic effects of ADs exist (Ottosson, 2018). A meta-analysis on
AD treatment proposed that anxiety significantly decreased following AD treatment in
randomised placebo-controlled trials (Nelson, Portera & Leon, 2005). In a study by Cha et al.
(2018) 100 individuals with depression under AD treatment were compared to healthy
controls, all between the ages 18-65. Participants were measured on their anxiety symptoms
using GAD-7, and it was found that the depressed group with both high and low anxiety
benefited significantly more following AD treatment, compared to healthy controls.
A recent meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies (N = 2405; Lyndon et al., 2019)
investigated whether participants with higher or lower levels of anxiety symptoms were
affected differently by AD treatment (6-12 weeks treatment). Based on anxiety scores from
the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), patients with depression were divided
into either a low (<3) or high anxiety (≥ 3) group. The results suggested that following AD
treatment (1) both the low- and high-anxiety groups had a significantly greater decrease in
anxiety compared to the placebo group, and (2) the group with high anxiety had a
significantly greater decrease of anxiety compared to the low-anxiety group. Thus, suggesting
that AD treatment had great anxiety-relieving associations in depressed patients with both
low, but especially high anxiety. Thereupon, the authors stressed the importance of assessing
anxiety in depression treatment and adapting AD treatment accordingly as some ADs are
suggested to be more efficient in depression with comorbid anxiety symptoms than others.
1.4 Anxiety and side effects of antidepressant treatment
According to the American Psychological Association’s revised Practice Guidelines
for the Treatment of depression (2019), AD treatment should be, among others, chosen based
on its potential side effects. Some common cognitive AD side effects are fatigue, memory
impairment and inattentiveness (Popovic et al., 2015). Impaired verbal memory has been
found in both current users and remitted users of AD (Nagane et al., 2014). Physical side
effects such as withdrawal, sexual problems and weight gain have been found in a study on
180 long-term users of AD. They did also report emotional side effects like feeling
emotionally numb and addicted. Although reporting feeling satisfied with the AD, the
patients did find side effects concerning (Cartwright, Gibson, Read, Cowan & Denhar, 2016).
Similar side effects were found in a study on long-term AD use completed by 1829 adults in

9

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
New Zealand, with additions such as feeling not as themselves, reduction in positive feelings,
caring less about others and suicidality (Read, Cartwright & Gibson, 2014).
Side effects of AD treatment are suggested to be elevated when anxiety is present in
depression (Fava et al., 2008; Ionescu et al., 2014). There is again limited earlier research on
side effects in AD treatments for depression and anxiety symptom comorbidity, where most
studies have instead focused on anxiety disorders rather than symptoms (Hung et al., 2020).
A study by Shankman et al. (2017) examined whether depressed patients with comorbid
panic disorder experienced more side effects than those without panic disorder. The study
suggested a higher frequency of side effects reported in the group with comorbidity.
Moreover, researchers have begun looking into the term anxious depression which is
in broad terms defined as high levels of anxiety (≥ 7score on HAM-D) within depression
(Ionescu et al., 2013). It has been suggested that it affects up to 50% of patients with
depression (Fava et al., 2008). A review on AD treatment on anxious depression found that
these patients were at a greater risk for side effect burden (Ionescu et al., 2014). An earlier
study by Fava et al. (2008) found similar results where patients with anxious depression
reported higher frequency, intensity, and burden of side effects. They also reported
significantly more serious adverse events.
1.5 Publication bias of AD treatment efficacy and side effects
It has been argued that publication bias has resulted in an overestimation of AD
treatment efficacy and underestimation of its side effects. This is often explained as being
linked to financial conflicts of interest as it is assumed that most clinical trials are sponsored
by the medical industry (Ebrahim et al., 2016; Fava et al., 2016). According to Turner et al.
(2008), 94% of the published literature on AD medication were positive findings, whereas
only half of all trials had positive results on the pre-registered primary outcome, i.e. negative
trials were not published. Clinical trials are also argued to underreport side effects (Bet et al.,
2013; Popovic et al., 2014) or not assess them appropriately (Rief et al., 2009). The reported
AD treatment trials also mainly examine short-term use (6-8 weeks), while the limited
published long-term trials are between 6-12 months use which is still shorter than the general
length of time for AD treatment (Bet et al., 2013; Ferguson, 2001). It has also been argued
that there is limited use of objective measures of side effects in the published studies
(Gartlehner et al., 2008).

10

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
1.6 The present study
The general aim of the study was to elucidate the association between anxiety
symptoms and antidepressant treatment. First, the association of AD treatment and anxiety
symptom levels were of interest. The study by Cha et al. (2018) assessed anxiety symptoms
during AD treatment but lacked a depressed group not under AD treatment to compare with.
The current study aimed to fill that gap by comparing the anxiety symptom levels of
depressed patients using and not using AD. Hence, based on previous research (e.g. Lyndon
et al., 2019; Nelson et al., 2005), it was expected that depressed individuals would be more
likely to have lower levels of anxiety symptoms following any type of AD treatment, in
comparison to depressed individuals not under AD treatment.
The second aim of the study was to explore the associations between anxiety
symptom levels and AD side effects. Based on limited previous research, it has been
suggested that there is a higher likelihood of experiencing more side effects from AD
treatment when the patient has higher anxiety (Fava et al., 2008; Ionescu et al., 2014). Thus,
in the current study, it was expected that within the group of depressed individuals under AD
treatment, higher levels of anxiety levels would be associated with more severe side effects of
AD.

Method
The data collection was a part of a study project at Åbo Akademi called Depression
Treatments and Cognitive functions (DETRECO). It was conducted between 2015 and 2017,
with ethical permission by the Board of Ethics at the Department of Psychology at Åbo
Akademi University. The primary aim of the DETRECO was to investigate depression and
cognitive functions.
2.1 Participants
The original data set had 491 respondents. 105 respondents were excluded due to not
indicating depressive symptoms or incompletion of the survey. The majority who
discontinued the survey stopped very early on, thus drop-out analyses on specific features of
these participants would not have yielded any meaningful results as e.g. demographic
information was missing from many of the drop-outs.

11

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
The current study initially included 386 individuals. Some respondents (n = 60)
reported that while they were not currently using ADs, they had used AD previously, these
respondents were excluded from analyses. This resulted in two AD groups, one currently
under AD treatment (n = 137) and one which had never had AD treatment (n = 189), in total
326 respondents. These respondents had completed the full survey and indicated subjective
experience or a diagnosis of depressive symptoms. A few respondents (n = 4) were above the
age limit (55 years) of the study, but they were included in the analysis as cognitive outcome
was not the focus in the present study (the age-limit in DETRECO was set at 55 years in
order to ensure that no participants with preclinical dementing syndromes would be
included).
Respondents were between 18-63 years old (M = 28.66, SD = 9.02). There was a
statistical significant difference in age between those who never had AD treatment (M =
25.70, SD = 6.17) and those who were using AD treatment (M = 32.74, SD = 10.63),
t(201.92) = -6.96, p < .001, d = 0.81. There were 65 males, 250 females, 5 transgender
respondents and 6 responded “other” in total and included in the main analyses. Analysing
gender distribution as a dichotomous variable (female/male) showed that there was a
significant difference between the AD users and non-users, χ2(1, N = 315) = 5.96, p = .015.
There was a slight overrepresentation of females in the AD user group (81%) compared to
females in the AD non-user group (73%). No differences between the AD users and nonusers were observed in depression severity as measured by QIDS-SR, t(377) = -.537, p
= .592, d = 0.002 or levels of education, t(324) = .75, p = .457, d = 0.09. There was a
significant difference in depression duration between the AD users and non-users, as longer
depression duration (≥5 years) was more frequent among the AD users, χ2(1 N = 311) =
20.18, p <.001. Polypharmacy was also relatively frequent, 45% of AD users reported having
at least one other psychotropic medication. Demographics data are shown in Table 1.

most common were other antidepressants, benzodiazepines, sleeping pills, anxiolytics and
antipsychotics.

2.2 Procedure
Utilising convenience sampling, participants were recruited through advertisements at
various health care centres in Finland, internal recruitment adverts at Åbo Akademi
University, at the Student Health Care Unit in Turku, along with social media (e.g.
Facebook). The study was conducted online using SOILE, a testing platform developed by
Brain Train Research Centre of Excellence at the Department of Psychology, Åbo Akademi
University.
DETRECO included a survey and a working memory test, all in Finnish. The survey
included questions and questionnaires on demographics, functional ability, physical health,
coping skills, personality, subjective cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, medication,
other treatments, and causes of depression. The study could be completed at any computer
available for the participant, however preferably at home, and took approximately one hour to
complete. Participants were asked to only participate if they were between the ages of 18-55
years and had subjective or diagnosed symptoms of depression.
2.3 Instruments
With its extensive set of questions, the DETRECO survey provided the current study
with data on demographics, depression severity, anxiety symptoms levels, and questions on

14

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
depression such as duration, AD treatment and its side effects. The demographics obtained
were age, gender, and educational level.
Three self-assessment scales were used. One was the Quick Inventory of Depressive
Symptomatology 16 items (QIDS-SR (16); Rush et al., 2003; Appendix A) which measures
depression severity. Each item was scored on a scale of 0-3 with varying responses gradually
increasing in severity in each item. The severity of depression was regarded as 0-5: none, 610: mild, 11-15: moderate, 16-20: severe and 21-27: very severe.
The second self-assessment scale was the six-item short-form of the state anxiety
scale Spielberger State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6; Marteau & Bekker, 1992; Appendix
B). The items encompass three anxiety-present (nervous, upset and worried) and three
anxiety-absent (calm, relaxed and satisfied) questions. They were rated on a scale from 1 (Not
at all) to 4 (A lot). This shorter version was selected to limit the length of the already
extensive DETRECO survey. Originally with 40 items, the six-item form gained an
acceptable reliability coefficient of α = 82, the items were highly correlated, r = .91, and
produced scores similar to full-form, t(22) = .96, p = .35 (Marteau et al., 1992). In the present
study, positive STAI items were reversed so that a larger score indicated more anxiety
symptoms, and therefore a sum score of the responses on all six items was calculated.
Consequently, the range of the summative score was 4-24.
The third questionnaire was a 20-item questionnaire on benefits and adverse effects of
AD treatment developed by Read, Cartwright and Gibson (2014; Appendix C). It included
both physical and psychological side effects and a response scale ranging from 1 (“Not at
all”) to 4 (“Difficult/A lot”). An exploratory factor analysis on this data was conducted by
Sjöberg (2017), exploring potential underlying factors and mean scores for each factor. The
Principal Axis Factor (PAF) with an Oblique rotation was utilised in the analyses to allow
factors to correlate. Out of the 20 items, seven factors were extracted with loadings over .3,
explaining 45.77% of the total variance. Two of the side effects items had loadings less
than .3 (diarrhoea and headache). Based on the Cronbach's Alpha, four side effect factors or,
as Sjöberg called them, clusters, were left with enough reliability. These were later
investigated and analysed in the current study. More information on the factor loadings can
be found in Sjöberg (2017).
Moreover, a question investigating duration of depression was included (“How long
have you been depressed?”) with response options on a seven-point scale varying from
“under a year”, “1-2 years”, “3-4 years” and so on up to “more than 10 years”. Checking the
distribution of depression duration amongst the participants showed a bimodal distribution,
15

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
with peaks at “1-2 years” and “over 10 years” of depression. Thus, to ease the interpretation
of results and control for depression duration in the main analysis, the variable was
transformed to having two levels: "0-4 years” and “5 years and more”.
Usage of AD treatment was tapped with one question (“Do you use antidepressant
medication?”) and provided participants with four response options (“Yes”, “Never”, “Yes,
but not anymore”, and “I have a prescription but have not used it”).

2.4 Study design and data analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0 for Windows
(IBM Corp., 2019). In all analyses, alpha level was set to p <.05.
Addressing the first study questions, with a between-subjects design, the aim was to
compare anxiety levels between those who were vs. were not under AD treatment. A
univariate 2 x 2 ANCOVA was conducted to examine effects of antidepressant use (yes/no)
and duration of depression (</> 5 years), as independent variables (IV), on anxiety levels as
the dependent variable (DV). Age was used as a covariate to control for possible confounds
as there was a statistically significant difference in age between the AD users and non-users.
It was first expected that there would be a main effect of antidepressant use so that the group
currently under AD treatment would report lower levels of anxiety compared to the group
which never had AD treatment. It was also expected that there would be no main effect of
duration of depression on anxiety levels. A follow-up 2x 2 ANOVA examining the effect of
antidepressant use (yes/no) and duration of depression (</> 5 years) with a subset of
participants who were 30 years or younger, without using age as a covariate, was run as a
secondary control for age-confounding.
It was also expected that within the group currently under AD treatment, anxiety
levels would be associated with side effects reported, and the higher anxiety levels would be
related to higher side effects burden. Here, anxiety level was again the DV to be predicted by
four IVs, which were side effect factors from the DETRECO-based study by Sjöberg (2017).
These were: Estrangement, Sexual, Dependency/Abstinence and Physical side effects. Thus,
to address the second study question, four hierarchical regression analyses were conducted
for each of the four side effect mean scores in the subset of the sample who were using
antidepressants (n = 137). In step one, age and depression severity (QIDS-SR) were entered

16

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
as predictors and in step two, anxiety level (STAI-6) was added as a third predictor. Other
variables controlled for all the analyses were gender and educational level.
Results
3.1 Differences in anxiety symptom levels between participants with and without AD
treatment
A two-way ANCOVA was run, controlling for age as a covariate, anxiety as a DV,
and antidepressant treatment (AD users vs. non-users) and duration of depression (0-4 years
vs. 5 or more years) as IV. The main effect of antidepressant treatment on anxiety levels did
not reach the level of statistical significance, F(1,305) = 3.48, p = .063, ηp2 = .011, but the
mean anxiety symptom level was higher in non-users. No significant main effect of
depression duration (0-4 years vs ≥5 years) on anxiety levels were found, F(1,305) = .23, p
= .635, ηp2 = .001. No statistically significant interaction between antidepressant treatment
and duration of depression on anxiety levels was found, F(1,305) = 1.80, p = .18, ηp2 = .006.
However, a significant main effect of the covariate age was found, F(1,305) = 8.82, p < .003,
ηp2 = .028, as older age was associated with lower anxiety. The results are shown in Figure 1.

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS

As the group which was under antidepressant treatment was significantly older than
the group not under antidepressant treatment, a follow-up analysis was run to control for the
age confound. When excluding older (<30 years) participants, the difference in age between
the AD users (n = 70, M = 16,09, SD = 3.70) and non-users (n = 162, M = 16.77, SD = 3.06)
was no longer statistically significant, t(230) = -1.65, p = .099, d = 0.20. A 2 x 2 ANOVA
was carried out with again anxiety as the DV, and duration of depression and antidepressant
treatment as IVs. No main effect of antidepressant treatment was found, F(1,204) = 2.33, p
= .128, ηp2 = .011 and the interaction between antidepressant treatment and depression
duration was also not significant, F(1,204) = 3.29, p = .071, ηp2 = .016. However the main
effect of depression duration reached the level of statistical significance , F(1,204) = 3.93, p
= .049, ηp2 = .019, as the mean anxiety level was slightly higher in those with longer
depression duration (M = 16.93, SD = 3.35) than those with shorter depression duration (M =
15.94, SD = 3.28). This is graphically depicted in Figure 2.

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
Gender could not be included as a between-groups factor in the main analysis due to
very unequal group sizes, but a one-way between-subjects ANOVA was conducted to
examine possible difference between the groups (women, men, transgender, other). No
statistically significant difference was found, F(3,380) = .59, p = .62, although the mean
STAI-6-value was highest for the transgender group (M = 17.00, SD = 3.10), and men (M =
16.38, SD = 3.50) had a higher anxiety symptom mean than women (M = 15.99, SD = 3.44).
3.2 Do anxiety symptom levels predict perceived side-effects of AD treatment?
Investigating the cohort under AD treatment, a previous factor analytic study in the
DETRECO data by Sjöberg (2017) found that the side effects cluster into four factors (see
more in “Instrument”). These factors, with acceptable levels of Cronbach’s alpha, were
labelled as “Estrangement” (α = .71), “Sexual side effects” (α = .84),
“Dependency/Abstinence” (α = .67), and “Physical side effects” (α = .53). However, due to
an earlier coding error, the physical side effects factor was missing a considerable amount of
responses on the item “restlessness”. This item was therefore removed in the current study.
The items for each factor can be found in Table 2.
Since the sample size had increased after the study by Sjöberg was conducted, a new
reliability analysis on the factor mean scores was conducted with the final DETRECO sample
completed in 2017. The reliability of the factor mean scores was now even more satisfactory
than in the original study: Estrangement α = .92, Sexual side effects α = .95,
Dependency/Abstinence α = .91, and the new Physical side effects factor α = .89. Spearman’s
rho correlation tests were run for age, depression severity (QIDS-SR) and anxiety levels
(STAI-6) with each side effect factor. These can be found in Table 3.

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS

Several hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted, one for each side effect
factor. Every analysis had two stages, with the side effect factor as the DV. Age and
depression severity (QIDS-SR) were entered at stage one and anxiety level was entered at
stage two of the regression. The variables were entered in this order as it was assumed that
the physiology of ageing affects the metabolism of pharmaceuticals, and depression severity
needs to be controlled for before exploring anxiety as it was the variable of interest.
In the estrangement side effect factor, the hierarchical multiple regression revealed
that at stage one, age and depression severity contributed significantly to the regression
model as a block, F(2,131) = 11.30, p <.001. However, it was the depression severity alone in
this block which contributed significantly, accounting for 14.7% of the variation of
estrangement side effects. Introducing the anxiety variable in step two explained an
additional 0.1% of the variance in this side effect, but no significance as a block. These
regression statistics are reported in Table 4.
In sexual side effects, the hierarchical multiple regression did not reveal any
significant contribution of age and depression severity in the first step. However, when
introducing the anxiety variable in step two, a significant contribution of anxiety on the
variance was revealed, F(3,130) = 3.52, p = .017, accounting for 6.6% of the variance in
sexual side effects. The relationship was negative, suggesting that the more sexual side
effects experienced, the less anxiety experienced. This can be found reported in Table 5.
In the dependency/abstinence side effects factor no variable significantly contributed
to the variance. Find this in Table 6.
Lastly, in the case of the physical side effects factor, the hierarchical multiple
regression revealed that at stage one, age and depression severity contributed significantly to
the regression model as a block, F(2,131) = 7.81, p <.001. However, it was again the
depression severity alone in this block which contributed significantly, accounting for 9.3%
of the variation. The regression statistics are reported in Table 7.

Discussion
The present study sought to first elucidate the association between antidepressant
treatment and anxiety symptoms. It was expected that anxiety symptoms levels would be
higher in AD non-users compared to AD users. The study did also aim to investigate possible
associations between anxiety symptoms and AD side effects. Based on limited previous
studies, higher levels of anxiety symptoms were expected to be associated with more severe
AD side effects.
4.1 Anxiety, antidepressants, and age
In this data from the DETRECO project, a trend level difference in anxiety levels was
found between AD users and AD non-users, but the effect was confounded by age, as ADusers were significantly older than the non-users. Age was, in fact, the only variable that had
a statistically significant effect on anxiety symptoms, as older participants (irrespective of
AD use) reported lower levels of anxiety symptoms. Secondary follow-up analyses which
included only participants under the age of 30, hence matching the AD users and non-users at
group level for age, showed no main effect of treatment on anxiety symptoms. Thus, the
expected results of participants with AD treatment having significantly lower anxiety levels
than those not using ADs was not found.
One possible explanation for the discrepancy between the results in the present study
and those of previous studies is that anxiolytic effects may be specific to some ADs (Graeff

24

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
& Zangrossi, 2010; Lyndon et al., 2019). In the present study all AD-users were pooled
together, irrespective of the specific type of AD, while both earlier studies by Nelson et al.
(2005) and Cha et al. (2018) examined the effects of specific ADs. As various ADs have
shown to have different effects on anxiety, and not controlling for type might have evened
out the anxiolytic effects in the current study. SSRIs have been found to have a better
response rate than bupropion for depressed patients with anxiety (Papakostas et al., 2008).
Certain types of ADs are even approved for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Venlafaxine
extended-release has shown efficacy for anxiety disorder (Rickels, Pollack, Sheehan &
Haskins, 2000; Davidson, DuPont, Hedges & Haskins, 1999) and has been approved for the
treatment of generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder and panic disorder, when
comorbid with depression (Effexor XR [package insert], 2017 as cited in Lyndon et al.,
2019). On the other hand, some types of ADs have been suggested to have the opposite effect
(e.g. Baldwin et al., 2005; Toni et al., 2000).
The lack of a group effect of AD use on anxiety symptoms may also be due to not
controlling anxiety levels reported with a cut-off point and possibly dividing participants into
e.g. high anxiety and low anxiety groups in the current study. Previous studies have shown
that anxiolytic effects of some ADs may be more likely to be present in those with very high
anxiety levels. The previous study by Lyndon et al., (2019) suggested that depressed patients
with higher anxiety levels had a significantly greater reduction of anxiety symptoms
compared to those with low levels of anxiety. Therefore, in the current study a larger portion
of participants may have had milder anxiety symptoms and thus an association between
anxiety and AD-use might have been more difficult to find.
In the present study, almost half of the AD users reported polypharmacy, i.e. having at
least one other psychotropic medication (often another type of antidepressant or a
benzodiazepine); a common phenomenon in AD users (Dold et al., 2018; Kukreja, Kalra,
Shah & Shrivastava, 2013). The effect of polypharmacy would, however, be more likely to
reduce than increase the anxiety levels in the AD users groups. Benzodiazepines (and
antipsychotics) are often used for their anxiolytic and sedative effects and thus it seems
unlikely that polypharmacy would explain the lack of a difference in anxiety levels between
AD users and non-users.
Another possible reason for differing results is that most studies showing anxiolytic
effects of AD have been short-term studies (6-8 weeks), while long-term use currently, in
fact, is the norm (Bet et al., 2013; Ferguson, 2001). In the present study, 43% had used AD

25

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
for 5 years or more, thus it is possible that anxiolytic effects may decrease with longer usage
which perhaps gives an insight to anxiety levels changes in a naturalistic setting.
Age was a significant covariate in the main analysis in the current study; older age
was associated with lower levels of anxiety. Anxiety decreasing with age has frequently been
found in other studies. In personality research, a very high correlation between one of the big
five traits, neuroticism, and anxiety has been found (Twenge, 2000, as cited in Twenge,
2000.). Neuroticism has consistently been found to decrease with age (McCrae et al., 1999;
Srivastava, John, Gosling & Potter, 2003), with an evident decrease in almost every year of
life (Scollon & Diener, 2006). In a recent study by Jensen, Kirkegaard, O’Connor and
Mehlsen (2019), when older participants were asked to describe chapters and memories of
their lives, they described them in a more positive light and scored lower on neuroticism
compared to both young and middle-aged participants. Age was the strongest predictor for
neuroticism which also enhanced their subjective well-being. There are also suggestions of a
reduction of intrinsic susceptibility to anxiety and depression in association with ageing,
which might be related to increased emotional regulation and so called psychological
immunization to stressful experiences (Jorm, 2000). The fact that anxiety typically lessens as
one gets older would be useful to communicate during treatment to young people suffering
from anxiety. Psychoeducation about anxiety to patients formally diagnosed with anxiety
disorders improved the quality of life and decreased psychological distress over time
(Rodrigues, Bártolo, Pacheco, Pereira, Silva & Oliveira, 2018). Thus patients under ADtreatment should also be informed about the decreased prevalence of anxiety with ageing and
what cognitive mindsets to practice.
On another note, although the number of participants reporting as transgender or
“other” was very low, and statistical comparisons could not reliably be conducted, it should
be noted that people identifying as transgender in the current sample reported very high levels
of anxiety. Although the relatively low prevalence of transgender individuals has likewise
kept samples small in other studies (Bouman, Claes, Brewin, Crawford, Millet & Arcelus,
2016), similar findings have been reported. A study on 913 individuals self-identified as
transgender, found that they had an almost threefold risk of developing an anxiety disorder
compared to the general population. Anxiety was associated with low self-esteem and
interpersonal functioning. Similarly, higher levels of anxiety in transgender samples in
comparison to the general population have been found in a systematic review in 2016 (Millet,
Longworth & Arcelus, 2016).

26

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
The gender distribution in the present study was not balanced, thus limiting the
analysis of gender differences, and in contrast with the previous studies, men reported higher
levels of anxiety than women. According to the OECD (2018), anxiety, depressive and
bipolar disorder are more common amongst women. In studies, women are often found to
have significantly more anxiety symptoms (Gao, Ping & Liu, 2020) and/or be more prone to
anxious depression (Fava et al., 2006), compared to men. However, there are studies which
have found contrasting results where men might manifest more (e.g. Kalsoom, 2020) or as
much (e.g. Peterson, Newton & Feingold, 2007) anxiety as women when both are in a more
vulnerable health condition.
The significant difference in age between AD users and non-users was unfortunate as
this made it impossible to entangle the effects of age and depression duration on anxiety in
the two groups. Duration of depression naturally correlates with age as a younger individual
will simply not have had the time to be depressed for the same amount of time as an older
individual. However, a long-term study followed 49 patients diagnosed with depression over
25 years. After 25 years, only 12% had recovered and remained in remission, while 84% had
recurrent episodes of depression, 2% had unremitting depression and 2% had committed
suicide. Thus, the authors concluded that at least severe depression seemed to have poor longterm outcomes and also the older the individuals were, the longer they had been depressed
(Brodaty, Luscombe, Peisah & Anstey, 2001).
4.2 Side effects of AD treatment and anxiety levels
The second aim of the study was to explore the association between side effects and
anxiety levels, using side effects factors stemming from Sjöberg (2017). Contrary to
expectations, higher anxiety levels were not associated with more severe side effects in any
of the four side effects factors studied: Estrangement, Sexual, Dependence/Abstinence or
Physical side effects. Rather counterintuitively, lower anxiety was related to more severe
sexual side effects. There are various possible explanations for this finding. Sexual
dysfunction and anxiety symptoms are generally two of the top priorities to avoid when
prescribing AD (Zimmerman et al., 2004). However that does not mean that they are
mutually prioritised and it could be that clinicians end up prioritizing one over the other, as
both might not be easy to meet. Sexual side effects have also been suggested to be frequently
ignored. Both clinicians and patients in Asia regard sexual side effects as a “forbidden topic”
(Chen et al., 2008, p. E57), and spontaneous reporting of sexual dysfunctions are less

27

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
frequent also according to studies in Western societies (Ottosson, 2018). When overtly and
directly assessed, sexual side effects are reported 55% of the time, whereas when left
spontaneous to report by patient, it decreases to 2-7% (Ferguson, 2001).
A possible explanation is that anxiety might lead to lower sexual activity and sexual
side effects might thus be left undiscovered. According to Barlow’s model (1986), it is
hypothesized that anxiety distracts attention from erotic cues and in turn reduces or impedes
the sexual arousal or sexual activity in general. And Wolpe (1958, as cited in Kane, Dawson,
Shaughnessy, Reissing, Ouimet & Ashbaugh, 2019) proposed that sexual arousal and anxiety
might be mutually inhibitory as they are of opposing nervous system activations. Sexual
arousal being activated by parasympathetic activation and anxious arousal by sympathetic
activation. Likewise, social anxiety has been suggested to have a negative correlation with
the amount of sexual contact, in women (but not in men; Kashdan, Adams, Savostyanova,
Ferssizidis, McKnight & Nezlek, 2011), thus potentially decreasing sexual contact and in
turn, decreasing the likelihood of experiencing sexual side effects. Nonetheless, recognition
and patients’ education of both anxiety and sexual side effects are imperative, and caution
should be taken when describing ADs when earlier issues with sexual side effects are known.
Although not a focus in the current study, depression severity in the current sample
predicted both estrangement and physical side effects. This is in line with earlier studies
mentioned (Fava et al., 2008; Ionescu et al., 2014; Shankman et al.,2017), the greater
depression severity, the more side effects are suggested to be experienced. The number of
side effects is argued to increase with higher depression severity. Bet et al., (2013) conducted
a naturalistic study on a large cohort of patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders.
They found that on average, 2.9 side effects were reported in 64% of the patients in long-term
AD treatment. Physical side effects have earlier also been suggested to relate to depression
severity as depressed patients might have a higher attentiveness to physical discomfort (Bet et
al., 2013 & Klauenberg et al., 2008)
Neither age, depression severity nor anxiety was related to dependency/abstinence
side effects. Nevertheless, to properly examine these variables would require that respondents
have at some point tried to stop or be remitted from AD treatment (Fava et al., 2015). Yet, the
respondents who were not currently under AD treatment, but had been in the past, were
omitted from the current sample. And therefore, valuable data for these side effects might
have been lost with them. Thus, an extension of this study looking into that cohort could be
worth investigating.

28

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
Despite earlier studies finding anxiety symptoms having a detrimental and increasing
effect on AD treatment side effects, the current study did not find supporting results.
Nonetheless, lesser sexual side effects were found with higher anxiety symptom levels which
is intriguing and calls for more controlled studies.
4.3 Strengths and limitations
The strength of this study is mainly the relatively large dataset from the DETRECO
project which allowed wide explorations of demographic, clinical variables and relationships
of a big Finnish sample. Being able to utilise the data and complement Sjöberg’s (2017) study
with even higher reliability in data, is also a potential strength. It is suggested that there is
limited literature on AD treatment in older cohorts as they are excluded due to presence of
confounding comorbidities or concomitant medication (Mittman et al., 1997), and instead,
treatment recommendations are often extrapolated from younger patients. The current study
included respondents up to 63 years old and therefore, making an important contribution to
the literature.
There are also several limitations to the current study. The study used a convenience
sample which entails a significant risk of selection bias. The sample may not be
representative of the population of people suffering from depression. Since usage of AD
treatment has previously been shown to be very frequent, it puts doubt on the representability
of the current sample as the majority were not AD users. Moreover, for analysing effects of
AD on anxiety levels a placebo-controlled randomized trial would be the gold standard,
although these trials can typically only examine effects over the short term (6-8 weeks).
Examining effects over the long term can typically only be conducted using naturalistic
follow-up designs. Also, the study had a cross-sectional design, while a longitudinal design
would allow for examining changes in anxiety levels over time in both AD users and nonusers.
A female majority, with four times more females than men in the sample might have
affected the results. Some side effects such as weight gain have been found to be associated
with the female gender (Bet et al., 2013) even though weight change was not a side effect
investigated in the present study.
The low number of items in the STAI-6 assessment forced a summation of the anxiety
measure in the current study. The potential of extracting specific information from the
individual items was lost (e.g. “I feel calm” vs. “I feel nervous”) and might be a limitation of

29

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
the study. However, the summation gave the analysis higher reliability and more power.
Another potential limitation to the utilisation of STAI-6 is that there are currently no studies,
at least known to the author, which has investigated the cut-off points for clinical anxiety or
generally expected anxiety level of healthy controls when using STAI-6. Thus, if all the
current studies participants’ anxiety levels were not at a clinical level, perhaps seeing
differences between the AD users and non-users would not have been possible anyway.
Another limitation to the data was the earlier coding error of the side effect of
“restlessness” which required omittance of this item from the physical side effect factor.
Using self-report also has some weaknesses which entails among others, the issues of
social desirability, comprehension of questions posed (Del Boca & Noll, 2000; Kwon et al.,
2003), sampling bias etc. Moreover, since this was a sample of potentially depressed
individuals there might have been a higher risk of fatigue and incompletion of questionnaires.
Those who did not complete the survey might have been respondents with the highest
depression severity (Luyten, Kempke, Van Wambeke, Claes, Blatt & Van Housenhove,
2011). Moderate to severe depression has been found in 70% of patients diagnosed with
chronic fatigue syndrome (Walker, Lindner & Noonan, 2009). Therefore, to decrease the risk
of missing out on these respondents, making self-reports as short and concise as possible for
this particular population might be something to consider for future studies.
4.4 Future research and implications
The current study can be extended by matching the groups of AD-users and non-users
on factors such as age and gender in a randomised trial with a longitudinal design. In this
way, state-anxiety differences could be investigated in a more controlled study allowing
examination of potential changes in anxiety levels over time. Moreover, the current study
utilises correlational statistical analysis in examining anxiety levels and AD-use vs. non-use.
However, comparing groups, e.g. low- and high-anxiety, could be more fruitful and has been
done in earlier studies by Ionescu et al., (2014) and Fava et al., (2008). It would also be
interesting to investigate possible differences between those solely using an antidepressant
compared to those using more psychotropic treatments (polypharmacy).
The present study could be further extended by investigating sexual side effects and
its negative relationship with anxiety levels more in detail. Earlier hypotheses point in two
different directions (Kane et al., 2019) of anxiety increasing or decreasing sexual activity and

30

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
response. And since sexual side effects and anxiety are two of the most considered side
effects in AD choice, a better insight would support or reject the current widespread practice.
Two other aspects worth examining is within the interplay of age and AD treatment.
One is examining the efficiency of AD treatment in different age cohorts, and investigating
possible factors which might associate with experienced anxiety and AD treatment. The other
aspect could be examining subjective motivation of patients of different ages in using AD
treatment and how that could be related to subjective anxiety. Nevertheless, the current study
leaves questions unanswered between the age difference of those using and not using AD
medication. And since there is a greater paucity of research into older samples, a more
controlled and clinically valid examination of this cohort should be sought after.
The findings of the current study could be applied to the clinical setting when
choosing treatment and/or psychoeducation for people suffering from depression and anxiety.
The present study suggests that AD, in general, might not be associated with lower or higher
anxiety levels. Lower anxiety seems to be related to more experienced sexual side effects of
AD. Therefore, anxiety symptom levels and sexual dysfunctions should be considered in
clinical guidelines for the treatment of depression, but also adapted in the choice of AD
treatment, at least when it comes to side effects. Patients should also receive psychoeducation
on the association between increasing age and lower anxiety. Moreover, greater patient
informed consent and clinicians’ recognition of anxiety symptoms and sexual side effects
should be sought after and caution in the prescription of AD should be warranted (Andrews et
al., 2012).
4.5 Conclusion
The present study did not find a difference in anxiety levels between depressed
individuals under antidepressant treatment vs. those not under antidepressant treatment.
Instead, age was found to correlate with anxiety levels which already has wide support in the
literature. Previous studies showing anxiety alleviating effects of AD have mostly been shortterm clinical trials. Possible anxiolytic effects of AD in long-term use thus clearly needs to be
studied with more controlled designs. The current study did also find that depressed
respondents who were under AD treatment were more likely to experience sexual side effects
if their anxiety levels were low. This is counterintuitive and calls for more research inquiring
about this relationship. It was also found that anxiety levels do not relate to other side effects,
in contrast with earlier suggestions of anxiety worsening the experience of side effects.

31

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
However, the side effects of dependency/abstinence might require more research and include
those respondents who have experience of AD treatment but have now gone off them.
Conclusively, as anxiety and sexual side effects have earlier shown effects on clients’ wellbeing and choice of antidepressants, the current study suggests that attention and raising
awareness to these factors are crucial in clinician's’ choice of treatment of depression.

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
Summary in Swedish - Svensk Sammanfattning
Ångestsymtom i depression: är de relaterade till antidepressiva läkemedel och läkemedlens
biverkningar?
Depression är en av världens vanligaste psykiska sjukdomar, vilket påverkade ungefär
264 miljoner människor år 2017 (GDB Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence
Collaborators, 2017). Depression har även varit den vanligaste anledningen till psykisk
ohälsa i Finland de senaste decennierna (The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
Development, 2018; OECD). Enligt den femte upplagan av Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) är
depressionssymtom bl.a. nedstämdhet, anhedoni, aptit- och sömnstörningar, kognitiv
nedsättning och känslor av hopplöshet. Ofta känner personer med depression även ångest
(Montgomery, 2019), vilket verkar vara komorbid med depression hos upp till 78% av
befolkningen som har depression (Gaspersz, Nawijn, Lamers & Penninx, 2018).
Den vanligaste behandlingen för depression i världen och Finland är antidepressiva
(AD) läkemedel (Honkonen, Aro, Isometsä, Virtanen & Katila, 2007; National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence, 2004). Selektiva hämmare av serotoninåterupptag (SSRIs) är
den vanligaste typen av AD (Ottosson, 2018). Långtidsanvändningen av AD (över fem år)
har ökat sedan 1994 både i världen (Lockhart & Guthrie, 2011; Moore et al., 2009) och i
Finland (Sihvo et al., 2010). Forskning stöder även effektiviteten av antidepressiva hos
patienter med depression och ångest (e.g. Lyndon, Prieto, Wajsbrot, Allgulander &
Bandelow, 2019). Trots ADs popularitet är det vanligt att biverkningar uppstår vid ADbehandling (Ottosson, 2018) vilket försvåras när depression ackompanjeras av ångest
(Ionsescu, Niciu, Richards & Zarate, 2014). Syftet med denna avhandling är att närmare
undersöka ångestsymtom i depression och om ångestsymtom varierar beroende på ADbehandling. Även en undersökning av potentiella associationer mellan ångestsymtom och
biverkningar av AD utförs.
Ångestsymtom (state-anxiety) definieras som den subjektiva upplevelsen av ett stort
hot mot ens person. Den uppstår som en reaktion av ett resultat av anlag för ångest och
stressiga omständigheter. Anlag för ångest i denna mening syftar på den ångest som även
finns som en del av vår personlighet (trait-anxiety; Derakshan & Eysenck, 2009; Eysenck,
1992). Det förstnämnda ångestsymtomet präglas av starka känslor av oro och rädsla och är
den sortens ångest som är i fokus i denna studie. Mellan 42-80% av vuxna med depression
har ångestsymtom på klinisk nivå (Gaspersz et al., 2018; Lyche, Jonassen, Stiles, Ulleberg &
43

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
Landrø, 2010; Zimmerman et al., 2000) men ofta utesluts dessa patienter från urval i kliniska
studier just på grund av svårigheterna med att studera patienter med denna komorbiditet
(Zimmerman, McDermus & Mattia, 2000).
Depression med ångestsymtom har påvisats vara svårbehandlat (Gaspersz et al., 2018)
och vara associerat med högre risk för självmord (Allgulander, 2000, as cited in Lyndon et
al., 2019). Jämfört med patienter med endast depression har patienter med komorbid
ångestsymtom svårare depression, högre depression kronicitet, större psykosociala
utmaningar, ökad risk för återfall (Altamura, Montresor, Salvadori & Mundo, 2004; Fava et
al., 2006; Lyche et al., 2010; Weiss et al., 2016; Wiethoff et al., 2010) och minskad
livskvalitet (Gaspersz et al., 2018; Ionescu et al., 2013).
Antidepressiva läkemedel hävdas också ha ångestdämpande effekter (Ottosson, 2018).
En metaanalys av randomiserade placebo-studier fann en signifikant minskning av
ångestsymtom efter AD-behandling (Nelson, Portera & Leon, 2005). En studie av Cha et al.
(2018) jämförde deprimerade personer som fick AD-behandling med en kontrollgrupp som
inte var deprimerad. Cha och hens kollegors resultat visade att ångesten hos de deprimerade
var signifikant mycket lägre efter AD-behandling jämfört med kontrollgruppen. Ytterligare
en metaanalys av Lyndon et al. (2019) undersökte patienter med depression där de delades in
i antingen låg eller hög ångestsymtom innan AD-behandling (6-12 veckor). De fann två
positiva utfall: (1) både den låga och höga ångest-gruppen hade signifikant mindre ångest än
placebo och (2) gruppen med hög ångest hade signifikant större lindring i ångest än gruppen
med låg ångest.
Det finns dock nackdelar med AD-behandling då flera olika sorters biverkningar har
rapporterats. Fysiska biverkningar inkluderar abstinensbesvär, sexuella dysfunktioner och
viktökning (Cartwright, Gibson, Read, Cowan & Denhar, 2016). Kognitiva biverkningar
inkluderar utmattning, minnesproblem och koncentrationssvårigheter (Popovic et al., 2015).
Andra biverkningar från en studie i Nya Zeeland på långtidsanvändande av AD hos 1829
vuxna rapporterade minskning i positiva känslor, likgiltighet till andra och självmordstankar
(Read, Cartwright & Gibson, 2014). Dessa biverkningar kan förvärras när ångestsymtom är
närvarande i depression (Fava et al., 2008; Ionescu et al., 2014) men det finns begränsat med
studier inom detta fält då forskare har tenderat att fokusera på ångeststörningar istället för
endast ångestsymtom (Hung et al., 2020).
En annan eventuell nackdel med AD-behandling är att vissa forskare hävdar att det
finns en publiceringsbias som resulterat i en överskattning av AD-behandlingen effektivitet
och en underskattning av dess biverkningar. Detta förklaras oftast vara relaterat till finansiella
44

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
anledningar då många kliniska studier är sponsrade av läkemedelsindustrin (Ebrahim et al.,
2016; Fava et al., 2016). De studier som finns publicerade kritiseras för att bara undersöka
korttidsanvändning (6-8 veckor) av AD som sällan kan appliceras till verklighetens norm av
AD-användning (Bet et al., 2013; Ferguson, 2001). Utgivarna av studier kritiseras även för att
generellt publicera studier som inte använder tillräckligt objektiva mätinstrument för
undersökning av biverkningar i AD (Gartlehner et al., 2008).
Studiens syfte
Syftet med denna studie var att utforska associationen mellan ångestsymtom och
antidepressiv behandling. Den första målsättningen var att undersöka AD-behandlingens
påverkan på ångestsymtom. I tidigare studie av Cha et al. (2018) mättes ångestsymtom under
AD-behandling men studien jämförde deprimerade med friska personer och saknade en
deprimerad grupp som inte var på AD-behandling. Denna studie söker att fylla detta
tillkortakommande genom att jämföra ångestsymtom hos deprimerade individer som
behandlas eller inte behandlas med AD-behandling. Baserat på tidigare forskning (t.ex.
Lyndon et al., 2019; Nelson et al., 2005) förväntas deprimerade individer uppleva mindre
ångestsymtom efter AD-behandling än deprimerade individer som inte genomgått ADbehandling.
Den andra målsättningen var att undersöka associationen mellan ångestsymtom och
biverkningar från AD-behandling. Baserat på tidigare begränsad forskning förväntas det att
biverkningar upplevs i högre grad ju mer ångestsymtom individen upplever (Fava et al.,
2008; Ionescu et al., 2014). Specifikt i denna studie förväntas det att inom AD-gruppen
upplevas mer biverkningar ju högre ångestsymtom som upplevs.

Metod
Datainsamlingen var en del av ett större projekt vid Åbo Akademi vid namnet
Depressionsbehandling och kognitiva funktioner (DETRECO). Med godkännande från Åbo
Akademis etiska granskningsnämnd, pågick insamlingen av enkäter mellan år 2015-2017.
Det primära syftet med DETRECO var att undersöka depression och kognitiva funktioner.
Denna studie hade initialt 386 individer. Några respondenter (n = 60) indikerade att de
tidigare använt AD men inte gör det längre. Dessa togs bort för att få en mer kontrollerad
studie. Studien hade då 326 personer i samplet indelat i två grupper: en grupp aktuella i en
AD-behandling (AD-grupp; n = 137) och en grupp som aldrig varit med i en sådan
45

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
behandling (icke-AD-grupp; n = 189). Samplet bestod av 65 män, 250 kvinnor, 5
transpersoner och 6 som identifierade sig som “annat”, alla inkluderades i huvudanalysen.
Kön analyserades senare som en dikotom variabel (man/kvinna) vilket fann att AD och ickeAD-gruppen skildes sig signifikant i kön, χ2(1, N = 315) = 5.96, p = .015. Kvinnor var en
aning överrepresenterade i AD-gruppen (81%) i jämförelse med icke-AD-gruppen (73%).
Grupperna skilde sig även signifikant i ålder då samplet var mellan 18-63 år gamla (M =
28.66, SD = 9.02). AD-gruppen (M = 32.74, SD = 10.63) var signifikant äldre än icke-ADgruppen (M = 25.70, SD = 6.17), t(201.92) = -6.96, p < .001, d = 0.81. Det fanns en skillnad
på depressionskronicitet där depression ofta varade längre (≥ 5 år) hos AD-gruppen, χ2(1 N =
311) = 20.18, p <.001. Likväl fanns inga skillnader mellan grupperna gällande
utbildningsnivå, t(324) = .75, p = .457, d = 0.09, eller depressionssvårighet (QIDS-SR),
t(377) = -.537, p = .592, d = 0.002. Polyfarmaci var också relativt vanligt. 45% av ADanvändare rapporterade minst en psykoaktiv medicinering.
Rekryteringen genomfördes som ett bekvämlighetsurval. Deltagare i enkäterna
rekryterades med hjälp av marknadsföring på olika vårdinstanser i Finland, internt genom
annonser på Åbo Akademi, på Studenthälsan i Åbo och genom sociala medier (t.ex.
Facebook). Studien gjordes online på en testplattform, SOILE, utvecklad av Brain Train
Research Centre of Excellence på Institutionen av Humaniora, Psykologi och Teologi vid
Åbo Akademi. Hela DETRECO-projektet innehöll en finskspråkig och omfattande
depressionsrelaterad undersökning och arbetsminnestest. För att delta i undersökningen
förutsätts en subjektiv upplevelse av depressionssymtom eller en diagnos av depression.
Tre självskattningsformulär från projektet har analyserats i denna studie. Den första
var Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 16 items (QIDS-SR(16); Rush et al.,
2003; Appendix A) som ämnar att mäta depressionens svårighet. Det andra
skattningsformuläret var en kortare version av state-ångest enkäten Spielberger State-trait
Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6; Marteau & Bekker, 1992; Appendix B). Den tredje skattningen
undersökte både positiva och negativa fysiska och psykiska biverkningar (Read, Cartwright
and Gibson, 2014; Appendix C). En explorativ faktoranalys av dessa biverkningar från
DETRECO projektet hade redan gjorts av Sjöberg (2017) där undersökningen av potentiella
underliggande faktorer och medelvärden gjordes. Baserat på Cronbach’s Alpha hade fyra
faktorer av biverkningar tillräckligt god reliabilitet. Dessa faktorer var senare analyserade och
utvecklade i denna studie. Mer information om faktoranalysen finns att hitta i Sjöberg (2017).
Fler frågor som användes från projektet var frågor om depressionens längd (kronicitet) och
användning av AD läkemedel.
46

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
Den statistiska analysen genomfördes med IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0 för Windows
(IBM Corp., 2019). Alla analyser hade alpha nivå på p <.05. För att analysera ångestsymtom i
AD och icke-AD-gruppen utfördes en 2 x 2 ANCOVA. Effekter av AD-behandling (ja/nej)
och depression kronicitet (</> 5 år) var oberoende variabler (OBV) medan ångestsymtom var
den beroende variabeln (BV). Ålder fungerade som kovariat för att kontrollera för eventuella
ovidkommande faktorer då det fanns en signifikant skillnad på ålder mellan grupperna. Man
förväntade sig en huvudeffekt av AD-behandling där AD-gruppen skulle rapportera lägre
nivåer av ångestsymtom än icke-AD-gruppen. Analysen upprepas en andra gång med ett
subsample av deltagare som var 30 år och yngre.
Det andra syftet med studien analyserades med hjälp av multipel hierarkisk
regressionsanalys på alla fyra biverknings-faktorer: Utanförskap, Sexuella,
Beroende/Abstinens och Fysiska biverkningar. Här undersöktes endast den gruppen som var
aktuell med AD-behandling (n = 137). Ångestsymtom var återigen BV som prediceras av de
ovan fyra biverkningar som fungerade som OBVs, baserade på Sjöbergs (2017) studie från
DETRECO-projektet. I första steget inkluderades ålder och depressionssvårighet (QIDS-SR)
som två prediktorer, medan i andra steget infördes ångestsymtom (STAI-6) som en tredje
prediktor. Andra faktorer som kontrollerades för var kön och utbildningsnivå. Det
förväntades att ångestsymtom nivåer skulle vara associerade med upplevda biverkningar,
vilket innebar ju högre ångestsymtom desto högre nivå av biverkningar.

Resultat
Skillnader i ångestsymtom nivåer hos deltagare med och utan AD-behandling
En 2 x 2 ANCOVA med ålder som kovariat, ångest som BV, och AD-behandling
(AD-användning vs. icke-AD användning) och depression kronicitet (0-4 år vs. ≥ 5 år) som
OBV genomfördes. En huvudeffekt av AD-behandling på ångestnivåer uppnådde inte
statistisk signifikans, F(1,305) = 3.48, p = .063, ηp2 = .011, men medelvärdet av
ångestsymtom var högre i icke-AD-gruppen. Depressions kronicitet (0-4 år vs ≥5 år) hade
inte heller en huvudeffekt på ångest, F(1,305) = .23, p = .635, ηp2 = .001. Som förväntat fanns
ingen interaktion mellan AD-behandling och depressions kronicitet, F(1,305) = 1.80, p = .18,
ηp2 = .006. Dock visade resultaten att ålder var en signifikant huvudeffekt, F(1,305) = 8.82, p
< .003, ηp2 = .028.

47

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
Eftersom AD-gruppen var signifikant äldre än icke-AD-gruppen, kördes en kontroll
univariat 2 x 2 ANOVA på endast deltagare som var upp till 30 år. Återigen hittades inte
någon huvudeffekt av AD-behandling, F(1,204) = 2.33, p = .128, ηp2 = .011, depression
kronicitet, F(1,204) = 3.93, p = .049, ηp2 = .019, eller interaktion mellan kronicitet och ADbehandling, F(1,204) = 3.29, p = .071, ηp2 = .016.
På grund av den obalanserade fördelningen av kön i de två grupperna avstod vi från
att använda kön som en mellangruppsvariabel i huvudanalysen. Istället genomfördes en
inspektion av eventuella skillnader i ångestsymtom mellan de olika grupperna (kvinna, man,
transperson,“annan”). Ingen signifikant statistisk skillnad hittades, F(3,380) = .59, p = .62.
Däremot är det värt att nämna att ångest var högst hos transpersoner (M = 17.00, SD = 3.10),
medan män (M = 16.38, SD = 3.50) hade högre ångest än kvinnor (M = 15.99, SD = 3.44).

Predicerar ångestsymtom upplevda biverkningar i AD-behandling?
För att inspektera biverkningar hos AD-gruppen användes tidigare resultat från
Sjöberg (2017). Sjöberg fann fyra biverkningsfaktorer som med det kompletta samplet från
2017 fick ännu högre Cronbach’s Alpha-nivåer. Dessa blev kategoriserade som
“Utanförskap” (α = .92), “Sexuella biverkningar” (α = .95), “Beroende/Abstinens” (α = .91)
och “Fysiska biverkningar” (α = .89). Det bör nämnas att på grund av ett tidigare kodningsfel
saknade Fysiska biverkningar omfattande data på frågan om “rastlöshet”. Detta item togs
därför bort från faktorn i denna studie.
En multipel hierarkisk regressionsanalys genomfördes för varje biverkningsfaktor. I
utanförskapsklustret avslöjades vid steg ett att ålder och depressionssvårighet som ett block
bidrog signifikant till regressionen, F(2,131) = 11.30, p <.001. Det var dock
depressionssvårighet som ensam variabel signifikant predicerade 14.7% av variationen i
utanförskapsklustret. När analysen sedan introducerade ångest i steg två, fanns ingen
signifikant varians från ångest som block.
Inom sexuella biverkningar fann multipel hierarkisk regressionsanalysen inga
signifikanta prediktorer från ålder och depressionssvårighet i något av blocken. När ångest
introducerades i steg två däremot, indikerade resultaten att ångest predicerade 6.6% av
variansen, F(3,130) = 3.52, p = .017. Relationen var negativ vilket föreslår att ju mer
sexuella biverkningar som upplevs, desto mindre ångestsymtom upplevs.
I analysen av fysiska biverkningar presenterades ålder och depressionssvårighet som
signifikanta bidrag till variansen som ett block i steg ett, F(2,131) = 7.81, p <.001. Men
48

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
återigen är det depressionssvårigheter som ensam faktor predicerar 9.3% av variansen i
fysiska biverkningar. Det fanns inga signifikanta prediktorer i biverkningsfaktorn
beroende/abstinens.
Diskussion
Denna avhandling hade som syfte att undersöka associationer mellan antidepressiv
behandling och ångestsymtom. Första syftet var att utvärdera om ångestsymtom är lägre hos
de som har AD-behandling än hos de som inte har AD-behandling. Det andra syftet var att
undersöka om ångestsymtom ökade risken att uppleva högre nivåer av biverkningar från ADbehandling.
Ångest, antidepressiv behandling och ålder
Från data tagen från DETRECO-projektet fann denna avhandling en skillnad i
ångestsymtom nivåer mellan de som hade AD-behandling och de som inte hade det. Dock var
denna trend påverkad av ålder då AD-gruppen var äldre än icke-AD-gruppen. Ålder var den
enda signifikanta huvudeffekt på ångestsymtom och ju äldre individerna blev ju mindre
ångestsymtom verkade upplevas. Trots sekundära analyser med ålders-matchning där endast
deltagare som var högst 30 år inkluderades fanns ingen huvudeffekt av AD-behandling (ADanvändning vs. icke-AD användning).
Avhandlingens resultat är i motstridighet till tidigare forskning av t.ex. Nelson et al.
(2005) och Cha et al. (2018). Det dessa studier gjorde annorlunda var att kontrollera för typen
av AD som användes av deltagarna. Det finns även tidigare forskning som föreslår att vissa
AD läkemedel har ångestdämpande effekt (Graeff & Zangrossi, 2010; Lyndon et al., 2019),
medan andra har den motsatta effekten (e.g. Baldwin et al., 2005; Toni et al., 2000). Detta
kan ha resulterat i att de båda effekterna slog ut varandra i den aktuella studien.
Svårigheter i att hitta skillnader i ångestsymtom mellan användare och icke-användare
av AD kan också ha berott på det specifika samplet i denna avhandling. Många av deltagarna
använde flera antidepressiva läkemedel, så kallad polyfarmaci. Detta är relativt vanligt
(Kukreja, Kalra, Shah & Shrivastava, 2013) och deprimerade patienter verkar använda i
medelvärde 2.18 psykotropiska läkemedel per person (Dold et al., 2018). Samplet kan även
ha haft en generellt lägre ångestnivå. Lyndon et al. (2019) hävdade att ångestdämpande
effekter är tydligare när deprimerade patienter har hög ångestsymtom. En stor andel av
samplet (43%) hade även varit under AD-behandling i fem år eller mer, vilket kan ha minskat
ångesten med tiden. Tidigare studier på AD och dess ångestdämpande effektivitet har varit
49

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
korttidsstudier (6-8 veckor) trots att långtidsanvändning är normen (Bet et al., 2013;
Ferguson, 2001).
Resultaten indikerade att ångestsymtom minskade med ålder. Detta är inte
överraskade då inom forskningen kring personlighet och femfaktormodellen har man hittat
höga korrelationer mellan ångest och neuroticism (Twenge, 2000, as cited in Twenge, 2000).
Och det finns tydligt forskningsstöd i att neuroticism minskar med åren (McCrae et al., 1999;
Srivastava, John, Gosling & Potter, 2003).
Trots icke signifikanta resultat upplevde transpersoner mer ångest än resten av
samplet överlag, samt männen upplevde mer ångest än kvinnorna. I linje med tidigare
forskning utgör transpersoner sällan en stor del av ett sampel inom litteraturen men har
eventuellt tre gånger så stor risk att lida av ångest än den allmänna populationen. Män brukar
oftast uppleva mindre ångest än kvinnor (Fava et al., 2006; Gao, Ping & Liu, 2020) men det
finns studier som visar att män kanske upplever lika mycket eller mer ångest när de finner sig
i en sårbar situation som en mentalsjukdom (e.g. Kalsoom, 2020; Peterson, Newton &
Feingold, 2007).
Biverkningar och ångestsymtom
Inga biverkningar ökade i samband med ångestsymtom, men ångest ledde till högre
risk för sexuella biverkningar och vice versa. En potentiell förklaring är att både ångest och
sexuella biverkningar är de två högst prioriterade faktorerna i klinikers val av AD läkemedel
(Zimmerman et al., 2004) vilket kan betyda att ena väljs över den andra när man väljer vilken
som ska undvikas, eller så är det svårt att prioritera båda samtidigt. Det finns även studier
som menar att sexuell dysfunktion ofta ignoreras när man frågar klienter om deras
biverkningar (Chen et al., 2008).
Ångest kan ibland leda till mindre sexuell aktivitet vilket gör att sexuella biverkningar
då lämnas oupptäckta. Enligt Barlows modell (1986) skulle ångest distrahera
uppmärksamheten från erotiska signaler och då minska sexuell upphetsning och sexuell
aktivitet. Social fobi har eventuellt en negativ korrelation med frekvensen av sexuell kontakt
med andra och på det sättet minskar det potentiella situationer där sexuella biverkningar av
AD-behandling kan upplevas.
Depressionssvårighet predicerade både utanförskap och fysiska biverkningar och är i
linje med tidigare nämnda studier om att ju svårare depressionen är desto mer biverkningar
kan upplevs. En ökning av fysiska biverkningar är kanske inte heller så överraskade då

50

ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS
deprimerade klienter kan ha en förhöjd uppmärksamhet och upplevelse av fysiska besvär (Bet
et al., 2013 & Klauenberg et al., 2008).
Det bör även nämnas att beroende/abstinensbiverkningar inte predicerades av någon
av variablerna ålder, depressionssvårighet eller AD-behandling. Detta kan ha varit på grund
av att en relativ stor grupp av deltagare i enkäten togs bort för att de inte var aktuella med
AD-behandling men hade genomgått en innan. Eftersom beroende och abstinens förutsätter
försök att avsluta AD-behandling kan studien förlorar värdefull information från denna grupp
som exkluderades.
Styrkor och Svagheter
Styrkor i denna avhandling är den omfattade datainsamlingen från DETRECOprojektet, dess breda finska population samt tillgången till Sjöbergs (2017) tidigare
faktoranalys för att sedan få en ännu starkare reliabilitet i biverkningsfaktorer för denna
studie. En ytterligare styrka i avhandlingen är att den även undersöker äldre klienter där
tidigare litteratur oftast tagit bort dessa deltagare på grund av att de har högre risk för
komorbiditet.
Denna avhandling har även några begränsningar. De största svagheterna var kanske
studiens bekvämlighetsurval och att det var en tvärsnittsstudie vilket utgör en signifikant risk
för urvalsfel och mindre representativ sampel. En optimal undersökning av AD-behandling
skulle vara en placebo-kontrollerad och randomiserad studie. Dock kan dessa oftast bara vara
korttidsinterventioner och och långtidsbehandling är oftast bara möjliga att undersöka i
naturalistiska miljöer.
En annan begränsning är att samplet har en fyra gånger större del kvinnor än män.
Vissa biverkningar som förändringar i vikt ska exempelvis vara mer associerat med det
kvinnliga könet (Bet et al., 2013). Till andra begränsningar hör det att det låga antalet items i
STAI-6 tvingade en summering av ångestskalan istället för en analys av varje item. På det
sättet förlorade studien eventuell specifik information om ångest. En annan svaghet är
nackdelarna med självskattning. Samplet var av en klinisk deprimerad kohort vilket kan
spekuleras att de deltagare som inte deltog eller inte fyllde i hela enkäten kan ha varit dem
som lider av den svåraste graden av depression och i sin tur bli utmattade snabbare (Luyten,
Kempke, Van Wambeke, Claes, Blatt & Van Housenhove, 2011). Därför bör framtida
forskning av speciellt deprimerad population ta undersökningens längd och
användarvänlighet i beaktande.

Framtida forskning, tillämpning och sammanfattning
Framtida forskning skulle kunna fortsätta undersöka AD-behandling hos
urvalsgrupper som är matchade i ålder och kön samt kontrollera för användning av specifika
typer eller antal AD-läkemedel. I enlighet med tidigare studier av t.ex. Ionescu et al., (2014)
and Fava et al., (2008) skulle grupperna även kunna delas upp i låg och hög ångest. På detta
sätt kan ångestsymtom studeras över tid i en mer kontrollerad design.
Den aktuella studien kan även expanderas genom i mer detalj inspektera sexuella
biverkningar och dess negativa korrelation med ångestsymtom. Oklara hypoteser om ångest
och sexuella drifter behöver förtydligas i empiriska studier. Fynden från denna avhandling
skulle även kunna bidra i det kliniska området då val av typ av behandling för depression
sker. Om AD-behandling skulle vara aktuellt bör klienten informeras om dess biverkningar,
få tydlig och bred psykoedukation om AD-behandling och läkemedlet bör anpassas efter
klientens symtom-bakgrund.
Sammanfattningsvis är depression en psykisk sjukdom som påverkar många
människor världen över. Fler som drabbas av depression upplever även ångestsymtom.
Antidepressiva läkemedel är den mest prevalenta behandlingen för depression men i denna
avhandling fanns det inga skillnader på ångestnivåer hos dem som hade eller inte hade
genomgått AD-behandling, istället var ålder en faktor som associerades med ångestsymtom.
Vidare minskar sexuella biverkningar från AD-behandling hos den deprimerade individen ju
högre ångest hen får. Detta är kontraintuitivt och en djupare dykning i detta förhållande
skulle vara intressant i framtida forskning. Beroende och abstinens biverkningar blev
eventuellt inte rättvist undersökt i denna studie och kan behövas uppmärksammas igen. Den
aktuella studien påvisar ett behov av att ge klienter tydligare och kanske mer omfattande
informerat samtycke och psykoedukation inom AD-behandlingens effektivitet i
ångestdämpning och dess biverkningar.

Antidepressiva läkemedel kan leda till ökad sexuella biverkningar vid låg ångest
Pro gradu-avhandling i Psykologi
Fakulteten för Humaniora, Psykologi och Teologi, Åbo Akademi
Resultaten från en pro gradu-avhandlingen vid Åbo Akademi fann att antidepressiva
läkemedel kanske inte är så effektiva mot ångest. Sally Lo har undersökt deprimerade
individers ångest, antidepressiva läkemedel och dess biverkningar inom ramen av projektet
“DETRECO” på Åbo Akademi. Hon fann att antidepressiva läkemedel inte kunde kopplas till
förändringar av ångest hos användare. I studien jämfördes ångesten hos deprimerade
individer som använder antidepressiva läkemedel, med deprimerade individer som inte
använder antidepressiva läkemedel. De som använde antidepressiva var inte mindre
ångestfyllda än de utan läkemedlet. Det bör dock nämnas att det finns olika sorters
antidepressiva, men som en grupp fungerade antidepressiva inte som ångestdämpare.
Enligt Los studie har de individer som hade lägre ångest fler sexuella biverkningar, jämfört
med dem som hade högre ångest och mindre sexuella biverkningar. Dessa biverkningar var
svårigheter i att uppnå orgasm trots stimulation och andra sexuella svårigheter.
Enligt Lo är detta fynd viktiga för klinikers arbete då de bör beakta patienters sexuella
biverkningar och ångest till en längre utsträckning än idag. Kliniker bör var noga med att
informera sina patienter om antidepressivas effektivitet i ångest och dess biverkningar.
Samtidigt bör även patienter vara tydliga med biverkningar och andra symptom de upplever
under depressionen.
Sammanlagt deltog 326 deprimerade individer i studien, varav 137 fick antidepressiv
behandling och 189 fick det inte. Information samlades in online med hjälp av formulär som
bland annat mätte ångest samt negativa och positiva upplevelser av antidepressiva
biverkningar. Framtida studier rekommenderas att undersöka eventuella anledningar och
förhållandet mellan ångest och sexuella biverkningar.
Avhandlingen utfördes av Sally Lo under handledning av Mira Karrash.
