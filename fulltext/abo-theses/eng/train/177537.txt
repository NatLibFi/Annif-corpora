Title of the Thesis: Choosing How and When to Die in Accordance with the European Convention on Human
Rights
Supevisor: Catarina Krause
As technology becomes more advanced so does our capacity to sustain life artificially. We are now able to stay
alive in situations that would have led to death in the past. This had led to debates on the topic of assisted dying
both within ethics and law. While some countries have legalized assisted suicide and/or active voluntary euthanasia,
most European countries have not. Debates over the differences between active and passive euthanasia persist as
well, and some countries authorize different forms of passive euthanasia despite criminalizing active forms of
assisted dying.
The first case regarding assisted suicide was brought to the European Court of Human Rights (the ECtHR or the
Court) by Mrs. Diane Pretty, who wished to commit suicide by the help of her husband. Assisted suicide is
criminalized in the United Kingdom, which resulted in Mrs. Pretty complaining to the ECtHR under several articles
of the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention). No violations of any articles were found in the
case; however, it was the first case where the ECtHR mentioned the possibility of the existence of a right to choose
how and when to die under article 8 of the Convention.
Since the Pretty case there have been several assisted dying cases brought before the ECtHR and the existence of
a right to choose how and when to die has been established. This thesis examines the extent an individual can
choose how and when to die in accordance with the Convention by examining the case-law of the ECtHR and
writings of scholars, as well as exploring questions that have yet to be addressed by the Court. While the ECtHR
addresses the extent of the right to choose how and when to die in a rather vague language, with a seeming
reluctance to address the substantive issues regarding the right, some conclusions can be drawn. The conflict
between the right to life and the autonomy of the individual has been addressed in many end-of-life cases,
demonstrating that States are only obliged to prevent suicide in a limited amount of circumstances.
Due to the wide margin of appreciation enjoyed by the States in end-of-life issues, States are rather free in their
choice on how to regulate assisted dying. The emphasis on the importance of an autonomous decision and a
legitimate consent is however emphasised throughout the case-law. Therefore, if States choose to authorize
different forms of assisted dying, they must ensure that the individual wishing to die has decision-making-capacity
and has given their legitimate consent to the practice. States that authorize assisted dying must ensure the protection
of the vulnerable, but whether States can set blanket prohibitions on assisted dying remains debated, as this may be
discriminatory towards disabled individuals. When it comes to passive euthanasia, the previous wishes of the
patient are to be crucial in the decision-making process, whether those wishes were made orally or in written form.
The wishes of parents may also play a role when the patient is a minor, but doctors may not be obliged to act in
accordance with those wishes as the best interests of the child may take priority.
Key words: European Convention on Human Rights, assisted dying, refusing life-sustaining treatment, right to
life, autonomy, withdrawing life-sustaining treatment

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
Euthanasia and assisted suicide are topics that are frequently debated within ethics and law. The
Netherlands was the first Western country to authorize some forms of assisted suicide and
euthanasia.1 Since then, more Western countries have authorized some forms of assisted dying,
among which are Belgium, Luxemburg and Switzerland.2 In 2001, the first case regarding assisted
suicide was examined by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR or “the Court”).3 Since
then the ECtHR has decided on several other end-of-life cases.4 On the one hand it has been
established that Member States of the Council of Europe have an obligation to protect the right to
life,5 but on the other hand the ECtHR has recognized that a right to decide how and when to die
is an aspect the scope of article 8 in the European Convention on Human Rights (the ECHR or the
Convention).6
1.2. Research aim and research questions
The aim of this thesis is to examine to what extent individuals can to choose the time and manner
of their deaths in accordance with the ECHR. In order to answer this, the following questions will
have to be examined; What are the competing rights and interests under the ECHR in relation to
assisted dying? How have relevant articles of the Convention been interpreted by the ECtHR in
end-of-life cases? Are States obliged to provide equal opportunity to commit suicide for all
individuals? What is the role of consent in the decision-making process in end-of-life situations?
1.3. Methodology, sources and limitations
End-of-life subjects included in this thesis will be different forms of euthanasia and assisted
suicide, while, in the interest of space, the topic of palliative care will be included only to a limited
extent. The ECHR will be the basis for this thesis. Additional protocols to the Convention will be

excluded, as relevant case law is based on provisions in the original treaty. The interpretations of
the Convention in relation to the research questions of this thesis will be examined. The focus will
be largely on case-law, namely on how the ECtHR has decided on the end-of-life issues that have
been brought to the Court. Studying the case law of the ECtHR will give guidance as to which
articles are relevant and how to interpret them with regards to assisted suicide and euthanasia.
Some national cases will be included as well as opinions of legal scholars in order to further
analyse alternatives in interpretation with regards to relevant articles as well as to questions that
have not yet been addressed by the ECtHR. Some soft law instruments will also be included, as
they can influence the practice of the organs of the Council of Europe and the member states,
despite not being binding law.7
Besides the judgements of the ECtHR, the thesis will be to a great extent based on writings of
scholars such as Elizabeth Wicks, Gregor Puppinck and Claire de la Hougue. The most significant
influence from scholars in the thesis will be the writings of Wicks, as her research is largely
focused on human rights and health care law. She has written numerous books and articles on the
topic, many of which are focused on end-of-life situations.8 There have been new cases in the endof-life sphere since many of Wick’s analyses. Some areas within the end-of-life sphere have been
analysed in depth in more recent years. An example of this is Black’s analyses on refusing lifeprolonging treatment,9 which will be discussed in this thesis. A broader scope of end-of-life
situations will be exammined in this thesis, including forms of passive euthanasia as well as active
forms of assisted dying. This will allow comparisons to be made between the rights related to
different forms of assisted dying and refusals to life-sustaining treatment (LST).
1.4. Terminology
It is challenging to find consistent definitions of terms related to end-of-life situations, as different
terms are often used interchangeably by some, while others make a clear distinction between them.
With the purpose of giving a general overview of the key terms that will be used in this thesis;
definitions will be given below to the most reoccurring to the terms.

In this thesis active euthanasia refers to the physician or another individual administering the lethal
substance to the patient.10
Physician-assisted suicide, sometimes referred simply as assisted suicide11 can be described as a
physician providing the patient with the means to commit suicide while it is the patient themselves
who will ultimately use it to commit suicide. 12 Alternative terms excluding the word suicide, such
as physician-assisted death, are also advocated by those who deem the word “suicide” to be biased
and too emotionally charged.13 Some include assisted suicide under active euthanasia,14 while
others argue that it should be differentiated from euthanasia as it does not involve another person
directly killing the patient.15 The distinction between assisted suicide and euthanasia is not always
clear in legislation either, as Switzerland is the only European country to clearly differentiate the
two acts in its legislation.16
Passive euthanasia is the withdrawing or withholding of LST.17
The two types of euthanasia, active and passive, can further be divided into voluntary, involuntary
and nonvoluntary forms of it.
Voluntary euthanasia is when euthanasia is performed on a patient who requests it. 18
Involuntary euthanasia is when euthanasia is performed on a patient who opposes it.19

Nonvoluntary euthanasia is when euthanasia is performed on a patient lacking decision-making
capacity.20
Assisted dying will be used in this thesis to describe any of the forms of assisted suicide or
euthanasia described above.
The following is the definition of palliative care used the World Health Organization:
Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families
facing the problem associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief
of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of
pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual21

2. Relevant rights and interests of the ECHR
2.1. Introduction to the ECHR
The ECHR, which entered into force in 1953, was the first comprehensive human rights treaty
formed after the Second World War.22 The Convention protects mainly civil and political rights.23
The original treaty contains 59 articles24, but it has been complemented by protocols, six out of
which contain substantial rights.25 As stated above, additional protocols will not be addressed in
this thesis as the end-of-life case law has regarded provisions in the original treaty.
Individuals of State Parties of the ECHR have the right under article 34 in the Convention to lodge
a complaint to the ECtHR when they claim their rights have been violated by the State.26 In the
case of Handyside v. the United Kingdom 27 the Court established the principle of the margin of
appreciation. This margin of appreciation is connected to the principle of subsidiarity,28 means that
national authorities have a primary task of ensuring the rights and liberties protected by the
Convention. 29 When addressing article 10 in the case the Court stated that States do not have “an

unlimited power of appreciation”30 and that the Court, together with the Commission, “is
responsible for ensuring the observance of those States' engagements (Article 19) (art. 19), is
empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘restriction’ or ‘penalty’ is reconcilable with
freedom of expression as protected by Article 10”31
2.2. The right to life
2.2.1. Generally about the right to life under the Convention
The right to life, found in article 2 in the Convention,32 has been described by the ECtHR as “one
of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention”.33 It is nonetheless not an absolute right.34
The article states that:
1. Everyone’s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save
in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided
by law.
2. Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this Article when it results from
the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:
(a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence;
(b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;
(c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.35

Derogations from the Convention during times of emergency are addressed in article 15, where it
is stated that the Convention allows “[n]o derogation from Article 2, except in respect of deaths
resulting from lawful acts of war [...]”.36
The right to life under the ECHR includes both negative and positive obligations on States.
Negative obligations require States to refrain from a specific type of action, while positive
obligations require States to take measures to ensure a certain outcome.37 The Court has interpreted
article 2 (1) to mean that States have an obligation “not only to refrain from the intentional and
unlawful taking of life, but also to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its
jurisdiction”.38 This can include in some circumstances a positive obligation to take measures to

protect the right to life of an individual from life-threatening criminal actions of another
individual.39 The Court has stated that “not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities
a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materializing”.40
The requirements the Court has set up for State authorities regarding the positive obligations to
protect the right to life are that they “knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of
a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual from the criminal acts of a third
party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged
reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.”41 The Court has also affirmed that States’
positive obligations under article 2 includes the requirement to
make regulations compelling hospitals, whether public or private, to adopt appropriate measures for the
protection of their patients' lives. They also require an effective independent judicial system to be set up so that
the cause of death of patients in the care of the medical profession, whether in the public or the private sector,
can be determined and those responsible made accountable.42

2.2.2. The difficulty of defining life and death
Due to advances in medical technology the question of when life ends no longer has a clear-cut
answer. In the past a person has normally been considered dead once they stop breathing or when
their heart stops beating. Death can no longer be defined that simply, as a patient in that state can
now be revived with the help of modern medical technology. The traditional definition of death
may thus be outdated.43 Many different suggestions have been proposed on what criteria must be
fulfilled in modern times to determine that a person has died. These suggestions have included for
example cessation of all activity of the whole brain, cessation of activities of the higher brain and
brain stem death.44 The definition of death can depend on several different factors such as culture
and religious beliefs.45
Article 2 in the Convention states that “[e]veryone's right to life shall be protected by law”46 , but
when life begins, or ends, is not defined in the ECHR. Neither the former European Commission
of Human Rights (the Commission), nor the Court has given a clear definition on life.47 The

Court’s reluctance to define the term “life” is evident in Vo v. France, a case regarding an unborn
child. It held that determining whether an unborn child has the right to life fell within the margin
of appreciation of States.48
2.2.3. Application of article 2 at the end of life
One might argue that when a person is approaching the end of their life, the right to life is not
important to protect compared to an individual whose life is further away from ending. Wicks,
however, argues that the length of the life expectation does not affect the protection of the right to
life. On the contrary, she argues that when an individual’s life is nearing the end the right to life
becomes more important, as this may be the most valued days of that individual’s life. It is also at
the end of one’s life when the right to life is often the most threatened. This is especially true when
life is coming to an end due to illness or injury, both of which in and of themselves cause a threat
to life, but also due to the vulnerable position the patient is in and the added medical treatment.49
Wicks presents two main arguments for why a person who will die does not have a weaker
protection of the right to life. The first argument is the difficulty of assessing the certitude of a
coming death. The second argument she brings forward concerns the question of why a person
approaching death would be less entitled to protection of life than someone who is not. All humans
will die at some point and any decision of a certain point in time where a person is no longer
entitled to enjoy human rights is inevitably an arbitrary one.50
Another relevant issue is the situation of patients who are unconscious, mentally incapacitated or
lack self-awareness. Wicks argues that such patients enjoy the protection of the right to life as well.
She describes the right to life as starting the moment an individual is considered a viable human
being,51 and as prevailing until the moment of brain death. Nonetheless, this does not mean that
life will always be preserved regardless of the circumstances.52

2.2.4. Circumstances that give rise to a positive obligation to prevent suicide
The positive obligation of States to protect the right to life under article 2 in the Convention can
extend to a positive obligation to prevent suicide in certain situations. This obligation applies when
an individual is under the control of a State, for example when they are a prisoner. What is expected
from authorities in such a situation is that, if they know or ought to know that an individual is at a
risk of suicide, they do everything that can reasonably be expected of them in order to prevent it.53
The case of Keenan v. the United Kingdom54 concerned the issue of suicide committed by a
schizophrenic individual who was detained.55 The Court found no violation of article 2 in the case,
as it held that the authorities had not acted negligently with regard to the suicide risk of the
prisoner.56 Daniel Rietiker interprets the case as establishing that the obligation to prevent suicide
is restricted and dependent on the circumstances of the case. He argues furthermore that even if
not completely apparent in the case, the national authorities were forced to consider other rights
besides the right to life that the prisoner had under the Convention. According to Rietiker, they
had to consider for example rights under article 8, as they could have violated the prisoner’s rights
had they organised a permanent supervision of the prisoner.57 The obligation for States to prevent
suicide when an individual is under its control has also applied in situations beyond prisons,58 such
as during a compulsory military service.59
Wicks argues that the obligation on States to prevent suicides of detained individuals is due to the
restricted autonomy of such individuals, in addition to detention often generating depression and
suicidal thoughts. The prisoner’s lives are at a greater risk compared to those not detained.

60

In

the Keenan case the Court stated that
The prison authorities, similarly, must discharge their duties in a manner compatible with the rights and
freedoms of the individual concerned. There are general measures and precautions which will be available to
diminish the opportunities for self-harm, without infringing on personal autonomy. Whether any more stringent
measures are necessary in respect of a prisoner and whether it is reasonable to apply them will depend on the
circumstances of the case.61

According to Wicks’ interpretation of this paragraph, this is a clear indication that it is necessary
and reasonable in some situations to infringe on a suicidal prisoner’s personal autonomy to save
their life.62 Even so, Wicks argues that autonomy is not completely irrelevant. Despite the cases
where the Court has found a violation when a State has failed to prevent suicide, Wicks argues that
if an individual who is mentally competent makes the decision to end their life, States are under
no obligation to prevent that individual from committing suicide. This is, according to her, because
the positive obligation to protect the right to life does not apply when there is a substantial
conflicting interest, such as an autonomous decision to commit suicide.63 The topic of autonomy
as a conflicting interest to the right to life in end-of-life cases will be addressed further in chapter

The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) has commented on the topic of
euthanasia on a few occasions. In 1976 the PACE stated in Recommendation 779 (1976) that a
doctor “has no right, even in cases which appear to him to be desperate, intentionally to hasten the
natural course of death”.64 In 1999 the PACE stated in paragraph 9 of Recommendation 1418 that
it upholds “the prohibition against intentionally taking the life of terminally ill or dying persons”.65
It also acknowledged that the right to life of terminally ill and dying individuals is guaranteed
under article 266 and that the wish of the patient to die does not constitute “any legal claim to die
at the hand of another person” 67 and that it “cannot of itself constitute a legal justification to carry
out actions intended to bring about death”.68 Later, in 2012, the PACE stated in Resolution 1859
which regarded the protection of human rights and dignity that “[e]thanasia, in the sense of the
intentional killing by act or omission of a dependent human being for his or her alleged benefit,
must always be prohibited.”69

2.2.6. Active versus passive euthanasia regarding article 2
One question that arises about a State’s obligation to protect life in end-of-life situations, is whether
there is a difference between killing and letting die. From a philosophical perspective, one might
argue that there is a difference. Hugh V. Mclachlan takes this position. He argues that omission
cannot cause something to happen. He argues that an omission by a doctor to for example prescribe
antibiotics to a patient may indirectly lead to death, and can be immoral, but is not active killing.70
He compares it to a situation with a drowning child. He argues that everyone has both a moral and
a legal responsibility not to drown a child, but we do not have the same type of responsibility to
save a drowning child. To drown a child would be considered murder, while not saving a drowning
child is not, albeit the person who failed to save the child may be guilty of failing to comply his
duty of care. He argues that killing and letting die are different both from a moral and a legal
presentative and thus active and passive euthanasia should be differentiated.71
The opposing opinion is that omissions do cause death. E. Gerald and S. Wilkinson argue that the
omission to save a drowning child and the omission of a doctor to prescribe antibiotics to a patient
who needs them in order to stay alive does cause death. They argue that both permissible and
impermissible omissions cause death. To illustrate their argument, they take as an example a
scenario where 10 patients are receiving LST. If it is in the best interest for three of them to die,
while for the other patients it is not, then switching off the treatment is nevertheless the cause of
death for all patients. They also address the argument that in passive euthanasia of a terminally ill
patient it is the disease that kills the patient rather than an action. They dismiss the argument by
holding that this argument would have to apply to active euthanasia as well, since in the case of a
terminally ill patient who requests active euthanasia, the underlying cause is the disease. It does
not therefore address the issue of how passive euthanasia supposedly does not cause death.72
The ECtHR has addressed this issue to some extent in the case of Lambert and others v. France,73
which concerned the withdrawal of LST of a patient. 74 This case of passive euthanasia which will
be presented in more detail in chapter 4.1.1. It stated that it “stresses that the issue before it in the

present case is not that of euthanasia, but rather the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment”.75 This
can be perceived as the Court wanting to draw a clear distinction between the withdrawing of LST,
i.e. letting the patient die from his condition, and providing a patient with the means to end their
own life, i.e. ending the life of the patient in a more direct way. The majority in the case therefore
seems to have taken a similar approach as Mclachlan.
The partly dissenting judges in the case disagreed on the fact that the withdrawal of LST from the
patient would not be one of euthanasia. The partly dissenting judges state the following:
We agree that, conceptually, there is a legitimate distinction between euthanasia and assisted suicide on the
one hand, and therapeutic abstention on the other. However, because of the manner in which domestic law has
been interpreted and the way it has been applied to the facts of the case under examination, we strongly disagree
with what is stated in paragraph 141 of the present judgment. The case before this Court is one of euthanasia,
even if under a different name.76

The partly dissenting judges seem to take an approach similar to Gerald and Wilkinson, as they
hold that withdrawing the LST “results in precipitating death which would not otherwise occur in
the foreseeable future”.77 They emphasize that the treatment in the case was of ordinary care and
that in lack of the consequence will inevitably be his death. They add that
[o]ne may not will the death of the subject in question, but by willing the act or omission which one knows
will in all likelihood lead to that death, one actually intends to kill that subject nonetheless. This is, after all,
the whole notion of positive indirect intent as one of the two limbs of the notion of dolus in criminal law.78

The partly dissenting judges in the Lambert case therefore disagreed with the definition of
euthanasia implied by the majority.
In analysing a domestic case from the United Kingdom concerning the withdrawal of artificial
nutrition and hydration (ANH) from a patient in a permanent vegetative state, Emily Jackson
notes that the domestic law seemingly recognizes that sometimes it is not in the patient’s best
interests to be kept alive in a permanent vegetative state. She raises an important question, namely
why the law allows for the slow death by dehydration and starvation of a patient, while
condemning directly killing a patient in a faster manner through a lethal injection.79 The same
question could be posed regarding the French law, as the direct killing of Vincent Lambert would

have been against the domestic law, while starving and dehydrating him to death was authorized.80
The majority of the Court agreed with the French government, separating cases of direct killing
and withdrawing LST.
Jackson addresses a possible counter argument to the view that withdrawing LST should not be
separated from direct killing. The counter argument is that withdrawing the LST does not kill the
patient, but it is rather the underlying condition that ends up killing the patient. Jackson is not
convinced by this argument, as that would mean that doctors may stand back and watch a patient
die from an easily treatable condition, which is normally not acceptable behaviour from doctors.
She takes the example of a patient entering a hospital severely dehydrated and doctors deciding
not to help despite there being a simple solution to the condition. Could the doctors really justify
their actions by saying that it was the underlying condition, namely severe dehydration, that killed
the patient rather than their omission to act?

81

As Jackson argues, withholding or withdrawing

LST can only be acceptable when letting the patient die is acceptable. In other words, it is not the
act of withdrawing LST in itself that is an acceptable way of killing someone, but it is rather the
circumstances the patient is in that makes it acceptable to let them die.82
Jackson is in general critical of the distinction between killing and letting die. While she recognizes
that there are some differences between withdrawing LST and injecting a lethal substance into a
patient, she does not hold them to be significant enough to justify the bearing of “the moral weight
that is placed upon them by law”.83 If taking a terminal cancer patient who no longer benefits from
chemotherapy as an example, the alternative of withdrawing treatment instead of a lethal injection
is a slower and perhaps more painful and distressful death. Jackson poses the question of why
withdrawing the treatment would be the preferable solution when the end result in both scenarios
is the same, death.84
As seen above, one argument for the alternative of withdrawal of treatment is that the underlying
condition is what causes the death, whereas in the case of a lethal injection it is the injection that
causes the death of the patient. However, as Jackson explains, this is not necessarily the case. If a

terminally ill cancer patient receives ANH, and this treatment is withdrawn, its it is not the cancer
that kills the patient, but rather starvation and dehydration.85
Another possible argument could be that the difference lies on the moral distinction in taking a
positive action to cause harm versus failing to prevent harm from happening. As Jackson notes,
this may indeed be a valid argument in some cases. A person who does not donate to an
organization that helps save lives could hardly be accused of murder, while someone poisoning a
baby’s milk and thereby causing that baby’s death could reasonably be held morally accountable
for the death of the baby. Jackson argues however that this would not be the case in the terminally
ill cancer patient. The alternatives of a lethal injection versus withdrawing ANH are not the same
as in the previously expressed example. She is not convinced that there is any moral difference
between a doctor injecting the patient with a lethal injection versus the doctor withdrawing the
treatment. Again, it is not the way that the doctor causes the death that is acceptable, but rather the
death of the patient due to circumstances that must be acceptable. Jackson holds that the way the
patient is allowed to die should promote dignity as well as reflect the values held by the patient
during his or her lifetime.86
When considering the argument presented by Jackson, it could be seen as rather odd how the Court,
as well as the French law, seem to separate assisted suicide and active euthanasia on the one hand
and withdrawing LST on the other hand. An alternative possibility could be that due to positive
obligations States have under article 2, omissions that lead to death can breach the article and
therefore the distinction between active and passive euthanasia would be irrelevant under the
article. Such a view has been taken by Wicks, who argues that under article 2 of the ECHR, it is
of little relevance whether a person is killed by an act or an omission. As States have a duty to take
reasonable steps to preserve life, she deems it self-evident that an omission can infringe the
obligation.87 However, if the Court holds the same view as Wicks, it would seem slightly
contradictory that it wanted to emphasize that the Lambert case was not one of euthanasia.
Nonetheless, judging by the Lambert case, it seems rather clear that the Court does not consider
withdrawing LST from a patient in a persistent vegetative state to be a breach of the right to life,

at least as long as it is done with respect to the previous wishes of the patient. This does not seem
to differ considerably from how the Court has interpreted the article in relation to assisted suicide,
where the requirement of an autonomous decision of the patient has been emphasized. Perhaps the
most obvious difference between assisted suicide cases and the Lambert case is the lack of
emphasis on the protection of the vulnerable in the Lambert case. This was also noted by the partly
dissenting judges in the Lambert case. They stated that “[w]e find that conclusion not only
frightening but – and we very much regret having to say this – tantamount to a retrograde step in
the degree of protection which the Convention and the Court have hitherto afforded to vulnerable
people.”88
2.3. The prohibition of torture, inhumane and degrading treatment
Another article in the Convention that may be relevant in cases of assisted dying is article 3, which
states that “No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment”.89 The argument concerning the applicability article 3 assisted dying is that denying
someone the chance to end their unbearable suffering through assisted dying could amount to
inhumane and degrading treatment.90 Article 3 includes the positive obligation to protect
individuals from ill-treatment, whether from public or private parties.91 The Court has considered
article 3 to be an absolute prohibition and has stated that it “enshrines one of the fundamental
values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe”.92 No exceptions are listed
under the article93 and derogations from it are not allowed under article 15.94 Therefore, if a
prohibition of assisted dying was to be deemed to be in breach of article 3, the prohibition could
not be justified.
The absolute nature of article 3 has been demonstrated by the Court in cases such as Chahal v. the
United Kingdom95 and Saadi v. Italy.96 In the Chahal case the Court held that deporting the
applicant to India, where he would be at risk of being subject to ill-treatment within the meaning

of article 3, would be in violation of the article,97 despite reason behind the potential deportation
was to protect national security.98 In the Saadi case the Court held that holding a higher standard
of proof regarding the potential risk of ill-treatment when deporting an individual would be
contrary to the absolute nature of article 3, even if the individual in question poses a threat to
national security.99 Suffering caused by an illness can fall within the scope of article 3, if a State’s
actions cause it to aggravate. Such was the case in D v. the United Kingdom100 where the State
would have breached article 3, had the State deported the applicant who suffered from AIDS to St
Kitts, where he would have died without the medical and palliative care he needed.101
In Ireland v. the United Kingdom102 the Court noted that for ill-treatment to fall within the scope
of article 3 it must “attain a minimum level of severity”.103 This standard must be met regardless
of the type of conduct in question. Therefore, even illegal conduct must meet this criterion in order
to fall within the scope of article 3.104 In the case of Jalloh v. Germany,105 the Court commented
on the assessment of the minimum level of severity, stating that “it depends on all the
circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects
and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim”.106 For a prohibition of assisted
dying to breach article 3, it would therefore have to reach this minimum level of severity.
In the Ireland v. the United Kingdom case the Court described degrading treatment as arousing
“feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them and possibly
breaking their physical or moral resistance.”107 In assessing whether treatment has been degrading
the Court had taken into consideration whether it had the object to “humiliate and debase the person
concerned”.108 However, an intention to humiliate need not necessarily be present, as was shown
for example in the Peers v. Greece case,109 where the Court held that despite the lack of such intent

in the case, the possibility of a violation of article 3 still existed.110 In V v. the United Kingdom111
the Court noted that the suffering and humiliation caused by an inhumane or degrading treatment
or punishment must “go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with
a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment”.112 When it comes to medical treatment, the
Court has stated that generally “a measure which is a therapeutic necessity cannot be regarded as
inhuman or degrading”.113
In the inadmissibility decision X v. Germany,114 the applicant was a German man under arrest,
during which he went on a hunger strike, which resulted in him being force-fed. He complained
that he had been subject to inhumane and degrading treatment by being force-fed and that his rights
under article 3 in the Convention had therefore been breached. The European Commission of
Human Rights “forced feeding of a person does involve degrading elements which in certain
circumstances may be regarded as prohibited by Art. 3 in the Convention”115 but held that it is:
[…]satisfied that the authorities acted solely in the best interest of the applicant when choosing between either
respect for the applicant’s will not to accept nourishment of any kind and thereby incur the risk that he might
be subject to lasting injuries or even die, or to take action with a view to securing his survival although such
action might infringe the applicant’s human dignity116

2.4. The right to private life
The right to respect for private and family life is found under article 8117 in the ECHR and states
that:
1.

Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.

2.

There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in
accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public
safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection
of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.118

Article 8 in the Convention becomes relevant through the argument that individuals have a right
to end their own life based on the principle of personal autonomy.119 The Court has established

that “ ‘private life’ is a broad term encompassing the sphere of personal autonomy within which
everyone can freely pursue the development and fulfilment of his or her personality and to
establish and develop relationships with other persons and the outside world”.120 PACE stated in
Resolution 428 (1970) that the right to private life “consists essentially in the right to live one's
own life with a minimum of interference”.121 States are not obliged under the Convention to
provide citizens a specific level of medical care,122 but the Court has stated that “private life
includes a person’s physical and psychological integrity”123 and that “health, together with
physical and moral integrity, falls within the realm of private life”.124
The seconds paragraph of article 8 lists justifications for state interference with the exercise of the
rights listed in the first paragraph. The rights protected under the article are thus not absolute. The
Court has described the object of article 8 as being “essentially that of protecting an individual
against an arbitrary interference by the public authorities”.125 In addition to negative obligations,
States have positive obligations under the article as well. This was underlined by the Court for
example in the of Dickson v. the United Kingdom126 where it stated that:
In addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in an effective
respect for private and family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure
respect for private and family life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves. 127

When two rights are at conflict with each other, a balancing must be made between those rights,
which means that sometimes an interference with article 8 is permitted in order to protect
another right, as long as the interference is proportionate to the aim it pursues.128 Accordingly,
if assisted dying is protected by article 8, it does not automatically mean that a State cannot
justify such a prohibition under the article, as the prohibition may be justified under article 8(2).
The margin of appreciation under article 8 will be restricted “[w]here a particularly important
facet of an individual’s existence or identity is at stake”,129 while it will be wider where “there

is no consensus within the member States of the Council of Europe, either as to the relative
importance of the interest at stake or as to the best means of protecting it, particularly
where the case raises sensitive moral or ethical issues”.130
What is meant with “in accordance with law” under article 8 (2) is that the interference with the
article must be a recognized in the national law, including statutory law and judge made law.131
Moreover, the law must be adequately foreseeable and accessible.132 The assessment of a
legitimate aim under article 8 (2) is often rather insignificant, as the list under the article covers
a large amount of government activity. The Court has also often allowed the terms to be applied
in a somewhat broad and liberal manner.133 What the Court usually focuses on the most is the
requirement that the interference is “necessary in a democratic society”.134 This entails that fair
balance must be struck between the interests of the individual and the interests of the
community as a whole.135 The interference must therefore be proportionate, which furthermore
entails that if the measure the State has taken could have been achieved with a smaller burden
on the individual, it may not pass the proportionality test.136
2.5. The freedom of thought, conscience and religion
The freedom of thought, conscience and religion is protected under article 9137 in the Convention.
The article states that:
1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change
his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest
his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.
2. Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by
law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order,
health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. 138

The freedom to believe and to worship may be a vital part of an individual’s personality. This is
especially true to individuals with religious beliefs.139 The Court has nevertheless noted that the

freedom “is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned”.140 One
argument concerning article 9 and assisted dying is that assisted dying as a manifestation of belief
protected by article 9. 141 Another argument is the that assisted dying could be protected by article
9, if it is performed as a conscious objection by someone who does not believe death needs to be
natural. 142
The right to believe and to change one’s beliefs is an absolute right, whereas the right to manifest
such beliefs is subject to limitations under article 9 (2), as this can affect others.143 Jim Murdoch
has interpreted the scope of article 9 to be rather narrow in practice, despite the terms “thought,
conscious and religion” suggesting a potentially wide scope. He mentions that a “belief” is not the
same as an “opinion”.144 A personal beliefs must “attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness,
cohesion and importance”145 and that it must be considered to be compatible with respect for
human dignity.146 The possible obligations States have under article 9 was put forward by the Court
in the case of Otto-Preminger Institute v. Austria, where the Court stated that States must “ensure
the peaceful enjoyment of the right guaranteed under Article 9 (art. 9) to the holders of those beliefs
and doctrines”.147
The permissible limitations under article 9 (2) are similar to those listed under article 8 (2), while
containing some differences.148 Similarly to article 8 (2), the interference must be in accordance
with national law,149 as well as accessible and foreseeable.150 Interferences with the article must
have a legitimate aim, which must be interpreted narrowly.151 Unlike article 8 (2), article 9 (2)
does not list “national security” as legitimate aim. The Court has commented on the subject stating
that

Far from being an accidental omission, the non-inclusion of that particular ground for limitations in Article 9
reflects the primordial importance of religious pluralism as “one of the foundations of a ‘democratic
society’ within the meaning of the Convention” and the fact that a State cannot dictate what a person believes
or take coercive steps to make him change his beliefs152

The interference must also be “necessary in a democratic society”, meaning that, again like
under article 8 (2), it the individual’s interests must be balanced against the community’s
interests.153
2.6. The prohibition of discrimination
An argument regarding equality is occasionally used in support of assisted suicide. It is claimed
that a prohibition of assisted suicide leads to inequality between those who are physically able to
commit suicide and those who are unable to do so due to their physical limitations.154 Article 14
in the Convention concerns discrimination and states that:
The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any
ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association
with a national minority, property, birth or other status.

As the grounds in the article includes “other status”, it is possible for discrimination to be based
on another status than those listed in the article.155 There are two lines of case law when it comes
to the scope of the “other status”; one which suggests a narrow interpretation of other status,
encompassing only personal characteristics as a basis of comparison and a wider interpretation,
which can include any situation.156 An example of a narrow interpretation can be found in Budak
and Others v. Turkey where the Court stated that it “reiterates that Article 14 is not concerned with
all differences of treatment but only with differences having as their basis or reason a personal
characteristic (“status”) by which persons or group of persons are distinguishable from each
other”.157 A wider interpretation of what can be included under “other status” is found for example
in Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, where the Court emphasized that the grounds listed under
the article were illustrative rather than exhaustive.158 Disability has been found to fall within the
“other status” of article 14.159 Rainey, Wicks and Ovey argue nevertheless that if the ground for

differentiation is a personal characteristic it is more likely that it will be considered to be
encompassed by article 14.160 What differentiates article 14 in the Convention from other articles
treated in this thesis is that claims made under this article must be in conjunction to a substantive
right under the Convention, meaning that one cannot invoke the article alone.161 A breach of a
substantive provision is nevertheless not required in order to find a breach of article 14.162
Discrimination can be either direct or indirect. The Court has described direct discrimination as a
“difference in the treatment of persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations”.163 However,
direct discrimination can also arise when a State treats people who are in vastly different situations
the same.164 The assessment of when and what factors may justify a differential treatment of
individuals in similar situations falls within the margin of appreciation of States.165 In the case of
Thlimmenos v. Greece166 the State was found to have violated article 14 as it failed to treat persons
in different situations differently.167 The complaint was made in conjunction with article 9. 168 The
applicant was a Jehovah’s Witness who was convicted for subordination, as he refused to wear a
military uniform.169 The applicant was not appointed to a post of chartered accountant due to him
refusing to do military service because of his religious beliefs. This decision was made without
differentiating the applicant from other persons convicted of a serious crime, despite the applicant
committing the crime because he was exercising his religious freedom.170
The Court has also described indirect discrimination171 by stating that a “difference in treatment
may take the form of disproportionately prejudicial effects of a general policy or measure which,
though couched in neutral terms, discriminates against a group”.172 When it comes to positive

obligations under article 14, the Court has stated that a violation can occur either by “positive
action on the part of the State or by a failure to ensure non-discrimination […]”.173
Not all forms of inequalities will be in breach of article 14.174 In the Belgian linguistics case175 the
Court stated that it
[…] holds that the principle of equality of treatment is violated if the distinction has no objective and
reasonable justification. The existence of such a justification must be assessed in relation to the aim and effects
of the measure under consideration, regard being had to the principles which normally prevail in democratic
societies. A difference of treatment in the exercise of a right laid down in the Convention must not only pursue
a legitimate aim: Article 14 (art. 14) is likewise violated when it is clearly established that there is no reasonable
relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised.176

The idea behind such an approach on discrimination is that the grounds stated in the article are not
in and of themselves a justification to treat individuals or groups differently, but that such a
differential treatment may be acceptable due to the aim of the measure taken.177
In order to determine whether a disadvantageous treatment is due to one of the grounds listed under
article 14, the Court may examine whether the individual claiming to be a victim of a violation of
the article can be properly compared to a group of individuals who are being treated more
advantageously. This test requires that the applicant and the group of individuals they are being
compared to are in an analogous situation in all material respects.178 The Court has examined for
example whether a woman who was transgender was in a similar situation as someone who is
cisgender or an unmarried transgender when it came to the obtaining of a female identity
number.179 As Bernadette et al. note,180 when it comes to a State’s argument that a differential
treatment has a legitimate aim in accordance with article 8 (2), it is not enough to show that such
an aim exists, but also that the action taken by the State aids in fulfilling that aim.181
Another important issue to consider under the article is proportionality. When a fundamental right
of an individual is at stake, the means used by the State to achieve an aim must not be of a

disproportionate nature. In other words, the means are proportionate if the aim could not be
achieved by means that would interfere less with the individual’s rights.182 States are granted a
margin of appreciation, which varies in extent, with regard to the assessment of prohibited
differential treatment. Whether or not differential treatment can be justified may also change in
time, as conditions can change, as well as the prevailing consensus among Member States.

183

Whether or not there is common ground on an issue among Member States affects the
permissibility of differential treatment.184

3. Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia under the ECHR
3.1. A right to die within the right to life?
Pretty v. the United Kingdom was the first case where the Court had to decide on whether article
2 in the Convention also contains a right to die.185 There was one inadmissibility decision before
the Pretty case, namely the case of Sanles Sanles v. Spain186. The applicant in the case was the heir
legally appointed by a man named Mr. Sampedro who has been tetraplegic for 30 years after an
accident and wanted a dignified death. By the time the case was brought to the Court Mr. Sampedro
had already committed suicide with the help of a third party and the case was declared inadmissible
since the applicant could not claim to be a victim of the articles her complaint was based on.187
The Pretty case concerned a citizen of the United Kingdom named Diane Pretty, a 43-year-old
woman who suffered from a motor neuron disease and was paralyzed from the neck down due to
the disease. She was also not able to speak properly and was fed through a tube. The disease had
developed to an advanced stage and the applicant was expected to die within months. The usual
way of dying for patients suffering from the disease is through respiratory failure and pneumonia.
The disease did not affect the applicant’s intellect or capacity to make decisions. The applicant
wanted to avoid the suffering and indignity that was awaiting her if she died naturally through the
progression of the disease and wished to be able to control the way she would die.188

Since the applicant was not able to commit suicide on her own, she wished for her husband to
assist her, which was illegal under domestic law.189 The applicant had asked the Director of Public
Prosecutions (DPP) for an undertaking not to prosecute her husband if he assisted in her suicide,
but the DPP refused.190 The applicant appealed to domestic courts without the success to have the
decision of the DPP dismissed or showing that the domestic law was incompatible with the
Convention.191 The articles the applicant invoked before the Court were articles 2, 3, 8, 9 and 14.192
The applicant’s claim under article 2 of the Convention was that if the Court did not find a violation
of article 2 when her husband is not permitted to assist in his wife’s suicide, it would mean that
the States that do permit assisted suicide are in violation of the article. The applicant also claimed
that article 2 includes a right to choose whether one wants to continue living. She claimed that
article 2 was only meant to protect individuals from intervention to the right to life from third
parties, not the individual themselves.193
The Court held that States have an obligation to protect life and that despite some articles in the
Convention, such as article 11, containing a negative aspect to them, article 2 cannot be interpreted
as containing a negative aspect to it. It held that the article is “unconcerned with issues to do with
the quality of living or what a person chooses to do with his or her life”.194 The Court clarified that
the article “cannot, without a distortion of language, be interpreted as conferring the diametrically
opposite right, namely a right to die; nor can it create a right to self-determination in the sense of
conferring on an individual the entitlement to choose death rather than life.”195 Rietiker interprets
this statement made by the Court as an indication of the Court’s reluctance to apply what he calls
a “dynamic” or “evolutive” interpretation of the Convention196 and stresses that it is established in
the Court’s case law that the Court “should not depart, without cogent reason, from precedents laid

down in previous cases”.197 He agrees however with the Court’s statement, concluding that to
interpret article 2 as containing implicitly a right to die would indeed be far-fetched.198
Rietiker also notes that as such a fundamental right as the right to life is at play, it is unlikely that
the Court would interpret other Convention rights to be superior to it when they are in conflict with
the fundamental right, even when the Convention is interpreted “as a whole”. As he notes, the
findings under article 2 did indeed dominate the findings of the other claims that the applicant
presented before the Court in Pretty. He argues that this judgement gives States a basis for
criminalizing assistance in suicide by obliging States to investigate all deaths. As he notes
however, assisted suicide is an area that automatically includes complex moral and ethical
considerations. Assisted suicide is therefore more controversial than situations where States clearly
have an obligation to prevent suicide and other forms of self-harm, namely in cases such as
prisoners which was addressed above.199 States therefore enjoy a wider margin of appreciation as
well regarding assisted suicide.200
As to the applicants claim that if the Court does not find a violation of article 2 in her case it would
mean that States that do permit assistance in a person’s suicide, the Court held that ” [i]t is not for
the Court in this case to attempt to assess whether or not the state of law in any other country fails
to protect the right to life”201 and that
even if circumstances prevailing in a particular country which permitted assisted suicide were found not to
infringe Article 2 of the Convention, that would not assist the applicant in this case, where the very different
proposition – that the United Kingdom would be in breach of its obligations under Article 2 if it did not allow
assisted suicide – has not been established.202

Mathieu Bertrand argues that it is indisputable that authorizing euthanasia is a breach of article 2
in the Convention, since it is executed either directly by the public authorities or under the
supervision of them. He also argues that the patient consenting to the killing does not affect a
State’s obligation under article 2, which, as he mentions, includes no specified exception regarding
euthanasia.203 He adds, however, that despite the fact that many constitutional court judgements

have on the basis of the prohibition on deliberate killings supported euthanasia bans, the ECtHR
has started to develop a different approach on the issue. He supposes that it is due to the
development of national laws in Europe regarding euthanasia.204 When he talks more generally
about the nature of the right to life (not only the right to life under the ECHR), he argues that the
right to life is a right, not a freedom, and that it only includes the right to protection of life, not a
right for individuals to decide what they want to do with their lives. He argues that suicide is a
personal freedom but not a right and that States are under no obligation to help individuals in
committing suicide.205 Panos Merkouris argues that despite the positive obligation of States to take
measures to protect life, other rights under the Convention, such as the right to privacy, have to be
considered when fulfilling that obligation.206
So far, the ECtHR has addressed a situation in which a person has been actively euthanized or has
received aid in committing suicide against the wishes, or in the absence of knowledge, of a loved
one. There is a pending application, Mortier v. Belgium, which concerns this exact situation. The
applicant’s mother, who suffered from chronic depression, was euthanatized in Belgium without
the knowledge of the applicant and his sister. The applicant claims that article 2 was violated as
the State failed to protect his mother’s life, as he held that the domestic law concerning euthanasia
were not respected in his mother’s case. He also complains that his right to mental integrity and
family life under article 8 were breached.207 Whether the Court finds a violation of any of the
Convention articles remains to be seen.
3.2. Prohibition of assisted suicide and euthanasia as degrading treatment
The applicant in the Pretty case argued that the suffering she was forced to undergo if she was
forced to die naturally constituted a degrading treatment under article 3 of the Convention. The
applicant did not argue that the State was responsible for causing the suffering she was facing, but
instead based her argument on State’s positive obligations. She argued that State’s had, according
to the case law, a positive obligation to protect its citizens from degrading treatment. The applicant
claimed that her State was obliged to protect her from the suffering she was facing.208

The applicant argued that the State could not justify the blanket ban, which according to her
violated her rights under article 3, because the rights under the article are absolute. A balance had
been struck despite this, according to the applicant, and the individual facts of her case had not
been taken into consideration when balancing the rights under article 3 against other rights.209 She
argued that there should be an exception in the blanket ban for people like her, who were mentally
capable and were not in the need of protection.210
The Court agreed with the applicant about the absolute nature of article 3,211 but held that
treatments listed under article 3 has mostly applied in situations where an individual has been at a
risk of a State agent or a public authority intentionally inflicting that individual with such
treatment.212 The Court also noted that a positive obligation under article 3 had been found in some
cases.213 The Court held nevertheless that in the case in question it was clear that the State did not
inflict any ill-treatment on the applicant, nor was it argued that the State failed to provide the
applicant with appropriate medical care.214 The Court held that the applicant’s perception of a
States obligations under article 3 “places a new and extended construction on the concept of
treatment, which, as found by the House of Lords, goes beyond the ordinary meaning of the
word”.215 The Court also noted that article 3 “must be construed in harmony with Article 2”.216
The Court Stated that an obligation to terminate life cannot be derived from article 3, despite the
Court being sympathetic for the distressing death the applicant was facing.217 The Court held that
the State had not violated article 3 in the Convention.218
Paul Tiensuu notes that in the Pretty case the applicant is clearly mentally competent, contrary the
Keenan case, where the individual was suffering from schizophrenia219 and X v. Germany, where
a prisoner went on a hunger strike.220 He argues that the Court therefore confirmed in the Pretty

case that even when an individual is evidently mentally competent article 2 can be raised against
a complaint regarding quality of life based on article 3.221
When assessing whether unbearable suffering (such as what the applicant in the Pretty case was
facing if she was to die from the disease) can breach article 3, Jozef Dorscheidt notes that support
for such a view is hard to find in the case law of the ECtHR or the drafting history of the provision.
He notes furthermore, based on the Court’s case law, that it is difficult to show that medical
treatment has been intentionally used to cause intensive physical and mental suffering.222 A
violation of article 3 has however been found for example by the Commission with regard to forced
feeding and medication, as well as retainment of a patient to a bed in the case of Herczegfalvy v.
Austria,223 but the Court disagreed.224 If it were established that a medical practitioner had
intentionally caused such suffering, another question would have to be answered, namely whether
they were acting as a private person or a State official. When considering the margin of
appreciation that States enjoy in sensitive medical-ethical issues,225 in addition to the
aforementioned factors, Dorscheidt concludes that it remains unlikely that a criminalization of
assisted suicide or euthanasia would breach article 3, albeit it may depend on the facts of the
case.226
A scenario where Dorscheidt argues a breach of article 3 regarding end-of-life treatment may occur
is if the medical professionals were to intentionally humiliate a severely suffering patient wishing
to die227 or if the medical treatment in such a scenario were to be found to be genuinely

An example of a case that Dorscheidt references in support of this argument is R.R. v. Poland, no. 27617/04, ECHR
2011 (extracts), where the Court found a violation of article 3 due to the treatment of a pregnant woman by medical
practitioners. The applicant had been informed that the fetus is likely to have a genetic disorder and wished to do
genetic tests on the fetus in order to terminate the pregnancy in the case of such a disorder, which was not provided
for her despite her being legally entitled to it. The denial of a genetic test along with other forms of treatment she was
subjected to by the medical practitioners lead the Court to hold that the applicant had been humiliated by the treatment.

appalling.228 Dorscheidt argues however that if there is a risk of a breach of the right to life it would
be illogical to allow the possibility of such a breach only to ensure that article 3 is not breached.229
3.3. Autonomy and death with dignity
The applicant in the Pretty case argued that the right to self-determination was guaranteed under
article 8 in the Convention and that this right encompassed the right to decide about one’s own
body. This included, according to the applicant, a right to decide when and how to die. Her rights
under article 8 (1) had therefore according to her been interfered with.230
The Court held that the term “private life” was not “susceptible to exhaustive definition” and that
despite a right to self-determination not being established under article 8, personal autonomy is
“an important principle underlying the interpretation of its guarantees”.231 The Court noted that
when the private conduct of an individual has been interfered with through compulsory or criminal
measures, it has been considered to be an interference in that individuals private life within the
meaning of article 8 (1), even when the conduct has been potentially harmful to that individual, or
perhaps even when it is of life threatening nature. This type of interference requires therefore a
justification according to the second paragraph of the article.232 The Court noted that rights under
article 8 (1) may be engaged if a patient who refuses to take medicine is forced to take it against
their own will, even in cases where the medicine would prolong the patient’s life.233
The Court stated that human dignity and human freedom are the very essence of the Convention
and that “[i]n an era of growing medical sophistication combined with longer life expectancies,
many people are concerned that they should not be forced to linger on in old age or in states of
advanced physical or mental decrepitude which conflict with strongly held ideas of self and
personal identity.”234 The Court held that the applicant’s right to private life may have been
interfered with, by stating that it “not prepared to exclude that this constitutes an interference with
her right to respect for private life”.235 Grégor Puppinck and Claire de la Hougue argue that the

Court may have already “admitted” by this statement that the choice to die is within the scope of
the article. They argue that if that is the case, States must be able to justify any restriction to the
choice.236
The Court decided to consider whether there was a justification in accordance with article 8 (2).237
When assessing whether the prohibition on assisted suicide was justified under article 8 (2) the
Court considered the margin of appreciation that States enjoy. It held that although the margin of
appreciation had been found to be narrow regarding an individual’s sexual life, the Court held that
the case in question was of different nature.238 The applicant argued that blanket ban on assisted
suicide was disproportionate.239 The Court held that the applicant was not in the category of
vulnerable that the domestic law was intended to protect but noted that as the state of terminally
ill individuals varies, and some of them will fall under this category.240 It held that “[i]t is primarily
for States to assess the risk and the likely incidence of abuse if the general prohibition on assisted
suicides were relaxed or if exceptions were to be created”241 The Court found neither the blank
prohibition on assisted suicide nor the refusal of the DPP to give an undertaking to be
disproportionate.242 The Court held therefore that the interference was justified under article 8 (2)
and article 8 was not breached.243
Complaints regarding the United Kingdom laws on assisted suicide were again addressed by the
Court in the inadmissibility decision of Nicklinson and Lamb v. the United Kingdom.244 The first
applicant in the case was the late wife of Tony Nicklinson, a man who suffered from locked in
syndrome.245 Mr. Nicklinson wished to end his life through suicide but was unable to do so himself.
His only legal option under the domestic law was to starve himself to death. In 2007 he made a

ones to watch, he wished to be killed through an injection of a lethal drug, which was illegal.246
After the High Court dismissed his claims that assistance in his suicide should be allowed legally,
he started to refuse nutrition and hydration, as well as refusing medical treatment. He died in
August 2012.247 The first applicant’s appeal to the Court of Appeals was unsuccessful, 248 as well
as her appeal to the Supreme Court.249
The first applicant’s claims before the ECtHR was based on article 8. She claimed that both her
and her late husband’s rights under article 8 had been breached, as she held that the domestic courts
did not assess whether the domestic law was compatible with her rights under article 8.250 The
Court held that the procedural protections of article 8 could not be extend to a State being obliged
to examine the merits of a challenge of primary law.251 The Court held that as the Supreme Court
held that the applicant had failed to show that developments after the Pretty case meant that the
blanket ban was disproportionate, it had assessed the compatibility of the law in relation to article
8.252 The Court found the application of the first applicant to be manifestly ill-founded.253
The second applicant in the case was irreversibly paralyzed due to a car accident254 and wished to
end his life as he could no longer enjoy it. Due to being almost fully paralyzed this would however
require a lethal injection, in other words active voluntary euthanasia.255 The second applicant
complained in front of the Court on the basis of articles 6, 8, 13 and 14, claiming that these articles
were breached as the State did not provide the possibility for him to seek the authority of the court
to allow a third person to give him a lethal injection.256 The second applicant’s application was
however deemed as inadmissible before the Court as the applicant had failed to exhaust all
domestic remedies.257

A case from 2011, Haas v. Switzerland,258 focused largely on article 8 regarding assisted suicide.
The applicant in the case suffered from a serious bipolar affective disorder and had during his 20
years of suffering from the disorder tried to commit suicide twice and had stayed in a psychiatric
hospital several times.259 While euthanasia is prohibited in Switzerland, assisted suicide is legal.260
However, article 15 of the Swiss Penal Code prohibits assisting someone in suicide if they do it
for selfish reasons.261 There is an association in Switzerland called “Dignitas” which has as one of
its objectives to assure death with dignity for its members.262 The applicant in the Haas case
became a member of the association and asked the for assistance in his suicide. He was denied
several times the lethal substance that he asked for.263
After several failed attempts of the applicant to obtain the lethal sustenance264 and after taking the
matter to the domestic courts, which held that article 8 does not impose States with an obligation
to provide the applicant with the lethal substance he asked for,265 the applicant took the matter to
the ECtHR. The applicant complained about the conditions required to obtain the lethal
subsidence, basing his complaint on article 8. He claimed that he had a right under the article to
choose the time and manner of his death and that the State is obliged to provide a person in a
situation such as his with the medical products required to commit suicide.266
The Court considered that deciding how and when to die is an aspect of the right to private life
within the meaning of article 8, with the condition that the individual can freely come to the
decision.267 The Court noted that the case in question differed from the Pretty case in a few ways.
The applicant in the case was not terminally ill, he was not unable to commit suicide due to his
condition and he alleged that the State was obliged to provide him with a lethal sustenance in order

to avoid an undignified suicide, as opposed to the Pretty case that concerned the freedom to die.268
The Court decided to examine the case “from the perspective of a positive obligation on the State
to take the necessary measures to permit a dignified suicide”.269
The Court noted again that as the Convention must be interpreted as a whole, the obligation to
protect the lives of the vulnerable under article 2 must be considered. The authorities of a State
must protect the vulnerable from actions that threaten their lives, even when they are at the risk of
taking their own life. The decision to commit suicide must be taken “freely and with full
understanding of what is involved”.270
The Court held that States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation regarding end of life decisions, as
there is no consensus among European countries regarding the issue.271 The Court held that Swiss
authorities had a legitimate aim to restrict the availability of lethal substances to patients with
prescriptions, namely, to protect individuals from hasty decisions and to prevent abuse. The aim
was also ensuring that only mentally capable individuals could obtain lethal doses of such
substances.272 The Court found such restrictions to be especially important in States that do allow
assisted suicide in order to prevent abuse.273 It held that the law in Switzerland that required a
prescription in order to obtain a lethal dose of a substance functioned as a way to ensure that the
decision is taken with free will.274 The Court concluded by stating that “even assuming that the
States have a positive obligation to adopt measures to facilitate the act of suicide with dignity, the
Swiss authorities have not failed to comply with this obligation in the instant case.”275
As Rietiker mentions, the Haas case differs from the Pretty case in a considerable way, as the case
concerned a State’s possible positive obligation to facilitate suicide, rather than a negative
obligation to abstain from interference with a right, as was the case in Pretty.276 He criticized the
Court’s vague, and perhaps even contradictory language regarding the possible obligation to in
certain situations facilitate suicide. On the one hand the Court seems to indicate that such an

obligation exists by stating that it “considers that it is appropriate to examine the applicant’s
request to obtain access to sodium pentobarbital without a medical prescription from the
perspective of a positive obligation on the State to take the necessary measures to permit a dignified
suicide”277 while on the other hand it held that “even assuming that the States have a positive
obligation to adopt measures to facilitate the act of suicide with dignity […]”,278 thereby leaving
the question open.279 Rietker identifies a few positive aspects in the Haas case. The case is the first
one to confirm that article 8 protects the right to choose how and when to die. The Court also
established in the case that a requirement of an expert opinion in order to access a lethal substance
is a suitable procedure to be taken to prevent abuse in a State where assisted suicide is authorized.
He also held that the case was examined by the Court to a great extent without bypassing the claims
made by the applicant.280
Although the Court did not confirm a positive obligation to facilitate suicide in the Haas case, it
has been argued that the case recognizes the right for an individual to end their own life.281 As
rights under article 8 are not absolute, and these rights can be restricted if the restrictions comply
with article 8 (2), also the right to choose how and when to die can be restricted. As Wicks notes,
arguing for the legalization of assisted suicide can be problematic, as the rights of others in the
society need to be considered. She emphasizes the need to protect the vulnerable by stating that
“the danger that vulnerable persons, especially the elderly or those suffering from a terminal
illness, might be bullied into ending their lives provides a restraint upon the law’s ability to protect
autonomous choices to die in this context”.282 The issue concerning the protection of vulnerable
individuals will be discussed further below.283
Negri argues that due to the margin of appreciation that States enjoy regarding assisted suicide,
the Court implied in the Haas case that the Swiss law was indeed compatible with the

Convention.284 She also interpreted the Courts decision in the case to mean that States have no
positive obligation to ensure that individuals can die with dignity.285 An opposing view has
however also been proposed. Puppinck and de la Hougue argue that the Haas case shows a
development from a liberty to a right regarding assisted suicide.286 They note that the Court moved
away from its original wording used in the Pretty case, namely that that suicide rather than natural
death is an exercise of choice,287 to referring to “right to decide by what means and at what point
his or her life will end” in the Haas case.288 G R Sullivan argues that the Haas case recognized a
right to die under article 8 (1),289 but that it is not an unqualified right, since it is restricted to those
who are free to make the choice.290
Black calls the judgement in the Haas case a “hesitant recognition […] of a positive obligation on
the State to adopt measures facilitating ‘dignified’ suicide”.291 She argues that States that have
blanket prohibitions on assisted suicide will struggle more justifying such a position compared to
States like Switzerland that allow assisted suicide, as it will be more difficult to show that such a
prohibition is proportionate to a legitimate aim under article 8 (2). She holds justifications of a
blanket prohibitions such as the one in England to be at first glance difficult to justify, as she deems
it to contradict the principle that rights must be practical and effective, which has been established
in the ECtHR’s case law.292 Nonetheless, as she explains, due to the wide margin of appreciation
that States enjoy regarding end-of-life situations such a blanket prohibition may be justified.293
However, Black seems somewhat convinced of the existence of a positive obligation to facilitate
suicide, as she analyses whether the law in the United Kingdom can comply with the obligation.294

The right to choose how and when to die in the Haas case has been argued based on the case to
extend to individuals suffering from psychiatric disabilities.295
When analysing the Swiss law on assisted suicide after the Haas case, Black notes that clarifying
that assisted suicide is authorized also for individuals with psychiatric disorders, rather than solely
for individuals who are terminally ill or whose suffering is of somatic nature, clarifies for
physicians the boundaries of legal assisted suicide. This may be beneficial for physicians as they
can act with more certainty when prescribing lethal substances, but according to Black it may not
benefit the individuals seeking assisted suicide. Patients suffering from psychiatric disabilities in
Switzerland still have it more difficult when it comes to receiving a prescription for a lethal
substance. Black speculates that the requirements imposed on individuals suffering from
psychiatric disorders are placed because it is harder to recognize suffering originating form a nonsomatic source.296
The following year of the Haas case there was another end of life case where the applicant relied
on article 8 in the Convention, namely the case of Koch v. Germany.297 In this case the applicant
was not an individual wanting to commit suicide, but rather the husband of a late wife. His late
wife had fallen in front of her doorstep and was almost completely paralyzed due to it. She required
artificial ventilation and constant care and suffered from spasms. She was expected to live at least
15 more years. She wished to commit suicide with the help of her husband as she did not want to
live a life that she felt was undignified.298 She tried to obtain a prescription to a lethal dose of a
substance in order to commit suicide at home but was refused it based on the domestic law in
Germany, which criminalized assisted suicide.299
The applicant and his late wife took the matter to the Federal Court in Germany, which held that
due to article 2 in the Convention a State cannot have an obligation to assist someone in committing
suicide.300 The applicant’s late wife committed suicide with the help of Dignitas in Switzerland in
February 2005,301 after which the applicant continued lodging complaints to the domestic courts

without success.302 The Cologne Administrative Court declared the applicant’s complaint as
inadmissible, as it held that the applicant could not claim that his own rights had been violated.303
The North-Rhine Westphalia Administrative Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s request for
appeal and the Federal Constitutional Court also found declared his complaints inadmissible.304
The applicant based his arguments in front of the ECtHR on article 8 in the Convention, that is to
say that his rights had been breached.305 He based the claims on that he had a personal interest that
his wife’s wish be respected, and that the refusal of the authorities to authorize her assisted suicide
“had immediate repercussions on his own state of health.”306 Similarly to previous assisted suicide
cases, the applicant claimed that article 8 contained the right to choose how and when to die.307
The Court held that the case in question had to be differentiated from cases where an individual is
complaining on behalf of a diseased individual, as in this case the applicant claimed that his own
rights had been breached.308 The Court held that the applicant had an exceptionally close
relationship to the diseased person and that he could claim to have been directly affected by the
refusal for authorities to authorize his late wife’s assisted suicide.309 The Court noted that even if
a substantive right under the Convention had not yet been established, it may still be possible for
a right to judicial review to exists under article 8.310 Considering these factors and previous case
law regarding assisted dying, the Court held that the applicant’s right to respect for private life
under article 8 (1) had been interfered with, as the domestic courts had refused to examine the
merits in the case.311 As the Court examined whether the interference could be justified under
article 8 (2), it held that the applicant’s procedural rights had been breached, as it did not find that
the State was justified not to examine the merits in his case.312 The Court decided not to rule on
the merits of the claims due to the principle of subsidiarity.313

The finding that the husband could be a victim of a violation in this situation differed completely
from the previously established concept of a victim. Puppinck and de La Hougue question the
Courts decision, as they note that the Court did not clarify how the applicant’s rights were involved.
As they note, it is easy to see how his feelings were involved, but it is more challenging to
determine how his rights were involved. They propose two possibilities as to how his rights could
have been involved; either through a right to his wife’s death or that he has a right that concerns
the conditions of her death.314 They criticize the Court for perhaps not considering the issue of the
victim status from a strict legal rationality viewpoint, but rather from the viewpoint of the
applicant’s feelings. A third option they propose to the establishing of the applicant’s victim status
is that as the assistant in the suicide “both provides the means by which the individual desiring
suicide can actualise their right to take their life while also benefitting from the personal right of
the suicidal person”.315
Gross v. Switzerland316 was a case that was declared inadmissible after it came to the knowledge
of the Court that the applicant had already committed suicide before the Chamber had adopted its
decision on the case.317 The case concerned an elderly woman who wished to end her life as her
physical and mental faculties declined with time.318 She was denied a prescription to a lethal
sustenance in order to commit suicide and claimed that this breached her right under article 8 in
the Convention to decide by what means and when she would die.319 In May 2013 the Chamber
delivered a judgement in which it held that there had been a violation of article 8, but at that time
the Court was not aware of the fact that the applicant was already dead.320 In that judgement the
Swiss law was found to be in breach of article 8 because it was found not to be sufficiently clear
as it did not give clear guidelines on under which circumstances someone should be able to obtain
a lethal dose of a substance in order to commit suicide.321 Much like in previous case-law, the

Court only assessed the case through procedural standards, while not ruling on the substantive
issues.322
Tiensuu argues that the judgement in Gross indicates that States can have a positive obligation
under article 8 to specify when citizens are free from prosecution when assisting someone in
committing suicide and to assure that citizens are not denied assistance in suicide because of a
groundless fear of criminal charges.323 He argues that in cases where States do accept assisted
suicide, it has to be clear when such assistance is accepted.324
Dorscheidt proposes, based on the case law of the ECtHR in end-of-life situations, that the relevant
question has moved from being the question about the legal status of the freedom to choose to end
one’s life to being what the limitations of such as right can be. 325 However, as Rainey et al note,
when examining the case law relating to assisted suicide and active euthanasia, the Court remains
rather silent on the substantive standards, and is more willing to address the procedural standards.
Rainey et al argue that it is clear that seeking to die with dignity through suicide does fall within
the protection of article 8, but they are not convinced that the article yet encompasses a right to a
specific means of death. This is because of conflicting obligations under article 2 and the wide
margin of appreciation that States enjoy on the subject.326
Puppinck and de la Hougue argue that the Court’s establishment of violations of procedural rights
relating to assisted suicide suggests that substantive rights relating to assisted suicide exist. They
base their argument on the inherent nature of a procedural obligation, as an “accessory to the
principal material right”.327 In other words, in order to have a procedural obligation, a material
obligation must exist first. This can be an autonomous conventional obligation or a material
obligation in the domestic law that falls within the scope of the Convention. A third, and most
common situation, is that it is both.328 They base their analysis on the procedural rights that the
Court has developed in relation to assisted suicide on the Haas case, the Koch case and the Gross

case.329 It is notable that when the article was published the Gross case had not yet been deemed
inadmissible.330
When assessing whether the underlying substantial right to assisted suicide is an independent
conventional right or not, Pupponck and de la Houge note that while in the Haas case (and the
Gross case) the domestic law authorized assisted suicide in some cases, while in the Koch case it
was criminalized. They reason that in situations such as the Koch case, where the domestic law
prohibits assisted suicide the substantive right that is behind the procedural right could be argued
to be an independent conventional right and therefore binding to all member States.331 The Court
did not conclude that in the Koch case, however.332
Puppinck and de la Hougue note that the Court has not in its case law regarding assisted dying
dismissed the possible existence of an independent conventional right to assisted dying. They
criticize the Court’s statement however in the Koch case that article 8 “may encompass a right to
judicial review even in a case in which the substantive right in question had yet to be
established”.333 This statement was made based on a previous case where the right to substantive
right already existed in the domestic law,334 therefore differing from the Koch case where the
substantive right did not exist in domestic law. Consequently, they hold this argument to be
insufficient.335 They argue that “the legal basis on which the court is building a right to assisted
suicide is dubious”.336
Puppnck and de la Hougue note that while assisted suicide is a clear attack on life, the Court has
in its case law increasingly disregarded article 2, along with article 17, which prohibits the abuse
of rights under the Convention. They argue that a conventional right to assisted suicide and
euthanasia should not be possible due to article 17 and yet the Court has established that article 8
encompasses a right to decide how and when to die. The way they interpret the judgement of the
Court in the Haas case, is that in cases where a State allows assisted suicide or euthanasia article
2 only places positive procedural obligations on the State to ensure that the suicide is autonomous.

Therefore, they interpret autonomy to be the source and the condition of the right to suicide. They
argue based on the Haas case that autonomy has replaced the right to life in hierarchy as the
highest-ranking human right.337
In the Koch case and the Gross case, the Court does not mention article 2 in its judgement. The
statement by the Court that “[w]ithout in any way negating the principle of sanctity of life protected
under the Convention, the Court considers that it is under Article 8 that notions of the quality of
life take on significance”, which was first stated in the Pretty case,338 was again stated in the
Koch339 case and in the Gross case.340 Puppnck and de la Hougue interpret this as the Court moving
away from an objective right to life and putting more value on the quality of life instead, which is
more of a subjective conception.341
3.4. Assisted suicide as a belief
As noted by Wicks, little attention has been given to the potential applicability of article 9 in endof-life cases.342 So far rights under article 9 have only been assessed by the ECtHR in one case of
assisted suicide/active euthanasia.343 The applicant in the Pretty case claimed that her rights under
article 9 in the Convention had been violated because she believed in the notion of assisted
suicide.344 The Court assessed the claims in the case under article 9 shortly, stating that “not all
opinions or convictions constitute beliefs in the sense protected by Article 9 § 1 of the
Convention”345 and that “[h]er claims do not involve a form of manifestation of a religion or belief,
through worship, teaching, practice or observance[…]”346 The Court found no violation of article
9.347 Since the Pretty case article 9 has not been invoked in other cases regarding assisted dying.
Despite the ECtHR holding that there was no violation of article 9 in the Pretty case, Wicks has
analysed whether the article might still be relevant in assisted suicide in her thesis Dying with

argues that the Court has changed its approach on what constitutes a manifestation of a belief.349
She notes that the scope of article 9 reaches beyond simply the right not to hold religious beliefs,
as it has been shown to encompass the right to hold some specific secular beliefs such as
pacifism.350
Mark Campbell presents some reasons why article 9 (1) may not be deemed to be engaged. One
of them is if the belief is not genuinely held. Another one is if the belief is not one that qualifies
under the article, as not all beliefs do. Also, even if article 9 (1) protects the belief in questions,
the expression of such a belief may be justly restricted.351 In the case of Eweida and Others v. the
United Kingdom,352 the Court held that the rights under article 9 encompass “views that attain a
certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance”.353 Wicks notes that these
standards may be easier met by some beliefs compared to others, taking beliefs form mainstream
religion as an example of beliefs that may pass the test easier. She also acknowledges that wellestablished schools of thought outside of religion may pass the test rather easily, as opposed to a
single-issue belief.354 In X v Federal Republic of Germany355 the applicant did not want to be
buried in a cemetery with Christian symbols after he dies but preferred instead to be buried on his
own land. The Commission held that the applicant’s wish could not be “considered as a
manifestation of his belief by a ’practice’”.356 Wicks argues that the standard set out by the
Commission for the term “belief” “arguably presupposes a quasi-religious approach to belief
systems”,357 as the Commission

stated that the applicant’s wish in the case

was not

a

“manifestation of any belief in the sense that some coherent view on fundamental problems can be
seen as being expressed thereby”.358

According to Wicks, a personal belief may be more likely to fall within the scope of article 9 if
there is a “formation of an association which will imply a level of formality”.359 She also argues
that non-religious beliefs are at a disadvantage compared to religious beliefs when it comes to
assessing whether they amount to a belief within the scope of article 9. According to her, this is
because “establishing that a belief is sufficiently serious and presents a coherent view on
fundamental problems is a much harder task in the absence of a widely respected body of opinion
which presents an agreed solution to transcendental issues”.360
As is stated in article 9 in the Convention, manifestation of a belief can be in the form of “worship,
teaching, practice and observance”.361 Wicks argues that non-religious beliefs are again at a
disadvantage, as the display of non-religious beliefs may resemble more social or political
action.362 She argues however that the Court has taken a new approach in its requirements
regarding a manifestation of a belief and focuses largely on the Eweida case to demonstrate this.363
Two of the applicants in the case claimed that their rights to manifest their beliefs had been
breached as their employers did not allow them to visibly wear a cross necklace.364 Wicks argues
that the Court adapted a broad approach on manifestation of belief,365 as the Court stated that:
In order to count as a “manifestation” within the meaning of Article 9, the act in question must be intimately
linked to the religion or belief. An example would be an act of worship or devotion which forms part of the
practice of a religion or belief in a generally recognised form. However, the manifestation of religion or belief
is not limited to such acts; the existence of a sufficiently close and direct nexus between the act and the
underlying belief must be determined on the facts of each case. In particular, there is no requirement on the
applicant to establish that he or she acted in fulfilment of a duty mandated by the religion in question.366

As Wicks notes, this broader interpretation means that a manifestation within the meaning of
article 9 does not need to be considered as appropriate by a specific religion or belief, but rather
has to be assessed in context and the act must be sufficiently closely linked to the belief.367 This
development might make it possible for article 9 to be relevant in assisted dying according to

Wicks, but even if assisted dying constituted a belief under article 9, the possibility of a
restriction on such a belief being justified under article 9(2) still exists.368
The challenge with engaging article 9 in cases of assisted dying is the disadvantage of nonreligious beliefs according to Wicks,369 despite her believing that the wish of dying with dignity
satisfies most of the requirements set out by the Court in the Eweida case.370 The challenging
part is the question of whether wanting to die with dignity “presents a coherent and cogent view
on the fundamental problem of dying”.371 There is no consensus on assisted dying being the
most dignified way to hasten death as opposed to palliative care.372
Wicks argues that after the Eweida case, the most significant difficulty would likely not be to
find a close link between dying with dignity and a manifestation of the belief, but rather
elevating it to a belief within the meaning of article 9.373 Elevating an individualistic belief in
dying with dignity to what would be considered a belief under article 9 remains unlikely,
according to Wicks, due to the difficulties she presented in her paper.374
There is a limited exception to legal obligations based on conscience that has been recognized
in the case law of the ECtHR.375 Wicks therefore considers the possibility of assisted dying
being protected under article 9 through a conscientious objection as well.376 In Bayatyan v.
Armenia377 the Court held that article 9 was applicable, despite the article not specifically
referring to a right to conscientious objection, as the applicant was a Jehovah’s Witness and
was objecting to military service due to his religion.378 The Court found that there had been an
interference in the applicant’s rights under article 9 and that they were not justified under article
9 (2).379 Wicks argues that despite the applicant in the case relying on a mainstream religion as
a reason to conscientious objection, the reasoning should withstand without it. Dying with

dignity may meet the standards set out in the case,380 namely that a prohibition of assisted dying
is in “serious and insurmountable conflict” with a “person’s conscience or his deeply and
genuinely held religious or other beliefs”.381
Another view has been presented by James E. Hurford, who suggests that conscious objections
to military service is an exception and would not be applicable regarding other issues. He argues
that if a general obligation is applied neutrally it is unlikely to breach article 9. His interpretation
of article 9 is that it does not appear to entail a duty on States to provide a general exemption
from legal duties through conscientious objections. He interprets military service as being
merely an exception.382
Although Hurford is not convinced that there is a general right to conscientious objection, based
on the partly dissenting opinion of judges Vučinić and Gaetano in the Eweida case, he
hypothesizes the possibility that if a genuinely held objection entails sufficient “cogency,
seriousness, cohesion and importance”383 rights under article 9 may have been interfered with.
The partly dissenting judges used the following definition of conscience:
Conscience – by which is meant moral conscience – is what enjoins a person at the appropriate moment to do
good and to avoid evil. In essence it is a judgment of reason whereby a physical person recognises the moral
quality of a concrete act that he is going to perform, is in the process of performing, or has already completed.
This rational judgment on what is good and what is evil, although it may be nurtured by religious beliefs, is
not necessarily so, and people with no particular religious beliefs or affiliations make such judgments
constantly in their daily lives.384

The partly dissenting opinion in the case was that prescriptions of conscience must be separated
from religious prescriptions, such as not eating certain foods or wearing religious clothing.
According to the partly dissenting judges, the former cannot be justified under article 9 (2)
while the latter can. They held that when there is a genuine and serious conscientious objection,
a State has both positive and negative obligations to respect it based on the freedom of
conscience.385 Hurford argues that manifesting conscience is fundamentally different from

manifesting belief. When manifesting conscience, one must act on what he calls “inward
perceived and held moral and ethical precepts”, while manifesting belief is about “outward
obligations” that a person follows due to their beliefs. Hurford holds that there ought to be a
difference between restrictions imposed on how one presents one’s beliefs and obliging an
individual to act in contrast with their conscience.386
Furthermore, if such an interference on the right under article 9 cannot be justified under the
second provision of the article, a State may be obliged to allow individuals to object to an act
if it violates their fundamentally held values. He also notes that even if the dissenting opinion
is not correct, an argument for a conscientious objection could be made based on article 14 in
conjunction with article 9, and that a breach of the Convention may be found that way.387
Wicks argues that applying conscious objections to prohibitions of assisted dying would allow
States to abide by the positive obligations of States to protect the right to life and to respect the
principle of the sanctity of life, while still allowing an exemption for a minority whose
conscience does not oppose to an “unnatural” death. She furthermore suggests that this might
even be a preferable option to arguing for the right to assisted suicide through rights under
article 8 in the Convention. Her reasoning is that arguments based on autonomy under article 8
may open doors to anyone who decides to die through assisted dying, while “Article 9 would
only protect those whose conscience genuinely requires a limited exemption from the usual
legal rules”.388 She goes on to explain her reasoning by stating that:
In western societies where the generally applicable law is frequently founded upon, and
sometimes still developed upon, Judaeo-Christian values, a limited exemption for those
whose belief systems have different priorities (human dignity over sanctity of life, for
example) could serve a vital role in ensuring that we can all live freely, guided by our
own consciences in relation to the dying process.389
Article 9 has also been used as an argument to support the notion that medical practitioners
have a right to assist individuals in committing suicide. After all, when it comes to States
where assisted suicide is criminalized it is the person who assists in the suicide who suffers
the consequences of the criminalization.390 John Adenitire presents arguments for why such

a right may exist based on article 9, despite the Court finding no violation of article 9 in the
Pretty case. In the Pretty case, the applicant stated that she “believed in and supported the
notion of assisted suicide for herself”.391 Adenitire therefore argues that she presented her
argument relying on autonomy rather than a value of conscience. He argues that this is less
likely to be an issue when it comes to a medical practitioner. It is hardly for the practitioner’s
autonomy or personal benefit that they choose to aid someone in committing suicide.
Adenitire finds it convincing that a medical practitioner may be acting on what they deem
to be a moral obligation in certain circumstances to help someone who requests it commit
suicide. He believes if such a medical practitioner, who is acting out of sympathy, were to
invoke article 9 with a different outcome than in the Pretty case.392
Another argument Adenitire presents is that a medical practitioner could, based on a
conscientious objection, invoke article 9, as he argues it is possible that it meets the
requirements in the Bayatyan case. The medical practitioner feels that he must help the
patient wishing to die. He must choose to act either on his conscience or the law. The conflict
is serious as he may be criminally sanctioned if he acts on his conscience. Adenitire believes
many medical practitioners would be able to show that the belief is cogent, serious, coherent
and important.393
Adenitire emphasizes that conscientious objections need not be refusals to do something. He
bases the argument on the wording in article 9, as the article protects the right “to manifest
his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance”394 and that the article
protects positive acts as well as negative ones. He argues that this is clear from the Eweida
case.395
When it comes to the protection of the vulnerable as a justification under article 9, Adenitire
uses the arguments made by the court in a Canadian case, Carter v. Canada.396 To

summarize the arguments he presented from the Canadian case for why a blanket prohibition
on assisted dying is not necessary:
1. Doctors can asses the legitimacy of a request of assisted dying and that they can use
already existing investigations related to other end-of-life medical decisions397
2. Risks related to a permissive assisted dying law can be controlled “through a
carefully designed and monitored system of safeguard”398
3. “A theoretical or speculative fear cannot justify an absolute prohibition”399
4. It should not be assumed that regulatory framework or criminal sanctions will
function defectively and that a slippery slope into involuntary euthanasia will occur
as a result400
One last question to address regarding conscientious objections is the potential conscientious
objection against assisted dying by medical practitioners. The Court has rejected claims
regarding conscientious objections for example in the case of Pichon and Sajous v.
France,401 where two pharmacists refused to sell contraceptives to three women. The
pharmacists complained in front of the Court that they had a right to refuse selling the
contraceptives based on article 9. The Court however held that since contraceptives were
legal and were only sold in pharmacies “the applicants cannot give precedence to their
religious beliefs and impose them on others as justification for their refusal to sell such
products, since they can manifest those beliefs in many ways outside the professional
sphere.”402 As Campbell notes, based on this case it may seem like conscientious objections
within healthcare are simply not protected by article 9. This is, however, not necessarily the
case, as Campbell notes that it was an inadmissibility decision that lacked any in depth
reasoning by the Court. It may be the case that the conscientious objection in the case did
not amount to a manifestation of the belief they had. He furthermore emphasizes the factual
context in the case. The pharmacists had acted in contradiction to a criminal law. Lastly, he

emphasizes the wide margin of appreciation regarding restrictions of article 9 that States
generally enjoy.403
3.5. An exception to a blanket prohibition of assisted suicide for physically disabled people?
3.5.1. The slippery slope and the risk of abuse
An argument used against the authorization of euthanasia is the slippery slope argument. Slippery
slope arguments entail that if a specific action is authorized, then it will lead to something else
which is morally wrong being authorized too. In the case of euthanasia this would mean moving
from a restrictive authorization of voluntary euthanasia to a more permissive authorization of
euthanasia. To support such an argument, one could take the Netherlands as an example. The law
in the Netherlands has moved from allowing euthanasia and assisted suicide exclusively for the
terminally ill, to authorizing assisted dying for others too, including the chronically ill, those
suffering from psychological pain and incompetent patients.404 Another slippery slope argument
against the authorization of euthanasia is moving from active voluntary euthanasia as practised
solely in cases of immense suffering in terminally ill patients, to accepting the practice in less
severe cases of suffering as well.405 Even if opponents of assisted dying may sometimes accept
that there are cases in which assisted dying would be acceptable, they might still oppose the
authorization of assisted dying in order to prevent the unintended deaths from happening.406
3.5.2. Blanket ban of assisted dying as discrimination
Article 14 was invoked by the applicant in the Pretty case407 and the Court decided to review the
claim as it had found rights under article 8 to be engaged in the case.408 The fact that article 8 was
not shown to have been violated does not exclude a possible breach of article 14 in conjunction
with article 8, since the article was shown to be engaged.409 As mentioned earlier, the Court has
noted that treating individuals who are in similar situations differently can be discriminatory under
certain conditions,410 but it has equally noted that when States treat individuals who are in vastly

different situations similarly, and no objective and reasonable justification can be found for the
similar treatment, the prohibition of discrimination is violated. 411
In the argument of the applicant it was stated that the applicant was “prevented from exercising a
right enjoyed by others”.412 Antje Pedain criticizes Mrs. Pretty’s counsel’s choice to use the term
right instead of a liberty to commit suicide when talking about the discrimination of disabled
people.413 The government responded to the applicants claims under article 14 by stating that no
discrimination has occurred as under the domestic law no one can be said to have a right to commit
suicide.414 The government also referenced the arguments it made regarding article 3 and 8, namely
that allowing disabled people an exception to the blanket prohibition of assisted suicide would risk
abuse and eventually lead to the practice of involuntary euthanasia. They also argued that it fell
within the margin of appreciation of the State.415 The Court addressed the argument under the
article briefly. It agreed with the government. The Court held that there were sound reasons for
not allowing exceptions to the blanket prohibition, as this would introduce a risk of abuse.416 No
violation was found of article 14.417
According to Pedain a separate justification for treating disabled individuals the same as ablebodied individuals under article 14 is necessary, as a law that results in disabled individuals not
being able to commit suicide contrary to able-bodied individuals, causes discriminatory treatment
of disabled people. But as she notes, although a prohibition that leads to inequality in that it affects
a particular group of individuals harsher than others seems to be discriminatory at first glance, a
decisive answer on whether the law is in fact discriminatory requires a look into whether the burden
on the group is placed arbitrarily.418 In the Pretty case the Court held that there was a legitimate
aim for prohibiting assisted suicide from all individuals, as it held it to be necessary in order to
prevent abuse and to protect the vulnerable.419 As noted by Pedain, the argument that it is necessary

to prohibit assisted suicide altogether, even if it come at the price that individuals such as Mrs.
Pretty have to pay, is a kind of slippery slope argument.420
Pedain criticizes the decision made by the Court regarding article 14. According to her the heavier
burden placed on disabled people under the domestic law was not justified.421 After examining the
Pretty case under articles 8 and 14, she argues that according to the law, non-vulnerable, mentally
competent individuals who are physically unable to commit suicide will have to be given an
exception from blanket prohibitions. The condition she puts forward for such an exception is that
such a law would still effectively protect the vulnerable. She is not convinced that such a law is
impossible to legislate and criticizes the lack of examination of such a possibility by the Court.422
She holds that exceptions to a blanket ban on assisted suicide are possible without risking abuse,
as a similar practice already exists with regard to refusal of medical treatment which can in some
cases lead to death. She suggests that by requiring courts and doctors to assure that the patient is
physically incapable of committing suicide, the exception to the law would not threaten the
protection of the vulnerable and able-bodied individuals in general. This would according to her
also keep the authorization of euthanasia from moving towards a more permissive law which
would eventually allow euthanasia for others as well.423
Pedain addresses another concern too, namely the threat of moral corruption in society by making
life appear as less valuable and more disposable. In her view this is not the message the exception
to a blanket prohibition of assisted suicide would send, as this exception would be based on the
principle of personal autonomy and human dignity. She argues that it would coincide with our
commitment to treat people equally in the absence of a compelling reason to do otherwise. In
reference to Mrs. Pretty she states that “[t]he reason why we respect her choice remains the same
reason that makes us respect the choice of able-bodied persons to commit suicide: not that it is the
right choice, but that it is her choice.”424
The argument that allowing assisted dying is risky as it can lead to a lack of protection of the
vulnerable is a common argument used against authorization of assisted dying, despite the fact that

evidence of it occurring in States that allow it has been argued to be weak.425 Similar comments
have been made by Tiensuu as was made by Pedain. He notes that the argument that a blanket ban
on assisted suicide is necessary in order to protect the vulnerable is inherently a slippery slope
argument.426 He is not convinced by this argument. He takes another approach than Pedain,
however. He compares assisted suicide to palliative care, which is often proposed as a better
option, albeit it is less controlled and reported compared to assisted suicide. Consent is not an issue
in assisted suicide according to him, whereas that is not the case for palliative care, which he argues
leads to unrequested deaths.427 The side effect of death that is accepted in palliative care is
commonly called “the doctrine of double effect”. It entails that when a disease progresses, doctors
may administer potentially lethal quantities of a drug such as diamorphine or morphine into a
patient in order to relieve pain. The idea behind it is that the doctor’s action is not motivated by
the potential negative effect of the drug, death, but is instead motivated by the positive effects of
it, which is relieving pain. A doctor administering such doses of a drug is therefore according to
the doctrine not guilty of murder. Interestingly, many countries that do not authorize assisted
suicide or euthanasia still authorize palliative care.428 Death is not the intended outcome in
palliative care, however, as injecting a patient with potentially lethal doses of a drug must happen
only in a situation where the risk of death is deemed to be justified in a terminally ill patient as the
pain relief it provides is perceived to outweigh the benefit of continued life.429
Tiensuu presents two different slippery slope arguments, the first one being that allowing voluntary
euthanasia and assisted suicide would lead to cases of involuntary euthanasia and the second one
being that allowing these two forms of assisted dying for terminally ill patients would lead to cases
of assisted suicide of individuals experiencing nonphysical suffering.430 He is unconvinced of both
arguments. Regarding the first type of slippery slope, he argues that the argument requires support
by empirical studies, which he claims is lacking. To the second type of slippery slope argument he
replies by stating that if we accept the underlying principles of palliative care and refusal of LST,

namely beneficence and autonomy, it should be irrelevant whether the suffering is physical or
not.431
As Tiensuu indicates, those who choose palliative care at the end of their lives need not opt for
assisted suicide instead, even when assisted suicide is available. These two forms of medical
treatment can coexist. As he states,
[a] trade-off of interests does not really take place between those who could be helped with palliative care and
those who request assisted suicide, because palliative care could be given to those who do not want assisted
suicide even if assisted suicide were also available. Rather, the trade-off is between those who could be bullied
into unwillingly ending their lives and those who could seek assisted suicide to end their lives with more dignity
and less pain432

Tiensuu observes that what is at stake is two principles that are in contradiction, namely the right
to life and the right to autonomy. He makes the interesting observation that when it comes to
withholding LST, the prohibition of intentional killing has not been argued to overrule the right to
autonomy, despite the fact that similarly to assisted suicide it will lead to death.433 He also argues
that the act of assisting someone in suicide is no more motivated by desire to kill than is killing
someone in self-defence or when it is required in a legal arrest,434 both of which are exceptions in
accordance to article 2 (a) and 2 (b) in the Convention.435 He also emphasizes the fact that
authorizing assisted suicide is not about a choice to end someone’s life, but rather about who is
allowed to decide by what means and when the patient’s life will end. Palliative care contravenes
the aim of preserving life and yet it is authorized. This leads Tiensuu to conclude, that what the
right to life opposes is the patient being allowed to choose the time and manner of their death,
which in turn is a right that individuals have under article 8.436
Wicks has also considered that an exception to a blanket prohibition could be possible without
risking the protection of the vulnerable. She argues that patients in situations such as Mrs. Pretty’s
could be given an exception to a law that prohibits assisted suicide when the law overrides the
patient’s personal autonomy. She suggests that an exception could be limited to situations where
the patient’s suffering is unbearable, and the patient is unable to commit suicide by themselves.

She bases her argument on the principle of autonomy and quality of life considerations, which she
argues pose a strong conflicting interest to States’ obligations to protect life.437
Wicks argues that in addition to vulnerable individuals, there is another group of individuals that
needs protection through law, namely the individuals who assist in suicides. She argues that since
assisted suicide involves by definition at least two people, the protection of autonomy does not
only concern the individual who wishes to die, but also the individual assisting in the suicide. Just
as vulnerable individuals may be pressured into committing suicide, individuals may also be
pressured into assisting someone in a suicide, which can lead to psychological harm. Wicks argues
therefore that if assisted suicide is authorized it is important that the law includes a conscience
clause to protect individuals who for religious reasons or otherwise do not want to participate in
an assisted suicide.438 Such a provision exists for example in Belgium, where no one can according
to the law be forced to perform or to assist in the performing of euthanasia.439

3.6. Euthanasia and assisted suicide for minor patients
When analysing the case-law of the ECtHR regarding assisted dying, it seems apparent that one of
the most important criteria for authorizing different forms of assisted dying is the patient
consenting to it as well as ensuring that the patient is mentally capable of making an informed
decision on it. As seen above, different factors can play a role in whether a State is obliged to
prevent an adult from committing suicide. But what if a child is terminally ill and is suffering to
the extent that they wish to end their life rather than continuing to live? Can a child consent to
assisted dying?
Under Dutch law, euthanasia or assisted suicide is authorized for minors between the age of 12-16
under certain conditions.440 In 2014 the act that authorized euthanasia in Belgium was amended,
resulting in the age restriction of euthanasia to be removed. Consequently, euthanasia is legal for
minors in Belgium now under certain conditions.441 Belgium is the first country in the world to

authorize euthanasia without an age limit.442 In both Belgium and the Netherlands one of the
requirements for a legitimate consent to euthanasia or assisted suicide is that the minor understand
the consequences of it.443 PACE stated its opinion in a written declaration in 2014 after the Belgian
Senate voted for the legalization of euthanasia for children, that it held that the new law “betrays
some of the most vulnerable children in Belgium by accepting that their lives may no longer have
any inherent value or worth and that they should die”.444
When it comes to assisted dying regarding minors, there may be different factors that have to be
considered compared to assisted dying in adults. Luc Bovens has identified five common moral
arguments against authorizing assisted dying to minors.445 One of the arguments he presents
concerns what the ECtHR has emphasized extensively in its end-of-life case law, namely
discernment. Bovens focuses his analysis on adolescents since he argues it is evident that young
children lack discernment. He describes capacity of discernment and a valid decision in the context
as responsive to reason and as being made by the agent themselves rather than giving the
responsibility to someone else. Bovens argues that contrary to those who argue that adolescents
lack discernment, he does not believe so. He argues that albeit the decision-making style of
adolescents may differ from adults, this does not affect the capacity of discernment, as these
differences can also be found between age groups among adults while the decision remains equally
responsive to reason.446
Another argument Bovens addresses is that adolescents lack discernment because of the influence
from their parents, as their critical thinking skills have not yet developed fully. Bovens is not
convinced by this argument either, as he argues that critical scrutiny is not required for an agent to
have authorships over their decisions. He argues that if a minor opposes to euthanasia because of
their parents’ view on euthanasia, this decision would be respected despite the lack of critical
scrutiny. Therefore, Bovens argues that the same respect should be given to minors who request
euthanasia because they grow up in a family that does not oppose euthanasia.447

A third argument Bovens presents is that the minor is being pressured into euthanasia. He argues
that the pressure on a minor to request euthanasia is likely no bigger than the pressure older
individuals may experience. In fact, he expects pressure on older individuals to be greater for
multiple reasons, one of which is that parents often cling to their children’s lives harder than adults
cling to their parents’ lives.

448

Another related argument he presents is that children are more

sensitive to pressure when compared to adults and are therefore more vulnerable. While Bovens
accepts that children may be more prone to succumb to pressure, he argues that it is still less likely
that a child opts for euthanasia due to pressure because of the aforementioned reason, that is to
say, that children are typically less pressured to request euthanasia. He also argues that parents
typically feel obliged to make things well for their children, while the same may not be true to the
same extent when it comes to adults taking care of their parents.449 The last argument he presents
is that there is a better option, namely palliative case. He dismisses this argument by stating that
this is an argument against euthanasia in general rather than an argument specifically against
euthanasia for minors.450 The arguments made by Bovens have been criticized,451 but they give
an idea on possible relevant questions regarding assisted dying in children.
There have not yet been any cases brought to the ECtHR regarding active euthanasia or assisted
suicide when it comes to minors.452 Therefore, the aforementioned concerns regarding minor
patients’ capacity to consent to active euthanasia or assisted suicide have yet to be directly
addressed by the Court. The possible outcome of such cases has been hypothesised, however.
Dorscheidt seems to consider children as belonging to the group of vulnerable individuals, as based
on the Court’s statements regarding the protection of the vulnerable in the Pretty case, he argues
that it could potentially be justified for a State that allows assisted suicide to make restrictions of
the practice on children.453 Passive euthanasia has been addressed by the Court regarding situations
involving minors. Perhaps the case law on passive euthanasia on minors can also give some

indication to how the Court would address consent of minor patient in active euthanasia or assisted
suicide. The issue of passive euthanasia on minor patients will be discussed in chapter 4.2.

4. Passive Euthanasia under the ECHR
4.1. The withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment and the right to life
As mentioned above,454 individuals who lack consciousness are protected by the right to life. While
States have an obligation to take reasonable steps to preserve life, they are not obliged to provide
an absolute right to receive medical treatment, including LST.455 When addressing the argument
that individuals who are not conscious have less of a protection of the right to life, Wicks reminds
that the view of separating persons from non-persons is both ethically and legally problematic. She
emphasizes firstly that respect should be given to the previous wishes of the patient, as a way of
respecting the interest of autonomy that individuals has. Secondly, she argues that autonomy is not
the only interest that can apply to incapacitated individuals, as many interests and rights, such as
human dignity, can still apply when the individual is not conscious. The issue of dignity can be
complex with patients in a persistent vegetative state. On the one hand, it can be argued that
withdrawing ANH leads to an undignified death, while on the other hand it can be argued that
keeping such an individual alive with life prolonging treatment leads to an undignified life.456
What is tricky about situations of patients in a vegetative state is that they cannot consent to
treatment or alternatively refuse consent to treatment, as they do not, for obvious reasons, possess
decision-making capacity at that moment. In this situation the question arises as to how the
decision of the continuance/termination of LST must be made. There may be contradicting
opinions between for example the family of the patient and the doctors treating the patient. One
possible solution is that previous wishes of the patient are considered. These wishes can come in
the form of a living will, which is made in advance by an individual who expresses their wishes as
to what type of treatment they would like to receive/not to receive in the case that they lack decision
making capacity at the point when such an information is needed. This is usually done in written
form. Another alternative is the appointing of a healthcare power of attorney. This is a document
where an individual appoints someone to make healthcare decisions for them in case they were to

lose decision making capacity.457 There is no consensus on the regulation of these advance
directives in European countries458 and of course, not everybody makes an advance directive.
Cases regarding withdrawal of LST has been brought in front of the ECtHR, including such cases
where no advance directives were present. The Lambert case concerned the withdrawal of ANH
from a man named Vincent Lambert.459 The applicants in the case were his parents as well as his
half-brother and his sister.460 Vincent Lambert was in a chronic vegetative state after a car accident
in 2008.461 At the time of the case Vincent Lambert was in Reims University Hospital where he
received ANH.462 The Coma Science Group at the University of Liège concluded that Vincent
Lambert was in a “chronic neuro-vegetative state characterized as ‘minimally conscious plus’”.463
Vincent Lambert received several physiotherapy sessions and speech and language therapy
sessions that were all unsuccessful.464
Dr. Kariger, Vincent Lambert’s doctor, announced in January 2014, as a result of a meeting where
five out of six doctors agreed on it, to withdraw the treatment.465 Dr. Kariger was convinced that
continuing with the treatment would have been against the patient’s wishes.466 Vincent Lambert
had not drawn any advance directives, however. Dr. Kariger’s conclusions on the patient’s wishes
were based on wishes he had expressed to his wife and brother before the accident.467
After the Conseil d’État declared that Dr. Kariger’s decision on withdrawing the treatment was
lawful,468 the applicants complained to the ECHR, claiming that withdrawing the treatment was in
breach of articles 2, 3 and 8 in the Convention.469 The Court found that the applicants could not
complain on behalf of Vincent Lambert but went on to examine the substantive issues on the
applicants’ own behalf.470

End of life issues are regulated in France under the so called “Leonetti Act”, which, in the Court’s
words, does not authorize euthanasia or assisted suicide, albeit it allows withdrawal of LST under
certain criteria.471 As with previous end-of-life cases above, the Court again held that States have
a certain margin of appreciation regarding end of life issues. 472 Regarding the decision-making
process, as in this case there was no advance directives or a designated person of trust, the Court
noted that it varies between States. The final decision may be taken either by the doctor, the doctor
together with the family, the family alone or by a legal representative or courts.473
The Court held that the decision-making process falls within the margin of appreciation of States,
and that it was in accordance with article 2 in this case, despite the fact that the family members
had differing views on whether or not to end the LST.474 The Court emphasized the importance of
the patient’s own wishes, holding that even when the patient is unable to express their wishes his
“consent must remain at heart”.475 The Court has previously in the Pretty case stated that
individuals have the right to refuse life-prolonging treatment and held therefore in the Lambert
case that Conseil d’État was authorized to take into consideration the wishes he had shared with
his wife and brother.476 The State had fulfilled its positive obligations under article 2 and there was
no violation of the article.477
The judgement in the Lambert case was not a unanimous decision, as there were disagreements on
several points in the case. Five partly dissenting judges in the case emphasized that articles 2 and
3 do not contain a negative aspect in that one does not have a right to die under article 2, nor does
one have a right to be subjected to ill-treatment under article 3, for example by being “beaten,
tortured or starved to death”.478 They were not convinced that Vincent Lambert had clearly
expressed a wish not to be kept alive in a situation such as where he in this case found himself to
be, as he had not written advance directives or designated a person of trust. They stated that “[e]ven
if, for the sake of argument, Vincent Lambert had indeed expressed the view that he would have

refused to be kept in a state of great dependency, such a statement does not in our view offer a
sufficient degree of certainty regarding his desire to be deprived of food and water.”479 They also
did not agree that Vincent Lambert was in an end-of-life situation.480
The partly dissenting judges held that there was no question about whether Vincent Lambert was
alive, as he was not braindead and was able to breathe on his own as well as digest food, albeit he
was, at best, in a minimally conscious state.481 The partly dissenting judges seem to have chosen a
definition of death which includes the cessation of all activity of the brain. 482 They held that the
State has an obligation under article 2 to keep providing Vincent Lambert with food and
water.483 As Arend Hendriks notes, when it comes to passive euthanasia, the Court “emphasises
the importance of a good and foreseeable decision-making process where all arguments expressed
are taken into account”.484

4.2. Passive euthanasia in cases of minor patients
Unlike active euthanasia and assisted suicide, passive euthanasia cases regarding minor patients
have been brought to the ECtHR. In Glass v. the United Kingdom, 485 the mother of a minor patient
complained about the administering of diamorphine to her son against her will, as well as the
placing of a do-not-resuscitate order by a doctor without her consent.486 The applicants in the case
were the mother and her son David, who was severely disabled, both mentally and physically.487
On one occasion, when David’s condition had worsened, he was admitted to a hospital, where
doctors suggested the administering of morphine in order to ease David’s distress. David’s mother
opposed it. David’s doctor furthermore believed that if David’s state was to worsen to the point of
his heart stopping, David should not be resuscitated, as he thought that would be against the child’s
best interests.488

The decision to administer diamorphine to the applicant was finally taken, against the mother’s
will, as David’s medical team believed he was dying and in need of pain relief. 489 The applicants
claimed that the dose of diamorphine that was given was suitable for adults, not for a child.490 A
do-not-resuscitate order was also placed.491 The belief of the medical team that David was dying
turned out to be false, as David’s condition improved and he was eventually released from the
hospital.492
The applicants complained in front of the ECtHR that their rights under article 8, in David’s case
the right to physical and moral integrity, had been violated. They claimed that the actions taken by
the doctors were illegal, as they administered the drug against the mother’s will without a court
decision being involved.493 The applicants claimed that in the doctors’ conduct they failed to
efficiently respect the interests of both applicants.494 The government held that in exceptional
situations of emergency the consent of a parent was not required.495 Furthermore, the government
noted that the doctors were forced to make quick decisions as the patient was in a critical situation.
They had to act in the best interests of the child.496
The Court decided to examine the case form David’s viewpoint, despite the mother also claiming
to have been a victim of a violation of article 8.497 The Court noted that the mother was David’s
legal proxy and had therefore the authority to act on behalf of David and to defend his best interests
in medical decisions. The Court noted that the mother’s objections to the administration of
diamorphine was overridden, which it considered to be an interference with David’s right to
physical integrity.498 The Court held that the actions taken by the doctors were not unlawful and
that it was clear that the doctors did not try to hasten David’s death, but rather to act in David’s
best interests.499

When assessing the necessity of the doctors actions, the Court held that the hospital could have
sought intervention by the High Court before an emergency arose, as the doctors were aware, that
she was reluctant to agree with the advice doctors had in case of an emergency. 500 It also noted
that a consent to the administering of morphine was given by the mother in a previous discussion,
but that it was clear that she had later withdrawn that consent, which the doctors failed to respect.501
The Court held that there had been a violation of article 8, as the hospital and the doctors had
overridden the mother’s objection to the treatment.502
A breach does not automatically occur when medical staff act in contrast to what the parents of a
minor wish. Gard and others v. the United Kingdom503 is an inadmissibility decision concerning
the withdrawal of LST of a minor. Charlie Gad was a baby who suffered from a severe
mitochondrial disease, which caused him to be dependent of a ventilator for breathing. He suffered
from several health issues, including severe epilepsy disorder, absence of signs of normal brain
activity and the inability to move his limbs. He was also deaf.504 Charlie’s parents wanted to try a
treatment called nucleoside treatment, which had only been used on patients with less severe
mitochondrial condition. The American doctor providing this treatment stated that there was a
theoretical possibility that the treatment might benefit Charlie,505 but after Charlie suffered from
brain seizures due to his epilepsy, the treating clinicians held that the treatment would be futile.506
The hospital where Charlie was applied to the High Court to withdraw the artificial ventilation of
Charlie, as they deemed it to be in his best interests. Charlie’s parents opposed the withdrawing of
his artificial ventilation.507 The domestic courts deemed it to be in the best interest of Charlie to
withdraw his treatment so that his suffering would not continue, rather than taking him to America
for the experimental treatment.508 The parents took the matter to the ECtHR. When the Court
addressed the issue regarding article 2, it listed three things to consider in cases of withdrawal of
LST based on the Lambert case;

- the existence in domestic law and practice of a regulatory framework compatible with the requirements of
Article 2;
- whether account had been taken of the applicant’s previously expressed wishes and those of the persons close
to him, as well as the opinions of other medical personnel;
- the possibility to approach the courts in the event of doubts as to the best decision to take in the patient’s
interests509

What makes this case different from the Lambert case, is that the patient was a baby, thus did not
have any previous wishes. However, an independent guardian was assigned to Charlie by the High
Court to protect the patient’s best interests,510 which the Court interpreted as a way to ensure
Charlie’s wishes were expressed.511 The guardian was of the opinion that taking Charlie to the
USA for the experimental treatment was not in his best interests.512 Opinions of medical personnel
were thoroughly examined; the Court was satisfied with the conduct of the domestic courts and
the views of Charlie’s parents were considered. The Court held for these reasons that the second
element of the list from the Lambert case was satisfied.513 It also found the first and third element
to be fulfilled,514 and noted the margin of appreciation that States enjoy in such issues, therefore
concluding that the applicants’ claims under article 2 being manifestly ill-founded.515
When it came to article 8, the Court reminded it has in previous case law held that treating a child
against the wishes of their parents was in violation of the child’s rights under the article.516 The
Court also reminded that it has previously considered appropriate in case of a conflict between the
wishes of the parents and the opinion of the medical personnel to refer the matter to a domestic
court. 517 It also emphasized on the broad consensus regarding the treatment of children, namely
that the child’s best interest is of primary importance.518 The Court held that there had been an
interference of the rights of the parents under article 8.519 It found however that the interference
was in accordance with the law, that it had the legitimate aim of protecting “integrity and moral”

and “rights and freedoms” of the child and that the decisions taken were not arbitrary or
disproportionate. 520 The application was declared inadmissible.521
A similar situation was presented in the inadmissibility decision Afiri and Biddarri v. France,522
which concerned the complaint of the withdrawal of LST of the applicants’ 14-year-old daughter
who was in a persistent vegetative state due to an acute cardio-respiratory failure.523 The medical
practitioners suggested the withdrawing of the LST, which the parents did not agree with.524 The
doctors tried to explain the situation of their daughter to the applicants and held it was not in the
best interest of her to continue the treatment like her parents wished, but the parents refused to
agree to the withdrawal of the treatment.525 The applicants based their complaints before the Court
on articles 2 and 8, claiming that their rights under these articles were violated because a decision
was made to withdraw the treatment of their daughter based on the doctors’ assessments despite
the fact that they opposed to it.526
Once again the Court emphasized the margin of appreciation which is left to the States when it
comes to end-of-life situations, both with regard to the balancing of right to life and the right to
private life when it comes to patients, as well as whether or not to allow cessation of LST. It also
reminded that this margin of appreciation is not without limits.527 The applicants in the case
claimed that the domestic law was not clear enough on situations where parents oppose to
withdrawing a LST from a minor child.528 However, the Court noted that it had already considered
in the Lambert case that the law was sufficiently clear. The law had been modified but not to a
significant extent. Furthermore, the applicants did not complain about the modifications to the
law.529 Doctors are obliged under the domestic law to try to seek the consent of the parents when
withdrawing LST and to make the best interests of the child a priority.530 The Court held that the

process how the domestic law requires doctors to manage situations where the parents disagree
complied with article 2 in the Convention.531
The applicants complained about the fact that parents did not share the decision-making power
with the medical professionals under the domestic law when it came to minor children.532 The
Court however held that article 2 does not impose any specific procedure to be taken to reach a
decision on whether to withdraw LST.533 The Court also noted that the procedure required by the
domestic law was followed in this case, that is to say the medical professionals had consulted the
parents of the minor patient and they tried to come to an agreement with them.
The Conseil d’État had found the information on the patient’s wishes to be contradictory, which
is why it could not be determined with certainty. It had also emphasized the importance of the
opinion of the parents in cases where the wishes of the patient as unknown but noted that the
parents had indeed been involved in the decision-making process.534 The Court concluded what it
had already stated in the Lambert case, namely that the decision-making process in the area falls
within the margin of appreciation of States.535 The Court held that even if the parents do not agree
with the decision taken regarding the withdrawing of their daughter’s treatment, the procedure
applied in the case was enough for article 2 not have been breached. 536 The Court also found that
the national authorities had complied with requirements under article 2 and therefore declared the
complaints to be manifestly ill-founded.537
Based on these cases, it seems that the best interests of the child take priority in situations of
treatment withdrawal of minor patients. However, the wishes of the parents are not completely
irrelevant either, as was shown in the Glass case. Similarly to the Lambert case, the Court did not
emphasize the need to protect the vulnerable as it has done in assisted suicide cases.

4.2. Refusing life-sustaining treatment
4.2.1. Refusing life-sustaining treatment based on personal autonomy
The right to decide how and when to die originated in the Pretty case,538 and was further described
in the Haas case.539 Black argues that despite these cases addressing assisted suicide, the
applicability of article 8 reaches beyond it and may apply in multiple different end-of-life
scenarios, including the right to refuse LST.540 Black notes that the right to decide how and when
to die is “somewhat loose”, as interference is permissible in some situations with accordance to
the second paragraph of article 8.541 Black therefore argues that it is a prima facie right and
therefore suggests that it is preferable to call it a freedom rather than a right.542
As Black specifies, because the freedom to refuse LST is connected to personal autonomy, it
follows that there are situations where such a refusal is not an expression of that freedom.
Therefore, article 8 does not apply to non-autonomous refusals to LST.543 In the Pretty case the
Court stated that
In the sphere of medical treatment, the refusal to accept a particular treatment might, inevitably, lead to a fatal
outcome, yet the imposition of medical treatment, without the consent of a mentally competent adult patient,
would interfere with a person's physical integrity in a manner capable of engaging the rights protected under
Article 8 § 1 of the Convention. As recognised in domestic case-law, a person may claim to exercise a choice
to die by declining to consent to treatment which might have the effect of prolonging his life544

Tiensuu interprets the right to refuse LST as a right to be allowed to die. As he notes, however, the
House of Lords Selected Committee held that “[t]he right to refuse medical treatment is far
removed from the right to request assistance in dying”.545 Tiensuu interprets the Courts judgement
in the Pretty case as agreeing with this statement. He notes however that this is not a self-evident
conclusion, as the opposite interpretation has been taken by the Netherlands, which he argues
based its legalization of assisted suicide on the same principles as the right to refuse LST is based
on.546 Tiensuu argues that if palliative care and the right to refuse LST is accepted, then an absolute
prohibition on assisted suicide becomes problematic.547

The criteria that the Court mentioned in the Pretty case for the consent to be legitimate is that the
patient is an adult who is mentally competent. Black argues that these requirements expressed by
the Court do not encompass all situations where a patient might make a non-autonomous decision
to refuse medication. She argues that situations including coercion and undue influence can also
lead to a non-autonomous refusal of medication. She goes on to argue that a wider view of a
legitimate consent may be found in the Haas case.548 Black bases her suggestion on paragraph 51
in the case, citing the Court as saying
the Court considers that the right of an individual to decide how and when to end his life, provided that said
individual is in a position to make up his own mind in that respect […] is one aspect of the right to respect for
private life within the meaning of art.8 of the Convention549

Paragraph 51 in Haas, however, states that
[…]the Court considers that an individual’s right to decide by what means and at what point his or her life will
end, provided he or she is capable of freely reaching a decision on this question and acting in consequence, is
one of the aspects of the right to respect for private life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention.550

Nevertheless, the Court phrases the requirement of a legitimate consent in a different manner
compared to the Pretty case, perhaps encompassing the broader view Black is suggesting. In
Recommendation 1418 the PACE included similar requirements that Black is suggesting for a
legitimate refusal, as it stated that States should protect the self-determination of terminally ill
patients and taking necessary measures “to ensure that no terminally ill or dying person is treated
against his or her will while ensuring that he or she is neither influenced nor pressured by another
person. Furthermore, safeguards are to be envisaged to ensure that their wishes are not formed
under economic pressure […]”551
When it comes to the timing of the refusal to LST, i.e. whether the refusal is made in the current
time or in advance, Black argues that it is irrelevant. She argues that if the decision is made for the
future by a patient who still has decision-making capacity, it is a valid autonomous decision, even

if the patient lacks decision-making capacity when the decision takes effect. The justification for
this argument is that both decisions are an attempt to decide how and when to die.552
The second paragraph of article 8 opens the possibility to legitimate interferences to the freedom
to refuse LST. Black argues that refusals to LST that pose a threat to population health, which has
been found to be included under “the protection of health and morals” of article 8 (2),553 may be
the only proportionate restriction of the right to choose how and when to die.554 Such a scenario
could be for example if the patient suffers from an infectious disease and wants to refuse treatment.
If the disease poses a threat to the health of other individuals, it may be legitimate to deny the
patient the possibility to refuse treatment.555 In fact, Black argues that if a State were to allow a
patient to refuse treatment in such a scenario, the State would violate its obligations by risking
public health.556
The issue of risking the health of a third party has even been mentioned by the ECtHR in the case
of Jehovah’s Witnesses of Moscow and Others v. Russia,557 where the Court noted that in many
jurisdictions the only exception to the patients’ freedom of choice in health care has been when a
refusal of treatment threatens the security of a third party, taking mandatory vaccination during an
epidemic as an example.558 Black notes in her thesis however that there may be other ways to
eliminate the risks to the health of others were the patient to suffer from an infectious disease, for
example through quarantine. She estimates that the limitation to the right to choose how and when
to die caused by threats to populations health is likely to be rather limited in scope.559 Black
concludes that the freedom to refuse LST is extensive and argues that if a State intervenes with
this freedom, when it is in accordance with the right to decide how and when to die, is incompatible
with article 8.560 Dorscheidt also argues that preventing the spread of contagious diseases is the

only scenario where a State may interfere with the freedom of choice in health care. He argues that
in any other case, such an interference would only diminish the value of life.561
Black is not convinced by arguments against the authorization of refusals of LST which may at
first glance look persuasive.562 This includes arguments such as loved ones suffering if the patient
refuses treatment and the argument that such refusals should be prohibited in order to protect the
vulnerable. She argues that individuals having an obligation to make decisions in their lives that
favour the interests of their loved ones over their own interests seems to be “a highly unintuitive
characterization of the obligations that attach to close personal relationships […]”.563 Black notes
that unlike in discussions of assisted dying, the argument regarding the protection of the vulnerable
is seldom present in discussions of refusal of treatment. She speculates that this is perhaps because
of procedural requirements can ensure that the decision is truly autonomous. She argues that the
autonomy of individuals who wish to refuse treatment should not be set aside to ensure the
protection of the vulnerable.564
4.2.2. Refusing life-sustaining treatment on the basis of a belief
Wicks argues that article 9 in the Convention may be relevant in refusals of LST.565 She makes
her case by studying English law, but the analysis is included in this thesis nevertheless, as it may
give ideas on what types of issues may arise if article 9 is used as a justification of a refusal of
treatment. As Wicks mentions, perhaps the most well-known example of a situation where a
patient may refuse LST due to religious beliefs is a Jehovah’s Witness refusing blood transfusion.
This might amount to a manifestation of a belief within the meaning of article 9.566 It seems that a
refusal to LST does not need to be based on a rational decision, as the Court stated in the Jehovah’s
Witness case that
The freedom to accept or refuse specific medical treatment, or to select an alternative form of treatment, is vital
to the principles of self-determination and personal autonomy. A competent adult patient is free to decide, for
instance, whether or not to undergo surgery or treatment or, by the same token, to have a blood transfusion.
However, for this freedom to be meaningful, patients must have the right to make choices that accord with

their own views and values, regardless of how irrational, unwise or imprudent such choices may appear to
others.567

Wicks argues that it is likely that religious beliefs will be accepted easier than secular ones even
with regard to refusal of treatment. However, assessing whether the refusal based on a religious
conviction truly is an autonomous one might be more problematic, especially if the patient is a
child. As Wicks mentions, the patient may be at a risk of indoctrination or they may be pressured
by religious family members to refuse the treatment.568 A case in England, Re E, regarded a 15year-old boy who refused a blood transfusion as he was a Jehovah’s Witness. The transfusion was
however authorized, as the court held that he was not competent to make the decision.569 Whether
or not the ECtHR would come to the same conclusion can only be speculated, as such a case has
not been brought before the Court. Based on its case law regarding medical treatment withdrawal
of children, however, it seems that the Court prioritizes the best interests of the child, and therefore
one could speculate that the Court would come to the same conclusion as the English court did,
namely that in case the medical professionals saw it as necessary for the child to receive blood
transfusion they would be authorized to do it.

5. Conclusions
The aim of this thesis was to examine the extent to which individuals can choose how and when
to die in accordance with the ECHR. In order to address the question relevant articles in the ECHR
were presented. When examining perhaps the most obvious relevant right under the Convention,
namely the right to life, it was demonstrated that albeit the right is considered to be one of the most
fundamental rights under the Convention, it is not an absolute right lacking any exceptions. Caselaw of the ECtHR has demonstrated that States have both positive and negative obligations under
article 2. It has also been established in the case-law that States can sometimes have an obligation
to prevent individuals form committing suicide, but this has only been established in specific
circumstances, such as when an individual is detained. Apart from inadmissibility cases, article 2
in relation to assisted suicide has only been invoked in the Pretty case. The Court clearly
established that there is no right to die under article 2. The Court held that the blanked ban in the

568

70

Vivi Ahtiainen

State did not breach the article. However, it did not state that authorizing assisted suicide would
breach article 2 either.
Article 2 has been invoked in passive euthanasia cases. Based on the Lambert case, in addition to
several inadmissibility cases, it seems rather clear that States do not have an obligation to keep
patients who are in a persistent vegetative state alive. Some factors should be considered, however.
The previous wishes and beliefs of the individuals are to be considered when making the decision
to withdraw treatment. The wishes of loved ones may play a role as well, especially when it comes
to parents of a minor patient, but it is more relevant under article 8. If the patient is a young minor
who has not had the chance to express previous wishes, it seems, based on the Gard case, that a
system where a guardian is designated to the child can serve a similar function in the decisionmaking process. The Court, as well as different governments, do not seem to consider withdrawing
or withholding LST as a form of euthanasia. Thus, even States that do not allow assisted suicide
or voluntary euthanasia sometimes allow passive euthanasia. The emphasis on protection of the
vulnerable is more or less absent in passive euthanasia cases, in contrast to the heavy emphasis
placed on it in assisted suicide cases. Nonetheless, the Court has not stated in any of the end-oflife cases that assisted dying in any form, at least as long as there is a legitimate consent and the
wishes of the patient are considered, would violate article 2.
Article 3, the prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, was shown to be an
absolute right with no exceptions, not even when national security is threatened. States have been
shown to have positive obligations under the article, meaning that they must protect their citizens
from ill-treatment. There are specific standards for when an act can be considered ill-treatment
under the article, for example, the act must attain a minimum level of severity. It has been
established that suffering resulting from a disease can lead to a breach of article 3, if the State act
in a manner that causes it to worsen. However, in the Pretty case the Court held that the blanket
ban did not breach the applicant’s rights under article 3, as it was clear that no ill-treatment had
been inflicted on her by public authorities. Furthermore, the applicant was receiving the medical
care that she needed. As has been argued, it seems that even when a mentally competent individuals
invoke article 3 regarding requests to assisted suicide, States can deny it based on the right to life.
In the absence of intentional humiliation by medical personnel inflicted on a suffering patient
wishing to die, or alternatively appalling medical treatment imposed on such a patient, it seems
71

Vivi Ahtiainen

unlikely that any breach of article 3 would be found when States prohibit assisted dying. Therefore,
advocating for a right to assisted dying based on article 3 does not seem promising.
The right to private life seems to be one of the most relevant articles when it comes to assisted
dying, as all cases assessed by the Court regarding assisted dying have involved claims under
article 8. The article has been shown to include the right to self-determination, albeit it is not
explicitly listed under the article. The right to autonomy is one of the most often used arguments
for assisted dying. Rights under article 8 are nevertheless not absolute, as article 8 (2) allows for
some exceptions. Therefore, even if a right under article 8 has been interfered with, it is still
possible that the article has not been breached. The Pretty case was where the Court first introduced
the notion of a right to choose how and when to die. At that point it was worded in a rather uncertain
manner. In the Haas case, however, it became clearer that the article does indeed entail that right.
The Haas case has been interpreted in different ways. Some interpret the case as a clear statement
that a right to suicide or even a right to assisted suicide exists under article 8, while others are not
convinced by that. It is difficult to determine whether such a right exists under article 8, as the
Court uses a rather vague language when addressing the issue. It has repeatedly kept to assessing
the procedural rights of the applicants rather than the substantive issues, including the Koch case
where the Court found a violation of article 8.
Controversially, the right to refuse medical treatment seems to be better established compared to
the right to assisted suicide, despite the fact that both will have the same end result, death.
Arguably, there may be proportionate limitations to that right as well, namely when the refusal of
medical treatment can lead to a threat to population health. Another possible exception may be
when a child refuses lifesaving treatment, as it may not be regarded as a legitimate autonomous
refusal of LST. It has however not been confirmed by the ECtHR as such a case has not yet been
brought before it.
It is uncertain whether States are obliged under article 8 to aid a dignified death but based on case
law some conclusions on limitations can be drawn. If a State allows for assisted dying it must
ensure that vulnerable individuals are protected. An appropriate way seems to be, based on the
Haas case, requiring a prescription for a lethal substance. The Court hinted of the existence of a
positive obligation to facilitate death with dignity but did not expressly state so and it therefore

72

Vivi Ahtiainen

remains unsettled. The Court has also emphasized the importance of decision-making capacity in
assisted dying.
One largely ignored article on the issue of assisted dying, that may nevertheless be relevant, is
article 9, the freedom of thought, conscience and religion. It has been invoked in one assisted
suicide case; the Pretty case, where the Court did not find a violation of the article. The article has
been established to protect not only religious beliefs, but also secular beliefs, although arguments
have been presented regarding the possible difficulty of invoicing the protection of secular beliefs
under the article. A personal belief may be at a disadvantage if it is a secular one, but since the
Eweida case, it could be argued that death with dignity can amount to a belief under article 9.
Regardless, this does not mean that a State would necessarily breach the article even if death with
dignity was recognized as a belief within the meaning of the article, as States may be able to justify
a restriction based on article 9 (2). The other possibility under article 9 is that individuals may
invoke the article by basing their argument on a conscientious objection. It may be possible for
death with dignity to fulfil the requirements in the Eweida case. However, it has also been argued
that conscientious obligation against military service is simply an exception and does not
necessarily apply in other situations.
As article 8 was shown to be engaged in the Pretty case, the Court examined the possible breach
of article 14 in conjunction with article 8. In the Pretty case the applicant claimed that the blanket
prohibition on assisted suicide was discriminatory as the State failed to treat people who are unable
to commit suicide on their own differently from people who are able to do it. The Court disagreed
with the applicant and took the view of the government, namely focusing the argument on a type
of slippery slope argument.
The slippery slope argument presented by the government and agreed on by the Court in the Pretty
case has been criticized heavily and could indeed have been better constructed in the case. The
article was addressed in a brief manner in the case and the Court failed to consider the possibilities
for exceptions to a blanket prohibition. No argument was made either by the government nor by
the Court on why the restrictions applied to rejection of medical treatment would not be sufficient
to protect the vulnerable against non-voluntary assisted dying. Furthermore, arguments presented
by Tiensuu indicate that even if assisted suicide was authorized, it would not automatically lead to
patients opting for it rather than other alternatives such as palliative care. Patients who are at the
73

Vivi Ahtiainen

end of their lives could therefore still choose to die naturally. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain
whether the Court would ever find a breach of article 14 regarding a blanket prohibition of assisted
dying.
In conclusion, article 2 does not seem to impose States any general obligations to prevent suicide,
even when the suicide requires the involvement of a third party. At the same time, it is clear that
the article itself does not include a right to die. The most promising article regarding an unqualified
right to suicide is article 8, as it has already been established that it contains a right to choose how
and when to die. Whether or not States are obliged to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity
to end their own life, that is to say both the disables and the able bodied, remains unclear. It is
equally unclear if States have an obligation to facilitate assisted suicide for able-bodied
individuals. However, when they do allow assisted dying, they must ensure the protection of the
vulnerable. States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in end-of-life matters. Therefore, the Court
leaves many decisions regarding assisted dying for the States to decide. Whether States can impose
blanket prohibitions on assisted suicide remains debatable despite the Court not finding a violation
of the Convention in the Pretty case. When it comes to passive euthanasia, where the previous
wishes of the patient are considered, it appears unlikely that it would breach article 2.

Swedish summary
Frågor gällande eutanasi och assisterat självmord debatteras intensivt inom etik och juridik.

570

Fyra europeiska länder, Belgien, Nederländerna, Schweiz och Luxemburg, tillåter assisterat
självmord eller aktiv eutanasi.

571

Den Europeiska domstolen för de mänskliga rättigheterna

(härefter Europadomstolen) dömde det första fallet gällande assisterat självmord, Pretty mot
Förenade kungariket, år 2001.

572

Diane Pretty klagade till domstolen över att hennes rättigheter

hade blivit kränkta eftersom hennes man enligt engelska lagen möjligtvis skulle bli åtalad ifall han
hade hjälpt sin fru att begå självmord.

573

Pretty var nästan helt förlamad p.g.a. den

motorneuronsjukdom som hon led av och kunde därför inte begå självmord utan assistans.

574

Domstolen hittade inget brott mot den Europeiska konventionen om mänskliga rättigheter (härefter
konventionen) i fallet, men fallet var det första där domstolen nämnde att artikel 8, rätt till skydd
för privat- och familjeliv,

575

möjligtvis skyddar rätten till att bestämma när och hur en person

avslutar livet. 576 Principen fastställdes i fallet Haas mot Schweiz. 577
Efter fallet Pretty har flera domar gällande slutet av livet givits av Europadomstolen. Denna
avhandling behandlar frågor gällande möjligheter att bestämma när och hur en person avslutar
livet enligt konventionen. Syftet är att besvara frågan om hur omfattande rätten är enligt den
Europeiska konventionen om mänskliga rättigheter. För att besvara denna fråga kommer följande
frågor också att behandlas i denna avhandling: Vilka rättigheter och intressen i konventionen är
relevanta i assisterat självmord? Hur har Europadomstolen tolkat artiklar i konventionen gällande
dödshjälp? Har staterna en obligation att säkerställa samma möjligheter till självmord för alla?
Vilken roll spelar samtycke i beslutsprocessen? För att få svar på frågorna granskas i denna
avhandling Europadomstolens tolkningar av artiklarna i konventionen, vetenskapliga texter och
till en viss mån icke-bindande rättsliga instrument.

I fallet Pretty konstaterade Europadomstolen klart att artikel 2, rätten till liv,
rätten att dö.

inte innehåller

Domstolen fann ingen kränkning av artiklarna som Pretty klagade över i fallet,

d.v.s. artiklarna 2, 3, 8, 9 och 14. 580 Domstolens beslut gällande förbudet mot diskriminering enligt
artikel 14

581

har blivit kritiserat. Domstolen fann att ett totalförbud är berättigat för att skydda

sårbara individer. 582 Flera argument har lagts fram gällande problem med domstolens förklaring
om varför ett totalförbud mot dödshjälp är berättigat. Ett vanligt motargument är att missbruk av
dödshjälp kan förhindras på andra sätt. 583
Tio år efter fallet Pretty fastställde domstolen i fallet Haas att artikel 8 skyddar rätten att välja när
och hur en person avslutar sitt liv. 584 I det fallet fann domstolen att kravet på recept på en dödlig
substans inte kränkte den klagandes rättigheter enligt artikel 8, eftersom det var ett sätt att
säkerställa skyddet av sårbara individer. 585 Det första fallet där domstolen fann ett brott mot artikel
8 gällande assisterat självmord var fallet Koch mot Tyskland. 586 Fallet handlade om en tysk kvinna
som var nästan helt förlamad.587 Hon ville avsluta sitt liv hemma, men var förhindrad att göra det
p.g.a. Tysklands lag som kriminaliserade assisterat självmord.

588

Hon var tvungen att åka till

Schweiz där hon tog livet sig själv. 589 Hennes man klagade inför Europadomstolen, som fann att
staten hade brutit mot artikel 8 i konventionen. 590 Domstolen granskade dock inte ifall materiella
rättigheter enligt artikeln hade brutits, utan fokuserade på granskningen av processuella rättigheter
som artikeln skyddar. 591 Domstolen har inte nämnt i ett endaste fall att stater som tillåter dödshjälp
skulle bryta mot artikel 2.

behandlingsmetoder om han någonsin skulle vara i en situation som den han befann sig i efter
olyckan. Domstolen ansåg att Vincent Lamberts önskemål kunde beaktas, trotts att de endast hade
blivit uttryckta muntligt.

595

Domstolen fann inget brott mot konventionen i beslutet Gard mot

Förenade kungariket heller, där det artificiella upprätthållandet av liv för en bebis skulle slutas
emot föräldrarnas vilja. 596 Däremot fann domstolen att en minderårigs förälders rättigheter enligt
artikel 8 hade kränkts i ett fall där läkarna handlade emot föräldrarnas önskan och gav
diacetylmorfin till barnet för att de trodde att barnet skulle dö. 597
När domstolen har granskat artikel 8 gällande assisterat självmord har den i allmänhet hållit sig till
att granska processuella rättigheter,

598

vilket gör att det är svårt att dra exakta slutsatser av

innehållet i rätten att välja när och hur en person avslutar livet. Vissa slutsatser kan dock dras.
Artikel 2 innehåller inte rätten att dö, men däremot bryter stater knappast mot artikel 2 ifall de
tillåter assisterat självmord. Vissa krav kan dock ställas på sådana stater. De måste säkerställa
skyddet av sårbara människor. Detta kan ske till exempel genom att kräva recept på dödliga
substanser. Ifall ett totalförbud mot dödshjälp kan berättigas är oklart fastän domstolen inte fann
något brott mot artikel 14 i fallet Pretty.
Passiv eutanasi verkar inte bryta mot artikel 2. Patientens samtycke är viktigt också ifall där
patienten inte kan uttrycka sig. Detta kan ske genom tidigare uttryckta önskemål. Då det gäller
passiv eutanasi för minderåriga patienter borde föräldrarnas vilja beaktas. Det betyder dock inte
att läkarna alltid måste handla i enlighet med föräldrarnas åsikter, vilket var tydligt i fallet Gard.
