Title: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment
Supervisor: Associate Prof. Jozsef Mezei
Abstract:
Nowadays, becoming data centric and insights driven is a critical strategy for nearly all
businesses. Data can be regarded today as oxygen, which is needed in order to thrive in the
data-driven business environment, as they conceal ample opportunities for business
organizations for discovering new insights and knowledge. Visual analytics has become an
indispensable part of business, as it enables analysts to explore data via visualizations and
discover knowledge in innovative ways. Visual representations of information reduce complex
cognitive efforts required to perform certain tasks. However, converting data into meaningful
visualizations is not a trivial task and it cannot necessarily be automatically improved by
continuously increasing computational capacity.
The purpose of this study is to examine why visualization is critical in today’s business
organizations for innovative knowledge discovery and what drives knowledge discovery in the
context of visual culture in organizations. The study attempts to explain what facilitates the
process of knowledge discovery from the holistic perspective including the role of an analyst
(human discourse), the tool-based viewpoint in terms of features and the organizational
perspective in terms of the visual culture concept. It also encompasses the notion of visual
discovery by design and endeavors to contemplate its implications in the knowledge discovery
process.
In order to fulfil the purpose of the study, an appropriate theoretical background was built
initially. Further, mixed research methods were applied to the study. The qualitative data were
collected in the form of semi-structured interviews. Afterwards, a survey was conducted to
collect quantitative data. The target group for both qualitative and quantitative data collections
comprised business analysts. Finally, the thesis provides evaluations of the findings while
comparing the literature review results in a discussion form and giving concluding points.

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

1 INTRODUCTION
In today’s data-driven economy, in almost every domain there is an enormous demand
for visual analytics to discover knowledge in innovative ways, since data and analytics
have become imperative drivers for business strategy. Yet, it is complicated and
challenging to fully leverage data. Complex, heterogenous and multidimensional data
continuously accrue concealing ample opportunities for business organizations to
discover new insights and make data-driven, timely and swift decisions by means of
visual analytics approaches. Numerous advanced and top-notch analytics and Business
Intelligence (BI) tools are at business’s disposal nowadays, which offer business users
solutions for augmented analytics enabling them to focus on data exploration and
knowledge discovery rather than on complicated analytics processes and computational
algorithms (Dewani 2020; Dar 2020; Gartner PeerInsights 2021; Sosulski 2019). That is,
with the help of such tools, analysts can fully embrace their perceptual and cognitive
capabilities in the analytical work while exploiting advanced computational capabilities
enhancing the discovery process.
In the age of information overload or so called “data deluge”, visual analytics has become
an indispensable part of business. The aim of visual analytics is to convert data overload
into meaningful information and eventually into knowledge by utilizing three primary
areas: data mining, information retrieval and human interaction. In visual analytics,
human perception and cognition coupled with interaction and augmented capabilities of
a visualization tool facilitate data exploration, data comprehension and eventually
knowledge discovery. Visual representations of information reduce complex cognitive
efforts required to perform certain tasks. In addition, visualizations encourage creative
thinking, which is usually not associated with data analysis, but can lead to unexpected
insights. However, converting data into meaningful visualizations is not a trivial task and
this process can not necessarily be automatically improved by continuously increasing
computational capacity. In order to achieve effective visual data analysis, advanced
concepts of representation, interaction, perception and decision-making must be
considered and applied.
Numerous studies (Stahl et al. 2013; Endert et al. 2017; Bertini & Lalanne 2010) have
investigated how visualization and data mining can be best integrated to achieve the

3

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

synergism of the best of human and computer capabilities for effective knowledge
discovery. Some pieces of research (Bertini & Lalanne 2010; Elmqvist et al. 2011; Keim
et al. 2010; Chang et al. 2014) have been conducted from the machine-to-human
perspective while analysing various ways of augmentation and enhancement of
visualization and data mining techniques and methods to facilitate knowledge discovery.
Some studies (Green et al. 2009; Pohl et al. 2012) have analysed human capabilities to
perceive, relate and conclude and how these capabilities can be exploited and leveraged
in visual analytics. Ultimately, certain human cognition frameworks for information
visualization have been suggested, and principles and guidelines for visualization design
have been developed.
This research attempted to investigate why visualization is critical in today’s business
organizations for innovative knowledge discovery and what drives knowledge discovery
in the context of visual culture in organizations by distilling the most important findings
in different standpoints of visual analytics.

1.1 Research objectives and questions
Data-driven economy forces organizations of different sizes to embrace and exploit data
strategically. Various BI and visual analytics tools boost companies’ abilities to handle
complex and massive data in order to gain insights and extract knowledge. This research
endeavored to explain drivers of the knowledge discovery process from the perspectives
of the organizational culture, tool-based features and human information discourse.
The research objectives and questions placed for the thesis are the following:
Research question (RQ) 1: What drives insight and knowledge discovery in visual
analytics?
- Understand the role of visual data discovery in the context of data-driven
environment.
- Identify the drivers of knowledge discovery by means of visualization
tools.
Research question (RQ) 2: Why and how does visualization simplify cognitive tasks?

4

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

- Understand why visualizations support human’s high-level cognitive
functioning.
- Identify how visual representations facilitate human cognitive capabilities.
Research question (RQ) 3: What are the implications of the visual discovery by design
for knowledge generation?
- Understand what discovery by design is and what it entails for knowledge
generation.

1.2 Scope of the thesis
The scope of the thesis covers consideration of data and information visualization within
visual analytics in terms of knowledge discovery in the context of data-driven business
world. The study attempts to describe and explain what facilitates the process of
knowledge discovery from the holistic perspective including the role of an analyst (human
discourse), the tool-based viewpoint in terms of features and the organizational
perspective in terms of the visual culture concept, and why visualization plays a crucial
role in visual analytics. It also encompasses the notion visual discovery by design and
endeavors to contemplate their implications in the knowledge discovery process.
The purpose of the research is to understand the very drivers of knowledge discovery in
visual analytics rather in a broader sense by considering the role of a user in the interaction
with a VA tool and the role of visual culture in the process of knowledge discovery.

The Table 1 lists and explains definitions of the key concepts in the framework of the
data-driven business environment.
Table 1 Key terms and definitions

Key terms
Data

Explanation
refer to symbols representing properties of objects, events and
their environments and being of no value until they are
processed into a useable form (Ackoff 1989)

Information

is inferred from the data into a meaningful form answering the
questions at hand (what, who, where, when, how many)
(Ackoff 1989);
refers to the data resulting from the computational process for
the assignment of meanings to the data or the transcripts of the

Analytics

“is used to describe statistical and mathematical data analysis
that clusters, segments, scores and predicts what scenarios are
most likely to happen.” (Gartner IT Glossary 2020)

Advanced analytics

“is the autonomous or semi-autonomous examination of data or
content using sophisticated techniques and tools, typically
beyond those of traditional business intelligence (BI), to

information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative
forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight,
decision making, and process automation”. (Gartner IT
Glossary 2020)

The era of big data and innovative technologies has created both numerous challenges
and tremendous opportunities for businesses to explore and apply appropriate
technologies for an effective data governance and creation of agile and more streamlined
data analytics. Today’s business setting demands from companies to build a cohesive

8

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

environment, which not only enables integration of data management and data analyses,
but also provides agile analytics on an ad hoc basis and delivers real-time reports.
However, not every organization is adept in making sense of heterogeneous data it
amasses in high volume and at high velocity (Davenport 2018). Today, more than ever
before, there is a critical need in the ability to make agile, data-driven decisions based on
real-time analytics. Data continuously accrue and drive rapid disruption, reinvention, and
digital transformation, which, in turn, forces organizations to transform to visual, datadriven and discovery-oriented organizations. (Ryan 2016)
In literature, different authors use different terms for defining organizations, which
embrace and leverage data, data visualization (DataViz) tools and analytics in an effective
way and ultimately gain insights and discover knowledge. Simon (2014) defines such
organizations as Visual Organizations. Visual organizations are those with a data-driven
mindset and which routinely take advantage of visualizing data from different sources
and of different types by utilizing contemporary, interactive and flexible DataViz tools
and applications or creating new ones, if necessary. The core principles of visual
organizations are first, the ease of data access, data discovery and data processing for
everyone; second, the ability to visualize data regardless of its size, type and source; third,
swiftness and agility in finding data. (Simon 2014)
Data-driven or data-centric are another, more common, terms used to describe
organizations, which embrace data and analytics. Insights-driven organizations appear in
literature when investigating data-driven business (Saulles 2019). As the significance and
implications in exploiting data and analytics for organizations change, the definitions of
data-driven organizations are continuously broadening and gaining new meanings. Kirin
(2017) distinguishes three levels of data-driven organizations. On the first level, there are
organizations with well-governed data and commitment from both parties - leadership
and employees. When organizations start handling data as a core asset and as an
imperative element in building strategies and transforming relationships with
stakeholders, then they move to the second level. Finally, with mature capabilities in data
and analytics, organizations become adept in establishing new, innovative business
models and operations, which might bring about fundamental alterations within an
organization. (Kirin 2017) The significance of creating a data-driven culture in an
organization, specifically from top-down, is obvious (Saulles 2019). In order to thrive in

9

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

the data-driven world, where volume, velocity, variety and veracity of data are rising,
organizations have to build a well-established and fine-tuned ecosystem to be able to
effectively generate, collect, assimilate, analyze and discover insights and knowledge.
There is also the term big data phenomenon (Ylijoki 2019), which refers to “the paradigm
shift towards data-driven businesses and ecosystems” and implies big and ubiquitous
cultural or organizational change towards a new data-oriented mindset. The author
emphasizes the need of organizations to move towards the data-driven culture, in which
analytics and insights should be embedded into processes and decision-making. (Ylijoki
2019)
Ryan (2016) extends the definition of data-driven culture and refers to discovery-oriented
culture. According to Ryan (2016, p.8), discovery-oriented culture implies agile and
iterative process from information to insight in a more proactive, actionable and real-time
way. Data-centric companies embrace their analytical culture to generate knowledge in
four principal areas: customer insights, product insights, optimization and innovation
(Ryan 2016). Ryan (2016) argues that data-centric is on par with competitive advantage.
In order to gain this competitive advantage as a data-centric organization, companies must
not only accumulate data from different sources, but also embrace ongoing analytics,
think long term and simultaneously act on analytics real time. Analytics must be swift
and prompt enough to make a difference. In the establishment of a successful data-driven
culture, one of the most significant aspects is the cultivation of principles of data
discovery and data visualization. Obviously, this requires a cultural change within an
organization. (Ryan 2016)
Increasing availability of heterogenous data stimulates the data discovery process which,
in turn, demands the ability to explore, dig deeper into data and reveal hidden information
to gain insights and create knowledge. As this is an iterative process, a multitude of
iterations might be required before a meaningful insight or knowledge could be
discovered. Therefore, the IT department’s role is transforming to enablement
technology, that is, it not only enables the analytical process but fosters it, while allowing
analysts to focus on the primary tasks without cessations (Ryan 2016). In this sense,
Nguyen (2016) defines the analytical data life cycle as consisting of several stages which
require a specific role in an organization. This cycle comprises data exploration, data
preparation, model development and model deployment. Nguyen (2016) also refers to the

10

term of enabling technology implying in-database processing and in-memory analytics,
which enable organizations to amass, process, and analyse data in an effective, efficient
and agile way without any possible interruptions.

2.2 Visual culture of data discovery
Today, data must be converted into information quickly to be analysed further. For this
purpose, organizations exploit fast analytics through visualization. Fast analytics is used
synonymously with visual analytics and refers to the ability to quickly obtain and
visualize data (Larson & Chang 2016). Visual or fast analytics is more about discovery,
which can result in knowledge and which, in turn, creates a refinement of the visual
product. (Larson & Chang 2016)
Visual representation of data is an influential mechanism in the visual data discovery
process. Fast analytics and visualization are conducted as parts of exploratory data
analysis (Larson & Chang 2016). The competency of data visualization must be cultivated
nowadays in order to fully embrace the ethos of visual culture of data discovery.
According to Ryan (2016), creating a visual culture of data discovery within an
organization implies balancing design, information and organizational culture with the
emphasis on gaining insights, discoveries and ability to visually communicate.
Nowadays, the significance of data visualization is growing due to the fact that
organizations are demanded to make faster data-driven decisions and swiftly deliver datadriven solutions, wherein abilities in visualizing huge volumes of multidimensional data
stimulates insight and knowledge discovery. There are numerous impactful, flexible and
user-friendly data visualization and visual analytics tools at companies’ disposal today,
which enable companies to visualize and analyze their data in an innovative and effective
way for knowledge discovery. Nowadays more than ever raw data can be interpreted on
the fly for ad hoc analyses. Coupled with enablement technology, these DataViz tools
allow organizations to gain insights and discover knowledge with the further swift
decision-making. (Simon 2014)

2.3 Visualization and knowledge discovery
This section investigates the core questions of this research by attempting to find answers
to why visualize and how it helps in knowledge discovery from the tool-based perspective
and from the perspective of a business analyst.

2.3.1 Visualization in knowledge discovery process
Knowledge discovery has become strategically significant for businesses. Yet, effective
generation of knowledge from massive datasets remains challenging for many
organizations. (Begoli & Horey 2012)
The term datafication is used to depict the pervasive nature of data and increasing
significance of data. Lycett (2013) defines datafication as “an information technology
driven sense-making process”. According to Ackoff (1989), data does not have value as
such, until it is processed into usable form. Ackoff presented a model explaining how data
generates value, many other studies have been based on this model later. The model
describes

a data-information-knowledge-wisdom

hierarchy

and helps

in

the

understanding of the value creation process by conceptualizing this process in an abstract
model (Ylijoki 2019). Three types of data exist in every entity (Murray & Chabot 2016,
p. 5): first, “known data” contained in daily, weekly and monthly reports providing the
visibility of operations and the basic context for discussions; second, “data you know you
need to know” providing answers to questions which can arise from the known data; third,
“data you don’t know you need to know” which can be captured through interaction
leading to uncovering patterns and outliers, which are invisible in previous types of data.
Visualization is one part of visual analytics, incorporating also “algorithmic data analysis
and analytical reasoning, which takes advantage of visualization and interactions as
suitable tools to integrate human judgement into KDD process to visually discover
explainable patterns (knowledge) and to gain insight into large and complex data sets”
(Cui 2019, p. 81559).
Visualization is not a new concept and is nowadays a crucial aspect in fast analytics.
Visualization enables users to swiftly comprehend complex data sets produced from
statistical analysis or analytical models. As today data are determined not only by volume,

12

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

velocity and variety, but also by value, validity, veracity and visibility, it bears immense
significance of visualization. (Larson & Chang 2016)
According to Colin Ware (Ware, 2004), visualization is considered to be a visual
representation of data with numerous benefits: it enables to understand vast amounts of
data, its structure and quality, it allows to identify trends and patterns in data, it supports
in gaining insights and decision-making. The purpose of visualization, wherein
interactivity is a fundamental aspect, consists in supporting users to intuitively explore
data within a visual context by leveraging the human visual system to provide insight and
understanding about data, to assist in reasoning and problem solving. (Kim 2016,
Patterson et al. 2014)
Ryan (2016, p. 179) defines data visualization as “a visual display of information that is
transformed by the influence of purposeful design decisions with the intent of encoding
and conveying information that would otherwise be either difficult to understand or
unlikely (or impossible) to connect with in a meaningful way”. The author describes data
visualization as a process of drawing values to visuals, as a tool assisting in exploration
of trends, patterns, correlations and in revealing results and insights, and as a mechanism
for data communication, exploration and explanation. Azzam (2013) also explains data
visualization as a threefold concept: it is a process based on quantitative or qualitative
data, it is results in visual representations of raw data, which is interpretable by users and
supports user’s exploration, investigation and communication of data.
Knowledge discovery is a data-intensive process enabling users to identify trends,
models, patterns hidden in vast amounts of heterogeneous data. Numerous methods
assisting in detecting meaningful information and discovering useful knowledge have
been introduced, for instance, decision trees, evidence theory, cluster analysis., etc.
KDD or knowledge discovery in databases (or knowledge discovery and data mining) is
the process of making sense out of data by exploiting data mining techniques with the
purpose of discovering or extracting trends and patterns, which can be transformed into
knowledge (Sacha et al. 2014). KDD enables to extract implicit, previously unknown,
and potentially meaningful information. This process includes 4 stages (Figure 2): first,
preparing data relevant for analysis which includes selecting, cleaning and converting
data; second, utilizing suitable data mining technique; third, assessing discovered

13

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

patterns; and forth, integrating discovered knowledge into decision-making system. (Ltifi
2016) Begoli & Horey (2012) argue that effective KDD requires from enterprises to
implement effective organizational and technological practices, which comprise the
following elements:
• Data collection, storage and organization practices
• Understanding and effective application of the modern data analytic methods
(including tools)
• Understanding of the problem domain and the nature, structure and meaning of the
underlying data (Begoli & Horey 2012)

Figure 2 KDD process (Ltifi 2016, p.33)

Visualization often accompanies the KDD process and has become an essential
mechanism in knowledge discovery regardless of the data type. Moreover, Leece (1999)
emphasises that “visualization of multidimensional data is one of the key tools for data
mining as part of the overall process of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD)”.
If viewing data visualization and data mining separately in terms of knowledge discovery,
the former presents a human-centered approach to knowledge discovery, whereas the
latter is commonly machine-driven approach exploiting tools for automatic extraction of
patterns and models from data, for devising information and eventually knowledge

14

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

(Bertini & Lalanne 2010). Keim et al. (2008) determine gaining insight or knowledge
discovery as the final step in the process of visual analytics. Fekete et al. (2008) explain
the value of visualization so that “demonstrations should start using a simple question,
show that a good representation answers the question at once and then argue about
additional benefits, i.e., questions the users did not know they had”. For users it implies
that a good visualization will support their prior knowledge, provide a prompt answer to
the question asked, give them insights resulting in the so called “a-ha” moment, wherein
users feel they comprehend the dataset.
Users play a central role in constructing knowledge from the snippets of information
retrieved from visual data analysis. Recent studies in visual analytics theories emphasise
the need in the shift from “human in the loop” to “human is the loop” concept in order to
merge human work processes with analytics (Sacha et al. 2014). Sacha et al. (2014)
developed a knowledge generation model for visual analytics (Figure 3) illustrating
integration of a visual analytics system on the one side and knowledge generation process
of a human on the other side. From the human cognitive processes side, it is a reasoning
process which consists of exploration, verification and knowledge generation loops.
(Sacha et al. 2014) Visualization exploits data or models created from data and allows the
user to identify patterns and relationships. Visualization is generally the primary interface
between the user and visual analytics system, whereas the comprehension of models
requires cognitive efforts. (Sacha et al. 2014)

Figure 3 Knowledge generation model for visual analytics (Sacha et al. 2014, p.14)

In the knowledge generation model the exploration loop presents user interactions with
the system. Findings or a user’s goal specifies actions taken in the exploration loop. A
user’s specific goal might be missing, or findings are not necessarily related to this goal
and eventually they can bring about new insights or new analytical directions (Sacha et

15

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

al. 2014). Sacha et al. then break down the process model into action and cognition paths:
data preparation including data collection or data selection, model building related to
KDD process and its configuration, model usage such as statistical calculation or data
clustering, then visual mapping for creating data visualizations, model-vis mapping
outlining models into visualizations. Then manipulating with visualization alters the
output or stresses striking data without the need to change the model-vis mapping. (Sacha
et al. 2014)
The exploration loop is steered to the verification loop to confirm hypotheses or formulate
new ones. Visualization itself facilitates hypothesis formation (Ware 2004). By being able
to translate findings from the exploration loop in the context of the problem realm, the
user can obtain new insights, which might be not related to the initial hypothesis or which
in turn can result in new hypotheses or further investigations. Moreover, the user obtains
additional knowledge when collecting more reliable insights. (Sacha et al. 2014)
In the knowledge generation loop the user’s prior knowledge about the data, the problem
domain, visual analytics tools and methodology determine the analysis strategy and
procedure. During the visual analytics process the user attempts to identify evidence for
hypotheses or discover new knowledge about the problem realm, which can be defined
as “justified belief” (Sacha et al. 2014). However, the characteristics of the evidence can
affect the trustworthiness of the discovered knowledge, and the findings of the statistical
testing may be perceived more reliable than patterns in visualization. Hence, it is of the
user’s decision on whether the collected evidence is sufficient to trust a new insight or
discovered knowledge or whether further investigation is required. Sacha et al. (2014)
state that the evaluation of new knowledge trustworthiness should start from data
collection and is critical in the course of the entire analysis process. (Sacha et al. 2014)
Figure 4 illustrates how the knowledge generation model (Sacha et al. 2014) is related to
other models and theories. That is, along with the KDD process represented by data,
model and their mapping, there is also InfoVis Pipeline corresponding to data,
visualization and their mappings. When data is converted to visualization, the user can
generate knowledge based on perception through interactive exploration. Green et al.
(2009) argue that perception plays a crucial role in interactive exploration, which is
associated with reasoning and which oftentimes results in knowledge acquisition.

Figure 5 illustrates a typical visualization pipeline in terms of two contexts of visualizing
– viewing and seeing, which correspond to different parts in the visualization pipeline.
The process of defining important or noteworthy information, generating suitable visual
representations and communicating visual representations to the target audience is
referred to as viewing. In the literature, it is clarified in terms of “making visible to one’s
eyes”. Seeing relates to a viewer’s cognitive processes and experiences of interpreting
visuals by translating them into mental representations in order to comprehend what
message they convey. In the literature, it is explained in terms of “making visible to one’s
mind”. Viewing implies concentration on a visualization process, which is supported by
a tool or a system and includes filtering, mapping, rendering. Seeing implies optimizing
the effectiveness and usefulness of a visualization process and includes creating visual
metaphors, designing visuals, assessing visualization outcome and user experience. (Chen
& Florodi 2013) In addition, the authors broadly group visualizations into three main
categories depending on the user’s tasks: information retrieval, information analysis and
information dissemination. In terms of knowledge discovery, information analysis serves
as the most essential objective of a visualization for gaining insights from data and
comprises various analytical tasks, such as filtering, clustering, sorting, identifying
patterns and anomalies, combining and portioning data, comparing and finding
correlations, evaluating hypotheses. (Chen & Florodi 2013)

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

Figure 5 A typical visualization pipeline (Chen & Florodi, 2013, p.3422)

The authors (Chen & Florodi 2013) also define requirements in order for data to become
information and for information to become new knowledge. In a broad sense, in order to
become information, data need to be, first, well-formed, implying correct data collection
by strictly following certain rules (syntax), second, meaningful, implying compliance
with the meanings of the chosen code (semantics), and, third, truthful, implying
possibility to recognize mis- or disinformation. Then new knowledge is extracted based
on available information and already existing knowledge through different cognitive
activities including, reasoning, learning, association. (Chen & Florodi 2013)
Cui (2019) demonstrates visual analytics process as a sense-making loop (Figure 6),
which consists of and adjusted from various models, including visualization models,
knowledge conversion processes and knowledge generation models for visual analytics
as well as analytical processes in visual analytics.

Figure 6 Visual Analytics as a sense-making loop (Cui 2019, p.81561)

Li et al. (2016) state that it is crucial to have a comprehensive framework outlining the
entire analytic process. The authors argue that traditional knowledge discovery and data
mining process (KDDM) models do not suffice in the modern business context and are
not always able to address challenges imposed by the data-driven economy and have to
be revised. They offer an updated knowledge discovery via data analytics (KDDA)
process model, named Snail Shell KDDA process model (Figure 7). This model has eight
phases, which are iterative and consist of different tasks. It is regarded as a project life
cycle, however, sequences between phases are not strictly determined. Importantly, the
project more often starts with Problem Formulation (PF). Li et al. (2016) declare that the
quality of a business problem formulation can potentially impact the findings of the
following stages in the KDDA process. According to the authors, business users must
have reasonable expectations regarding possible achievements of analytic models and the
PF phase should be introduced to direct the systematic formulation of achievable analytic
problem statements based on specific business goals. KDDA model is able to deal with
more aspects of the analytic model life cycle in comparison to the traditional KDDM
models, as it comprises a model maintenance phase, which includes all model
management activities. (Li et al 2016)

2.3.2 Tool-based drivers of knowledge discovery
Bertini & Lalanne (2010) reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of the current state of
visual analytics, specifically on the most effective ways of integrating data analysis and
visualization in order to facilitate knowledge discovery. Investigation is conducted from
the perspective of human-machine interaction. Various data mining techniques and
visualization methods are investigated while classifying them into separate categories
with regard to the knowledge discovery matter. The following major categories are
identified: first, computationally enhanced visualization, second, visually enhanced
mining, and third, integrated visualization and mining. (Bertini & Lalanne 2010)
The computationally enhanced visualization category can be considered as a somewhat
pure visualization technique implying that it is a primary data analysis means with
supplementary automatic computation features. In terms of benefits which could be
derived from automatic computation, this visualization technique can be enhanced by
such automatic methods as projection (e.g., multidimensional scaling), intelligent data
reduction (e.g., dimension filtering) and pattern disclosure (graph clustering). These
methods could not only reduce data complexity and controlled information loss, but also
enhance visual configuration by making patterns more salient. (Bertini & Lalanne 2010)

20

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

Visually enhanced mining consists in data mining as a primary data analysis providing
an interactive interface for displaying the output. This approach can benefit from
visualization by exploiting model presentation (e.g., nomograms) and pattern exploration
and filtering (e.g., sequential patterns visualization). These methods facilitate interaction
with data for its deeper understanding and gaining insights. (Bertini & Lalanne 2010)
Integrated visualization and mining imply a synergic combination of both approaches.
However, strategies used for their integration can be different. Two kinds of integration
are identified, first, white-box integration, which is characterized by the highest degree
of collaboration between the user and the computer, second, black-box integration or in
other words feedback loop, which is more common, and which provides the user with a
set of solutions and guides the user by offering alternatives. (Bertini & Lalanne 2010)
Given the observed particularities of each category, the authors suggest possible
contributions of data analysis and visualization in visual analytics systems. Thus, the first
category, computationally enhanced visualization, which has limitations in providing
more than simple pattern recognition and extending the problem for higher level
reasoning, would benefit from incorporating such functions as visual model building,
verification and refinement, and prediction. For the visually enhanced mining approach,
the following functions could be beneficial in terms of enabling the user to involve in the
knowledge discovery process at early stages: visualizing parameter space and
alternatives, and model-data linking. These functions would equip systems with the direct
representation of connections between parameters and results, between models and raw
data as well as with visualization of structures to better compare alternatives. The third,
integrated visualization and mining, category should be aimed at achieving a full mixedinitiative KDD process, since this approach already implies the complementary work of
humans and computers. This category of systems can leverage collaboration of humans
and machines by incorporating both visualization and data mining techniques, wherein
models are built by mining techniques or derived by human perception and cognition.
(Bertini & Lalanne 2010)
Ultimately, suggested contributions lead to the conclusion that both visualization and data
mining equally contribute to the knowledge discovery process. However, both techniques
necessitate further investigation. Particularly, the authors suggest directing research to the
following issues: from the perspective of data mining, research should focus on exploring

21

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

how the mining process can be augmented with flexibility to simplify exploration of
alternatives, and how robustness and verification capabilities can be added to
visualization. From the visualization perspective, research should explore how effective
visualization can be provided so to interpret, understand and verify models, how model
visualization differs from data visualization in terms of interaction techniques and design
principles, and finally, how automatic data analysis can contribute to simple extraction of
relevant and accurate patterns. (Bertini & Lalanne 2010)

2.4 Human discourse in visual analytics
This section studies the visualization process in terms of human cognitive abilities and
interactivity.

2.4.1 Visualization and human cognition
The visual analytics process is described by the interplay between data analysis,
visualization and human cognition in order to discover knowledge, which can be
exploited for optimization of processes and operations, improvement of business
strategies or innovations. Figure 8 depicts how human perception, cognition and
analytical reasoning are exploited in visual analytics. Its essence lies in the effective
integration of human analytical reasoning abilities and knowledge into the data analysis
process to gain insights or discover knowledge, which would be difficult with solely
visualization or analysis techniques. (Cui 2019)

Figure 8 Visual analytics as the interaction between data analysis, visualization and human cognition
(Cui 2019, p.81560)

22

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

Human perception and human abilities in pattern recognition as well as human readiness
to creative discoveries and serendipities are at the core of the effectiveness in
visualizations. Human cognition is almost always based on mental models, and
visualization as a cognition amplifier facilitates building those mental models. (Valle
2013) Cognitive science suggests taking into detailed consideration the relationships
between mental models as a special form of human’s internal representation of
visualizations and external representations (Bačić & Fadlalla 2016). In the context of
information visualization, a mental model is defined as following:
A mental model is a functional analogue representation to an external interactive
visualization system with the following characteristics:
• The structural and behavioral properties of external systems are preserved in mental
models.
• A mental model can preserve schematic, semantic or item-specific information about
the underlying data.
• Given a problem, a mental model of an interactive visualization can be constructed
and simulated in working memory for reasoning. (Liu & Stasko 2010)

Patterson et al. (2014) view data visualization as “a human cognition-augmentation issue”
and suggest that well-designed visualization leverages human visual perception
capabilities and promotes reasoning and comprehension processes by involving highlevel cognitive activities such as retrieval from long-term memory. From the design
perspective, there have been developed design principles, which can be used to leverage
human cognition in the visual analytics process. These design principles are based on
numerous studies and research including Gestalt principles, visual imagery, cognitive fit
and preattentive attributes (Bačić & Fadlalla 2016). Gestalt laws (e.g. proximity,
similarity, continuity, closure) and related preattentive attributes (e.g. high-speed level
visual perception occurring unconsciously) have been leveraged for visual
representations of data. Cognitive Fit Theory implies that handling data representations
involves the profound cognitive effort in user effectiveness and efficiency, and that if the
problem representation matches the task type, the “cognitive fit” can be reached and this
will improve the decision-making performance (Baker et al. 2009). That is, there must be
a “cognitive fit” between information presentation, problem-solving task, and the user’s
decision processes, which can reduce the user’s cognitive effort by exploiting visual
displays. (Bačić & Fadlalla 2016)
Creating an information visualization for effective analysis corresponds to creating visual
representations of data for “information extraction” rather than “data availability”, since

23

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

in “information extraction” visual representation of data facilitates human cognition by
benefiting from graphical elementary cognitive codes such as length, area, angle, etc.
(Patterson et al. 2014). Information visualization is also extended to high-level cognitive
processes. Patterson et al. (2014) suggest a human cognition framework promoting those
processes. Since human cognition entails the reciprocity between two processes: bottomup (visual information drives pattern building) and top-down (demand in attention
reinforcing relevant information) (Ware 2008), the human cognition framework for
information visualization focuses on top-down processing as it “guides the way in which
the bottom-up information is processed in order to activate organized knowledge
structures represented in long-term memory” (Patterson et al. 2014). The human
cognition framework consists of such components as exogenous attentional capture,
encoding, working memory, long-term memory, pattern recognition and decision. In
their cognition framework, Patterson et al. (2014) conclude that well-designed visual
representations should encourage high-level cognitive functioning, such as gaining
insight, making sense and understanding. For this purpose, the authors define so called
“leverage points” as an access mechanism for the visualization design process, which
eventually improves knowledge extraction (Patterson et al. 2014). Table 1 briefly
explains the leverage points.
Table 2 Visualization leverage points defined by Patterson et al (2014)

Leverage point
1. Capture exogenous
attention

Using salient cues as signals to changes in or essential
attributes of a visualization.
This minimizes so called “inattentional blindness” of a
user.

Providing proper organization of information or
interaction options to engage endogenous attention and
reduce distractions.

6. Encourage implicit
learning

Training regimes for implicit learning about statistical
regularities within a visualization.

2.4.2 Interactive visualization
Visualization is a medium for human interaction with data, involving human cognitive
reasoning processes.
Tasks in visual analytics are strategic in nature and require converting into operational
questions in the process of analysis (Endert, 2014). The significance of visual analysis
tools is high for the knowledge discovery process by enabling the user to visually and
intuitively explore datasets. As visualizations considerably rely on human cognitive
abilities, they have to be highly interactive.
The theory of distributed cognition seeks to understand and explain the interaction
between users and computers. It explains that knowledge is distributed among users and
artefacts and that user knowledge is embodied in artefacts, and the interaction is a
mediator between users and artefacts. In addition, the theory of distributed cognition
highlights that cognitive processes can be distributed among other users in a group and

25

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

require coordination, which is also regarded as a crucial element of visual analytics by
other researchers. (Hollan, 2000; Isenberg, 2012)
Interaction is critical to data visualization, as it amplifies human cognition in active data
exploration, in which the user controls information space, and these interactive
manipulations enable the user to construct, test, refine and share knowledge (Dimara &
Perin 2020). “Further, interaction leverages humans’ natural abilities through new
visualization shapes, modalities, and input technologies, helping to make visualizations
accessible to broader audiences” (Dimara & Perin 2020).
The first information visualization mantra was introduced by Shneiderman (Sun et al.
2013):
Overview first, zoom/filter, details on demand. (Sun et al. 2013)

Then Keim et al. (Sun et al. 2013) extended the mantra to visual analysis for gaining
profound insights, which combines algorithmic data analysis and interactive visual
interface:
Analyse first, show the important, zoom/filter, analyse further, details on demands. (Sun et al. 2013)

Dimara and Perin (2020) summarize concepts characterising good interaction in HCI. The
first concept consists in dialogue, which views interaction as a series of communication
acts between a computer through input and output and a user through action and
perception. The author then defines good interaction based on Norman’s action theory,
describing the route from goal formulation by the user to actions needed to move towards
that goal and user’s perception and evaluation of the system’s output related to that goal.
Thus, good interaction amplifies simplicity, directness and “naturalness” of the dialogue,
it also gives the user a strong feeling of understanding and control (Dimara & Perin 2020).
The next concept considers interaction as a transmission of information between the
computer and the user (Dimara & Perin 2020). Good interaction is measured in
transmission rate, which is “the amount of error-free information per time unit that is
transferred over a communication channel in the presence of noise” based on information
theory (Dimara & Perin 2020). The third concept, control, is based on control theory,
where interaction is continuous and performed via the system comprising goals, input,
output, feedback, feedforward and states, and wherein the user carries out “goal-driven
actions, with feedback on the system state and feedforward on its prospect state” (Dimara
26

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

& Perin 2020). Thus, good interaction implies minimization of errors and gaps to the
user’s goal as well as provision of swift and steady convergence to the aimed state. Tool
use is the concept based on activity theory and considers interaction as a set of tools
allowing the user to interact with the system. Thus, good interaction is defined by
boosting utility or usefulness of these tools and simultaneously increasing the user’s
capabilities. (Dimara & Perin 2020) The rationality paradigm and adaptation theories
such as information foraging reveal that “humans tend to approximate optimal adaptation
of their motor, perceptual and cognitive processes” (Dimara & Perin 2020). Optimal
behaviour constitutes the next concept of good interaction implying maximization of
utility to the best of the user’s capabilities corresponding to such constraints as task,
interface and environment. It has to be mentioned here that utility is not equal to
efficiency in this sense. (Dimara & Perin 2020) The concept of embodiment is based on
ecological psychology and views interaction as the act of being and participating in the
world, wherein the user perceives technology as an extension of them, and where the
focus lies in the user’s lived experiences combining the user’s intention, actions and
context. Thus, good interaction implies leveraging artifacts which do not interfere with
the user’s pursuit and help him or her “in the wild” (Dimara & Perin 2020). The last
concept, experience, considers interaction as an aspect constructed by the user’s
expectations, reactions and recall, and is based on user experience research focusing on
aesthetics, emotions, stimulations, fulfilment and others, that is, pursuing a non-utilitarian
objective. And thus, good interaction implies maximized satisfaction of the user’s
psychological needs. (Dimara & Perin 2020)
Considering these all concepts the authors further elaborate on good interaction within
the scope of HCI. As user intent in HCI is not a requirement, good design of tools should
explain how to use the tool, not to impose what to do with the tool. Thus, successful
interaction design implies tools supporting unforeseen user intents. In visualization, user
intents are more explicit, and it is often stated that insight or knowledge discovery is the
ultimate goal of visualization (Dimara & Perin 2020). The authors then reveal that
interaction with visualization can have several goals. The authors further distinguish HCI
and visualization in terms of entities, emphasis, intent and flexibility of interaction. HCI
includes two entities involved in the interplay – human and computer, and HCI concept
is intended for tools simplifying the use and minimizing efforts while simultaneously
increasing performance. Whereas visualization includes also the third entity – data entity,

27

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

and thus computer is a mediator between human and data, where visualization has its
objective to facilitate knowledge generation and sense-making. As opposed to
minimizing efforts in HCI concept, visualization intends to make the user think and reflect
on data being explored. Therefore, good interaction can imply in this sense effort and may
ostensibly moderate interaction in order to gain deeper understanding of data. Dimara and
Perin (2020) highlight that the user benefits by being provided with various means of
interacting with visualization. (Dimara & Perin 2020)
According to Ware (2004), interactive visualization consists of four interlinking feedback
loops: data manipulation loop at the lowest level, which involves basic eye-hand
coordination skills to select and place objects; then, exploration and navigation loop at
the middle level, where analysts orient themselves in the visual data space; and finally,
problem-solving loop at the highest level, where hypotheses are formulated, and
visualization is refined. This third process may consist of several visualization cycles
when adding new data or reformulating a problem or finding a possible solution.
Visualization can externalize the problem at hand, as a result this can enhance the
cognitive process.
Knowledge discovery as any form of discovery has a serendipitous nature and might
ensue provided that right factors, which are difficult to control, are present and aligned.
However, there are also certain factors, which are controllable, and, thus, maximizing
those factors in design can facilitate the process of knowledge discovery (Begoli & Horey
2012). The former factors, which are difficult to control, are intuition, acuteness,
probability of observation, the controllable factors include availability of proper tools,
comprehensibility, organization and layout of data as well as domain expertise (Begoli &
Horey 2012). There are certain principles based on these controllable factors,
maximization of which enables the user to explore, analyse and interact with data in a
more effective and easier way (Begoli & Horey 2012). Ware (2004) defines several
principles and concepts, whose incorporation into the interface make the process of
interaction with visualization more efficient. For instance, the Hick–Hyman law provides
an understanding of choice reaction time in relation to the number of choices. According
to this law, a person provided with more information has a longer decision-making
process than a person provided with less information. Another principle is Fitt’s law,
which explains a relationship between task difficulty and movement time. Task difficulty

28

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

is calculated as the index of difficulty specified by the distance to the targets and their
size. That is, a simple selection task can take more time, if the target gets smaller. (Ware
2004, p. 318-320) Thus, incorporating these rules into interfaces can improve the
interaction process in that the optimal amount of information is presented for quick
decision-making and task completion time is optimised.
Another important concept applied to interfaces is Gibson’s concept of affordances,
which is extended from the properties of the physical environment to the user interface
design and representation of the data. (Ware 2004, p.18-20, p.327) Affordances are
properties of objects displaying what actions the user can take. Different kinds of interface
icons, pictograms, fields and buttons present a diverse group of visual affordances. These
affordances should be easily perceived simply by looking without any instruction.
By and large, interaction is a fundamental aspect in visual analytics. To integrate human
perception and reasoning into data analysis in visual analytics, users apply their
judgement to the data analysis process through interactions with visualization, such as
setting and changing the parameters of data models, filtering data, zooming and hover
queries, distortion and elision techniques, and other techniques, which play a crucial role
in solving the focus-context problem.

2.5 Visual discovery by design
Visualization encourages creative thinking, which is not always associated with data
analysis. Yet, it can result in seeing interesting patterns and gaining valuable insights.
Visual discovery by design is not accidental and can be regarded as a creative process. It
requires diligence, perseverance and design thinking (Ryan 2016). Visual discovery by
design is defined as “a method for the practical and creative resolution of problems that
is custom-built to meet an intended result” (Ryan 2016, p. 244). It is compared to
excellence, which is not an act, rather it is intended by deliberate planning and designing.
As organizations become more data-centric, they strive to find more ways to leverage
data. Ryan (2016) highlights a necessary shift for such companies from self-service to
self-sufficiency, which implies enabling as many users as possible within the organization
to participate in the discovery process. This means that both technical and non-technical
users have similar tools, access and setting in order to contribute to the discovery process.
(Ryan 2016)
29

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

Discovery by design is facilitated by visualization, flexibility and collaboration. Current
vendors of Analytics and BI tools focus more on providing tools which facilitate the
visual discovery by design process and on delivering technology solutions, which enable
both technical and non-technical users to perform more independently and contribute to
the discovery process (Ryan 2016). Visualization in discovery by design is a critical
amplifier and facilitator of human cognitive capabilities, it enriches the discovery process
by allowing technical as well as non-technical users to access enormous volumes of
heterogeneous data, collaborate and transfer knowledge. “Visualization within discovery
is the vehicle to move from shared understanding to shared insight” (Ryan 2016, p. 251).
Figure (Ryan 2016) introduces the four angles of visual discovery by design, which
explains how interactive and collaborative sharing environment, self-sufficiency along
with visualization and flexibility empower data-centric organizations to gain valuable
insights and discover knowledge in order to make prompt and informed decisions.

Figure 9 The four angles for visual discovery by design (Ryan 2016, p.252)

Several research projects (Heer & Agrawala 2008; Isenberg et al. 2012;) illustrate how
beneficial collaborative analysis is and offer tools which promote such collaboration. The
projects discuss various design considerations fostering collaboration in both
synchronous and asynchronous data analysis while advocating the use of visualization
during more stages in the analysis life cycle.
Daradkeh (2018) also introduces a concept of “a single seamless analytical environment”
and points out that in order for a company to increase the utilization and the business
value of visual analytics, it necessitates to ensure the infrastructure supporting the visual

30

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

analytics tool, it needs to engage all possible users in the company by customizing
training, it also requires to incorporate this tool into current business processes as well as
it needs managerial support and consideration of security and privacy requirements.
Although the visual analytics tool is exploited by different users in the company having
mostly different access rights, they “must successfully complement one another in a
single seamless analytical environment” (Daradkeh 2018).
Similar concept is pursued by Segid et al. (2012) who conceptualize the visual analytics
structure by dividing it into 5 spaces (Figure 10). The components of the spaces must be
designed and function in a harmonious manner to propel effective visual analytics
activities.

Figure 10 Spaces of the VA structure (Sedig et al. 2012, p.2)

Visual culture of data discovery implies the balance between Ryan (2016)

communicate. It embraces the concept of Enablement
Technology, which in conjunction with DataViz tools allows
organizations to gain insights and discover knowledge in an agile
and innovative way.
Three types of data: 1) “known data” contained in daily, weekly Murray & Chabot
and monthly reports providing the visibility of operations and the (2016)
basic context for discussions; 2) “data you know you need to
know” providing answers to questions, which can arise from the
known data; 3) “data you don’t know you need to know”, which
can be captured through interaction leading to uncovering
patterns and outliers, which are invisible in previous types of
data.
Data visualization is a visual display of information influenced Ryan (2016)
by the purposeful design for encoding and conveying
information that would otherwise be either difficult to

understand or unlikely (or impossible) to connect with in a Patterson
meaningful way, and, thus, is aimed at supporting users to (2014)

intuitively explore data within a visual context by leveraging the
human visual system to provide insight and understanding about
data, to assist in reasoning and problem solving.
Visualization in visual analytics incorporates algorithmic data Cui (2019)
analysis and analytical reasoning while taking advantage of
visualization and interaction to integrate human judgement into
the KDD process to visually discover explainable patterns
(knowledge) and to gain insight into large and complex data sets.
KDD (or KDDM) is the process of making sense out of data by Sacha (2014)
exploiting data mining techniques with the purpose of
discovering or extracting trends and patterns, which can be

Leece (1999)

32

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

transformed into knowledge. Visualization serves as an essential
mechanism of the overall process of knowledge discovery in
databases.
However, merely KDD does not suffice in the modern context.

Li et al. (2016)

KDDA (Snail Shell model) is required, which often starts with
problem formulation and has a nature of a project life cycle.
The concept: shift from “human in the loop” to “human is the Sacha et al. (2014)
loop”, which implies integrating the visual analytics systems and
knowledge generation process of the user, wherein visualization
is a primary interface.
The user’s prior knowledge about the data, the problem domain, Sacha et al. (2014)
visual analytics tools and methodology determine the analysis
strategy and procedure. The user evaluates the trustworthiness of
new insight or knowledge, which must start from data collection
and is critical in the course of the entire analysis process.

3 METHODOLOGY AND DATA COLLECTION
This chapter introduces the research design and methods exploited in the study. Further
data collection and data analysis methods are described.

3.1 Research design
Building an appropriate theoretical background has been a considerable part of the
research process. Thus, the research project included a vast part of literature review. The
literature review consisted in the examination of various secondary data, such as books,
articles, handbooks, which enabled to familiarize with key definitions, frameworks and
concepts on the topic. The literature review process helped to clarify research ideas and
questions. The process initially included the definition of the parameters to research
questions and objectives, followed by generation and refinement of search terms. After
the retrieval of scientific as well as non-scientific articles and books, evaluation and
recording of relevant information were conducted. As the ideas and thoughts developed
during the literature review process, the parameters for further search were redefined.
The review of principal terms, concepts and frameworks were taken from the scientific
research articles and books. A summary of the most relevant and essential findings from
the review is provided at the end of the theoretical background of the thesis.
The nature of the research is descriptive and explanatory, that is, it attempts to seek the
answers to what-questions and investigate the relationships between two or more
variables by explaining why and how certain phenomenon occurs. (Saunders et al. 2012)
This research was conducted in a combination of different approaches (Table 1). Namely,
it included a deductive approach, as the research started with studying literature, an
inductive approach was applied when conducting interviews to define preliminary
hypotheses and new parameters for literature review. Based on interviews and literature
review, a questionnaire was developed for further data collection.

Thus, the research design included mixed methods combining both qualitative and
quantitative research. Johnson et al. (2007) define mixed methods research as following:
Mixed methods research is the type of research in which a researcher or team of
researchers combines elements of qualitative and quantitative research approaches
(e.g., use of qualitative and quantitative viewpoints, data collection, analysis, inference
techniques) for the broad purposes of breadth and depth of understanding and
corroboration. (Johnson et al. 2007)

In hindsight, the research design can be defined as a sequential mixed methods research,
wherein qualitative methods are followed and supported by quantitative ones (Saunders
et al. 2012; Venkatesh et al. 2013). A mixed methods design for a research has numerous
benefits and reasons. The definition of the mixed methods research provided by Johnson
et al. (2007) illustrates general benefits for research. Venkatesh et al. (2013, p.36) suggest
that mixed methods approach should be employed if the intention of a research is “to
provide a holistic understanding of a phenomenon for which extant research is
fragmented, inconclusive, and equivocal”. Mixed methods research is able to provide
more solid inferences than single method design (Venkatesh et al. 2013). One of the
advantages in the mixed methods research is the opportunity to combine deductive and
inductive approaches to finding more accurate answers to research questions (Denzin &
Lincoln 2005). The reason and the advantage of the chosen mixed methods design for this
research consists, particularly, in the initiation. That is, this kind of methodology allows
to determine the nature and the scope of sequential research by providing contextual
background and better understanding of a research problem. In addition, it can help in
formulating or refining research questions, interview questions and questionnaire items.
Namely, the purpose of the mixed methods design for the study is developmental, which
implies that a qualitative study is used to develop constructs and hypotheses and a
quantitative study is conducted to test the hypotheses (Venkatesh et al. 2013). Other

36

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

reasons for the choice of the mixed methods research are complementarity and expansion,
which enables findings and meanings to be confirmed, illustrated and linked as well as
the understanding from one study to be explained and expanded (Saunders et al. 2012;
Venkatesh et al. 2013). Besides, the combination of the research methods provides
triangulation by ascertaining whether the findings from one method corroborate the
findings from another method. That is, the validity of the qualitative methods can be
strengthened by the application of the quantitative method. (Saunders et al. 2012)

3.2 Data collection
Through the qualitative methods, data were collected from different scientific articles,
papers and books. Non-scientific publications, such as whitepapers and reports, were also
analysed. As a result of literature review, the conceptual framework was developed,
which served as a direction for compiling a set of questions for interviews. The qualitative
methods also included conducting semi-structured interviews, leading to developing and
refining questions for the questionnaire, which composed a quantitative research method.
The target persons and group for interviews and the questionnaire are business and data
analysts from different industries and with various experiences. The reason for the choice
of semi-structured interviews is that they provide more freedom to interviewees to
describe and discuss ideas, processes and relationships without losing focus on the
specific topics. The main factor for the choice of an interviewee was his or her experience
with a visual analytics tool and the use of this tool for the explorative data analysis. The
interviewees were found through the author’s personal contacts and LinkedIn. A
preliminary short conversation was conducted to ensure that a person’s experience suited
to the research objective. Open-ended questions were sent to the interview participants in
advance, which gave them an opportunity to contemplate on the topic and recall
experiences.
The qualitative methods were followed by the quantitative data collection, as supposed in
the mixed methods research. A study can benefit from the use of both qualitative and
quantitative methods by leveraging the complementary strengths of both approaches. A
qualitative data collection approach, particularly in the form of interviews, can deepen
the study by proving insights from abundant narratives, whereas surveys, a quantitative
data collection approach, can provide a breadth to a study by enabling to collect data
37

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

about different aspects of a phenomenon from numerous respondents. (Venkatesh et al.
2013)
Quantitative research is applied to examine also relationships between variables. It is
primarily associated with survey research strategies conducted in the form of
questionnaires, structured interviews or structured observations (Saunders et al. 2012).
For this research, a survey in the form of an online questionnaire was conducted to collect
more data. The survey was based on the results from the interviews and literature review.
As questionnaires are specifically useful for descriptive and explanatory research and
enable examination and explanation of relationships between variables, this method of
data collection supported the objective of the study (Saunders, 2012).

3.2.1 Interviews
In total, four interviews were held. The interviews were conducted remotely via Zoom
and WhatsApp and lasted approximately one hour. One interview was undertaken via
email due to the time zone difference, as a person is located in the United States. All the
interviews were held in English, except one interview, which was in Russian, and was
translated later into English for the transcript. The interviews adhered to an interview
guide comprising a set of predefined questions. However, the procedure was flexible and
enabled the participants to provide more details and, as the conversation developed,
follow-up and clarifying questions were asked in addition to the predefined questions.
The conversations were audio-recorded and subsequentially transcribed. This method of
data collection was aimed at gathering more opinionated and valuable insights from the
experts in business and data analytics. Although the number of interviewees was small,
the domain experts were from different companies and industries with various experience
in business analytics ranging from 2 to 9 years and with experience in working with
diverse visual analytics and BI tools, which provided insightful points about the topics.
The interviewed business and data analysts perform their analyses in the following
realms: markets and competitors, finance, business control and operational efficiency,
sales and sales operations, and insurance. The analysts synthetize data from different
sources and discover insights and knowledge through fused VA tools.
Due to flexibility and the flow of a semi-structured interview, the questions and the topics
were not discussed in the same order for all participants.

38

Validity and reliability of the interviews
The promotion of validity and reliability of semi-structured and in-depth interviews can
be achieved by the supply of the relevant information to interviewees before the interview
(Saunders et al. 2012). The prior provision of research topics and themes to interview
participants gives them an opportunity to prepare for the interview. In addition, as validity
also refers to the extent to which a researcher is aware of an interviewee’s knowledge and
experience, and is able to derive meanings from a participant’s intentions, a brief
conversation took place before the interview and its preparation in order to understand
the analysts’ tasks and day-to-day work practices and the context they perform their
analyses (Saunders et al. 2012).
The interview included the set of predefined questions (Appendix 1) comprised ten
questions, nine were open-ended, the last question was for ranking the features of VA
tools in their degree of importance for the effective process of knowledge discovery. The
open-ended questions were provided to the interviewees beforehand. In addition, various
follow-up or clarifying questions arose during the conversations.

The first interviewee is an experienced data analyst in a large Finnish company. They use
Microsoft Power BI and Tableau for their analyses. Several years ago, they had a sizable
project for implementing the integration of the advanced VA tools into existing systems
and operations in order to leverage the data. The primary area, in which this data analyst
conducts analyses, is business control, finance and operational efficiency. The data
analyst has 5-year experience in business analytics. The second interviewee, a business
intelligence analyst, works also in a large Finnish company, however, they are at the
beginning of their journey to the full integration of the advanced VA tool Microsoft Power
BI. They have partially implemented the project so that their analysts have started to
exploit the tool. Yet, the analyses are conducted primarily through Excel, where their
principal deliverable is PowerPoint presentation connected with Excel via think-cell addon. This business analyst performs data analyses on markets and competitors and has 3year experience in business analytics. The third interview participant works as a business
analyst in a large company in the United States. The company utilizes Tableau within the
Salesforce environment. The interviewed business analyst has considerable experience
with VA tools (9 years in different companies) and currently makes data analyses in the
realm of sales and sales operations. The fourth interviewed business analyst conducts data
analyses in the realm of insurance by exploiting various tools including Tableau and
Excel. The analyst’s experience in the role comprises 2 years.

3.2.2 Online questionnaire
A survey in the form of an online questionnaire took place after the interviews. The online
questionnaire was conducted in Google Forms and consisted of rating and ranking
questions (Appendix 2). The questionnaire comprised three sections: first, the background
of the respondents and the context of their analytics work; second, the questions related
to the first research question regarding drivers of knowledge discovery from the analyst
and VA tool perspectives; third, the questions related to the third research question
regarding visual discovery by design.

40

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

For the rating and ranking questions, the five-point Likert scale was adapted to measure
the extent of the agreement or importance. The five-level sentiment levels chosen for the
questionnaire were considered as being optimal for this research, as it provides a
reasonable array of opinions which, in turn, can help in better understanding of
respondents’ attitudes towards a phenomenon at hand.

Validity and Reliability
In order to ensure the achievement of the target audience and to prevent irrelevant
responses, the preliminary description of the goal of the survey was provided. As the
number of responses is low, there is a threat that the results from the same questionnaire
for a larger audience might vary. However, certain measures to reduce risks were adopted.
The statements were formulated as detailed and clear as possible and were based on the
results from the qualitative data collection including literature review. The prior revision
and feedback were performed involving an interview participant.
As the study was designed as a mixed methods research, meta-inferences have to be
developed. Drawing meta-inferences is critical and essential in the mixed methods
41

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

research, which are defined as “theoretical statements, narratives, or a story inferred from
an integration of findings from quantitative and qualitative strands of mixed methods
research” (Venkatesh et al. 2013, p.38). There are two approaches to develop metainferences: bracketing and bridging. Bridging is more suitable for this research, since it
was performed as a sequential mixed methods study. (Venkatesh et al. 2013) Venkatesh
et al. (2013, p. 39) define bridging as a process of developing a consensus between
qualitative and quantitative findings, which help to understand transitions and other
boundary conditions associated with research context. Therefore, the discussion part
attempts to discuss the findings from the quantitative data collection in relation to results
from the qualitative data collection.

4 RESULTS
This chapter presents the results of the collected qualitative and quantitative data and
provides the findings of the research.

4.1 Interview findings
The section summarizes the major findings distilled form the analysis of the qualitative
data.
The qualitative content analysis of the interviews included such methods as coding,
categorization and meaning condensation. Coding was performed by reading through the
transcripts line by line and by tagging describing words. Condensation and categorization
were applied to distil central themes and allocate them to the categories which were
predefined from the literature review.
Below are the most relevant and important extracts from the interviewees’ responses
presented in the form of meaning condensation answering the interview questions related
to the RQ1 and RQ3.

Question 4: What do you think facilitates knowledge discovery in visual analytics most?
Natural unit

Central theme

“There are 2 sides of a knowledge product. In visual analytics,
as in Power BI and Tableau, there are two sides: one side is data
visualization, the other side is interactivity, which allows users
to fine-tune filters, to drill and explore data. That is, it enables
to conduct explorative data analysis in an interactive way and
gain insights from visualized data. These both sides contribute
to that how well you can get understanding of your data.
Visualization gives you a possibility to instantly recognize
patterns and trends in data. When you have data presented in
tables, they are kind of not interpreted. That is, they have
columns and rows titles, numbers have meanings, but to get
something from them, you have to put some cognitive effort to
understand how these numbers relate. That is, you make

additional cognitive efforts to, for example, understand that 200

the business context and the meaning of data.”
“I would answer simply just a person who does visual analytics. Analyst:

browsing through data and looking at the table, but being smart and understanding of data
enough and conscious enough about the industry, the structure
of the data, and then only if you know this, you will be able to
result in knowledge discovery, if not, then not.”
“The visualizations provided by these tools are the most powerful Tool features:
aspect of the tool we use. Data by itself inherently does not aid Visualization
in “telling the story” that managers and leadership would like interactivity
to see. In addition to the visualizations, the flexibility is also
important in that we can embed filters to isolate important
variables that managers want to see.”
“…I think if they're clear and easy, and offer first of all simple
plots and trend plots that are maybe the best way to go. And those
are like the good starting points, if you want to do analysis or
create a report for some management people that aren’t so good
at analytics. And I think the best thing is that you have many
options to dive deeper and maybe with some filters you can get
deeper knowledge from the data.”

Central topics derived from the interviewees’ answers to the question indicate that tool
features including visualization capabilities and interactivity are emphasized as
significant aspects in driving the process of knowledge discovery most. Two of the
interview participants highlighted the principal role of an analyst in the process of
knowledge discovery, wherein an analyst’s domain knowledge and data understanding
are crucial.

Question 5: What features must a visualization tool have to drive the process of
knowledge discovery?

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

“…an important feature of visual analytics is its interactivity…. such
employees as business and data analysts, financial analysts and
business controllers do need a broad functionality in a tool to be able
to deeply explore data. By, for example, filtering, different interaction
techniques. They need unlimited access to different, more detailed,
levels of data. If a business controller had same access rights to data
as, say, a department manager, he/she would not be able to gain all
the insights hidden in data. That is, a summarized figure doesn’t tell
him/her much, as he/she is responsible for the validity of this figure

Central themes gleaned from the responses to the question illustrate that the most
significant tool features facilitating the process of knowledge discovery comprise
interactivity and simplicity followed by visual competence, connectivity, scalability and
more advanced data mining techniques. Notably, simplicity was highlighted by the
interviewees who has less experience in the role of an analyst.

Question 6: In what way does the analyst impact the process of knowledge discovery?

cognitive load to first understand how it works and functions. I would
compare it to playing a musical instrument. If you cannot play a
musical instrument, at the beginning it would be a kind of suffering
and an extra load. But after achieving a certain level, you already

46

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

of tools. You should first learn how it functions to get the most from
it. The more difficult a tool is, the more effort you should put to learn
using it. First, it is important to learn how you can use it to leverage
all its capabilities…. … In addition to that, I would also mention that
people or soft skills are important for an analyst as well. Ability to
influence and work with different people. Because when working in
such area, you deal with technology and data, but at the end of the
day you communicate findings to people. And you have to understand
people in your organization, who will work with your reports and
findings. Not everybody has willingness and commitment to learning
new tools. Somebody perhaps can have difficulties with explaining
what reports they need and they would rather conduct them on their
own in Excel. And a business analyst can bring also a value to the
organization in this way, with his/her ability to work with different
people.”
“An analyst impacts this process in 100 percent way. Because if you experience

The extracted central topics depict that an analyst significantly contributes to the process
of knowledge discovery by providing business understanding and domain knowledge
along with visual and data literacy. Experience with VA tools is also indicated among
essential contributors followed by cooperation and collaboration with different business
stakeholders as well as with senior colleagues and tech people. Communication and other
soft skills of an analyst are defined by three interviewees as of an utmost importance for
making the process of knowledge discovery more effective.

49

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

it's very important that the upper management understands and
realizes the importance and transmits this knowledge and this
awareness.”

The responses to the question indicate the importance of the organizational culture
including the role of the executive advocacy. Consideration of end users’ needs and
responsibilities and their interaction with data are important aspects in building
infrastructure which encourages data-driven decision making.

Question 8: Could you recall the procedure of data analysis when you gained an insight
or discovered knowledge (your strategy)? Which steps did you take? What led you to an
insight? What was the role of visualization in this process?
All the interview participants provided nearly similar answers regarding the steps in the
analytic process prior to what led to an insight or knowledge discovery. The process starts
with the understanding of the data by overviewing the structure followed by preparing,
transforming and cleansing the data. Understanding of data is performed through
visualization. Visualization was emphasized as an important factor in data exploration.
That is, one interview participant declared that intuitive application of different simple
charts and graphs to the data helped to gain insights: “So after transformation you have
the data that reflects your goals. So then, to get an insight from the data, I try to apply
different generic graphs, just simple ones, to see whether it’s growing or not. If needed, I
go deeper into data and apply more graphs. I cannot say which one, they just come to my
mind during the process.”
Some of interviewees were able to recall or state what helped or could help in knowledge
discovery. For instance, one of the interviewees mentioned that knowledge gained from
the previous reports enhanced the process leading to “a-ha” moment and then to
knowledge discovery. Particularly, reading and learning from the reports created by other
colleagues aided the own analytic process. In addition, the collaboration with senior
colleagues helped to discover a new insight.

Another interview participant stated: “As the tool does most of the work for you really the
procedure is just interpreting the outputs and determining if results correlations are
accurate based on subject matter knowledge. … Using the visualization one can derive
as to whether the model is accurate and is coaching is necessary…. Overall, it is
imperative in my experience that the analyst possess the relevant subject matter
knowledge both on the application and to some extent the business.” That is, the
combination of diverse competences including subject matter knowledge, visual literacy
and experience with the tool enhances the process, as the lack of those competences “…
would elongate the process and lead to procedural inefficiencies as knowledge transfer
won’t be as effective nor will be the requirements gathering process.”

Question 9: What do you think about visual discovery by design? Does your company
implement this concept?

“…. the entire infrastructure incorporating all the aspects of visual Taking into account

has the access rights to the data to explore and drill data. In our
organisation, we have different access rights to the data. That is, for
example, our managers, they have limited access rights to the data,
as they don’t need to deeply explore the data. They just need to view

reports and they have possibility to do it by months or years. And
that’s it. They don’t have any other possibilities to explore data, not
to confuse them and not to damage visuals they see. And then we have
people whose job is to drill into data and that is why they have more
tools to deeply dig into data. And thanks to these drilldown tools, they
can find causes. “

rights. Not everyone in the company can see the same data, of
course…. It’s challenging because the company is huge. The
information is very diverse…”
“The amount of data generated on a daily basis [in our company] is subset of the group
higher than most companies produce in a year. The intent to deploy engaged in the process

to help make sense out of this large amount of data that is produced.
Our sales teams are extremely mobile as the company does not just
operate brick and mortar stores. Our company has certainly focused
on being mobile first especially since the start of the Covid-19
pandemic… It is important that every functional group have a stake
in the development if they indeed have access and will be using the
tool. It is not efficient to engage every possible employee in the
process but rather a subset of the group known as super-users or
SMEs. From a statistical perspective you need a sufficient amount of
people to provide input that is relative to whole. But not too many
people.”
“So, it means that data are available for everyone and everyone can issues

easy for analysis. And I think if they [business people] could have data skills at all people
those data and knew how to use Tableau properly, they could do it by levels
themselves. So it would free up a lot of time for me. And I could do
more advanced analytics. But for this people need to get better with
Tableau, need more training to do simple analytics by themselves.”

52

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

The responses to the questions illustrate that visual discovery by design is associated with
data access issues. One of the interview participants argued that the process of knowledge
discovery would be more effective if a subset of the group is engaged into the process.
Another interviewee conversely stated that involving business people into the analytic
process would make it more effective and efficient, provided that they have developed
necessary data skills, as this could eliminate the workload of an analyst dealing with
simple analysis. Instead, they could conduct more complex data analysis. In terms of
different access rights to data, the interviewee mentioned that it is crucial to be mindful
of end users’ needs.

Question 10: Please rank the following features of a visual analytics tool in terms of the
effectiveness for knowledge discovery.
The responses for the question vary in terms of the tool features. The interview
participants tended to combine the features. For instance, the interviewees grouped
simplicity and interactivity, or simplicity and visual competence, or scale and
connectivity. One of the interviewees stated: “I think the scale is quite important
nowadays. If the tool can’t handle big data, it’s useless. In many cases we have millions
of rows in the datasets. If the tool can’t handle it, it’s useless.” Similarly, other
interviewee argued: “Scale is something that I didn’t mention but it’s super important
because if the company is huge like ours, there are huge data and it could take couple of
days to process them.”

5 DISCUSSION
This chapter discusses the results from the interviews and questionnaire as well as
corresponding findings from the literature review answering the research questions.

5.1 Analysis of the findings
The interview participants described the drivers of the knowledge discovery process from
different aspects, which can be attributed to the fact that the interviewed business analysts
have different levels of experience in the role of an analyst and particularly different
experience with VA tools and use them for different purposes along with various areas of
business. However, when analyzing the responses to the interview questions, several
commonalities can be derived. First of all, the interviews indicate the significance of VA
tools features including simplicity, interactivity, visual competence, connectivity,
scalability and more advanced data mining techniques. Further, the conversations reveal
that the critical role in the effective process of knowledge discovery pertains to the
analyst, who possesses such crucial competences as business understanding and domain
knowledge in addition to visual literacy and soft skills. The findings from the quantitative
method reflect the findings from the interviews, as they also reveal that advanced VA
tools offering diverse features can significantly drive the effective process of knowledge
discovery. Based on the results from quantitative data, the analyst contributes to this
process by providing their business knowledge and visual literacy. Soft skills along with
communication and collaboration skills are also regarded as important facilitators in
knowledge discovery. For instance, the results from the survey illustrate that all the
respondents consider soft skills to be important, albeit to different extent. Whereas the
questionnaire reveals that technical skills are of a less importance. A discrepancy in
opinions regarding the importance of experience with a tool is noticed in the findings of
the qualitative and quantitative data: the results from the questionnaire indicate that the
respondents regard experience with a tool as insignificant for the process. Presumably, it
can be attributed to the fact that the question included several competences and when
choosing, the respondents had to quickly decide on the importance of a skill in relation to
other competences and skills offered for this question. Whereas during the conversation
in the interviews, the participants were asked clarifying and follow-up questions, which
led to broadening replies and made them rethink and consider. Both the qualitative and
62

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

quantitative data reveal the importance of organizational culture, particularly in the
context of visual culture. Access rights are considered to be possible issues in establishing
visual culture of data discovery. The concept of visual discovery by design is regarded as
a significant facilitator of the process of knowledge discovery. The findings from both
methods depict that this concept does not necessitate the requirement of possessing strong
visual and data literacy by all people within an organization, including analysts and
business people. The literature review indicates that currently it is not an absolute
requirement in those competences in order to establish a visual culture of data discovery
and engage many people into the process of knowledge discovery. However, the
cultivation of such competences is of an utmost importance for the future development in
terms of the knowledge discovery process. Undeniably, possessing data literacy has
become crucial in the data-driven world and it is obvious that data and business analysts,
who deals with data on another level in comparison to other business people, should have
wider visual and data competences and skills.
From both the interviews and the questionnaire, a conclusion can be drawn that the user
and a tool imply a synergy in order to drive the process of knowledge discovery. In this
sense, the role of a VA tool is supportive, which also is identified in the literature review.
Table 11 illustrates the complementary strengths of the user and VA tools in the process
of knowledge discovery, which is derived from the literature review, adapted from Bertini
& Lalanne (2010) and adjusted from the empirical findings.

As also concluded from the literature review (Keim 2010), the strengths of the user and
the computer are combined in visual analytics by using their respective capabilities.
However, it is an analyst who is engaged in the analytical process by interacting with the
interface. From the business analyst perspective, their background knowledge and
knowledge about the context play a crucial role in the effective process of insight and
knowledge discovery, since it allows them to make conclusions and estimations
regardless of the completeness of information available. While VA systems can provide
analysts with diverse functionalities to handle massive datasets and apply various
visualizations to extract patterns and trends, it is an analyst who defines strategies and
methods for analysis of data. Qualitative and quantitative data depict the critical
contribution of an analyst to the process, who possesses necessary competences such as
subject matter knowledge, visual and data literacy, communication and collaboration
skills, while advanced VA tools significantly boost the analytic process by providing
diverse features. Interactive features of VA tools enable analysts to actively determine
which information to display and how it should be displayed. Thus, from the perspective
of VA tools, the design of their features is important for facilitating the process of insight
and knowledge discovery. The success of information visualization is determined by the
interactive features of VA tools, which drive interaction with the user and connect to the
user’s analytical process. The information, which should be perceived and displayed, is
determined not only by top-down or user-driven processes (e.g., seeking relevant
information), but also by bottom-up or visualization-driven processes (e.g., Gestalt
principles). While advancements and analytic techniques in VA technologies aid the
analysis pipeline by automating specific tasks, the increasing complexity and uncertainty
in data demands the human engagement into the analytic process.
Evaluation of the strategies or procedures, which the analysts mostly employ in the
explorative analytic process resulted in insight or knowledge discovery, is difficult to
perform. Although the interview participants provided relatively common schema for an
analytical process, it is difficult to precisely distinguish between the steps in the
exploration process in terms of the use of prior knowledge or information provided. It is
obvious that the steps performed in the explorative data analysis for insight and

64

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

knowledge discovery are soundly connected and the analysts skip from one step to
another, while formulating or altering hypothesis or searching for supporting information.
They might refer to their prior knowledge (e.g. previous reports as revealed from the
interviews) or they might apply information provided in the dataset at hand. This remains
unclear. However, the initial steps in transforming data into information are identical for
all the interviewed analysts and are displayed in the Figure 19 (adopted from Sosulski
2019):

Figure 19 Steps in transformation of data into information

The process commences with understanding the data by viewing, which is done through
exploiting such visualization tools as Tableau, Power BI, R or Excel. The initial viewing
enables to understand the meaning of the data and its attributes, which, in turn, helps in
better formulation of questions for further visual analytical exploration. The findings from
both qualitative and quantitative data indicate the significance of several features in VA
tools which support this process of visual exploration eventually leading to an insight or
knowledge discovery. The foremost features comprise simplicity, visualization
capabilities, interactivity, that is, if the tool is easy and intuitive to use along with the
provision of visual competence and interactivity, it ensures the smooth dialogue between
a user and a system so that the principle of transparency is achieved, and an analyst is
able to concentrate on the task at hand. Simplicity also implies ease of learning and
alignment with skill level of a user. The importance of scalability and connectivity or
interoperability of VA tools is emphasized, which supports the literature review.
The findings regarding the concept of visual discovery by design depict that it could
significantly facilitate the process of knowledge discovery by creating collaborative and
sharing environment for analytic process. However, interview participants and
respondents of the questionnaire argued that building a visual culture with the emphasis
on visual discovery by design can be daunting due to issues associated with providing
access to data to various people levels in a business organization. The literature review
reveal how knowledge discovery is lifting nowadays while demanding from companies
more independence and improved agility to acquire, analyze and maintain new insights
and knowledge from data, and how self-service is evolving to self-sufficiency while
65

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

forcing companies to shift their organizational culture to a new level. Business users are
becoming more data savvy and are constantly developing further data competences. The
close work between various business users across a company could provide a deeper
understanding of the data and business. Visual analytics simplifies collaboration and
engagement by enabling self-sufficient users to explore the data by means of visualization
and share insights, which, in turn, can decrease time to knowledge discovery.

5.2 Answers to the research questions
This section summarizes the findings and provides answers to the research questions.
RQ1: What drives insight and knowledge discovery in visual analytics?
Under this research question, the study attempted to explain the role of visual data
discovery for data-driven business environment and analyze the core facilitators in the
process of knowledge discovery while utilizing VA tools. As the study aimed at
understanding of a holistic picture of different drivers in the effective process of
knowledge discovery, the answer to this question included consideration of the analyst
perspective, the VA tools perspective and the organization perspective. Hence, visual
culture of data discovery is explained to understand its role for knowledge discovery.
Visual culture of data discovery within an organization consists in harmonizing design,
information and organizational culture with the emphasis on gaining insights, discoveries
and ability to visually communicate. The significance of data visualization is increasing,
since organizations are demanded to make faster data-driven decisions and quickly
deliver data-driven solutions, wherein abilities in visualizing huge volumes of
multidimensional data stimulates insight and knowledge discovery. Thus, VA tools play
a significant role, where KDD process requires from organizations to implement effective
organizational and technological practices in order to make the process of knowledge
discovery more effective. Analysts play a central role in constructing knowledge from
information derived from visual data analysis. According to recent studies in visual
analytics theories, the concept “human in the loop” has shifted to the concept “human is
the loop”, which illustrates the merge of human work processes with analytics. The
analyst’s prior knowledge about the data, the problem domain, visual analytics tools and
methodology impact the analysis process. Additionally, it is a user who decides on

66

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

whether the collected evidence is sufficient to trust a new insight or discovered knowledge
or whether further investigation is required.
From the tool perspective, various data mining techniques and visualization methods are
investigated, and their enhancement is proposed in order to facilitate the process of
explorative data analysis. In sum, from the theory can be concluded that both enhanced
visualization and data mining techniques equally contribute to the knowledge discovery
process. The techniques for knowledge extraction and visualization vary according to data
type, the objective of the analysis as well as tool design. However, the utilization of
interactive techniques and how visualizations are connected is significant for the process
of knowledge discovery.
The interviews and the questionnaire reveal that the analyst and VA tools are
complementary drivers in the effective process of knowledge discovery. Analysts
contribute to the process by providing their competences such as business knowledge,
visual and data literacy, soft skills, while VA tools facilitate the process by offering such
features as simplicity, scalability, interactivity, connectivity, advanced visualization
capabilities and data mining techniques.
With regard to the findings from qualitative and quantitate data collection in addition to
the results from the literature review, the following conclusion can be summarized by
displaying in Figure 20.

67

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

Figure 20 Driving elements in effective process of knowledge discovery

Visual culture embraces different spaces: business analyst as a mental space, VA tools as
a computing space, interaction space and representation space, Data and Domain as
information space, wherein computing space interlinks VA tools and data. When viewing
a visual analytics environment in a comprehensive way, driving forces of effective
knowledge discovery are comprised of several elements, which are interlinked with each
other. First of all, efficient knowledge discovery can be achieved by involving domain
knowledge and understanding of the business analyst in addition to their visual literacy
and soft skills. The supportive role of VA tools in the efficient process of human
reasoning is undeniable and the following features of a tool facilitate the process of insight
and knowledge discovery: simplicity implying that it is exploited intuitively as well as
enhanced visualization and interactivity, which provide the analyst not only with the
possibility to visualize information in accordance with the type of data and the purpose
of visualization, but also to explore data on different levels and display granular data
while providing the possibility to alter analysis on the fly if needed. The third element
consists in data and, specifically, in domain-driven data mining, which represents
information space. Accumulating data and first and foremost providing access to these
data in order to explore and gain insights from them is another facilitating term for
effective knowledge discovery.

68

O.Donkovtceva: Knowledge discovery and visual analytics in a data-driven business environment

Those driving forces determine the effective process of knowledge discovery, provided
that they function in the synergy within the single seamless analytical environment, which
embraces enablement technology and visual culture of data discovery.

RQ2: Why and how does visualization simplify cognitive tasks?
Under this research question, the study attempted to understand why and how visual
representation supports and facilitates human cognitive capabilities, particularly in the
application of VA tools. Different frameworks, models and theories were described to
answer the question. Thus, the core of the effectiveness of visualization consists in human
perception and abilities in pattern recognition coupled with human eagerness to
discoveries and serendipities. Human’s internal representation of visualizations and
external representations are explained by mental models, which are constructed and
simulated in working memory for reasoning, when particularly dealing with interactive
visualizations. Different design considerations have been developed in multiple previous
studies to leverage human cognition in the visual analytics process. They include Gestalt
principles, visual imagery, cognitive fit and preattentive attributes. In order to improve
knowledge extraction in visualization, the following leveraging points have been
proposed in previous studies: capturing exogenous attention, directing endogenous
attention, facilitating chunking, aiding reasoning with mental models, aiding analogical
reasoning, encouraging implicit learning. Interaction is considered to be an amplifier of
human cognition in active data exploration. Good interaction implies simplicity,
directness and “naturalness” of the dialogue between human and data, while enabling the
user to easily and smoothly explore and map the data and its visualization so that the
principle of transparency is achieved, by which the tool itself seems to disappear and the
user ostensibly gets a direct control and thus is able to focus on the task. Various concepts
and principles for interfaces have been developed to make interaction more effective.
They include, for instance, Gibson’s concept of affordances, the Hick–Hyman law, Fitt’s
law.

RQ 3: What are the implications of the visual discovery by design for knowledge
generation?
Under this research question, the study endeavoured to understand the concept of visual
discovery by design and explain its implications for knowledge discovery.
The concept of visual discovery by design implies the deliberate planning and designing
of single analytic environment while embracing visualization, mobility and collaboration.
Moreover, this concept entails engaging as many users as possible within the organization
to participate in the discovery process. Visualization in discovery by design is a critical
amplifier and facilitator of human cognitive capabilities, it enriches the discovery process
by allowing technical as well as non-technical users to access data, collaborate and
transfer knowledge. Undeniably, the concept requires consideration of security and
privacy issues. The findings from the interviews and the questionnaire also reveal that
organizational culture affect the knowledge discovery process and collaborative
environment facilitate the analytic process leading to insights and knowledge discovery.
The concept of visual discovery by design is aimed at increasing the utilization and the
business value of visual analytics in a company while building single smooth analytic
ecosystem, which empower users to contribute, discover and share their insights.
According to the findings from the interviews, the engagement of other business people
into the process would enable analysts to focus on more complex tasks and would
accelerate the effective process of knowledge discovery. Therefore, the concept of visual
discovery by design has enormous implications for the process of knowledge discovery,
as it requires from both analysts and users with business and specifically domain expertise
to become partners in the discovery process by collaboratively engaging in the analytical
processes of huge amounts of diverse data. Business organizations would significantly
benefit from encouraging cooperation and sharing between users from cross-functional
units in that it could boost creativity, business knowledge and awareness which, in turn,
could lead to collective innovation.

6 CONCLUSION
This chapter provides concluding and final marks for the research in addition to
limitations in the sturdy.

6.1 Summary
The study was aimed at describing and explaining why visualization is critical in today’s
business organizations for knowledge discovery and what facilitates knowledge
discovery in the context of visual culture in organizations by distilling the most important
findings in different standpoints of visual analytics, particularly with the interplay
between analysts and VA systems. At the beginning, the paper introduced the concept of
visual culture of data discovery to explain the critical role of visual analytics in the datadriven context. The research questions were answered using mixed methods approach
including both qualitative and quantitative methods.
The research question regarding supportive role of visualization for cognitive tasks was
investigated through literature. To answer other two research questions along with
literature review, four professional business and data analysts were interviewed with the
goal of clarifying the facilitators in the knowledge discovery process, the role of an
analysts in this process and features of VA tools particularly needed for effective
knowledge discovery. The experts’ ideas about driving aspects of knowledge discovery
by means of VA tools were collected in addition to their opinions about the notion of
visual discovery by design. The online survey was conducted afterwards, in which 13
analysts participated and provided their responses regarding the competencies of an
analyst and features of VA tools required for the effective process of knowledge
discovery. Besides, the questionnaire also included the section on the concept of visual
discovery by design.
By and large, visualization, specifically in visual analytics, amplifies human cognitive
capabilities, which is explained through various theories and principles, such as
sensemaking, cognitive fit theory, Gestalt principles, theory of distributed cognition, etc.
The core driving elements in the effective process of knowledge discovery in the context
of data-driven business environment were provided in the illustration in the discussion

part and include such drivers as, first, the analyst possessing domain knowledge, soft
skills and visual and data literacy, which represent the mental space; second, data and
domain, which represent information space; third, VA tools with diverse features
including interactivity, advanced visualization and data mining along with intuitiveness,
which represent interaction and representation space. All these space function within a
single analytic ecosystem. The concept of visual discovery by design is considered to be
an essential aspect for facilitating knowledge discovery, as it emphasizes collaboration,
visualization and mobility. Collaboration is regarded as a constituting component of
visual analytics according to the theory of distributed cognition.

6.2 Limitations
The study has several limitations. First of all, the low number of participants in both the
interviews and the questionnaire is one of the limitations. Larger sample of participants
would be more representative, which in turn could provide more insights and ideas about
the investigated phenomenon. The study has also limitations common for qualitative
methods conducted in the form of in-depth or semi-structured interviews (Yin 2015). That
is, regardless of efforts put into analyzing of qualitative data, there might be relevant
findings, which were not identified. Hence, the subjectivity of interpretation of data is
another limitation in this study.
