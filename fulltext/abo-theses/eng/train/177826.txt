Abstract:

Since the end of the armed conflict in Syria, camps have been packed with family members of ISIS fighters.
Both Syrians and foreigners. These camps have received a lot of media attention mainly for two reasons. Firstly,
the difficult and critical living conditions at the camps. There have been several reports about illnesses, abuses
and even deaths, especially among children. Secondly, the nationality of the residents at the camps.
Several EU member states have nationals, mostly women and children, currently held at the camps in Syria,
unable to leave and travel back home. Children are held in detention like conditions in a foreign country, due
to their parents. The children are paying a very high price for something they have not been able to influence
in any way. EU member states have struggled with what to do with their nationals held at the camps in Syria.
The situation is politically very charged, and states fear for the possible national security risks a repatriation
could entail. Despite the fact that the authorities at the camps have urged EU member states to repatriate their
nationals, very few repatriations have taken place, and if so, solely on a case by case basis.
This thesis examines the state of nationalities obligations towards the children held in detention like conditions
abroad. The current situation in Syria will be used as an example throughout the thesis. The main question this
thesis aims to answer is whether there is an obligation for the states of nationality to repatriate children, who
are held in detention like conditions in a foreign country because they are family members of Foreign Terrorist
Fighters. Before examining specific rights that are at risk of being violated, the thesis will focus on state party’s
jurisdiction and the extraterritorial obligations towards nationals abroad.
The thesis will examine both primary and secondary sources of international law in order to answer the above
question. International law is evolving slowly, and since the matter under examination is new, secondary
sources will also be examined in order to clarify the interpretation of the primary sources. The examination
provides an overview of the different sources of international law relevant to the case of children held in
detention like conditions abroad.
The thesis finds no strict obligation for the state of nationality to repatriate the children. However, the thesis
also found no indication that a repatriation would violate international law. While relying on the interpretation
of different human rights provisions, the final conclusion of the thesis is that in some situations, especially if
the child’s right to life and safety is clearly threatened, there could be an obligation to repatriate. This needs to
be determined on a case by case basis, taking into consideration the best interest of the child. Due to the new
nature of this issue, there is not yet any caselaw available. Future caselaw will hopefully offer further
clarification on this type of situations.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
Since 2011, the international community has followed the situation in Syria through the news and social
media. The situation has in the last year settled down, however, it is in no way solved. What is left now,
is the aftermath. After the fall of the Islamic State (ISIS), camps have been packed with their family
members, both Syrians and foreigners. Children, often together with their mothers, are held in detention
like conditions in a foreign country, unable to leave and return to their state of nationality. These children
are paying a high price for something they have not been able to influence in any way. In the media the
deteriorating and critical living conditions in these camps have been noted on several occasions. For
example, the World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern regarding the humanitarian
situation at the al-Hol camp. 1 The camp hosts mostly women and children and the situation is critical.
Illnesses, abuses, and even deaths, especially among children, are part of the everyday life at the camp.
According to reports half of the patients at the field hospitals are children,2
Despite the fact that the authorities at the camps have urged EU member states to repatriate their
nationals, very few repatriations have taken place, and if so, solely on a case by case basis. The states of
nationality have had difficulties deciding how to proceed, and not only concerning the adults, but also
regarding the children.3 No examination into weather the inaction to assist could possibly even amount
to a violation of international law has been conducted.

The situation is politically very charged, and

states fear for the possible repercussions a repatriation could have on counter terrorism operations and
national security measures.5 Tanya Mehra, a researcher at the International Center for Counter- Terrorism
at The Hague, has stated, referring to the people at the camps, and addressing the states of nationality,
that “they are your citizens, and, for better or for worse, you’re responsible for the mess they’re

creating”. 6 Holding these women and children at the camps is not a durable solutions. For the states of
nationality, this situation will not resolve itself and ignorance is not a durable option. The situation grows
more complicated the longer, especially the children, remain at the camps. Observing the events during
the fall of 2019, with Turkish forces attacking the region, it is evident that the situation is critical and
will remain unsolved without action from the state of nationality.
The children living at these camps have been described as the world’s most vulnerable children. 7
However, a very different picture of them has simultaneously been painted on media. Propaganda videos
of children killing people have circulated and researchers say that ISIS used children as fighters, bombers,
scouts and spies. 8 The innocence of these children is not taken for granted, and this has affected the states
of nationalities willingness to repatriate them. The fact that the parents of these children are ISIS fighters,
or affiliated simply with ISIS, has become an obstacle for the enjoyment of basic human rights. There is
no international treaty that defines exactly what measures states are allowed to take when it comes to
protecting national security. Security is a human right, and states are obligated to ensure that the human
rights of their citizens and nationals are respected, by protecting them from terrorist attacks.9
Furthermore, state sovereignty is an important factor of international law, and states have a right to
protect, within their territory, their national security. Henrietta Fore, the UNICEF Executive Director,
has stated that “While acknowledging each country’s sovereign right to protect its national security
interests, UNICEF urges Member States to also fulfil their responsibilities to protect everyone under the
age of 18 in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child”.10
The question of repatriating children affiliated with FTF’s is a legal question, but at the same time also
a politically charged question. The political dilemma is highlighted in a statement by the Director of the
George Washington University Program on Extremism, Lorenzo Vidino; “Who wants to be the politician
who decides to repatriate Individual A who, two years down the road, blows himself up?”11 With the

propaganda videos of children circulating and reports about their radicalization, this fear does not
necessarily apply only to adults, but children as well. States are afraid, and not even children are seen
solely as innocent victims. This fear does not change the fact that they are children, and that they should
primarily be seen as victims.12 Under international law, they have rights and should be protected. Despite
the fact that the repatriation of children affiliated with FTF’s has become politicalized, relevant
legislations, both nationally and internationally, should be the main focus when examining an obligation
to repatriate.
This thesis aims to examine the international law aspect of repatriation. Do states of nationality have an
obligation to repatriate children, who are family members of FTF’s, and held in detention like conditions
abroad? Regarding the current situation in Syria, some states have already repatriated children. The
repatriation of these children is slow since states mostly carry out the repatriations on a case by case
basis, heavily influenced by political considerations.13 The process is still unclear, and while states
struggle to decide what to do, these children suffer in poor conditions at the camps. The Committee on
the Rights of the Children (CRC Committee) has, in connection to the best interest of the child, noted
that the “processes regarding or impacting children be prioritized and completed in the shortest time
possible”14 The situation in Syria has remained unclear for a long time now and this thesis aims to provide
some clarity into this complex and difficult situation.

1.2. Research question
The purpose of this thesis is to examine the obligation for the state of nationality to repatriate children,
who are family members of Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTF’s) and held in detention like conditions
abroad. In order to answer this question, several different elements will be examined. The states
obligations to protect is connected to jurisdiction, therefore the scope of states jurisdiction will be
examined. Do states have extraterritorial jurisdiction? Are children held in detention like conditions,

outside their state of nationality, under the jurisdiction of their state of nationality? Do the states of
nationality have obligations to their nationals abroad? After examining the states jurisdiction regarding
nationals abroad, specific rights that are relevant to a possible obligation to repatriate will be examined.
If there is a risk that these rights are violated, does this evoke an obligation to repatriate for the state of
nationality?

1.3. Limitations
While acknowledging the role of the parents as the legal guardians of children, the focus of this thesis
will be on the children. Problems that may arise in regard to parents will be addressed, but not discussed
extensively. The FTF themselves, and the mothers of the children are outside the scope of this thesis.
This thesis will not focus on all children detained outside their state of nationality, but specifically on
those who are family members of FTF’s. This is because, as observed regarding the situation in Syria,
states are less willing to repatriate children affiliated with FTF’s.
Practical difficulties of the possible repatriations are noted only on a general level since these are not
within the scope of this thesis. The focus is on legal instruments and obligations arising from those, not
on practical obstacles or difficulties. For example, difficulties that may arise from parents or legal
guardians opposing repatriation of their children will be noted and discussed, but not examined
extensively. The existence of practical difficulties regarding national legislation, or consular services is
also noted, however, these will not be discussed in this thesis since the focus is on international
legislation.
The focus of this thesis will also be limited to children with the nationality of an EU member state. EU
member states have all ratified the most relevant human rights treaties and are among the states with
practical capabilities to repatriate. 15 The children’s EU member state nationality is taken for granted for
the purpose of this thesis. While it is noted that there might be difficulties with, for example, proving the
child’s nationality, this will not be examined further. Therefore, for the scope of this thesis, the starting
point is that the children under examination are nationals of an EU member state.

15

Several EU member states have already repatriated children, mostly orphans, from the al-Hol camp in Syria

4

When it comes to children, there are many different rights that are actualized. This thesis will only focus
on the most relevant rights regarding a possible obligation for states of nationality to repatriate. The rights
that could give rise to an actual obligation to repatriate will be examined, even if all the rights in, for
example, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) are relevant for children. Since the current
situation in Syria, has been one motivation for choosing this topic, it will be used as an example
throughout the thesis.

1.4. Method and Sources
This thesis is a doctrinal analysis and both primary and secondary sources of international law will be
examined. The main focus is on primary sources of international. Relevant treaties and provisions will
be examined and analysed. Secondary sources are mainly used to clarify the interpretation of the primary
sources. The thesis will begin by discussing the extraterritorial applicability of human rights treaties.
How the term “jurisdiction” is used in different treaties will be examined. This will be done by observing
several different human rights treaties and analysing the provisions establishing the treaties jurisdiction.
For example, the difference between the use of terminology and the preparatory work will be observed.
The thesis will then move on to examine specific rights guaranteed in the human rights provisions that
are at risk of being violated and could therefore possibly give rise to an obligations to repatriate for the
state of nationality. The rights chosen to be further analysed are viewed by to author as the most relevant
for the possible obligation to repatriate. After examining the more specific rights, Diplomatic and
Consular relations will be examined. Would there exist an obligation to repatriate for the state of
nationality, the repatriation would be done in accordance with the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic
and Consular relations. These conventions are relevant to examine since they clarify the obligations of
states upon their nationals abroad. Children held in detention like conditions abroad is a very complex
situation. Nonetheless, the children are nationals abroad in need of assistance. Finally, humanitarian law
will also briefly be examined. The current situation in Syria, which will be used as an example throughout
the thesis, is the outcome of an armed conflict. Even if the active fighting in Syria has ceased,
humanitarian law is still relevant to examine.

5

In addition to the primary sources of international law, secondary sources will also be used. The subject
under examination is new and therefore secondary sources are also necessary to examine. Conventions
and treaties will be primarily analysed to clarify the state’s obligations and the rights of children.
Secondary sources, such as protocols, resolutions, declarations and general comments will be examined
in order to obtain a clearer understanding of the interpretation of the primary sources. The secondary
sources are also an important addition since they are able to faster adapt to current problems, such as the
situation in Syria today. Legally binding primary law is evolving slower. Because of this, secondary
sources are more up to date and provide an important addition to the primary sources in new situations.
Furthermore, relevant articles and reports from international organizations will be included in order to
provide a clear picture of the current situation in Syria, and the derogating conditions at the camps where
the children are held. The situation in Syria is necessary for the reader to bear in mind in order to be able
to understand which rights are at risk of being violated if the children remain at the camps.
The current situation in Syria, with nationals of EU member states being held in detention like conditions,
has been a motivation for choosing to examine the possible obligation to repatriate, therefore the situation
in Syria will be used as an example throughout the thesis. The purpose of this thesis is however not to
examine an obligation specifically in the Syrian context, but an overall examination regarding situations
when children are held in detention like conditions detained outside their state of nationality.

1.5 Definitions
Several different terms will be used throughout this thesis. It is necessary to clarify them in order to
ensure that the terms used are correctly understood.
The term “FTF” used in this thesis, refers to Foreign Terrorist Fighter. The term FTF’s is defined by the
Security Council as “individuals who travel to a State other than their States of residence or nationality
for the purpose of the perpetration, planning, or preparation of, or participation in, terrorist acts or the
providing or receiving of terrorist training, including in connection with armed conflict”. 16 The term

16

6

“child” refers to, as stated in art. 1 of the CRC, to “every human being below the age of eighteen years
unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier”. 17
The term “jurisdiction” is not specifically defined in any human right treaty. For the purpose of this thesis
it refers to “the actual exercise of control and authority by a state”. 18 Within a state’s jurisdiction the state
has rights and obligations under international law. The term “extraterritorial jurisdiction” refers to
jurisdiction outside a state’s territory. As regards obligations, two types of obligations are discussed,
positive and negative. The latter one referring to the act of refraining from doing something and the first
referring to acts taken to prevent a violation of a right. ‘Extraterritorial application’ refers to the fact that
“at the moment of the alleged violation of his or her human rights the individual concerned is not
physically located in the territory of the state party in question, a geographical area over which the state
has sovereignty or title”.19

2. Extraterritorial application of Human Rights Treaties
2.1. Exercise of jurisdiction
2.1.1 Extraterritorial applicability
Since the war against terrorists, and the allegations of human rights violations committed by US troops
against detainees abroad, the discussion about extraterritorial application of human rights treaties has
evolved. 20 State sovereignty remains as one of the cornerstones of international law, however, the world
has changed. We live in a globalized world, with people constantly moving around. Today, people travel
abroad for various reasons. For some, the reason to travel abroad is to fight for terrorist groups, and often
they bring along their families, including their children. This new type of movement poses problems for
the traditional view on state sovereignty. The territorial jurisdiction of the state where these people travel

is affected by the “minimum standard of rights for aliens required under international law”.21 A violation
of these standards can give the right for the state of nationality to exercise its diplomatic protection in
order to be able to guarantee these rights to their citizens. 22 This can also be called a “state’s personal
sovereignty over its citizens”.23
Generally, individuals are subject to the jurisdiction of the state on which territory they currently are. 24
However, not every scenario is that simple. The human rights violations that individuals, especially
children, are subjected to in the camps in Syria, is one indication of the importance of the question
concerning the application of human rights treaties beyond states national territory. 25 The subject of
extraterritorial applicability of human rights is very complex, and the discussion surrounding it has even
been described as having provided “more questions than answers”. 26 Scholars supporting the idea of
extraterritorial application of human rights instruments have, among other things, argued that if the
treaties would have been intended to be applicable only within a state’s territory, this would have been
indicated in the provisions. This has not been done in the current international human rights treaties.
There is nothing in the treaties that directly excludes extraterritorial applicability. 27 It is undeniable that
human rights treaties are applicable extraterritorially in some scenarios, but the scope of this applicability
is yet to be determined. 28 Milanovic has stated that “the application of a human rights treaty to a particular
individual thus requires that a state owes that individual some legal obligation under the treaty”. 29
In an expert opinion regarding applicability of human rights law, Wide states that “The consistent
jurisprudence and authoritative statements of the relevant international human rights review bodies and
the International Court of Justice regarding the CAT, ACHR and ECHR has been to interpret the term
‘jurisdiction’ in these treaties as operating extraterritorially in certain circumstances. ”30 Wide continues

by stating that “although there is less authoritative commentary on the extraterritorial applicability of the
CRC, the meaning of ‘jurisdiction’ in this treaty is arguably similar”. 31 This statement highlights the
connection between the term “jurisdiction” in the different human rights treaties, which will be discussed
in the following chapters. According to Wide, extraterritorial application of obligations in certain cases
cannot be denied; “the key question has not been whether human rights law treaty obligations apply
extraterritorially, but, rather, in what circumstances this happens”. 32

The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism and
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions (The Special Rapporteurs)
have, in a joint statement, expressed their views regarding the children and their mothers currently
detained in camps in Syria. 33 The Special Rapporteurs noted that the repatriation of the children,
including their families, is “the only international law-compliant response to the increasingly complex
and precarious human rights, humanitarian and security situation”. 34 Furthermore, the extent of the state’s
control must be examined when determining the extraterritorial obligations of that state. 35 Some state
obligations may have an extraterritorial scope, while others do not. The Special Rapporteurs clarify this
by noting that states can, for example, “have sufficient control over the child’s right to enter their own
country” but at the same time “not have sufficient control over their right to property” and therefore also
no obligation to guarantee this right to the children. 36 The connection between the acts of a state and the
impact on the individual has an direct effect on the states extraterritorial obligations. The connections
between the state of nationality and the child held in detention like conditions abroad is somewhat vague.
The actions, taken by the parents of these children, are the reason why the rights of these children risk
being violated. These parents do not work for, or take orders from, the state of nationality. This said, just
as the children, they are nationals of that state. However vague, this is a connection.
The possible existence of an obligation under international law to repatriate for states of nationality has
divided scholars. Those advocating for repatriation, such as directors for different human rights

organizations, have done so by simply stating that because states have ratified the CRC, they are therefore
obligated to secure the wellbeing of these children. 37 The problem regarding extraterritorial application
of human rights obligations has seldom been mentioned as a possible obstacle for an obligation to
repatriate.38 Before examining specific rights ensured in the relevant human rights treaties, the
extraterritorial applicability of state parties obligations need to be examined and clarified. When
examining the scope of applicability, the fact that human rights are meant to be universal, 39 should be
taken into consideration. According to Milanovic ‘jurisdiction’ has a “special meaning”40 within treaties;
“it has several ordinary meanings in general international law, and the interpretation has to establish
which of these meanings the treaties in fact use”. 41 This comment clearly highlights the importance of
interpretation. Arguments can be established both ways, depending on how the treaties are interpreted.
Milanovic has noted that there is “no presumption against extraterritoriality which we can turn to in
absence of a clear norm in the treaty itself regulating its extraterritorial applicability”. 42 Furthermore,
according to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the object and purpose should be taken into
consideration in the interpretation of the treaty. 43 This includes the interpretation of the provisions
determining the treaties jurisdiction. According to Milanovic “human rights treaties are themselves not
value-neutral instruments, and the process of their interpretation cannot be completely value-neutral
either”.44 Milanovic has also stated that in most cases an extraterritorial act by a state gives rise to
extraterritorial application of human rights treaties. 45 However, he has also noted that “extraterritorial
application does not require an extraterritorial state act, but solely that the individual concerned is located
outside the state’s territory, while the injury to his rights may as well take place inside it”. 46 In the case

of children held in detention like conditions outside their state of nationality, even if the injury takes place
outside the state parties territory, it does not necessarily mean that application could not be extraterritorial.
The decision not to repatriate is also taken within the state of nationality’s territory and might have
consequences for the enjoyment of rights outside the state of nationality’s territory.
According to the Maastricht Principles on Extraterritorial Obligations of States in the Area of Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights, an international expert opinion, the “attempt to limit obligations territorially
has led to gaps in human rights protection in various international political processes and a lack of
adequate regulation for the protection of human rights”. 47 The Maastricht Principles do not establish any
new section of international human rights law, rather it clarifies states extraterritorial obligations based
on already existing legislation.48 The Maastricht Principles notes that all states must “respect, protect and
fulfil human rights…both within their territories and extraterritorially”. 49 In the context of the state’s
scope of jurisdiction, the Maastricht Principles clarifies that if states have the ability to influence the
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights extraterritorially, they have an obligation to do so.50
Furthermore, the Maastricht Principles also note that states have an obligation to provide international
assistance, if possible, in order to secure these rights. 51 Repatriating children held in detention like
conditions in war torn states would definitely influence their possibility to enjoy these rights. The United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, has urged states to repatriate children
affiliated with FTF’s in Syria; “Foreign family members should be repatriated, unless they are to be
prosecuted for crimes in accordance with international standards". 52 It is unlikely that the children,
currently held at the camps in Syria, will ever be prosecuted.

discerned in order for that State to be authorized to exercise its jurisdiction”. 53 Regarding extraterritorial
obligations, it is easier to argue for possible negative obligations, that is, an obligation of a state to refrain
from doing something. However, if a state can exercise its jurisdiction extraterritorially, both positive
and negative obligations can also be applicable extraterritorially. According to the principle of nonintervention, it is prohibited for one state to intervene in another state’s domestic affairs. 54 If this principle
would be interpreted strictly, all actions by state’s that take place outside the territorial boarders would
be seen as violations of international law. This would be contrary to “what the international community
has opted for”, according to Ryngaert.55 With no provision in international human rights treaties directly
stipulating a possible obligation to repatriate children outside their state of nationality, the interpretation
of relevant human rights treaties and the scope of obligations related to children’s rights become
increasingly relevant and important. To interpret the principle of non-intervention strictly, and to limit
states possibility to act extraterritorially, would not be reasonable.
Tonon defines nationality as the “judicial link” between a person and a state, leading to duties both
nationally and internationally.56 When analysing jurisdiction and nationality the Nottebohm case, and the
concept of “genuine connection”, should be addressed as well since it is relevant to the reasonable
exercise of jurisdiction. The Nottebohm case focused on nationality and the connection between the
individual and the state of nationality. Mr. Nottebohm, a German national living in Guatemela, had
obtained the nationality of Liechtenstein in 1940 because of Germanies involvement in the Second World
War and the consequences from that. In 1943 he was removed because of war measures and
Liechtenstein’s claimed for restitution and compensation from the Guatemalan government before the
International Court of Justice (ICJ).57 The ICJ noted that there was an “absence of any bond of attachment
between Nottebohm and Liechtenstein”. 58 Therefore, the ICJ ruled that the claim submitted by
Liechtenstein was inadmissible. 59 For Liechtenstein to exercise diplomatic protection over Mr.
Nottebohm, outside the state’s territory, a “genuine connection” between Liechtenstein and Mr.

Nottebohm was required.60 In this case there was none. While acknowledging that the circumstances
surrounding the children held in detention like conditions abroad is very different, it is however worth
noting that these children have a far stronger connection to their state of nationality than Mr. Nottebohm.
Regarding the connection between the individual in need of protection, and the state, Ryngaert has noted
that “the rule of reason in fact goes further than the concept of “genuine connection, on the basis of
weighing the regulating State’s own connections and interests with those of other States involved”.61 In
the Nottebohm case, the problem was the fact that nationality was aqquired in order to obtain protection
and benefits, not because of any special link or connection to Liechtenstein. Comparing to, for example,
Finnish children affiliated with ISIS fighters in Syria, there are many differences, but also some
similarities. Mr. Nottebohm changed his nationality in order to not be affiliated with Germany, a country
very much in the centre of the Second World War. The children with parents belonging to ISIS do not
have the possibility to remove this affiliation in order to be treated more favourably. Furthermore,
contrary to Mr. Nottebohm, the children have a connection to their state of nationality. They are born in
that state, or they are born to a parent who is a national of that state. These children have not sought out
nationality to be able to seek protection of any kind. They have obtained the nationality by birth and
should therefore be entitled to protection accordingly. The Nottebohm case is an example of the
importance of a “genuine connection” in order for there to be a jurisdictional link. A reasonable
applicability of jurisdiction takes this link into consideration. However, in this case the link was discussed
in a procedural setting.
Contrary to many states’ inaction concerning their nationals held in detention like conditions in Syria,
countries like Russia, Kosovo and Kazakhstan have repatriated nationals, both children and adults. There
has been no indication that these repatriations would have violated international law or the principle of
state sovereignty. Establishing a state’s jurisdiction over the nationals detained abroad is a first step
towards acknowledging the repatriations legal nature. Scholars have suggested that the universal
character of human rights needs an “expansive concept of extraterritorial jurisdiction”. 62 Miller describes
extraterritorial jurisdiction, as a “limited exceptions to the rule of territorial jurisdiction”.63 An exception

that requires a significant connection between the individual whose rights have been affected and the
state physical territory. 64 Human rights norms were not conceived only to regulate states actions towards
individuals within their territory. The norms also regulate behaviour towards individuals within their
jurisdiction.65

2.1.3. Positive / negative obligations
The discussions about extraterritorial application of human rights obligation has mostly centred around
negative obligations, that is the obligation to refrain from doing something. The possible obligation to
repatriate children, held in detention like conditions abroad, is positive obligation. Both are obligations
to ensure that human rights are respected, one by refraining from violating human rights, and the other
by taking measures to ensure that human rights are respected. Both types of obligations offer protection,
but they are of different nature. It is easier to argue for states to refrain from violating human rights
abroad, than to argue for states to take certain positive measures, for example repatriation, to ensure that
human rights are respected.
When examining the case of children, who are family members of FTF’s, held in detention like conditions
in Syria right now, the importance of action by the state of nationality becomes evident. The camps where
the women and children are held are under the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Syrian governments
authority. These authorities have not indicated any specific interest in the fate of the foreigners in their
territory, except requested the states of nationality to repatriate. Therefore, the state of nationalities’ role
become even more important. 66 Da Costa has noted that a statement by the European Commission of
Human Rights, regarding a child abduction from UK to Jordan, “hints that states may remain bound by
their positive and negative obligations under the Convention when exercising jurisdiction abroad. 67 If
states have jurisdiction over their nationals held in detention like conditions abroad, they can also have
positive obligations towards them.
All human rights treaties have both positive and negative obligations, and these obligations may in certain
situations apply extraterritorially. There is no general rule determining when this is the case, rather it is

decided on a case by case basis. The Special Rapporteurs have issued a joint statement regarding the
current situation in Syria where they noted that there exists a “positive obligation to take necessary and
reasonable steps to intervene in favour of their nationals abroad”. 68 Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs
note that positive obligations only exists if there are “reasonable grounds to believe that they face
treatment in flagrant violation of international human rights law”. 69 If there is a serious risk of human
rights being violated, there could exists a positive obligation to repatriate. In the Special Rapporteurs joint
statement possible examples of “flagrant violations” were sexual violence, arbitrary detention, inhumane
or degrading treatment and torture. 70 All of these are violations that some children held in detention like
conditions in Syria have reportedly been subjected to.
The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms
while countering terrorism (the Special Rapporteur) stated in a report, after visiting France, that the
French government is “strongly encouraged to activate positive legal and diplomatic protection for
French citizens in conflict zones overseas, particularly children”. 71 The Special Rapporteur also stated
that this positive protection included “taking positive steps to support nationality determination and
interventions where French nationals face serious human rights violations in detention”. 72 Examples of
such a violations were torture and sexual violence.73 This is simply the view of the Special Rapporteur,
and not legally binding. Still, it is an example of how positive obligations found in human rights treaties
could be interpreted. States have also been urged to take “positive and cooperative action” in a joint
statement by four United Nations High-Level Advocates in order to “ensure the full protection of human
rights and ensure humanitarian needs of these civilians are met.” 74

2.2.1. The Convention on the Rights of the Child
Several rights in the CRC are relevant when examining the obligation to repatriate children of FTF’s held
in detention like conditions abroad. This chapter focuses on those that are relevant explicitly to the CRC’s
extraterritorial scope and the state party’s extraterritorial jurisdiction. Specific articles of the CRC,
relevant to the circumstances the are subjected to, will be examined later in the thesis. Article 2 of the
CRC determines the scope of the convention;

“1. States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present Convention to each child
within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child's or his or her
parent's or legal guardian's race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national,
ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status.
2.States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is protected against all forms
of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status, activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs of
the child's parents, legal guardians, or family members.”75

The foreign children currently held in detention like conditions in Syria are outside the territory of their
state of nationality, they are outside the state’s territorial jurisdiction. Art 2 of the CRC does not indicate
that the convention should only apply to children within state parties “territorial jurisdiction”. Neither
does art. 2 determine that the CRC should apply only to children within the state party’s territory. Article
2 of the CRC states that the rights ensured in the convention should be guaranteed to “each child within
their jurisdiction”. The exact scope of the jurisdiction is not further clarified in art. 2 and this leaves room
for interpretation.
One reason for states inaction to repatriate nationals, currently held in detention like conditions in Syria,
is the family ties to ISIS, a notorious terrorist organization. Most of the children at the camps where born
in the caliphate and are under the age of six. 76 When examining the extraterritorial scope of the CRC,
several factors needs to be considered, one of them being the non-discrimination principle, which is also
emphasized in art 2 of the CRC. Politics, national security or who your parents are should not have an
impact on how legislation is interpreted. It should not affect state parties’ legal obligations. However,
with the subject under examination being as sensitive and controversial as it is, this is to some extent

impossible. Children should be treated equally despite their family ties to FTF’s, and the possible
consequences of that. Even if the children could be considered as security threats, this should not have
consequences for the protection of their rights. Allowing national security and political factors, stemming
from the children’s family ties to FTF’s, affect the interpretation of the scope of the CRC is
discrimination, and therefore also a violation of the convention.
While examining the meaning of the word jurisdiction in art. 2 of the CRC, art. 4 of the same convention
should also be noted. Article 4 of the CRC states that:
“States Parties shall undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative, and other measures
for the implementation of the rights recognized in the present Convention. With regard to
economic, social and cultural rights, States Parties shall undertake such measures to the
maximum extent of their available resources and, where needed, within the framework of
international co-operation.”77

The CRC Committee has stated, regarding art 4 of the CRC, that “states are required to undertake all
possible measures towards the realization of the rights of the child, paying special attention to the most
disadvantaged groups”.78 Fore notes that “the thousands of children of foreign fighters languishing in
camps, detention centers or orphanages in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere are among the world’s most
vulnerable children”. 79 The children of foreign nationality currently held at the camps in Syria are a
disadvantaged group. They have not been able to affect their situation, they are being labelled as “ticking
time bombs” and they are unable to leave camps where they suffer from dire conditions. Therefore, these
children could have the right to “special attention”, as noted in art. 4 of the CRC. However, what exactly
this attention consists of, is not clarified. This “special attention” could consist of extraterritorial
applicability for state party obligations and a possible obligation to repatriate. Art 4 of the CRC also
states that the rights set out in the convention, if needed, can be achieved “within the framework of
international co-operation”.80 The states that have repatriated nationals from Syria, have done this in
cooperation with other actors, such as international organizations operating in the area.81

The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Right (ICESCR) includes neither territory
or jurisdiction when determining the scope of the covenant. Article 2 of the ICESCR simply states that
“each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually and through international
assistance and co-operation”82 and “the States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to guarantee that
the rights enunciated in the present Covenant will be exercised without discrimination of any kind”. 83
According to some scholars, this choice of wording, or rather the choice not to mention territory or
jurisdiction, could indicate that the ICESCR has an extraterritorial applicability. 84 This said, it should be
noted that this is only an interpretation. While the CRC did include the term “jurisdiction” in art. 2, it
could be interpreted as implying a weaker extraterritorial scope than the ICESCR. However, the fact that
the word “territory” was not included, could equally be interpreted as implying extraterritorial
applicability of the CRC’s obligations to state parties.
In a General Comment, from 2005, the CRC Committee discusses the treatment of unaccompanied
children that are outside their state of nationality. 85 Several of the children currently held in detention
like conditions at the camps in Syria are orphans, and would therefor fall within the category of
“unaccompanied children outside their state of nationality”. 86 The CRC Committee specifically even
mentions international conflict and civil war as a possible reason for children becoming unaccompanied
or separated.87 The current situation in Syria is also a product of civil war and international conflict. It
should be noted that not all children of FTF’s held in detention like conditions abroad are unaccompanied.
For example, in Syria children affiliated with ISIS are often detained together with their mothers. Art.1
of the CRC confirms a child is everyone under the age of 18, 88 unaccompanied or not. Article 2 also
states that the conventions should be applied without discrimination. 89 While the general comment
focuses on children that are unaccompanied and separated abroad, bearing in mind art 1 and art 2 of the

CRC, the General Comment could in some cases also be relevant regarding the children of FTF’s held
in detention like conditions in a foreign state.
The international nature of child rights abuses is also noted in the CRC Committee’s General Comment
No.2; “Children’s human rights issues are not constrained by national borders and it has become
increasingly necessary to devise appropriate regional and international responses to a variety of child
rights issues”.90 This General Comment dates back to 2002. Almost 20 years has passed and the nature
of abuses against children has changed. When the problems change, so should the solution. When
drafting the CRC, and the related General Comments, situations like the one currently taking place in
Syria where not necessarily taken into consideration. Children held at camps, outside their state of
nationality, is not something that has occurred before, at least not on this scale. The new nature of the
situation is important to bear in mind when examining the extraterritorial applicability of the CRC.
The CRC Committee notes in General Comment nr.5, concerning the general measures of
implementation of the CRC, that “when States ratify the Convention, they take upon themselves
obligations not only to implement it within their jurisdiction, but also to contribute, through international
cooperation, to global implementation”. 91 This is not an direct obligation for states to repatriate in order
to ensure that their rights are respected. Nor is it an indication of the fact that the CRC’s obligations are
always extraterritorial. This statement by the CRC Committee is merely a reminder that, while territorial
jurisdiction is the normal, state parties cannot ignore child rights abuses outside their territory. Even if
the children are not within their state of nationalities territory, nationality is the connection, and should
be considered when examining the states jurisdiction.
The CRC Committee has also commented on possible developments of state parties’ obligations. In the
Objectives of the General Comment No.6, the CRC Committee notes, referring to standards that will
clarify state obligations in relation to unaccompanied and separated children, that “states parties must be
cognizant of their evolutionary character and therefore recognize that their obligations may develop
beyond the standards articulated herein.”92 As previously noted, the situation under examination is new.

An innovative interpretation of this General Comment could be to claim that the emergence of the new
problematic situation regarding these children is an example of a new situation. And this new situation
leads to the “evolution” of these standards, and therefore also a development of state obligations
extraterritorially. Even if this General Comment focuses on unaccompanied and separated children’s
treatment, it is relevant to analyse. It is closely related to the purpose of this thesis and highlights an
innovative interpretation of the CRC’s extraterritorial applicability for state parties.
The CRC Committee has clarified that there is a difference between territory and jurisdiction, by stating
that “state obligations under the Convention apply to each child within the State’s territory and to all
children subject to its jurisdiction”. 93 The CRC Committee continues discussing the CRC’s jurisdiction
by clarifying that “state obligations under the Convention apply within the borders of a State, including
with respect to those children who come under the State’s jurisdiction while attempting to enter the
country’s territory.”94 This comment also makes it clear that states can have obligations under the CRC
outside the territorial boarders. The children held at the camps in Syria may not be actively trying to
enter their state of nationality. Many of them are held in detention like conditions at the camps, they are
young, or they might even have parents that object to a possible repatriation. These children do not
necessarily have the possibility to even try and enter their state of nationality. According to the CRC
Committee, the scope of the CRC is not limited to the children within the state’s territory, children trying
to enter the country are also included. Or at least with “respect to those children”. 95 Bearing this in mind,
it is again worth noting that the children at the centre of examination in this thesis are nationals of state
parties to the CRC. They might not all be unaccompanied, or actively trying to enter their state of
nationality, as required by this General Comment for the CRC to have extraterritorial jurisdiction, but
this is in most cases simply due to their lack of ability to do so.
The best interest of the child will be examined later on in the thesis. At this point it is simply worth noting
that the CRC Committee has stated that “the interpretation of a child’s best interest must be consistent
with the whole Convention”. 96 The “whole Convention” includes art.2, which states that “State Parties

95

20

shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present Convention to each child within their
jurisdiction without discrimination”. 97 When examining state parties jurisdiction, bearing in mind the
child’s best interest, an extraterritorial application would provide more protection for children, and
therefore also be in their best interest. International law is evolving slowly, while the events in our world
are evolving quickly. New and innovative ways of interpreting existing international law might be
necessary in some cases, and possible in cases where the legislation leaves room for interpretation. When
drafting human rights treaties, the fact that situations, circumstances and problems change has been taken
into consideration. Hence, there is room for interpretation in order to apply relevant provisions to
different scenarios.
There are several articles in the CRC that highlight the international nature of the convention and the
importance of international cooperation in order to secure all the rights in the convention to every child.98
The CRC Committee has stated that the CRC should “form the framework for international development
assistance related directly or indirectly to children”.99 The CRC Committee has also stated that United
Nations Agencies should make sure that “international cooperation is targeted at supporting States to
fulfil their obligations under the Convention”. 100 The international nature of the CRC is evident, and
despite lacking a direct indication of extraterritorial positive obligations for state parties, there is at the
same time no indication of the fact that the state parties obligations under the CRC would solely be
territorial.

2.2.2 European Convention on Human Rights
When examining the jurisdiction and obligations of state parties, in addition to the CRC, other human
rights treaties also need to be examined since children have rights under other human rights instruments
as well. Similarly, to the CRC, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) states that “the High
Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in
Section I of this Convention”. 101 Neither the CRC nor the ECHR mention the word “territory” when

establishing the state party’s jurisdiction. Also, similarly to the CRC, the obligations stemming from art.
1 of the ECHR include positive obligations to protect the rights of individuals against violations from
third parties. 102
The choice of wording of the ECHR was not established without deliberations. The exact choice of
wording was thoroughly examined when drawing up the ECHR. The Committee on Legal and
Administrative Affairs of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe drew up a draft of art. 1
of the ECHR that described the scope of the convention as “everyone residing in their territories”. 103 This
wording was later changed by the Committee of Intergovernmental Expert with the motivation;
“The Assembly draft had extended the benefits of the Convention to ‘all persons residing within
the territories of the signatory States’. It seemed to the Committee that the term ‘residing’ might
be considered too restrictive. It was felt that there were good grounds for extending the benefits
of the Convention to all persons in the territories of the signatory States, even those who could
not be considered as residing there in the legal sense of the word.” 104

The Committee of Intergovernmental Experts changed the wording of art.1 of the ECHR from “residing
in their territories” to “within their jurisdiction”. 105 This change further establishes that there is a
difference with the choice of wording in human rights treaties. According to Da Costa, the preparatory
work of the drafters of the ECHR indicates that the wish was to “extend protection under the Convention
as widely as possible”. 106 At the same time scholars also suggest that the drafters did not give any thought
to an extraterritorial application of the convention’s provisions.107 No matter what the exact intention
behind the choice of wording was, the changes made to art 1 of the ECHR leaves more room for
interpretation, and a possible extraterritorial applications of the obligations. Furthermore, the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) notes that the preparatory work may be used as a
“supplementary means of interpretation”. 108

The European Court of Human Rights (hereafter referred to as ECtHR) has also established case law
regarding art 1 and the extraterritorial applicability of the ECHR’s obligations. According to the ECtHR,
recognizing extraterritorial jurisdiction to state parties is exceptional. 109 However, exceptional does not
equal impossible. Since there is currently no case-law specifically concerning the issue under
examination in this thesis, the caselaw from the ECtHR is merely an example of the fact that in some
cases, states exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction. For example, in the case of Loizidou v. Turkey, the
ECtHR was requested to determine if the applicants complaint, which occurred outside the territory of
Turkey, falls within the “jurisdiction” of Turkey. 110 The ECtHR recalled in the deliberations that
“although Article 1 (art. 1) sets limits on the reach of the Convention, the concept of "”jurisdiction" under
this provision is not restricted to the national territory of the High Contracting Parties”. 111 Even though
the circumstances regarding the concept of jurisdiction were different from the one’s regarding the FTF’s
children held in detention like conditions outside their state of nationality, the case law should be taken
into consideration when examining whether the ECHR’s obligations are applicable extraterritorially. The
importance of the ECHR, regarding the rights of children affiliated with FTF’s, is also especially
significant because of the ECtHR, a mechanism in international human rights law enforcing these rights
and delivering judgements. 112 Compared to the ECHR, the CRC’s monitoring mechanism is weak. 113
The enforcement of the CRC is monitored by the CRC Committee, which constitutes of independent
experts.114 The CRC Committee cannot hand out legally binding judgements, like the ECtHR.

The Al-Skeini and Others v. United Kingdom case, before the ECtHR, 115 is another case of relevance for
the subject of this thesis. The case concerns Iraqi nationals, who were killed by British Forces in Iraq.
According to the applicants, the killed individuals were under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom
when they died. 116 The ECtHR noted that jurisdiction is primarily territorial, however also noting that

“acts of the Contracting States performed, or producing effects, outside their territories can constitute an
exercise of jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 only in exceptional cases.“ 117 Furthermore, the
ECtHR noted that there already exists established case law recognizing some circumstances which give
rise to exercise of jurisdiction by state parties outside the states territory. 118
The Al-Skeini case clarifies that exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction is possible when acts of the states
produce effects outside the state’s territory. 119 The ECtHR noted that since UK had exercised public
powers through its soldiers and had control and authority over the killed individuals, there existed a
jurisdictional link between UK and the killed individuals.120 Therefore, the ECtHR finally concluded that
the killed Iraqi nationals fell within the jurisdiction of the UK.121 Despite this outcome, the judgement
has also received criticism. Da Costa suggests that “the Courts reliance on the exercise of public powers
as one important factor suggesting the existence of a jurisdictional link between state and victims is
worrying, since it could leave out state actions which would not meet this condition”. 122 Furthermore,
Da Costa notes that the matter is still not solved and “clear principles on the subject” are still missing. 123
In the deliberations of the Al-skeini case the Court noted that “the Court’s approach must be guided by
the knowledge that the object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of
individual human rights requires that its provisions be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards
practical and effective”. 124 When interpreting art 1 of the ECHR, this is important to take into
consideration. Judgements like this open the door for possible future case law establishing states
extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction in cases where their nationals are held in detention like conditions
abroad.
Another case worth examining in the context of extraterritorial jurisdiction is Issa and Others v.
Turkey.125 The case concerned Turkish military operations carried out in Iraq, which led to the death of
the applicant’s relatives. The question the ECtHR had to examine was whether “the applicants' relatives

State as a result of the latter's extra-territorial acts”. 126 The ECtHR noted that “in exceptional
circumstances the acts of Contracting States performed outside their territory or which produce effects
there (“extra-territorial act”) may amount to exercise by them of their jurisdiction within the meaning of
Article 1 of the Convention”. 127 Holding foreign children in detention like conditions abroad could
amount to a “exceptional circumstance”, and a decision by the state of nationality not to repatriate most
likely “produce effects” for those children extraterritorially. Case law is constantly evolving, and
according to Da Costa, the Court has throughout the years increasingly found “exceptional
circumstances”.128 Thus, the evolution of case law will continue and new “exceptional circumstances”
seem to emerge. In the case of Issa and Others v. Turkey, the court finally did not find that the applicant’s
relatives where within the jurisdiction of Turkey.129 Nevertheless, the Courts reasoning is of relevance
since it further clarifies that the ECHR can in some cases be applied extraterritorially. 130
The Special Rapporteurs have stated that jurisdiction outside a state’s boarders is established primarily
in two different ways. First, by the state’s exercise over foreign territory, and secondly, by the state’s
control over a person, also called “ratione personae”. 131 Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs noted that,
regarding the current situation in Syria, states “are most likely to engage their jurisdiction ratione
personae. 132 The FTF’s were not sent there by the state, they are simply the state’s nationals, and the
FTF’s children were most likely taken to Syria without a choice, or were even born there. Nonetheless,
according to van Spaendonck, the state of nationality has the responsibility to guarantee the children’s
well-being according to the CRC even if the children would have left their state of nationality
voluntarily.133

There is currently a case against France brought to the European Court of Human Rights.

134

The

applicants in the case are the grandparents of two French children and their mother currently held at the
al-Hol camp in Syria. The case concerns the fact that France is refusing to repatriate them back home. 135
The grandparents claim that their grandchildren are “exposed to inhumane and degrading treatment in a
camp beset by illness and malnutrition”, 136 and this is because France is refusing to repatriate them. In
other words, they claim that France is in violation of art.3 of the ECHR, which states that “no one shall
be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”. 137 Clarification on an issue
affecting most European countries at the moment is much needed. In addition to the case brought before
the ECtHR, similar cases concerning state party’s failure to repatriate their nationals from the camps in
Syria have been brought before national courts.138 The lack of case law and jurisprudence regarding this
specific issue, both in international and national courts, is yet another indication of the fact that the issue
is new, and yet to be solved. Da Costa argues that the case law regarding extraterritorial jurisdiction is
“moving towards a broader and more inclusive interpretation of the Convention, leading to its application
in events taking place abroad”. 139 According to Da Costa the movement is slow, and there is still room
for improvement. 140 The important part is that there is movement. With new “exceptional circumstances”
arising, such as the foreign children currently held in detention like conditions in Syria, new case law
will eventually also emerge.
2.2.3. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) has a different wording regarding
jurisdiction than the CRC and the ECHR. In the ICCPR the scope of the covenant is described in art. 2
as:
“Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals
within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant,

without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status”.141

The ICCPR mentions both territory and jurisdiction when determining the Covenants scope. The
inclusion of the word “jurisdiction” in addition to “territory” could be interpreted as an indication of the
ICCPR’s extraterritorial reach. It should also be noted, similarly to the CRC and the ECHR, that the
obligations arising from art 2 paragraph 1 are both positive and negative.142
The Human Rights Committee (HRC) discusses the extraterritoriality of the ICCPR in General Comment
No. 31, The Nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the Covenant.143 The
HRC clarifies in General Comment that art 2, paragraph 1, of the ICCPR “means that a State party must
respect and ensure the rights laid down in the Covenant to anyone within the power of effective control
of that State Party, even if not situated within the territory of the State Party”. 144 The HRC has recognized
the extraterritorial reach of the ICCPR and therefore also, according Capone, opened “the door for a
wider interpretation of the jurisdiction clause, which could, in principle, find application also in the
situation of FTF’s and their family members”. 145 According to Capone, this could for example be in
regard to state refusing to issue birth certificates or identity documents. 146 According to Da Costa, the
HRC’s General Comment No. 31 clarifies that an individual does not have to be both within a state’s
jurisdiction and under its jurisdiction for the covenant to apply, either one is enough. 147 Da Costa also
notes that the HRC Committee refers to “power of effective control”, but does not specify the exact
meaning of the term.148 Da Costa further challenges this vague use of terminology by noting that “should
‘power’ be understood as a factual notion related to the influence and authority exercised over persons
or should it rather encompass a legal notion related to the capacity of states to guarantee Covenant rights
abroad?”.149 This question is of great relevance to the subject of this thesis. Again, examining the
situation in Syria as an example, states of nationality do not have any authorities operating in the country.

The children held in detention like conditions at the camps are not within “effective control” of their
states of nationality. However, the state of nationalities does have the capacity to influence their
enjoyment of rights abroad, by for example repatriating them.

In 1984, the HRC submitted views in the Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay case. 150 The communication was
initially submitted to the HRC by Delia Saldias Lopez, a political refugee from Uruguay. The
communication was submitted under the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights.151 Without going into details about the case, the relevant information in connection to
the subject of this thesis is that the author of the communication claimed that her husband had been
kidnapped and detained in Buenos Aires, by Uruguay security, and then later transported back to
Uruguay, where he was also detained. The author claimed that during the detentions her husband suffered
both mental and physical abuse and degrading or inhuman treatment. 152 Article 1 of the Optional Protocol
to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that the HCR can “consider
communications from individuals subject to its jurisdiction who claim to be victims of a violation by that
State Party of any of the rights set forth in the Covenant. 153 In the case of Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay, the
HRC concluded that even if the inhuman treatment and the initial detention according to the author took
place in another country, the HRC could still consider these allegation towards Uruguay because neither
art. 1 of the Optional Protocol or art. 2 (1) of the Covenant “barred” it. 154 In addition, the Committee
stated that:
“The reference in article 1 of the Optional Protocol to "individuals subject to its
jurisdiction" does not affect the above conclusion because the reference in that article is
not to the place where the violation occurred, but rather to the relationship between the
individual and the State in relation to a violation of any of the rights set forth in the
Covenant, wherever they occurred”.155

The circumstances in this case differ from the subject under examination in this thesis. A direct
comparison between the two cases is impossible to make. However, these comments by the HRC support

the fact that human rights obligations can, in certain situations, have an extraterritorial reach. The latter
comment by the HRC, stating that “the reference in that article is not to the place where the violation
occurred, but rather to the relationships between the individual and the State”, 156 is relevant also
regarding the purpose of this thesis, even if the circumstances are different. The current location of the
children, or their family ties to FTF’s, should not be at the main focus. The focus should be on the
children’s connection to their state of nationality, and this is clearly formulated by the HRC in the
comment quoted above.

In a communication concerning the Lopez v. Uruguay case, Tomuschat noted in an individual opinion
that “To construe the words "within its territory" pursuant to their strict literal meaning as excluding any
responsibility for conduct occurring beyond the national boundaries would, however, lead to utterly
absurd results”.157 Tomuschat continued by noting that, referring to the covenants jurisdictional clause,
“ the formula was intended to take care of objective difficulties which might impede the implementation
of the Covenant in specific situations”. 158 The above statement is a clear indication of the ICCPR’s
international scope. During the drafting phase of the ICCPR’s scope of application, the focus was not on
territory. 159 According to Da Costa, the drafters of the ICCPR were mainly worried about the nationals
abroad and their protection. 160 Furthermore, Da Costa note that “the main subject of controversy
concerned how to expect a state party to ensure rights to its nationals abroad, since nationals abroad
would arguably fall within the jurisdiction of another state”. 161 Having the nationality of a state party,
like the children under examination in this thesis, is a clear relationship to that state. The Special
Rapporteurs have also noted that if state parties to the ICCPR “decide to withhold essential life-saving
protection from an individual on the grounds of their purported crime, or on the grounds of the purported
crimes of their spouses or parents this would violate both the State’s obligation to protect the right to life
and the prohibition against discrimination”. 162 Repatriation could be a “life-saving protection”, and the
decision not to act because of an affiliation with FTF’s could therefore also amount to discrimination.

2.2.4. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment
The Committee against Torture describes the prohibition of torture as “non-derogable” and a “matter of
customary international law”.163 The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment (CAT) determines the scope of the convention in art 2 as “in any territory under
its jurisdiction”. 164 Again, both “territory” and “jurisdiction” are used to determine the state party’s
jurisdiction. However, differently than in the other human right treaties. Art 2 clarifies that states need to
take “effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture”. 165 The
preventive measures states need to take are further clarified in article 16; “each State Party shall undertake
to prevent in any territory under its jurisdiction other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment which do not amount to torture”. 166 Similarly to some obligations in other human rights
treaties, the above mentioned obligations are of a positive nature. It is not only a questions of actions
state parties need to refrain from doing, also actions states need to take in order to ensure that the rights
of individuals are respected. As previously mentioned, the possible obligation to repatriate children
affiliated FTF’s detained outside their state of nationality, is a positive obligation. It is an act states could
undertake in order to secure the rights set out in the CAT for their nationals.
Regarding the obligations to take preventive measures mentioned in art 2 and art 16 of the CAT, the
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (hereafter
referred to as the Special Rapporteur in this chapter) has stated that these articles “clearly encompasses
action taken by States in their own jurisdiction to prevent torture or other ill-treatment
extraterritorially”. 167 According to Da Costa, the phrasing of the CAT was also widened in the drafting
phase of the treaty,168 similarly to what was discussed regarding the drafting of the ECHR in previous
chapters. The Special Rapporteur also noted that the

” jus cogens non-derogable prohibition against torture and ill-treatment cannot be territorially
limited and that any jurisdictional references found in the Convention against Torture cannot be
read to restrict or limit States’ obligations to respect all individuals’ rights to be free from torture
and ill-treatment, anywhere in the world” 169

The Special Rapporteur reaffirmed that the prohibition of torture and the obligations stemming from it,
are customary international law.

170

The Special Rapporteur also clarified the scope of the state party’s

jurisdiction by stating that the jurisdiction “cannot be invoked to limit the applicability of the relevant
obligations to territory under States parties’ de jure control because such an interpretation would be
contrary to the Convention’s object and purpose”. 171
The object and purpose of human rights treaties should guide the interpretation of its provisions. 172 This
includes the provisions establishing state parties’ jurisdiction and the extraterritorial application of the
state parties’ obligations. While territorial sovereignty should be respected, the purpose of the CAT, and
other human rights treaties, would hardly ever be achieved if every state solely focused on the problems
and issues within their territory. According to Da Costa, referring to the CAT, “states sought to expand
the reach of the Convention as far as feasible, while paying respect to the principle of sovereignty”. 173
The Special Rapporteur also confirmed that to interpret state party’s jurisdiction only territorially would
be contrary to “authoritative interpretations by the Committee, jurisprudence and common interpretations
of the term “jurisdiction” under international law”. 174 This, is yet again another indication of the fact that
extraterritorial interpretation of the term jurisdiction is common under international law. The Special
Rapporteur additionally highlighted that interpreting jurisdiction only territorially “would be in
derogation of absolute norms of customary international law and of a jus cogens nature”. 175 Furthermore,
the CAT is not only a convention, it is also considered as a legal standard. 176

The Special Rapporteur has described the phrasing “any territory under its jurisdiction”, in art 2 of the
CAT, as “a common-sense drafting choice”.177 The Rapporteur also stated that the choice of wording
“cannot be interpreted as intending to limit a State’s obligation to take preventive measures against
torture and ill-treatment”. 178 As already discussed in connection to the ECHR, the choice of wording in
the treaties is intended to allow an extraterritorial interpretation of the jurisdictional clause. The Special
Rapporteur also clarified the positive nature of some of the obligations stemming from the CAT by noting
that states are not only required to “abstain from unlawful acts but also to ensure a broader range of
positive human rights obligations”. 179 The Rapporteur even stated that if a state fails to fulfil their positive
human rights obligations, the state may be “responsible for “indirectly attributable extraterritorial
wrongfulness”.180 Knowledge of grave breaches of human rights, such as a violation of the prohibition
against torture, entails indirect responsibility. The Special Rapporteur also noted that the practical
difficulties states might face when protecting “relevant rights” extraterritorially, does not “displace their
positive duties to guarantee and ensure these rights at all times”.181
Article 5 of the CAT notes that states must establish jurisdiction over offences when the persons who has
allegedly committed the offence is a national of that state. 182 In cases where the treatment of the children
held in detention like conditions abroad amounts to torture, and the parents of the child can be considered
responsible, states have a clear obligation to establish jurisdiction. However, this is not the situation in
all cases, only the most severe. Nonetheless, with jurisdiction comes positive obligations, such as the
obligation to repatriate. Furthermore, the Committee Against Torture has noted that if a state has
“reasonable ground to believe that acts of torture or ill-treatment are being committed by non-State
officials or private actors” and the state does not try to prevent these acts, the state is considered
responsible. 183 The ill-treatment of the children currently at the camps in Syria has been widely discussed
in media and is surely known by all states with nationals at the camps.

The CAT differs from the other human rights treaties because of the jus cogens nature of the prohibition
against torture, which is the focus of the treaty. 184 A prohibition against torture can also be found in other
human rights treaties. When examining the CAT, it should be noted that the convention might not be
applicable in all situations of foreign children held in detention like conditions abroad. The circumstances
of the children differ from situation to situation. However, as will be further discussed in the coming
chapters, the CAT should also be considered as there have been alarming reports from Syria about
violations of rights guaranteed in the CAT. The Special Rapporteur has clearly highlighted the
extraterritorial nature by stating that the international legal obligations stemming from the CAT obligate
states to guarantee the rights to every individual with its jurisdiction, “even extraterritorially.”185
To conclude the above chapter examining the articles defining state party’s jurisdiction in different
human rights treaties, there is no indication that the scope of the human rights treaties is strictly
territorially limited. According to Da Costa, interpreting the CAT broadly is only logical, and the purpose
of the treaty is to “fight against torture worldwide”. 186 There are several indications of extraterritorial
jurisdiction in both case law and general comments. Noting this, together with the new nature of the issue
under examination, an innovative interpretation, which takes into consideration the object and purpose,
of the treaties discussed above could be in favour of an extraterritorial jurisdiction for state parties.
Jurisdiction entails rights and obligations, both negative and positive. Extraterritorial jurisdiction does
not in it itself equal a positive obligation to repatriate. Furthermore, there is no direct extraterritorial
application of obligations for state parties. Nonetheless, what is clear is the fact that the scopes of the
human rights treaties, discussed above, are not territorially limited and therefore there is room for
interpretation and possibly positive extraterritorial obligations. It should also be noted that, for example,
the CAT does not impose any obligations on individuals, but on the state parties.187

3. Substantive Human Rights
3.1. The Best Interest of the Child
When examining the possible obligation to repatriate children that are family members of FTF’s and held
in detention like conditions abroad, article 3 of the CRC is one of the most important articles to examine.
The European Commission describes the concept of ‘the best interest of the child’ as a “substantive right,
a fundamental and interpretative legal principle and a rule of procedure”. 188 Paragraph 1 of art 3 states
that “in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare
institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child
shall be an primary consideration”.189 The wording “in all actions”, refers to every decision that concerns
and/or affects a child. In other words, decisions regarding the possible repatriation of children.
Furthermore, the wording “primary consideration” clearly indicates that nothing shall be considered
above the best interest of the child. Not economic reasons, not political reasons, and not national security
reasons. The fact that repatriation of these children is a politically charged issue, or the fact that it might
be viewed as a threat to national security, should not weigh more than the deliberation of what is in the
best interest of the child. However, what exactly is viewed as the “best interest of the child” is not
specified. If the conditions at the detention camps where the children affiliated with FTF’s are held are
similar to the current conditions at the camps in Syria, it is hard to argue that it would be in the best
interest of the child to leave them there.
The extraterritorial applicability of some human rights obligations has been established by several human
right’s supervisory bodies.190 In 2013, the CRC Committee stated in General Comment no. 14,
concerning the child’s best interest, that “In giving full effect to the child’s best interests, the following
parameters should be borne in min; (a) The universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated nature
of children’s rights…”191 In the same General Comment, the CRC Committee also mentions the “global
nature and reach of the Convention”. 192 The exact extraterritorial applicability of the CRC’s positive

obligations, or the exact scope of the CRC, is however not further clarified. Indications of the CRC’s
global and universal nature, could be an indication of possible extraterritorial applicability of the CRC’s
obligations, including the positive obligations. The obligation to repatriate in order to secure the rights
stipulated in the CRC, could be such positive obligation. Art 3 of the CRC does not specify exactly what
the “best interest of the child” is, and therefore there is here again room for interpretation. And this
interpretation should be done in favor of the child, since that is in the child’s “best interest”.
Problems regarding children’s family ties to FTF’s affecting the interpretation of art. 3 has already been
raised in many countries. For example, in Finland, the Finnish children affiliated with ISIS at the Al-hol
camp have been called pawns in the political game. 193 Children have also been viewed as “ticking time
bombs”,194 referring to them as threats towards national security. However, none of these factors, the
political game or the security aspect, should be a primary consideration when making decisions that
concern children. The child’s best interest should always be a primary consideration. 195 The interpretation
of international law, especially when it concerns children’s rights, should not be influenced by the current
political atmosphere or threats to national security. To some extent politics do affect legislation, both
nationally and internationally. Nonetheless, these factors are not the ones to primarily consider. The fact
that the best interest of the child should be taken into consideration in national security measures has also
been confirmed by the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly. According to the Assembly, when
fighting terrorism, and dealing with issues related to children, the focus should be on the best interest of
the child and that adequate protection of the children’s rights should be ensured. 196
There is no denying that art 3 of the CRC leaves room for interpretation in both ways. One could argue
that it is in the child’s best interest to stay at the camps where they have already spent most of their
childhood, rather than to return to a “unknown” country, they do not necessarily even remember. On the
other hand, it is also possible to argue that it is in the child’s best interest to be repatriated from the camps
back to their state of nationality where they have a chance to grow up in a safe environment, where their

human rights can be guaranteed. The CRC Committee has identified the ‘best interest of the child’ as a
“general principle of the Convention for interpreting and implementing all the rights of the child”. 197 In
other words, the principle should be taken into consideration when interpreting all the other provisions
of the CRC. The CRC Committee has also noted that the ‘best interest of the child’ should be viewed as
a “dynamic concept that requires an assessment appropriate to the specific context”. 198 Every situation is
different and therefore interpretation is important and should be “dynamic” and suited for the specific
situation at hand.
The dilemma regarding the parent/legal guardian also needs to be acknowledged when discussing art.3
of the CRC. Children should be separated from their parents only in extreme circumstances, and as a last
resort, since it is in most cases in the best interest of the child, to be with their parents. However,
separation from a parent is possible according to the CRC, if it is in the best interest of the child.
According to article 19 of the CRC, states can get judicially involved when protecting children from
“physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or
exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person
who has the care of the child”.199 Here again, what exactly is meant by “judicial involvement” 200 is not
specified. It could, for example, be the removal of a child from the care of a parent by repatriating in
order to secure the rights set out in the CRC for that child. However, here again it is important to
acknowledge the fact that the “best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration”. 201 In most
cases it is probably not in the best interest of the child to be separated from his/her parents. This said, in
some extreme cases, it could still be in the best interest of the child. This could be the case if, for example,
the child’s life is in danger.
The importance of the best interest of the child has also been emphasized by Fore, Executive Director
for UNICEF. In November 2019 UNICEF issued a statement regarding the detained children in Syria. In
the statement Fore noted that by November 2019, 17 countries had already repatriated children, however
she continued by highlighting that “the actions of these countries, however, remain the exception, rather
than the norm. Our message to governments is unequivocal: The best interests of children should be a

primary consideration at all times”. 202 Fore also stated that in accordance with international standards,
and the best interest of the child, states should assist in reintegrating the children and “the safe, dignified
and voluntary repatriation of foreign children back to their countries of origin”. 203 The first consideration
should always be payed to the best interest of the child and children should in all circumstances be treated
as victims first.204 The fact that these children are family members of FTF’s should not affect the
obligations of the state of nationality. If states were to allow the parents actions to influence the rights of
the child, it would not comply with international obligations.205 The possible repatriation of children
should not be “assessed through a national security lens”. 206
As already mentioned, the CRC’s legal obligations are both positive and negative. 207 The CRC creates
obligations for the state parties rather than directly on private individuals themselves. 208 States are
obligated to take positive action to protect the children within its jurisdiction from violations, carried out
or caused by, private persons or institutions.209 In other words, it is the state’s responsibility to ensure
that the children within their jurisdiction enjoys the rights set out in the CRC. This includes an obligation
to ensure that the parents of a child do not violate or ignore these rights. The examination of the best
interest of the child is important in itself, but also in connection to the interpretation of other rights. The
provisions in one way offers limitless protection, but at the same time it is vague. The protection assured
is dependent on the interpretation.
When examining the possible obligation to repatriate children, the issue regarding their parents evidently
also emerges. According to art 5 of the CRC state parties have to respect “the responsibilities, rights and
duties of parents,… legal guardians or other persons legally responsible for the child”. 210 This respect is
however not indefinite, article 19 of the

CRC allows states to take “appropriate legislative,

administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental
violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual
abuse”.211 Furthermore, art 19 lists measures states are allowed to take to support these children. Art 19
allows states to, in addition to the measures listed, also take “other forms of prevention”. 212 The wording
is very vague, and leaves room for interpretations. In this interpretation, it is important, here again, to
take the best interest of the child into primary consideration. Art 19 even specifically allows states to,
when appropriate, get judicially involved. 213 This does not mean that states can easily separate children
from their parents when repatriating. The conditions that should be met before a state can intervene are
strict. Article 19 merely opens a door for possible repatriation, even in cases where the parent/legal
guardian opposes. However, this is something that needs to be determined on a case by case basis, with
the best interest of the child as the most important consideration.
The Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly has stated in their report, concerning children affiliated
with ISIS detained in Syria, that “a child-rights perspective into counter-terrorism efforts is not only a
human rights imperative, but would also constitute an essential contribution towards the national security
of the countries concerned”. 214 This is a strong statement against arguments invoking national security
as an obstacle for repatriation. In the same report, the Parliamentary Assembly even urged member states
to repatriate children “regardless of their age or degree of involvement in the conflict”. 215 In other words,
even if states where to consider the children’s family ties to FTF’s as “involvement in the conflict”, this
should not affect their possible repatriation to their state of nationality. If the children are left at the camps
in Syria, there is a risk that they will be radicalized according to the Assembly. 216 Therefore, the Council
of Europe’s human-rights based approach to combating terrorism in the best way forward. 217 The
Assembly also noted that the focus should be on the best interest of the child when dealing with actions

against terrorism that are related to children. 218 The refusal to repatriate due to the potential threat to
national security, would be such action.

Like the European Commission, the CRC Committee has also described the child’s best interest as a
substantive right, fundamental principle and a rule of procedure. 219 In connection to the child’s best
interest as a substantive right the CRC Committee notes that it should be “implemented whenever a
decision is to be made concerning a child, a group of identified or unidentified children or children in
general”. 220 Regarding the child’s best interest as a legal principle, the CRC Committee notes that when
a legal provision is open for interpretation, the option that “most effectively” takes the child’s best interest
into consideration, should be chosen. 221 Finally, regarding the child’s best interest as a rule of procedure
the CRC Committee notes that if a decision will affect a child, the “decision-making process must include
an evaluation of the possible impact (positive or negative)”. 222 The decision not to repatriate the children
is a decision, even if it leads to no action. When making the decision, the best interest of the child needs
to be considered.
If a child’s right to life is at risk of being violated at the camp where he/she is being held, it is impossible
to argue that it would be in the child’s best interest to remain at the camp. The CRC Committee has noted
that when states have taken a decision that affects children, the state must be able to explain how the best
interest of the child has been considered in the decision-making process.223 States must also be able to
show “what criteria” the decision was based on and “how the child’s interest have been weighed against
other considerations”.224 Most EU member states have not taken any “official” decision against
repatriating, they have simply just not acted. However, not to act is also a decision and an assessment of
the child’s best interest should have been made when taking that decision. If, for example, the situation
would be extremely critical, and the conditions where a child is being held would amount to torture, it
would be impossible for the states of nationalities to find any “criteria” to base a decision not to repatriate

on. Also, what could weigh more than a child’s life? These are all questions the states of nationality have
to consider even in situations where they take no action. According to the CRC Committee “inaction or
failure to take action and omissions are also “actions””. 225
As previously noted, art 3 of the CRC leaves room for interpretation with its vague formulation.
According to the CRC Committee “the flexibility of the concept of the child’s best interests allows it to
be responsive to the situation of individual children”. 226 The vague formulation should be interpreted as
offering a broad range of protection to children in very different situation. Throughout this thesis the new
nature of the situation under examination has been highlighted and this is only one example of how new
situations constantly emerge and the best interest of the child should be applicable in all situations.

3.2. Right to Livelihood
3.2.1. Right to Life
Death is unfortunately not unusual at the Al-hol camp in Syria. According to a report from the
International Rescue Committee, published in September 2019, the number of young children under the
age of five, that have died at the Al-hol camp since March that same year has doubled. 227 According to
the same report, there where 399 recorded deaths of children between December 2018 and September
2019.228 This equals a total of 80% of all the deaths at the Al-hol camp.229 The children are those paying
the highest price and at the same time the children are the ones that least deserve to be there. When
examining the current situation in Syria, it is evident the right to life should also be noted when examining
an obligation to repatriate. Article 6 of the CRC states that “States Parties recognize that every child has
the inherent right to life”. 230 The wording in this article, “every child”, leaves no room for interpretation;
the right to life belongs to every child. It should not make a difference what nationality, age, or current
place of residence that child has. Children have the right to life. Art 6 does not refer to an obligation for
the state to secure the life of every child, it simply obligates states to “recognize” the right to life.

According to some scholars, if states were to leave the children currently at the camps in Syria, and not
make any effort to try to repatriate them, this would amount to a violation of art 6 of the CRC. 231

Paragraph two of art 6 of the CRC states that “States Parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible
the survival and development of the child”. 232 This second paragraph of art 6 also leaves room for
interpretation. What exactly counts as “the maximum extent possible”, is not clarified. While bearing in
mind the conditions at the camps in Syria, it is clear that both the survival and the development of the
children is threatened. The Committee on Social Affairs, Health and Sustainable Development has in a
report described the children’s situation in Syria as “stranded in squalid camps and detention centres,
exposed to grave violations of their rights, as well as risks of radicalisation, and a high rate of illness and
mortality. With every passing day, more children’s lives will be lost or ruined unless immediate action
is taken”. 233 No specific action is required by state parties in this article, and this leaves again room for
interpretation. The CRC Committee has stated, in connection to art. 6, that states are expected to
“interpret “development” in its broadest sense as a holistic concept”. 234 Furthermore, the CRC Committee
has noted, also in connection to art.6, that “implementation measures should be aimed at achieving the
optimal development for all children”. 235

The right to life is also protected in other human rights treaties. Article 2 of the ECHR states that
“everyone’s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save
in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is
provided by law”.236 According to the ECtHR this is “one of the most fundamental provisions of the
Convention” and “ no derogation from it is permitted”.237 The right to life is also guaranteed by the
ICCPR; “every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one
shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life”. 238

As previously discussed, art. 2 of the ICCPR determines the Covenants jurisdiction; “all individuals
within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction”. 239 The HRC has clarified the connection between art 2
and art 6 of the ICCPR by noting that the “subject to its jurisdiction” refers to “all persons over whose
enjoyment of the right to life it exercises power or effective control”. 240 Furthermore, the HRC clarifies
that this includes individuals who are currently outside the state parties territory, but “whose right to life
is nonetheless impacted by its military or other activities in a direct and reasonably foreseeable
manner”. 241 In the case of the children currently held in detention like conditions in Syria, their right to
life is not affected by their state of nationalities military. However, the HRC’s vague wording “other
activities in a direct or reasonable foreseeable manner” 242, leaves room for interpretation since there is
no specification to what exactly it refers to. This statement could also be interpreted as to indicate that
states may have extraterritorial responsibility in cases where the state in question has the possibility to
ensure the right to life and protect from a “immediate or foreseeable threat to life”.243 Repatriation of the
children from camps where they are held in detention like conditions, and where their right to life is
threatened, could be one possible way to ensure the right to life of these children.
The Special Rapporteurs on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism
and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions (the Special Rapporteurs)
have in a legal analysis noted that a state’s responsibility can be “invoked extra-territorially in
circumstances where that particular State has the capacity to protect the right to life against an immediate
or foreseeable threat to life”. 244 The Special Rapporteurs also note in the legal analysis that the
jurisdiction over nationals held in camps in a foreign state may exist because “their actions directly
influence their right to life”. 245 Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs also note that this is applicable to
the children currently being held in detention like conditions in Syria. 246 The inaction to repatriate
nationals, especially vulnerable children, could have an impact on the right to life. There have already

been reports of children dying in Syria, and this could probably have been avoided if those children
would have been repatriated.
The Country Director for Save the Children in Syria, Sonia Kush, has stated that governments actually
do have the chance to save the lives of children, that are their nationals, simply by removing them from
the camps; “children are being killed and it is unacceptable that governments who can do something to
stop this are not acting”.247 It remains open for interpretation exactly what exactly amounts to the
“maximum extent possible”, referred to in art 6, paragraph 2, of the CRC. It should be acknowledged in
this context that there are international organization on sight to assist,248 and authorities at the camps in
Syria have urged EU member states to repatriate their nationals. In other words, assistance is available for
the states of nationality. Taking into consideration these factors, it would be hard to imagine that any EU
member state could argue that it is not within their “maximum extent possible” to repatriate these children.
There are several practical obstacles, such as the will of the parents, national legislation, and the lack of
consular services in the area. However, since some states have already repatriated children,249 these are not
insurmountable obstacles. If repatriation is within the “maximum extent possible” of one EU member state,
it is hard to imagine it is not other EU member states.
In September 2019 the Washington Post wrote an article about a 14-year-old girl who had died at the alHol camp in Syria. The girl’s mother claimed that her daughter had slipped and died in result of the fall.
However, the doctors who examined her body, said that her neck had been broken in several places and
she died struggling to breath. Other camp residents supported this by saying she was killed because she
refused to follow the strict ISIS rules regarding wearing a black niqab. 250 According to the article,
authorities and other residents of the camp claim the women affiliated with ISIS are re-imposing ISIS
rules with a “reign of fear” at the camp. 251 This behavior by these women, many of whom are mothers,
could be interpreted as both physical violence and mental abuse, and in extreme cases such as the one
mentioned above, deprivation of the right to life. The acts of the parents that violate the children’s rights,
are the responsibility of the state. States are the duty holders. Several international organizations, and

even the Syrian Democratic forces have expressed their desire for Western States to take responsibility
for their citizen’s. 252
As discussed in the previous chapter, art 19 of the CRC allows states to take measure, when appropriate,
to ensure the rights set out in the CRC, even by getting involved “judicially”. 253 In cases where children
are dying, it is hard to argue that involvement would be inappropriate. It is not easy, and it entails several
practical difficulties, to separate a child from his/her parents. Nonetheless, it is not impossible if the
child’s life is threatened and it is in the best interest of the child. If repatriating a child would save that
child’s life, it is in the child’s best interest. Parents opposition to repatriation is not necessarily in all
cases an indefinite obstacle. The CRC Committee has noted that “the concept of the child’s best interest
is complex and its content must be determined on a case-by-case basis”. 254 The best interest of the child
should be taken into account in all decision, and in every interpretation of a provision that affects
children. 255 This includes the decision to possibly separate a child from his/her parents. According to the
CRC Committee the “specific circumstances of a particular child” should be considered when assessing
the child’s best interest. 256 The Committee on Social Affairs, Health and Sustainable Development has
in a report noted, in connection to the situation in Syria, that “in cases where surviving parents are
prosecuted or convicted for criminal activity, separation from the child may be inevitable”. 257
The situation of the foreign children held in detention like conditions in Syria is chaotic, constantly
evolving and still ongoing. The children at the camps suffer and their rights have been, and still are
violated. The local authorities have not been able to ensure that their right to life is respected in
accordance with the above-mentioned human rights treaties. Children shouldn’t only be viewed as
objects that need protection and assistance, instead they should be viewed as rights holders, rights that
they are entitled to have protected. 258 Paulssen has stated, in connection to the repatriation of children
from the camps and their state of nationality that, states can decide over the scope of their consular help,

but there are “several obligations under international law that would argue in favor of repatriation,
especially in the case of children”. 259

3.2.2. Right to Health
According to the organization Save the children there were 8704 foreign children living in 3 different
camps in North East Syria up until the 13th of October 2019.260 Only a small percentage of these children
have been repatriated. The Committee on Social Affairs, Health and Sustainable Development issued a
report in January 2020 reminding member states of their commitments to human rights treaties and their
obligations that can be found in these treaties.261 Several different obligations can be found in the human
rights treaties, such as the obligation to protect children from physical or mental violence, from inhumane
treatment and the obligation to always consider the child’s best interest.262 In cases where children are
held in detention like conditions in a foreign country, there are many possible rights that risk being
violated. The above-mentioned report also clearly states that according to the Council of Europe’s
Parliamentary Assembly, repatriation of the children affiliated with ISIS is a human rights obligation. 263
However, it should be noted, that the Parliamentary Assembly is not a legal authority.
According to an article from June 2019, at the Al-hol camp alone there were 8000 foreign children. 264
Reports from the camp note that worms have been found inside the tanks containing the residents
drinking water and the tents that the residents live in are contained with sewage water. 265 This is surely
far from the “highest attainable standard of health” mentioned in art.24 of the CRC;
“States Parties recognize the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard
of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. States Parties

shall strive to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to such health care
services.”266

Paragraph 4, of the same article, continues by stating that “State Parties undertake to promote and
encourage international co-operation with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the
rights recognized in the present article”. 267 This is not a direct obligation to repatriate these children, and
in that way achieve the “highest attainable standard of health” with the help of “international cooperation”. However, repatriation is one possible way of ensuring the rights set out in the article for the
state parties nationals. Paragraph 4 of art 24 is also another indication of the fact that cross boarder
cooperation and action is needed to ensure that the rights set out in CRC can be fully ensured to all
children.
The conditions at the camps are constantly deteriorating and lack of sanitation and proper housing are
growing problems. 268 The longer states leave their nationals, especially children, at the camps, the more
they suffer from the conditions. These conditions are not necessarily unique to the situation in Syria since
FTF who travel abroad to fight most likely end up in war torn countries, with limited resources. Syria is
just one example of such country. There have been several reports about the conditions and health
problems at the camps in Syria since the beginning of 2019. Still in April 2020, many children with
foreign nationalities are held in detention like conditions and the camps and subjected to the same
problems; a high rate of illnesses, no access to clean water, no access to medical services and no proper
shelter from the elements. 269 The longer the children are subjected to the above discussed conditions, the
higher the risk is that their right to life will at some point also be violated.
Art. 39 of the CRC clarifies the reintegration of children who have suffered violations of their right, and
in what environment this reintegration should take place;
“States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and
social reintegration of a child victim of: any form of neglect, exploitation, or abuse; torture or any other
form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; or armed conflicts. Such recovery and

reintegration shall take place in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the
child.”270

This article doesn’t directly state that the reintegration should take place in the state of nationality.
However, it is unlikely the camps, where the children in Syria are currently held, count as places that
foster “health, self-respect and dignity”, as stipulated in the article above. This article merely indicates
that there are requirements for the environment where the reintegration should take place. The importance
of reintegration, of for example children affiliated with ISIS, has also been established by the United
Nations Security Council.271

3.3. Right to be free from Ill-treatment
3.3.1. Right to be free from Torture
As previously noted, the prohibition of torture is customary international law.272 The CAT defines torture
as:
“any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted
on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession,
punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,
or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of
any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the cons ent
or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not
include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.” 273

In the case of children who are family members of FTF’s, the relevant substance in this article is not the
obtaining of a confession of information as a reason for torture. The relevance for this thesis is found in
the wording “punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having
committed” and “for any reason based on discrimination of any kind”. 274 Children should not be treated
any differently and should definitely not endure any kind of torture because of they are family members
of FTF’s. If the inaction of states to repatriate is the result of the possible security threat the children

could pose, and this inaction leads to treatment that amounts to torture for the children, it would be a
breach of art 1 of the CAT. Both by being discriminatory and by being a “punishment” for acts committed
by a third party. It should be noted that torture is not something every child held in detention like
conditions abroad is subjected to. A state’s failure to repatriate is also not always caused by the possibly
risk the children’s family ties to FTF’s pose for national security. Nonetheless, it should be noted that if
this would be the case, it would be violation of the child’s rights under several human rights treaties. The
prohibition of torture, whether mental or physical, is absolute. Article 2 of the CAT states that “No
exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political
instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture”. 275 This clearly
confirms that, for example, national security, the threat of war, nor the political nature of the issue, can
be viewed as reasons for justifying torture. There are no exceptions to the prohibition of torture.
Therefore, if the children’s treatment and conditions at the camps could amount to torture, there is no
argument against repatriation that states of nationality could awoke.

The right to be free from torture is also specifically secured for children in the other human rights treaties.
Article 7 of the ICCPR states that “no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment”.276 Article 37 of the CRC states that “no child shall be subjected to torture or
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”. 277 Article 3 of the ECHR states, similarly
to art 7 in the ICCPR, that “no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment”.278 The Committee on Social Affairs, Health and Sustainable Development has in a report
stated that since the situation at the camps in Syria is putting the rights of the children at risk, “article 7
of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and Article 3 of the European
Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) could be invoked”.279

The landmark case before the ECtHR, Soering v. The United Kingdom, clearly established that
deportation to a country where there is a risk of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment is a violation of

art.3 of the ECHR.280 In the Soering case the ECtHR clarifies that there are no exceptions or derogations
to art. 3 of the ECHR, and that it “enshrines one of the fundamental values of the democratic societies
making up the Council of Europe” and is “generally recognized as an internationally accepted
standard”.281 In the case of foreign children held in detention like conditions abroad, they have not been
deported there. They have been brought there by their parents, nonetheless, they have been taken there
without a choice. The circumstances in the Soering- case are different, the decision to deport was clearly
taken by an authority. For the children at the centre of this thesis, there was no official decision, the
decision was simply taken by the parents.
According to Da Costa, the Soering case indicates that not all violations amount to state responsibility,
only in cases where “key provisions” are violated. 282 Despite the differences, there are three clear
similarities between the Soering-case and foreign children held in detention like conditions abroad. The
first resemblance between the two situations is the above-mentioned fact, that neither Mr Soering, nor
the foreign children held in detention like conditions abroad, could impact their situation. Mr Soering
was being deported, and the children were taken abroad by their parents. Another resemblance is the
fact that they both faced the risk of violations of art. 3 of the ECHR. The states action to deport Mr
Soering would violated the enjoyment of his right under art 3, and the state of nationalities in-action to
repatriate could in severe cases violate the children’s rights under art 3. Thirdly, neither situations
concerned state actions on foreign territory. The violation of art 3 in the Soering case would have been a
result of a deportation decision taken by the authorities within the state’s territory, that would have had
consequences outside state territory. However different, a decision to refrain from repatriating children
that are held in detention like conditions and risk being subjected to torture, unhuman or degrading
treatment, is also a decision taken within the state’s territory, which has consequences outside state
territory. According to Da Costa the Soering case is a “groundbreaking judgement” since “it departs from
the principle according to which liability normally arises only once a violation has actually occurred”. 283
In the case of children held in detention like conditions abroad, a violation of art.3 might not yet have
occurred and might not even occur in every case. But the longer the children remain at the camps, the

higher the risk of future violations grows. One could argue that since states are not allowed to deport an
individual of foreign nationality to a state where there is a risk of torture or other inhuman treatment,
state should equally not be allowed to leave nationals to suffer from the same violations in a foreign state.
As already clarified in chapter 2, some of the obligations stemming from the CAT are positive
obligations. Not obligations to refrain from doing something, but an obligation to act to prevent a
violation of a right guaranteed by the convention. Such action could, for example, be the repatriation of
children held in detention like conditions outside their state of nationality, in order to ensure that their
rights secured in the CAT are respected. According to the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (hereafter referred to as the Special Rapporteur in this
chapter) states are obligated to take positive measures only in cases where they “exercise sufficient
authority to be able to do so”. 284 In other words, states are not in all circumstances obligated to take
positive measures. The fulfillment of positive obligations is “practicable only in certain situations”. 285
The Special Rapporteur has recognized that states can face “practical difficulties”. 286 At the same time
The Special Rapporteur notes that the ‘difficulties’ states may encounter when trying to secure the rights
set out in the CAT in extraterritorial scenarios “can never displace their positive duties to guarantee and
ensure these rights at all times”. 287 The “practical difficulties” that states use as arguments for not
repatriating their nationals, does not remove their obligation to guarantee the rights set out in CAT. 288
Capone has argued that in light of the statements form the Special Rapporteur discussed here above, the
only way for states to actually fulfill their

positive obligations under the CAT, to secure that their

nationals are not subjected to torture or inhuman treatment, is to repatriate both FTF’s and their
families. 289
The national security aspect to repatriation of the children currently detained in Syria has also been
brought up by the Committee against Torture. In General Comment no.2, the Committee against Torture
states that “The Committee is deeply concerned at and rejects absolutely any efforts by States to justify

torture and ill-treatment as a means to protect public safety or avert emergencies in these and all other
situations”. 290 Regarding the subject of this thesis, it is not an issue of states directly torturing children
in order to protect national security. It is rather a matter of states failing to act to prevent ill-treatment of
these children because of the security risk possible repatriation could amount to. Nonetheless, it would
be contrary to international law, since there are no circumstances that justifies torture. Again, noting that
the treatment of the children does not in all cases amount to torture.
The Committee against Torture has also clarified that the CAT does not impose any obligations directly
on individuals, but rather of state parties to the Convention. 291 Article 5 of the CAT states that:
“1. Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction
over the offences referred to in article 4 in the following cases:
(a) When the offences are committed in any territory under its jurisdiction or on board a ship or
aircraft registered in that State;
(b) When the alleged offender is a national of that State;
(c) When the victim is a national of that State if that State considers it appropriate.”292

The children at the centre of this thesis are not located within the territorial jurisdiction of their state of
nationality. However, they are nationals of a state party to the CAT. The possible torture they might
suffer/have suffered while held at, for example the Al-hol camp in Syria, might have been committed by
a parent. In other words, likely a person of the same nationality. In connection to article 5 of the CAT,
the Committee against Torture has stated that “The Committee considers that the scope of “territory”
under article 2 must also include situations where a State party exercises, directly or indirectly, de facto
or de jure control over persons in detention”. 293 No specification to whom this refers to is made and there
is room for interpretation, possibly in favour of “nationality” being interpreted as control to some extent.
UN experts have, in a statement concerning the repatriation to Canada of a five-year-old orphaned girl,
noted that “Canada has an obligation to intervene in favour of its nationals abroad, particularly if there

are reasonable grounds to believe that their non-derogable human rights have been violated”. 294 Article
4 of the ICCPR enables states to, in times of public emergency, take measures that may derogate from
the obligations of the Covenant. 295 However, art.4 also lists certain rights that are non-derogable. 296 This
list includes, among other rights, art.6 which guarantees the right to life, and art.7, which guarantees the
right to be free from torture and inhumane or degrading treatment. 297 Furthermore, the UN experts noted
that “Canada has “primary responsibility” for ensuring that she is treated with humanity and respect of
her dignity and human rights”. 298 Syria has expressed no interest in the foreign children held at the camps
on their territory and has urged the states of nationality to take responsibility for them. Again, bearing in
mind the object and purpose of human rights treaties in general, the responsibility to guarantee nonderogable human rights to individuals lies with every state. Especially with the state of nationality since
that state does have a possibility to guarantee that the rights are respected by, for example, repatriating.

3.3.2. Right to be free from Inhumane Treatment
The conditions at the camps where family members of ISIS fighter are held in Syria have gained a lot of
attention in the media. The children are clearly the ones suffering the most, for example of diarrhoea and
malnutrition.299 A manager for the clinic for the Kurdish Red Crescent, Ramadan Zaher, has stated that
with more and more children suffering from malnutrition, the children are the ones paying the price for
decisions that are made by their parents.300 Article 19 of the CRC states that;
1. States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and
educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence,
injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including
sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who
has the care of the child.

2. Such protective measures should, as appropriate, include effective procedures for the
establishment of social programmes to provide necessary support for the child and for
those who have the care of the child, as well as for other forms of prevention and for
identification, reporting, referral, investigation, treatment and follow-up of instances of
child maltreatment described heretofore, and, as appropriate, for judicial involvement.301

Paragraph 1 of the article lists the different circumstances that amounts to neglect, or abuse, and
paragraph 2 lists measures states should take to protect the children from the abuses listed in paragraph
1. While examining art 19, there are several violations that can be found at the camps in Syria where
children are currently held in detention like conditions. According to reports, the children are, among
other things, exposed to sexual abuse, violence and exploitation. 302 Article 19 of the CRC mentions all
of these violations. As previously also noted, the CRC Committee has stated that the best interest of the
child should be taken into consideration when interpreting provisions relevant to children, this is also the
case regarding the protection from abuse and mental or physical violence. 303
Article 27 of the CRC recognizes “the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child’s
physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development”. 304 Paragraph 4, of the same article, continues
by noting that “State Parties shall take all appropriate measures to secure the recovery of maintenance
for the child from the parents or other persons having financial responsibility for the child, both within
the State Party and from abroad”.305 This article has an extraterritorial nature, with paragraph 4 clearly
stating that state parties also have an obligation regarding maintenance outside state boarders. Especially
with this article in mind, it is difficult to argue that the jurisdiction referred to in art.2 of the CRC, also
discussed in previous chapters, is only territorial. This article imposes obligations upon state parties also
outside territorial boarders. The use of wording in this article, “all appropriate measures”, is however
vague and again leaves room for interpretation. The CRC Committees has clarified that state have an
obligation to prevent violence and protect children who are victims.306 The Special Rapporteurs have, in

a joint legal analysis, stated that as long as states do not accept responsibility and engage, children at the
camps in Syria “face death, starvation, and extreme physical and emotional harm”. 307 According to the
Special Rapporteurs, states of nationality have the best capability to ensure that the human rights of these
children are protected.308

3.4. Right to be free from Arbitrary Detention
Some scholars describe the children in Syria as they are living in camps, while other use the word
“detention”. There is a difference between these two, with detention clearly being much more
problematic from a human rights point of view. The children currently held at the camps in Syria have
not been officially arrested or detained. Nonetheless they are not allowed to leave the camps and therefore
the conditions are similar to detention. The Special Rapporteurs have in the joint statement described the
situation in Syria as a “increasingly complex and precarious human rights, humanitarian and security
situation”.309 The Special Rapporteurs also stated that the children, and their families, are “detained in
inhumane conditions in overcrowded camps, prisons, or elsewhere in the northern Syrian Arab Republic
and Iraq”.310 According to the Special Rapporteurs the situation is increasingly dangerous and practical
challenges should not be used as an argument against repatriation. 311 To thoroughly examine the rights
of the children at the center of this thesis, the effects of arbitrary detention are also relevant to consider
since it is the case for some children, for example those currently detained in Syria.
Already in 2018, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict
expressed concerns in a report about the detention of children. 312 The report noted that “increasingly,
large numbers of children are being systematically arrested and detained in operations countering violent
extremism for their alleged association with parties to conflict”. 313 The children are considered as security
risks,314 simply because of their family ties to FTF’s. No proof, no concrete evidence, only an affiliation.

Fore has also clarified that no child should be detained only because of an affiliation with an armed
group, or family members that are part of an armed group.315 Furthermore, Fore notes that if a child in
fact is suspected of a crime, the principles of juvenile justice should be respected.316 Even if the statement
by Fore was initiated by, and focused on, the situation in Syria, it was formulated in a general manner
clearly indicating that the rights of children, for example the best interest of the child and the right to be
free from arbitrary detention, should be respected similarly in all situations of children held in detention
like conditions in a foreign state. In a joint statement issued by four UN High-Level Advocates, the fact
that the children currently in Syria are not just “living in a camp”, but in fact are arbitrarily detained, was
confirmed. 317 The Advocated expressed their concern over the “uncertainty of detention and security
arrangements in this region including possible lack of due process, arbitrary detention”. 318
The right to be free from arbitrary detention is ensured in several human rights treaties, and even
especially for children in the CRC. 319 International instruments do not definitively answer the question
of when exactly a detention no longer is in accordance with international law and becomes arbitrary. 320
According to the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the detention is arbitrary if, for example, there
is no legal basis that justifies the deprivation and the international norms regulating the right to fair trial
are not respected. 321 Arbitrary detention is prohibited in art.9 of the ICCPR by stating that; “Everyone
has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention.
No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure
as are established by law”. 322 For example, a person who has been convicted of a crime, can lawfully be
detained and deprived of his/her liberty. A child, with family ties to FTF’s, who possibly in the future
might be convicted of a crime, does not fall under the above-mentioned category. Article 9 of the ICCPR
also states that “It shall not be the general rule that persons awaiting trial shall be detained in custody”.323
In other words, even if the purpose of the detention is to prosecute in the future, it does not automatically

make the detention lawful. Even if the parents of a child in detention might in the future be facing a trial,
this does not justify the child being detained. Family ties to suspected FTF’s, or even convicted FTF’s,
does not amount to grounds for lawful detention, especially not in the case of children.
In some rare and critical cases, a separation from the mother or legal guardian could be in the best interest
of the child for several different reasons. The possible separation from legal guardians in this context is
addressed in art 37 of the CRC;
“Every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity
of the human person, and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her
age. In particular, every child deprived of liberty shall be separated from adults unless it is
considered in the child's best interest not to do so and shall have the right to maintain contact with
his or her family through correspondence and visits, save in exceptional circumstances”.324

Even when detained legally, children can be separated from their legal guardians, if it is in their best
interest. In the case of arbitrary detention of children, this should be even easier, since in that case, there
is no legal ground to detain the child, even if there might be a legal ground to detain the child’s parent.
Article 37 of the CRC also states that “No child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or
arbitrarily. The arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall
be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time”. 325 This article
does not directly prohibit the detention of children. The terminology used, “measure of last resort” and
“shortest appropriate period of time”, is again vague and leaves room for interpretation. However, when
it comes to children, months, or even years, of lawful detention is not short. In the case of the children
currently held in detention like conditions at the camps in Syria, there has been no trial, no court decision
of the detention, no evidence, and therefore no legal ground for the “detention”. It is important to point
out that the failure to prohibit arbitrary detention cannot be put on the state o nationality, rather it is on
the state detaining the child. However, it is a clear indication of the human rights violations that children
affiliated with FTF’s detained outside their state on nationality face. Yet another reason indicating the
need for repatriation to guarantee human rights to these children.
At the camps in Syria the ISIS ideology has continued to spread and the children with family members
belonging to ISIS have been described as an “captive audience”.

326

These children are at risk of being

CRC, art. 37 (c)
325 Ibid., art. 37 (b)
326 Loveluck, 2019
324

56

radicalized and/or recruited at the camps. 327 The longer they are held at the camps, the higher the risk of
radicalization grows. This is most likely not the case only in Syria, but in all scenarios where children
are held in detention like conditions with suspected FTF’s, whom still might have a strong belief in their
cause and a dedication to recruiting. In Resolution 2396 the Security Council urges states to “assess and
investigate” persons who they believe are FTF’s and to “distinguish” these persons from their family
members. 328 This resolution clearly notes that children should not be detained due to their parents being
individuals who may fulfill the grounds for detention. Resolution 2396 recognizes the fact that children
have not necessarily served in any role, and they might in fact solely be victims themselves. 329
Furthermore, the Resolution stresses the need to assist these women and children, and notes the
importance of taking into account their age and gender when doing so. 330

Resolution 2396 also

recognizes the importance of rehabilitation and reintegration of children with family ties to FTF’s. 331
However, the resolution also states that this is recognized in regards to children “returning or relocating
from conflict zones”. 332 The fact that children would return back to their country of origin from conflict
zones is taken for granted. The possibility of them being unable to return is not taken into consideration.
This is yet again an indication of the new nature of the problems regarding children held in detention like
conditions abroad.
Resolution 2396 also urges states to “find and bring to justice, extradite or prosecute any person who
supports, facilitates, participates or attempts to participate in the direct or indirect financing of activities
conducted by terrorists or terrorist groups”.

333

In other words, the Security Council urges states to find

and bring to justice FTF’s. There is currently no international tribunal prosecuting FTF’s. Therefore,
regarding the situation in Syria, the wording “find and bring to justice” could be read as an indication for
state parties to find, repatriate and then prosecute the FTF’s in their state of nationality. If the FTF’s
should be repatriated to their state of nationality, even if it is for the purpose of prosecution, where does
this leave their children? Bearing in mind the conditions at the camps in Syria, it does not sound
reasonable to leave the children at the camps while repatriating their parents.

Even if not using the wording “children”, article 10 of the ICCPR touches upon the detention of minors.
Article 10 states that “Accused juvenile persons shall be separated from adults and brought as speedily
as possible for adjudication”.334 Even if children were “detained” not only based on their family ties to
FTF, but actually based on the grounds that they themselves are suspected of having committed a crime,
they are entitled to special treatment. Article 10 of the ICCPR continues by stating that “Juvenile
offenders shall be segregated from adults and be accorded treatment appropriate to their age and legal
status”.335 Again, proceeding with the assumption that the children themselves are suspected of a crime,
they deserve “treatment appropriate to their legal age”.336 Exactly what treatment is appropriate for what
age, is not further specified. However, since the article does not even mention the word “children”, rather
uses the word “juvenile” it is possible to draw the assumption that it is not “appropriate treatment” to
hold a 12-year-old child in detention like conditions, without any lawful justification, because of family
ties to FTF’s. Article 26 of the ICCPR furthermore prohibits discrimination and states that everyone is
equal before the law. 337 To arbitrary detain a child, only because of his/her family ties to FTF’s, could
amount to discrimination.
One could also draw some parallels between the children held in detention like conditions abroad, to the
refugee children detained in EU member states. The detention of refugees and asylum-seekers has
become a new normal in various states and the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has expressed
concern especially about the detention of children. 338 The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)
has noted, in connection to child immigration detention, that keeping a family together “is not a valid
reason to justify a child’s detention”. 339 The children currently held in detention like conditions in Syria
are held at the camps because their family members are affiliated with ISIS’s fighters. If it is not a valid
reason for detention in EU member states, where the conditions are much better, is should not be a valid
reason at the camps in Syria. Article 22 of the CRC ensures children who are seeking refugee appropriate
protection and states that “state parties shall provide, as they consider appropriate, co-operation in any
efforts by the United Nations and other competent intergovernmental organizations or non-governmental

organizations co-operating with the United Nations to protect and assist such a child”. 340 The children
held in detention liked condition in a foreign country are not seeking refuge in any state, they are nationals
of the state parties and have every right to return to their state of nationality. They are simply unable to
do so. In the case of the children currently held at the camps in Syria, they are not allowed to leave. If
children seeking refugee should be assisted, shouldn’t children that are nationals of the state parties then
also be assisted?

3. Diplomatic and Consular Relations
4.1. Diplomatic Relations
When children affiliated with foreign fighters are detained outside their state of nationality, like many
children currently are in Syria, the circumstances cannot be described as normal. Syria has been torn
apart by a war and the diplomatic and consular representations of European countries is weak or even
non-existing.341 However, when discussing a possible obligation for states of nationality to repatriate
their nationals, diplomatic relations also need to be examined.
The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations regulates the diplomatic relationship between states.
Article 3 of the convention states that the diplomatic mission’s function is, among other things,
“protecting in the receiving State the interests of the sending State and of its nationals, within the limits
permitted by international law”. 342 In the case of the children currently detained in camps in Syria, the
sending state is, for the purpose of the thesis a EU member state, and the receiving state is Syria. And
the “nationals” are children, who are family members of ISIS fighter, and are held in detention like
conditions at the camps. According to Capone, violations of the “minimum standard of rights for aliens
required by international law” could enable the “State of nationality’s right to exercise diplomatic
protection”.343 These “standard rights” include, for example, the recognition of humane treatment, the

CRC, Art.22

341

59

right to life and the right to be free from unlawful detention. 344 As noted in previous chapters, all of the
above mentioned are at risk of being violated at the camps in Syria.

The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms
while countering terrorism visited France in the spring of 2019 to “assess the country’s counter-terrorism
laws, policies and practices, measured against its international human rights obligations”. 345 In the report
issued after this visit the Special Rapporteur stated that the French government is “strongly encouraged
to activate positive legal and diplomatic protection for French citizens in conflict zones overseas,
particularly children”. 346 If there would be an obligation to repatriate children detained abroad, this
obligations should be regardless of an affiliations with FTF’s. The possible repatriation of these children
would likely be carried out with assistance from diplomatic, and consular, service. The latter will be
examined in the following chapter.

4.2. Consular Relations
In addition to Diplomatic Relations, Consular Relations have to be taken into consideration when
examining a possible obligation to repatriate. Article 5 in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations
(VCCR) states that the function of the Consular services is “protecting in the receiving State the interests
of the sending State and of its nationals, both individuals and bodies corporate, within the limits permitted
by international law”.347 Article 5 also continues by stating that the functions additionally entail “helping
and assisting nationals, both individuals and bodies corporate, of the sending State”. 348
The VCCR explicitly even mentions children by stating that consular functions also consist of
“safeguarding, within the limits imposed by the laws and regulations of the receiving State, the interests
of minors and other persons lacking full capacity who are nationals of the sending State”. 349 This
formulation is vague, but, at the same time it highlights the special attention that should be payed to

children. The VCCR provides nationals abroad with aid and assistance, and this is especially important
when the fundamental human rights of individuals are at risk of being violated. 350 Therefore, there is in
some cases a duty for states to also protects its nationals extraterritorially. 351 As noted by the Special
Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, “access to
consular assistance is a human right”. 352 The Special Rapporteur also confirmed that “the home State
may be said to have jurisdiction over its nationals detained abroad because its actions to provide adequate
consular assistance have a direct influence on their right to life”.353
As stated above, the consular services of most European states in Syria are at the moment non-existing.
However, this is not necessarily an obstacle for consular assistance. Article. 6 of the VCCR states that
“A consular officer may, in special circumstances, with the consent of the receiving State, exercise his
functions outside his consular district”. 354 The situation in Syria at the al-Hol camp holding children of
foreign nationality, could be considered a situation with “special circumstances”. Article 2 of EU Council
directive 2015/637, regarding the consular protection of unrepresented citizens in third countries, notes
that “Member States' embassies or consulates shall provide consular protection to unrepresented citizens
on the same conditions as to their own nationals”. 355 The same directive clarifies that this “consular
protection” could consist of repatriation;
“The consular protection referred to in Article 2 may include assistance, inter alia, in the
following situations: (a) arrest or detention; (b) being a victim of a crime; (c) a serious accident
or serious illness; (d) death; (e) relief and repatriation in case of emergency…”.356

Many of the situations described are similar to the current situation at the camps in Syria. The camps
where the mothers and their children are being held have been called detention camps. 357 Field
researchers have come across both sexual abuse and violence at the camps. 358 It has been reported that

between December 2018 and September 2019, 399 children have died at the al-Hol camp alone.359 This
equals over 80% of the deaths in total at the camp. 360 With this information there is no doubt the children
are the ones suffering the most. They suffer from detention, crimes, illness and death, all of which are
circumstances mentioned in the Council directive as situations that could amount to consular assistance.
“Repatriation in case of emergency” 361 is even mentioned separately. One could argue that the children
suffering from all the above-mentioned circumstances amounts to a “case of emergency”. Therefore, the
argument that the lack of consular services in the region is the reason for not repatriating, is vague. The
assistance then only falls upon other member states. Article 249 of the Treaty establishing the European
Community (TEC) states that “A directive shall be binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each
Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and
methods”.362 The Council Directive discussed above, clearly notes that the lack of consular services in a
region, does not mean that state party nationals in that area are not entitled to any assistance. Consular
officials play an important role in ensuring that human rights of their nationals are not violated
extraterritorially.363

In 2018 the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental
freedoms while countering terrorism visited Belgium to “assess counter-terrorism laws, policies and
practices, measured against the country’s international human rights obligations”. 364 The Special
Rapporteur stated that Belgium has a “positive obligation to take necessary and reasonable steps to
intervene in favor of their nationals abroad”. 365 This obligations applies only if there is a risk of Belgian
nationals suffering from violations of human rights standards that are binding to Belgium. 366 The Special
Rapporteur also noted that there can be difficulties to fulfill this obligation, such as limited access to
consular assistance in some areas. 367 However, the Special Rapporteur also highlighted the importance

of consular assistance as a “preventive tool”. 368 Positive obligations could be described as “preventive
tools”, since they take the shape of actions taken to ensure that human rights are respected.

4.3. Consular Assistance Case Example: Finland
As an example, Finland will be examined as a state that has so far been reluctant to, just as many other
EU member states, repatriate nationals from the camps in Syria. The Finnish Chancellor of Justice, Timo
Pöysti, released in early October 2019 a statement regarding the possible repatriation of Finnish citizens
from the camps in Syria. Among other things, Pöysti stated that in accordance with the Vienna
Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular relations states have a right
to oversee the rights and benefits of its citizens in foreign countries.369 As previously noted, the consular
services of European countries have been limited in Syria for some time now and the Finnish Foreign
Ministry is currently incapable of providing consular services in Syria. Finnish citizens have been
encouraged to leave the area already in the summer of 2011.370 In 2012, the Finnish Foreign Ministry
stated that their possibility to assist with consular services, or with leaving the country is limited, and a
year later they informed that they are not able to assist at all in possible evacuations of Finnish citizens. 371
Finnish people who have travelled to the area, or stayed in the area after these recommendations and
travel statements from the Finnish Foreign Ministry, have done so by knowing the risks. However, this
does not apply to the children in the area. They have travelled there with their parents, most likely without
a choice, and some have even been born at the camps in Syria. The children have not been able to affect
their presence in the country. Nonetheless, whether or not the children had a choice, their state of
nationality has a responsibility to safeguard their wellbeing under the CRC. 372 The situation in Syria has
also evolved since these statements by the Finnish Foreign Ministry were issued. The active fighting
against the terrorist organization ISIS has seized, and now the aftermath of the crisis is being dealt with.

The fact that an EU member state, such as Finland, has removed its consular services from Syria, does
not mean that there is no possibility for Finnish citizens to receive assistance in the area. Article 20 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that:
“Citizens of the Union shall enjoy the rights and be subject to the duties provided for in the Treaties.
They shall have…the right to enjoy, in the territory of a third country in which the Member State of
which they are nationals is not represented, the protection of the diplomatic and consular authorities of
any Member State on the same conditions as the nationals of that State”373

If Finland would argue that because they have no consular services in the region, and since the state has
informed nationals of the danger to travel to the region, there is no obligation to assist nationals, the
burden would only fall upon other member states of the European Union. Therefore, relying on the lack
of consular presence when arguing against repatriation, is not enough. Most states have no representation
in Syria at the moment, the nearest Embassy for nationals of EU member states is often in Ankara,
Turkey. This is also the case for Finnish nationals in Syria.374
The Foreign Affairs Committee, a committee within the Parliament of Finland, released in 1998 a report
regarding consular relations. In this report, the committee stressed that it is important to take into
consideration the receiving states human rights situation when assessing the importance of consular
assistance in that area. 375 This is not a legal document, and therefore not legally binding. It is merely an
example of the fact that consular assistance is needed the most in areas where the risk of human rights
violations is high. The committee reaffirmed this by stating, in the same report, that in areas where a
person faces the risk of having his/her human rights violated the “threshold” for providing consular
services should be lower.376 Especially children are vulnerable to human rights violations, and especially
children are entitled to special protection. As discussed in previous chapters, the human rights of the
individuals, especially children, held in detention like conditions in Syria have been violated in several
different ways. Both consular services and diplomatic protection have an important role to prevent these

violations of human rights.377 The Finnish Ombudsman for Children has supported the idea of
repatriating children of Finnish citizens from Syria, if necessary, even by force. 378 According to the
Ombudsman, leaving the children at the camps in Syria with “a parent who neglects their care
responsibilities” is a violation of the rights of a child guaranteed by the CRC. 379

4.4. Protection of Nationals Abroad
When discussing extraterritorial applicability of human rights treaties and possible state party obligations
reaching beyond the territorial boarders of the states, the doctrine of the Protection of Nationals Abroad
(hereafter referred to as the Doctrine) should also be examined. The Doctrine has divided the opinions
of states and scholars and has been described as “highly controversial”. 380 According to Vashakmadze
the “uncertain legal situation” surrounding the Doctrine provides states with room for interpretation. 381
In recent years a discussion about the doctrine has emerged in connection to Russia’s actions in Crimea,
and Russia’s claim that the state was protecting nationals outside their territory with their actions.382 The
Doctrine is an indication of the extraterritorial nature of the protection of human rights. The Doctrine can
be described as allowing states to “forcibly intervene in other countries for the protection of their
nationals abroad”.383 Nonetheless, it should be noted that the Protection of Nationals Abroad is not a
legal instrument and imposes no obligations to states. A doctrine, within the context of law can be
described as a “principle of law established through past decisions”. 384 It is an example of a possibility
to act outside states territorial boarders.
The fear of FTF’s, terrorism, and threats to national security affects the willingness of states to assist
nationals abroad. As witnessed with the current situation in Syria, this is the case also concerning
children. The affiliation to a possible threat to national security affects the action, or in this case, inaction,

of states. While the focus of this thesis is legal, the surrounding problems are also acknowledged, even
if they are not explicitly examined. Usually when examining the Doctrine of the Protection of Nationals
Abroad, the circumstances have been different. The subject in need of protection has not been a child
held in detention like conditions abroad because of their family ties to FTF’s. However, this should not
be an obstacle in the protection of human rights. Human rights belong to everyone. Especially children
should be able to enjoy their basic human rights, as humans, and as children in need of special protection.
When examining the Doctrine, it is examined in the same context as intervention and the use of force.
However, the protection of nationals abroad does not have to be via use of force. Diplomatic protection
by peaceful means is also a way to protect nationals abroad. 385 In the case of the children currently held
in Syria, authorities have clearly welcomed the states of nationality to repatriate their nationals and
therefore any use of force would not even be necessary.
Regarding the Doctrine, three conditions need to be met before it is applicable. Firstly, there needs to be
an “threat of injury” against the state’s nationals.386 As discussed previously in this thesis, and taking the
children at the al-Hol camp in Syria as an example, the threat of injury cannot be overlooked and is
clearly present. The Human Rights Watch visited the camp in the summer of 2019 and reported foreign
children having swollen bellies, emaciated limbs, skin rashes and acute diarrhea and flu- like infections
that have caused deaths among the children. 387 Letta Tayler, senior terrorism and counterterrorism
researcher at Human Rights Watch, has said that “Foreign women and children are indefinitely locked
in a dustbowl inferno in northeast Syria while their home countries look the other way… Governments
should be doing what they can to protect their citizens, not abandon them to disease and death in a foreign
desert.”388
Secondly, there needs to be a failure from the state where the nationals currently are residing to protect
them.389 Again examining the children at al-Hol as an example, the overall situation in Syria has been
chaotic already for a long time. According to aid groups operating at the camps, the authorities at the

camp do not even appear to record the deaths occurring at the camps. 390 In the case of al-Hol, the
Autonomous Administration, that is overseeing the authorities at the camp, has called upon states with
nationals at the camps to repatriate them since the camps are “overwhelmed”.

391

The third condition that needs to be met is that the action of the state intervening to protect its nationals
in another country needs to be “strictly confined to the objective of protecting it’s nationals”. 392 One
could argue that all these conditions would be met in the case of, for example, Finland repatriating
children from the al-Hol camp in Syria.
The military aspect, and the use of force aspect, when protecting nationals abroad, is no longer in the
center of the discussions. The discussions have evolved and today the doctrine is sometimes referred to
as “the doctrine of Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations”. 393 The Doctrine, no matter what it is called,
does not clearly state that there is an obligation for states to protects their nationals abroad by repatriating
them. However, the argument that a state “cannot intervene in a sovereign states domestic affair”, loses
credibility in the light of the Doctrine. In the case of the children detained in Syria, the Kurdish authorities
have expressed their willingness to even assist in the repatriation. 394 This is not necessarily the situation
in all cases where children are held in detention like conditions outside their state of nationality.
Circumstances and situations differ. Nonetheless, in some situations, such as the current situation in
Syria, arguments against repatriating children affiliated with FTF’s cannot solely rely on the
“sovereignty” argument, especially not if this argument, is evoked by the repatriating state and not the
state where the child currently is being held. Questioning, and even removing, the credibility of the
arguments against a possible obligation to repatriate is one way of examining if there is an obligation. If
there is nothing indicating that there does not exist an obligation, that in itself could be interpreted as an
indication of the existence of a possible obligation.

4. Humanitarian law
As noted previously in the thesis, the General Assembly’s Committee on Social Affairs, Health and
Sustainable Development issued in January 2020 a report called International obligations concerning
the repatriation of children from war and conflict zones.395 In this report the Committee reminded
member states of their obligations under humanitarian law in relation to children affiliated with ISIS
detained at the camps in Syria. 396 International humanitarian law is applicable during armed conflicts and
can in some scenarios even be in conflict with human rights law.397 Humanitarian law is also applicable
to the children of ISIS fighters currently held in detention like conditions in Syria. This has also been
confirmed by the General Assemblies report, which goes as far as calling repatriation of the children at
the camps a “humanitarian duty”. 398 The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has clarified the relationship
between human rights law and humanitarian law by stating that:
“As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law, there
are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters of international
humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be
matters of both these branches of international law”.399

Thus, in some circumstances both branches of law may be applicable. The fact that international human
rights law provides protection for children held in detention like conditions abroad does not necessarily
imply that humanitarian law is not applicable. The most important treaties within international
humanitarian law are the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols. 400 The protection of
children is especially acknowledged in the Fourth Geneva Convention that protects civilians during
wartime. 401 Article 3 of all the Geneva Conventions also regulates armed conflicts that are not of an
international character,402 such as for example the conflict in Syria which did not cross boarders but had
foreign fighters from several different countries participating in the hostilities.

Children are protected both as persons not taking any part in hostilities but also as particularly vulnerable
persons.403 Furthermore, children that even took part in the hostilities, are also protected by the four
Geneva Conventions. 404 In the Fourth Geneva Convention there are many articles in favor of especially
children, however, this is not explicitly stated anywhere in the Fourth Geneva Convention. 405 The
protection of children is explicitly stated in the Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions. Article
77, of Protocol 1, states that “children shall be the object of special respect and shall be protected against
any form of indecent assault”. 406 Children are also especially protected during conflicts via the CRC.
Article 38 of the CRC notes that state parties should “ensure respect for rules of international
humanitarian law applicable to them in armed conflicts which are relevant to the child”. 407 Furthermore,
article 38 also highlights that under international human rights law states have an obligation to protect
the civilian population under armed conflict and that states should take “feasible measures to ensure
protection and care of children who are affected by an armed conflict”. 408
Because humanitarian law applies during armed conflicts, the Protocol does not use the word
“repatriation” when discussing the assistance of children, rather the word “evacuation” is used. A war
between two states is different than a war that does not cross any boarders. However, when a situation is
unstable, and children are in danger, is there really a clear line between evacuation and repatriation?
Article 78, of Protocol 1, states that “No Party to the conflict shall arrange for the evacuation of children,
other than its own nationals, to a foreign country except for a temporary evacuation where compelling
reasons of the health or medical treatment of the children or, except in occupied territory, their safety, so
require”. 409 Here again, the link to nationality is emphasized, even if in a slightly different context.

Protocol II, relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflict, also offers special
protection to children. Article 4, paragraph 3, states that “children shall be provided with the care and aid
they require”. 410 Furthermore, paragraph 3, of article 4, notes that
“Measures shall be taken, if necessary, and whenever possible with the consent of their parents
or persons who by law or custom are primarily responsible for their care, to remove children
temporarily from the area in which hostilities are taking place to a safer area within the country
and ensure that they are accompanied by persons responsible for their safety and well-being”.411

According to Plattner, the structure of article 4 of Protocol II is an example of how the authors of the
Protocol considered the protection of children to be important during non-international armed
conflicts.412 However, this article does not regulate repatriation of children to their state of nationality.
As discussed previously, without going into detail, the lack of consent from the parents of a child might
cause of difficulties regarding repatriation. Nonetheless, no consent is not necessary an obstacle. The
wording in the above article also clarifies this by using the wording “whenever possible with the consent
of their parents or persons who by law or custom are primarily responsible for their care”. 413 The
provisions use of the wording “whenever possible” yet again, leaves room for interpretation.

Under international humanitarian law, it is not unlawful to detain children in certain situations. However,
international humanitarian law includes special provisions for detained children.414 For example, article
94 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, states that “all possible facilities shall be granted to internees to
continue their studies or to take up new subjects. The education of children and young people shall be
ensured”. 415 In war torn countries with unstable situations, this can be difficult to ensure. There have
been reports that in the areas at the al-Hol camp where foreigners are held, no area for the children to
play is provided, and the children of foreign nationality do not receive any education. 416 Physiologists
who have examined these children have stated that over a course of 6 months, they have noticed a clear

deterioration in the children’s well-being. 417 This is yet another right of the children that is violated at
these camps. A right that would not be violated if they would be repatriated to their states of nationality,
where for example, education for them could be provided.
Article 89 of the Fourth Geneva Convention ensures enough food for internees and states that “expectant
and nursing mothers and children under fifteen years of age shall be given additional food, in proportion
to their physiological needs”. 418 According to reports from the al-Hol camp in Syria, malnutrition is a
common condition among the children. 419 The access to health care is limited and some mothers are
reportedly even reluctant to seek medical assistance to their children because boys who are approaching
adolescence have been separated from their mothers by camp authorities. 420 Even with assistance
available, though limited, children might not necessarily receive it.
Article 132 of the Fourth Geneva Convention addresses the repatriation of detainees;
“The Parties to the conflict shall, moreover, endeavour during the course of hostilities, to
conclude agreements for the release, the repatriation, the return to places of residence or the
accommodation in a neutral country of certain classes of internees, in particular children,
pregnant women and mothers with infants and young children, wounded and sick, and
internees who have been detained for a long time”421

This article encourages repatriation to the state of nationality in general, but especially in the case of
children who are detained. In the case of the foreign children held at the camps in Syria, the authorities
have indicated that they are prepared to assist with repatriations. Even if authorities would oppose states
repatriating their nationals from the camps, this would be contrary to article 132 of the Fourth Geneva
Convention. Art 132 applies to “parties to the conflict”, which in the case of the Syrian conflict does not
include EU member states. However, the Syrian authorities whom have been parties in the conflict have
urged states of nationality, including EU member states, to repatriate. Art 134 of the Fourth Geneva
Convention states that “The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour, upon the close of hostilities or
occupation, to ensure the return of all internees to their last place of residence, or to facilitate their

repatriation”. 422 This article is not only applicable to parties to the conflict. If a state would argue against
an obligation to repatriate on the grounds that they do not have an agreement with the state detaining the
children, this would be contrary to the object of the above article since both states should establish
agreements to repatriate, especially children, under international humanitarian law. Overall, the state
where the children are held in detention like condition should, when the hostilities ceased, assist in the
repatriation of people back to their countries of origin.423
Unaccompanied and separated children are also especially protected by the Fourth Geneva
Convention. 424 States parties shall pay special attention to children that are separated from their families
or children that are orphaned by ensuring their maintenance. 425 State parties to the conflict are also
obligated to “facilitate the reception of such children in a neutral country for the duration of the conflict
with the consent of the Protecting Power”. 426

Again examining the current situation in Syria as an

example, a neutral state, and a protecting power, could be the state of which the children are nationals.
EU member states were not part of the conflict, and they have a connection to the children in need of
assistance. As already noted when examining the CRC, unaccompanied and orphaned children enjoy
special protection also under international humanitarian law. Humanitarian law may not be applicable in
all cases concerning children held in detention like conditions abroad. In the case of Syria, the conflicts
have been described both as international armed conflicts and non-international conflicts. 427 Nonetheless,
humanitarian law is applicable in both types of conflicts and the women and children currently held in
detention like conditions in Syria is a consequence of an armed conflict.

5. Conclusion
In the early stages of the writing process, very few states had formed a position regarding their nationals
held in detention like conditions at the camps in Syria, even regarding the children. Over the course of
several months the situation has evolved, but in no way been resolved. Even if the focus of this thesis
has been on a general approach to a possible obligation to repatriate, the current situation in Syria has
been present in each chapter. The topic is extremely relevant and the situation in Syria was one reason
for choosing to examine the obligations to repatriate.
The situation in Syria will pass, but similar situations will arise in the future. Therefore, the purpose of
this thesis has been to, on a general level, clarify state obligations towards their minor nationals held in
detention like conditions abroad. After examining the relevant sources of international law, it is clear,
that the subject under examination is new and there is no provision that directly clarifies that children
held in detention like conditions abroad automatically fall within the jurisdiction of the state of
nationality. In other words, there is no indication that the CRC, or any other human rights treaty,
automatically imposes positive extraterritorial obligations for state parties. Therefore, there is no strict
obligation to repatriate the children for the state of nationality. Despite this, several instruments and
bodies have urged state to do so. Not by relying on a specific treaty, or specific article in a treaty, but by
referring to obligations under international law in general and the interpretation of these. With no specific
treaty or article establishing an obligation, the examination of the bigger picture and combination of
several different treaties, articles and sources within international could establish an obligation. However,
this is open for interpretation.
In January 2020, the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly urged member States to “take all
necessary measures to ensure immediate repatriation of all children whose parents, believed to be
affiliated to ISIS/Daesh, are citizens of their State, regardless of their age or degree of involvement in
the conflict”.428 The term “Daesh” is another word used to describe ISIS. 429 This statement was published
one year after ISIS was considered defeated and many affiliated with the organization were detained.

The failure of states to repatriate their nationals, especially those states that have the means to do so, such
as EU member states, has been described as a “moral failure”.430 In a joint statement, by four UN
Advocates, states were reminded that they are obligated to “take all the necessary steps to intervene in
favor of their nationals abroad, including through the safe repatriation of women and children to their
countries of origin with full respect of non-refoulement”.431 The Advocates also emphasized that the
cases should be examined on an individual basis, and the best interest of the child and the principle of
family unit should be taken into consideration in the context of repatriation. 432 None of these statements
rely on a specific provision that would actually clearly establish the obligation to repatriate.
While examining the obligation to repatriate, the best interest of the child is a central element and should
be used as a guiding principle in all decisions concerning children. Throughout this thesis the importance
of interpretation has been emphasized. With the vague and “open” terminology used in some provisions,
the interpretation becomes increasingly important. In some cases, it might be in the best interest of the
child to be repatriated, even if, for example, the mother is against the repatriation or they would have to
be separated for other reasons. In other cases, it might be in the best interest of the child to remain at the
camps with their mothers, if there, for example, is no possibility to repatriate them both and the child’s
basic human rights are not threatened. The decisions in cases like these need to be taken on a case by
case basis since there is no strict, or clear, obligation to repatriate. Especially in cases where the parents
are against repatriation, extra caution should be payed, because removing a child from his/her parents
should only be done in extreme cases and if it is in the best interest of the child and in accordance with
the law. The best interest of the child leaves room for interpretation both ways.
In the legal analysis, conducted by the Special Rapporteurs, and discussed in previous chapters, states
duty to protect their citizens, also extraterritorially, is highlighted. 433 According to the Special
Rapporteurs this duty applies in the situation of the women and children currently detained in Syria and
states should “act with due diligence to ensure that the lives of their nationals are protected”.434 The

Special Rapporteurs also noted that states cannot argue that they are not aware of the situation in Syria.
435

The Special Rapporteurs conclusion in their legal analysis was that states that have “control over the

human rights of children and their guardians in camps in the northern Syrian Arab Republic have positive
obligations to prevent violations of those rights”.436 The Special Rapporteurs were also clear that
repatriating the children “amounts to a positive implementation of Security Council resolutions 2178
(2014) and 2396 (2017) and is considerate of a State’s long-term security interests”.437 This legal analysis
is not binding for states, and imposes no obligation upon them. Rather, it is an example of how relevant
international law could be interpreted in favor of repatriating the children. If a state is able to affect the
enjoyment of, for example a child’s right to life, by repatriating, that states has to some extent “control”.
Throughout this thesis the importance of interpretation has been established. There is not a clear yes or
no answer, there is no convention that explicitly regulates the obligation to repatriate and there is no
established case law regarding this issue. Scholars have been divided on the issue since much is
dependent on how the relevant sources of international law are interpreted. This thesis has examined a
possible obligation to repatriate, and even if no direct obligation is found, no indication of the opposite
has either been found. There is currently a case in the Netherlands, initiated by a group of lawyers on the
behalf of a group of Dutch women and children detained in Syria, that examines the obligation to
repatriate. The ruling in this case, and the clarification on whether or not it is a political choice, will
surely be closely observed by several states with nationals in similar situations. 438 Even if not yet
resolved, this case highlights the difficulties of repatriation and the final ruling will likely influence other
countries decisions to repatriate, or not to repatriate. 439
When interpreting international law, the object and purpose of human rights treaties needs to be
considered.440 According to Milanovic, the consideration of state sovereignty and title over territory
should matter less than consideration of universality and effectiveness. 441 This conclusion by Milanovic
also summarizes the findings in this thesis. Interpretation plays an important role. If sovereignty and

territorial jurisdiction is the primary consideration when interpreting the human right treaties, the
conclusion would be that there exists no obligation to repatriate. On the other hand, if universality and
effectiveness are the primary considerations, it is possible to argue in favour of a possible obligations to
repatriate.
If a state exercise authority, via for example state agents abroad, it is clear they have jurisdiction over the
individuals affected by this authority. The situation with children held in detention like conditions abroad
is much more complex. There are no state agent present whom possible violations could directly be
attributed to. The relevance lies in the fact that the children are nationals of an EU member state, they
were taken without a choice to a foreign state, and their human rights are at risk of being violated. To
argue for an obligation for states of nationality to repatriate children is much easier if there is a clear, and
evidence-based risk, of the child being tortured or killed. Bearing in mind the object and purpose of
human rights, the possibilities EU member states have to repatriate, and the fact that in some cases
repatriation could save a child’s life, one could argue for an obligation of the state of nationality to
repatriate. This is however only on a case by case basis. If there is no risk that the child’s right to life, or
right to be free from torture tai inhuman treatment, would be violated in his or her present location, it
would be difficult to argue for an obligation to repatriate. The principle of the best interest of the child
plays a key role in examining an obligation to repatriate. Article 3 of the CRC, if interpreted in light of
the child’s best interest, affects the interpretation of all other provision. If a repatriation would clearly be
in the best interest of the child, the relevant provisions could be interpreted in favor of an obligation to
repatriate for the state of nationality.
To conclude, there is no absolute obligation for the states of nationality to repatriate. However, in cases
where there is a clear, and evidence-based risk, that fundamental human rights, such as the right to life
and the right to be free from torture, are threatened, and action by the state of nationality could safeguard
these rights, it is possible to argue for an obligation to repatriate. As has been established throughout this
thesis via the example of the current situation in Syria, there is a real risk of these right being violated.
The decision to repatriate needs to be determined on a case by case basis, taking into consideration the
circumstances of the specific child, but foremost taking into consideration the best interest of the child.
