ABSTRACT
Most manufacturing industries need to clean the production equipment regularly. This
is especially important for the pharmaceutical industry, where product contamination
may lead to serious consequences. This work focuses on investigating two
technologies that have the potential to reduce cleaning durations and more efficiently
remove hard-to-clean contaminants. The technologies, a clamp-on ultrasound
technology and a surface coating called SLIPS® Repel™, were tested in a laboratory
environment. The clamp-on ultrasound technology was also tested in a pharmaceutical
manufacturing environment. The ultrasound technology performed well and was able
to remove contaminants more efficiently than the reference wash cycles and currently
used cleaning programs. Specifically, the technology was able to remove hard-toremove contaminants from piping. The technology is, however, not capable of
cleaning large areas quickly as the cleaning range of the ultrasound clamps is relatively
small. The SLIPS® Repel™ coating technology was tested with standardized wash
tests in a pharmaceutical laboratory. The coating was tested with both chemical and
mechanical wash tests, using visual examination, mass changes, and contact angle of
the coupons as methods of measurement. The coating performed well, repelling
contaminants more efficiently than the reference coupons. The coated coupons also
withstood the wash tests well, with close to no changes visually or in contact angle.
The masses of the coated coupons did, however, decrease. This indicates a slow
depletion of the coating. One coated coupon showed visual signs of adhesion problems
for unknown reasons. The contact angle of the coupon also decreased significantly.
Overall, both technologies need to be tested further to understand the best areas of
application.

INTRODUCTION
Cleanliness in the Pharmaceutical Industry

For most manufacturing industries, including the pharmaceutical industry, cleanliness
is a factor of utmost importance. Processed products should be completely free from
physical, chemical as well as from biological contamination. When a product is
manufactured, the risk of product contamination is always present. The product may
become contaminated with microorganisms and their toxins, the previously produced
product, cleaning agent residues, or some other type of contaminant. If the product is
contaminated, it could lead to severe consequences (Holah and Childs, 2019).
To guarantee product quality and patient protection in the pharmaceutical industry, an
international set of regulations called Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) are used.
These regulations exist to ensure that products of assured quality, purity, potency, and
safety are produced. The elements that encompass GMP are e.g. quality management
systems, standard operating procedures, and cleaning validation (Arayne, Sultana, and
Zaman, 2008).
To control the possible hazards and to protect the products from contamination, the
equipment used should be regularly and effectively cleaned. GMP dictates that there
should be evidence that the cleaning program is effectively able to remove any
contaminants from any product contact surfaces and be able to control the safety
hazard risks, i.e. there should be documented evidence of cleaning capability. This is
called cleaning validation - the way of cleaning and the cleaning program should be
validated (Holah and Childs, 2019).
To validate a cleaning process, the process has to be proven able to achieve acceptable
levels of cleanliness on a day-to-day basis. Parameters such as time, temperature, and
cleaning agents have to be given and the worst-case scenario (e.g. minimal amount of
time) needs to be proven capable of achieving an acceptable level of cleanliness. An
important part of the acceptance criteria is the visual check of the product contact
equipment. This, however, is not the only criterion for validating a cleaning process.
The surfaces also need to be tested for potential residues which might not be detectable
through a visual examination. After the cleaning process has been validated, visual
1

examination is generally the main method used to confirm cleanliness (Allport-Settle,
2009). In addition to this, yearly monitoring is also done.
Even though existing regulations are strict, the risk that some parts of the
manufacturing equipment remain unclean after a cleaning cycle still exists. Many
smaller pharmaceutical companies have relatively small batch sizes, with large product
portfolios. This leads to longer and longer cleaning cycles for most pharmaceutical
companies since they have to do everything in their power to eliminate the
contamination risks. For Orion Corporation, this is particularly true, since many of
their products need different cleaning programs, leading to a large number of washes.
Because the easiest way to impact the cleaning efficiency of the cleaning cycles is to
adjust the time parameter, it is more and more becoming a norm to increase the
duration of the cleaning cycles. Even if a company usually can achieve an acceptable
cleanliness level in two hours, if the cleaning sometimes takes four hours, then every
wash needs to be four hours long. This leads to many companies spending large
amounts of time on cleaning the equipment, instead of manufacturing products.

1.2

Project Background

In the summer of 2019, a research project of different existing cleaning technologies
was done at Orion Corporation. The project involved searching for different cleaning
technologies, as well as evaluating them based on potential and suitability for the
pharmaceutical industry. The identified technologies were evaluated with the help of
a heat map, calculating an overall score based on, for example, availability, cost, and
speed. The heat chart can be seen in Table 1.

Based on the heat chart, two technologies were chosen for further studies in this
Master’s thesis. The chosen technologies were an ultrasound cleaning technology, and
a surface coating called SLIPS® Repel™. These particular technologies were chosen
based on their potential for the pharmaceutical industry, availability, and their
projected cost-effectiveness. The clamp-on ultrasound technology has once before
been tested in the pharmaceutical industry so the technology was known beforehand.
Even if ultrasound in itself is not a new technology, the technology utilizes the cleaning
power of ultrasound using external clamps. The reasoning behind the choice was that
clamp-on ultrasound has the potential to solve some of the current cleaning problems
in the industry. The coating technology, however, was chosen as a technology with the
potential to be successfully implemented in the future. An investment in testing the
technology was done to investigate if the potential future value is beneficial.

1.3

Research Objectives

This study aims to investigate two anti-contamination technologies with the potential
for application in the pharmaceutical industry. The investigation was done through a
series of laboratory tests and tests in actual production facilities.
The laboratory tests aim to test how the chosen technologies behave in a
pharmaceutical environment. The laboratory tests model the levels of fouling in a
manufacturing environment, with contaminants commonly found in manufacturing
equipment. Provided the results of the laboratory tests are positive, they enable
potential tests in the production facilities. With the tests in production facilities, the
efficacy of the technology is tested in an actual production environment. This shows
how the effect of the technology transitions into real-life contamination instead of
laboratory-created fouling.

2.1

THEORY
Surface Cleanability and Cleaning Technologies

Surface cleanability is affected by many factors such as the properties of the dirt to be
removed, the material properties of the surface to be cleaned, the process duration, and
the drying time. A variety of factors affect the washing process, such as the chemicals
in the detergent used, the concentration of the detergent, the temperature of the wash
solution, and the duration of cleaning (Johansson and Somasundaran, 2007; Keskinen,
2015). Another important parameter is the impact of the mechanical force on the
contaminant. The mechanical cleaning force is generated by the speed or pressure of
the cleaning medium. Since all these parameters affect the result of the cleaning
process, if the impact of one parameter is small, the impact of the other parameters
needs to be that much bigger. For example, high-pressure water jets use a lot of water
pressure, i.e. mechanical force, with minimal cleaning agents involved. The chemical
impact is minimized, meaning some or all of the other cleaning impacts need to be
maximized to achieve the same result.
In the pharmaceutical industry, most of the cleaning is done with the help of Clean-InPlace (CIP) systems. These are systems which do not require the manufacturing
equipment to be dismantled for cleaning (Seiberling, 2007). Unlike Clean-Out-ofPlace (COP) systems, the CIP-systems have integrated the cleaning process into the
manufacturing equipment. For many CIP-systems, achieving an excellent mechanical
cleaning effect is often difficult. Most of the mechanical cleaning force comes from
spray balls (Figure 1) and high-pressure water jets. The water jets are used for more
easily accessible areas, while spray balls are used e.g. in enclosed containers. While
spray balls achieve some mechanical cleaning force, there is still room for
improvement. Piping, however, is mainly cleaned with chemical detergents, with close
to no mechanical cleaning force.

The technologies studied in this thesis is an ultrasonic cleaning system designed to
mechanically remove contaminants, and a surface coating, designed to chemically
repel any contaminants. To understand the surface coating and the methods used in
this work, one needs to understand repellant surfaces, contact angles, and ways to
measure contact angles. Measuring contact angles is a way to determine the
performance of a coating.

2.2

Ultrasound and Cavitation

To understand the cleaning mechanism of ultrasound, it is important to understand the
basic principles of ultrasonic cavitation. When the vibrations from the ultrasonic
transducer are introduced into a liquid, sound waves of alternating high and lowpressure areas are created (Azar, 2009). The low-pressure areas are called rarefactions
and the high-pressure areas are called compressions. Any given point in an ultrasoundactivated liquid will alternatingly achieve rarefaction and compression. Generally,
liquids are non-compressible. However, liquids do not indefinitely support vacuum
pressures, as a liquid vaporizes under conditions of lower pressure. This is, of course,
dependent on the temperature as well. Lower pressure leads to a lower vaporizing point.
For example, water boils at a lower temperature in a pressure cooker than in
atmospheric pressure. At vacuum pressure, changes to a liquid tend to happen at
locations with discontinuations in the liquid. These discontinuations may be e.g. solid
particles in the liquid or microbubbles suspended in the liquid.

6

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
When the negative pressure in the rarefaction of the sound wave passes over a suitable
microbubble in the liquid, a cavity, or a “cavitation bubble”, is formed (Crawford,
1963; Fuchs, 1995). With each cycle of compression and rarefaction, the size of the
bubble increases. After multiple compression-rarefaction cycles, the size of the bubble
grows to a size greater than that which can be supported by the recurring pressure
cycles in the liquid. As a result, the bubble collapses violently, creating an implosion
(Awad, 2000). The cleaning effect of ultrasound is created when thousands or even
millions of bubbles implode in the liquid. Existing evidence implies that the pressure
of an imploding bubble may reach up to 690 bar. This has, however, not been directly
measured. The implosions of the bubbles tend to be directed towards any
discontinuities in the liquid. In the case of a contaminated object that has been
immersed in the ultrasound-activated liquid, the interaction between the contamination
and the liquid creates such a discontinuity. This means that the energy of the implosion
is directed towards the surface being cleaned (Fuchs, 2015).
The intensity of the ultrasonic waves decreases with the distance and is dependent on
the absorption coefficient of the liquid. The intensity can be calculated with the
following formula:
𝐼𝑑 = 𝐼𝑜 ∙ exp⁡(−2⁡𝛼⁡𝑑)

1

With Id being the intensity of ultrasound, Io the starting intensity, d the distance, and α
the absorption coefficient of the liquid (Mason and Peters, 2002). The unit is W/m2.
This equation, however, does not apply for spherical sound waves with a point source,
where the intensity decreases with the squared distance. The angle from the source and
the area also impact the intensity of ultrasound.
For ultrasonic cleaning, high-intensity and high-frequency sound waves are used,
usually in combination with a facilitating liquid such as water. The sound waves used
are generally between 20 and 200 kHz. In industrial ultrasonic cleaning, the cleaning
method is mainly used as a Clean-out-of-Place method (COP), where the piece to be
cleaned is placed in a wash basket containing the wash liquid. The liquid used may be
regular water or water with an added detergent to aid in the contaminant removal. The
liquid used may also be some other ultrasound compatible solvent (Fuchs, 2015).
7

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
Most ultrasonic systems consist mainly of a transducer and a generator. The transducer,
which may refer to an individual transducer-driving element or a collection of
individually grouped elements, applied to a single vibrating diaphragm. The transducer
is essentially the part of the ultrasound system that converts an electrical signal into
ultrasound waves. An ultrasonic generator in the form of a high-frequency electrical
supply is required to power the transducer.
One major problem with conventional ultrasound cleaning systems is that they
generally need to be used as a COP-method. This means that the object to be cleaned
needs to be removed and inserted into the ultrasound-activated liquid. This requires a
stop in the production process, which usually is not financially beneficial.
Conventional ultrasound cleaning systems are also relatively small, which means that
the cleaned object needs to small enough to fit into the ultrasound bath. Since industrial
manufacturing equipment is relatively big, ultrasound cleaning baths are more used
for smaller tools and specific parts. In recent years, ultrasound has also been utilized
using external clamp-on ultrasonic cleaning technologies. Clamp-on ultrasound has
mainly been used on an industrial scale.

2.3

Omniphobic Surfaces

2.3.1 Repellent Surfaces and Contact Angle
A hydrophobic surface is, per definition, a surface that is not easily wetted by water or
tends to repel water (Zettlemoyer, 1969). On this surface, water does not easily adhere.
William Albert Zisman writes about the concept of a contact angle, which defines the
notion of wettability. The contact angle, θ, is the angle between the solid surface and
a drop of liquid resting on the surface. This is visualized in Figure 2 (Fowkes and
Zisman, 1964). For a hydrophobic surface, the contact angle, hereafter CA, is generally
greater than 90°. The smaller CA, the more the surface is wetted. Thus, a surface is
completely wetted when the CA approaches and reaches a 0° angle. So-called
superhydrophobic surfaces have also been successfully created. The CA between a
superhydrophobic surface and a liquid droplet approaches 180° (Nosonovsky and
Bhushan, 2009). Another type of repellent surface is the superoleophobic surface,
which repels water solutions as well as organic liquids, e.g. oil. However, creating
8

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
superoleophobic surfaces has proven to be rather difficult, since the surface tension of
organic liquids and water solutions is significantly lower than that of pure water. A
combination of a superhydrophobic and a superoleophobic surface is called an
omniphobic surface, i.e. a surface that can repel any liquid. (Nosonovsky and Bhushan,
2009)

Figure 2 Contact angle for a liquid on a solid surface (Fowkes and Zisman, 1964)

2.3.2 Measurement of Contact Angles
Several methods for measuring the contact angle of a liquid drop on a surface exists.
Among them, some of the most used methods are, for example, the Wilhelmy-balance
tensiometry (WBT), tilting-plate goniometry (TPG), and captive-drop goniometry
(CDG) (Krishnan et al., 2005). All of these methods require suitable equipment to be
utilized.
One may also use image processing software to approximate the curvature of a drop.
The curvature of the drop can then be used to calculate the corresponding contact angle.
Most methods that analyze the surface energy of a liquid or the wettability of a surface
use the so-called Young’s equation. This relatively simple equation equilibrates the
forces at the contact point of a liquid drop at a given surface. To this day, the equation
is well known and widely used in the area of surface wetting. The Young’s equation
is expressed as

9

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
𝛾𝑙,𝑔 cos 𝜃 = 𝛾𝑙,𝑔 − 𝛾𝑠,𝑙 ,

2

where γ is the excess free energy per unit area of the interface. The indices g, l, and s
correspond to the gas, liquid and solid phases. The symbol θ refers to the contact angle
between the surface and the droplet. The values for the liquid/gas-excess free energy,
γl,g, are well known and tabulated. (Stalder et al., 2006)
Another important equation with regards to surface tension and contact angles is the
Young-Laplace equation. The Young-Laplace equation relates the pressure gradient
of a surface to its curvature and can be expressed as

𝛥𝑃 = 𝛾 (

1
1
+ )
𝑅1 𝑅2

3

with R1S and R2S being the principal radii of curvature at any point on the drop, γ
being the surface tension and ΔP the pressure difference across the surface.
The method used in this work is the Low Bond Axisymmetric Drop Shape Analysis,
LBADSA. This method is based on fitting the Young-Laplace equation to the drop
image data. The axisymmetric drop shape analysis creates a drop profile that follows
an insoluble second-order differential equation of the Young-Laplace equation:

𝛾(

1
1
2𝛾
+ ) = 𝛥𝜌𝑔ℎ +
𝑅1 𝑅2
𝑏

4

Where b is the radius of the curvature at the apex, Δρ is the density difference of phases
involved, h is the elevation with respect to the plane, and g is the gravitational constant.
The LBADSA essentially creates a mathematical model, a theoretical drop profile to
be fitted to the contour of the drop. Different values for the Young-Laplace equation
for axisymmetrical drops have been calculated numerically and tabulated. The
solutions are tabulated for several dimensionless Bond numbers β = Δρ·g·b2/γ = cb2,
10

___________________________________________________________________
representing the drop profile’s deviation from a sphere. The LBADSA method uses
tabulated values to approximate the surface tension values and achieve relatively
precise contact angles. The LBADSA method uses the image energy approach to
approximate the surface energy and contour of the drop. This way the entire pixel
information is used when fitting the drop profile to the drop contour. This is
particularly advantageous if the boundaries of the drop are unsharp or noisy. (Stalder
et al., 2010)

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In all laboratory tests, a tablet-coating liquid called Opadry (Colorcon, 2020) was used.
The liquid is normally used in tablet coaters to coat pharmaceutical tablets. The liquid
is prepared by mixing a powder with water. Opadry contains polyvinyl alcohol,
titanium dioxide, talc, polyethylene glycol, and lecithin (soya). In Orion Corporation’s
production facilities, Opadry is heated to over 50 degrees Celsius, after which it is
sprayed onto the tablets. During the process, it is inevitable that some of the liquid
contaminates the insides of the equipment. As the process temperature is relatively
high, any liquid on the equipment usually dries, making it more difficult to remove.
Furthermore, as the coating drum spins, the Opadry may dry in layers, creating up to
10 layers of dried Opadry. Additionally, it has been observed that even after the
removal of the white, dried Opadry, a gray area may be left behind, which may be even
more difficult to remove. In the laboratory tests, all results were visually examined for
any signs of gray areas. The level of cleanliness can be graded on a scale of 1-5, with
1 being visually clean and 5 being clearly dirty. When visually examining an object,
at least two people should independently examine it. In all the laboratory tests, Opadry
was heated and dried, to try to simulate the coating drum process.

3.1

Clamp-on Ultrasound Tests

3.1.1 Clamp-on Technology
A relatively new type of ultrasonic solution is the clamp-on ultrasound technology,
which was tested in this study. The ultrasonic technology is based on the same
principle as conventional ultrasonic baths, except that the technology enhances the
efficiency of ultrasonic cleaning using externally mounted ultrasonic clamps. In this
way, the cleaning effect of the ultrasound is localized and the cleaning becomes more
efficient. The clamps can also be used to apply ultrasonic cleaning to closed pipelines
without opening them. This way, ultrasound cleaning can be used as a Clean-In-Place
(CIP) method, eliminating some of the negative aspects of ultrasound cleaning. Figure
3 shows an example of a clamp-on ultrasound setup.

12

Martin Ekman

Figure 3 A Clamp-on Ultrasound system

The external clamps need to be connected properly. The contact between the clamp
and the pipe (i.e. coupling) affects how well the sound can travel from the clamp to
the pipe. The coupling can be poor due to e.g. rust on the pipe's surface or the clamp
being attached loosely. This causes the power transmission to the pipe to decrease,
thus also decreasing the cleaning efficiency. Due to this, both the transducer and the
clamp may heat up more rapidly than normally, if the ultrasound has nowhere to go.

3.1.2 Test Pipes for Ultrasound Tests
The purpose of the ultrasound laboratory tests was to, as accurately as possible, model
the circumstances in the production facilities and find proof of concept for clamp-on
ultrasound as a cleaning technology capable of removing tablet coating remains. As
the Opadry solution tends to be difficult to remove, especially after it has dried, a
decision to test the cleaning efficacy of clamp-on ultrasound on dried Opadry was
made. Another purpose of the ultrasound laboratory tests was to investigate whether
or not clamp-on ultrasound has the capability to remove or prevent gray remains as
well.
As a model for the laboratory tests, the Opadry supply piping of the tablet coater was
chosen. Through the piping, Opadry is transported to the spraying nozzles in the tablet
drum. The pipelines associated with the coating drums are problematic, as they might

become contaminated with unwanted, dried Opadry. The main cleaning problem of
the pipelines is that remains of Opadry have been detected, along with the typical gray
areas left behind by dried Opadry. Residues of titanium dioxide, TiO2, have also been
detected. This problem may lead to unnecessary cleaning cycles, due to trace amounts
of contaminants ending up in the coating drum from the wash solution.
For the laboratory tests, five test pipes were used, with outside diameters of roughly
51 mm, and a length of 50 cm. The test pipes were made from the same material
(stainless steel 316LS) as the one in Orion’s production facilities. Figure 4 depicts one
of the test pipes.

Figure 4 Test pipe
seen from the side

The pipes were 51 mm in diameter because most pipes in production are of that size.
The bottoms of the test pipes were welded shut to prevent water from leaking out from
the bottom during tests. The other end of the pipes were left as is, making it easy to fill
and empty them with water for testing. Examples of the top and bottom of a test pipe
can be seen in Figure 5.

3.1.3 Preparation of Test Pipes
The test pipes described in 3.1.2 were the base for our clamp-on ultrasound laboratory
tests. The pipes were coated with a 10 weight-% Opadry solution and coatings of up
to eight layers of the Opadry solution. The test pipes had some signs of wear from the
beginning and to simulate an even more worn pipe, the inside of pipe number 5 was
sanded with sandpaper. This was done to investigate possible differences in coating
adhesion to the inside of a worn pipe.
Before each layer of coating, the Opadry solution was heated in a water bath to a
temperature of 40-45℃. After this, the solution was poured into the test pipes, one at
a time. To ensure proper contamination of the pipes, the solution was left in each pipe
for at least 5 minutes, before pouring it into the next test pipe. After each layer of
coating, the pipes were left to dry at room temperature. Figure 6 shows a test pipe filled
with the aforementioned Opadry solution.

After the coating and drying of the pipes, pictures were taken of the insides with a
camera. To provide sufficient lighting, both the camera’s flashlight and an external
flashlight were used. Figure 7 shows the insides of pipes 1-5 after coating (A-E).
The pipes were also weighed after having been coated as well as after the cleaning
tests. This way, approximate mass values of the removed contaminants are obtained.
The pipes were weighed on a scale with a 1 g precision. After this, the pipes were
thoroughly cleaned with hot tap water and cleaning detergent. The pipes were also
wiped with 50% ethanol. After this, the pipes were weighed again to determine the
weight when clean.

3.1.4 Clamp-on Ultrasound Laboratory Tests
The clamp-on ultrasound technology was tested on the coated pipes in a test laboratory.
These tests were done to investigate the cleaning potential of the technology, with
Opadry as the contaminant. Custom-made clamps were made for the test pipes to
ensure a proper contact surface between the clamps and the pipes.
The setup consisted of a clamp, an ultrasonic waveguide, as well as an ultrasonic
transducer. The clamp was coupled to the transducer, with the transducer being the
sound-generating part. The ultrasonic waveguide consisted of two parts, affecting the
tuning of the ultrasonic system.
The procedures of the tests were as follows: The pipe to be tested was placed in a
separate room for noise reduction. For this setup, no data on noise levels were
available. However, for other cases in closed spaces, measurements with values
between 100 and 120 dB have been comprised.
The clamp-on ultrasound setup was attached to the pipe, after which the pipe was filled
with regular tap water and the ultrasound switched on. After a chosen duration, the
content of the pipe was emptied into a glass beaker and visually examined. This way,
we were able to gradually see the diminishing amounts of loosened contaminants. The
pipe was also visually examined, to check for remaining residue. This procedure was
repeated until no noticeable traces of the contaminant remained.
To achieve a sense of how well clamp-on ultrasound can remove Opadry and how long
it takes, the pipes were subject to multiple ultrasound cycles of varying duration. The
total durations were as follows (cycle duration in parentheses):
•

1 minute

•

2.5 minutes (+1.5 min)

•

5 minutes (+ 2.5 min)

•

10 minutes (+ 5 min)

•

20 minutes (+ 10 min)

Pipe number 1 was tested differently, due to it being 53 mm in diameter as well as to
test how well ultrasound removes the typical gray residue from Opadry coatings. To
test this, pipe 1 was rinsed 6 times with tap water (25°C), after which the same
19

ultrasound cycles were applied to the pipe. This way, excess, relatively loose Opadry
was removed, allowing the ultrasound cleaning effect to penetrate deeper into the
contaminants.

3.1.5 Laboratory Reference Cleaning Tests
To compare the results obtained from the ultrasound laboratory tests, reference tests
were performed. To ensure similar coatings and coating strengths on the reference test
pipes, as on the ultrasound test pipes, the reference test pipes were randomly chosen
from the five test pipes. The reference test pipes were coated simultaneously, under
the same circumstances as the rest of the test pipes, to avoid any differences in the
coatings. The reference test pipes chosen were numbers three and four. A wash recipe
commonly used in production to remove Opadry was used for the reference tests and
is shown in Table 7. The recipe consisted of rinsing steps (with tap water), alkali
washes, as well as acid washes. The used alkali wash detergent was Proset S26E with
an added effect booster, M47T. The acid detergent was Proset S26HS. The pH for the
alkali wash was around 10 and the acid wash around 3.

The washing liquid was put into a glass beaker, which in turn was immersed in a water
bath. The water bath was heated which, in turn, heated the washing liquid to the desired
temperature. These steps were repeated for each step in the recipe, except for the
rinsing steps. A new washing liquid was used for every step. To accurately model the
original wash in production, the pipes were immersed in the washing liquids, with a
magnet stirrer. For the liquid to reach the inside of the pipe walls properly, a plastic
tube was added to the rig. This tube allowed the air to flow more freely so that when
the pipe was immersed in water, upside down, the excess air flowed out through the
pipe. This can be seen in Figure 8 and Figure 9.

3.1.6 Clamp-on Ultrasound Tests in Production Facilities
Clamp-on ultrasound was tested at a production site in Finland, to see whether
localized ultrasound performed the same way as in the test laboratory. The target of
the test was a part of the piping to a tablet coater, more specifically, the forward CleanIn-Place line to the drum. The forward CIP line is a set of piping with a total length of
around 10 meters.
Before and after each test, contamination samples were taken with bio tape. The tape
test is a suitable method for collecting contamination samples from a surface. The
particulate contamination is generally 5 µm or larger. Film residues may also be
collected with the tape method.

21

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
The tape method was in practice performed by applying a pressure-sensitive piece of
tape to the surface and pressing down on the contaminants. The contaminants adhered
to the tape, after which the tape was peeled off and examined for contaminants.
For the tests, a particular part of the pipeline was chosen. As the CIP pipeline is
distributing a washing solution to more than one coating drum, a tee pipe intersection
where the distribution is divided was chosen. Another reason for which this particular
location was chosen, is that a suitable, easily removable valve was located directly
next to the intersection. This way, the results of the clamp-on ultrasound tests were
easily visually examined. Furthermore, the piping diameter was the same as the
previously performed laboratory tests. The piping, with the valve removed, can be seen
in Figure 10.

Figure 10 The tested pipeline intersection, with the valve removed

To get a better understanding of how quickly clamp-on ultrasound can remove
contaminants on the inside of the pipeline, the sonication was divided into three parts:
1. Firstly, the pipeline was sonicated for five minutes and quickly rinsed with a 3
% washing solution. The detergent used was Proset M47T. This part tested
clamp-on ultrasound’s capability of removing contaminants that are not
strongly adhered to the surface. This also removed excess contaminants,
making it easier to visually examine how the sonication impacted
extraordinarily hard-to-remove fouling.
2. The second step of the sonication tests was to sonicate the pipeline for one
hour. After one hour of sonication, the pipe was visually examined to try to
determine the rate at which the contaminant is removed. The visual

22

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
examination also helped approximate how much sonication was needed to
remove remaining contaminants.
3. As a third sonication step, the pipeline was sonicated for an additional 30
minuts, making the total sonication duration 1.5 hours. In addition to this, the
pipeline was also washed with a validated CIP wash cycle. The main purpose
of the CIP cycle was to remove any excess contaminants which may have been
loosened during the sonication.
Before the ultrasonic wash tests, pictures of the inside of the piping were taken.
Figure 11 shows one of the pictures taken. The picture provides evidence of a
contaminated pipe. Most of the inside of the pipe is covered with a white layer of
contaminants. The pipe in question should be silver colored when clean. The film
was not particularly thick, with the thickness being 1-2mm at most. The picture is
from the pipe going away from the valve, towards the tablet coater.

Figure 11 Inside of the forward CIP pipeline

23

Martin Ekman

___________________________________________________________________
Another area of interest was the inside of the piping next to the valve inlet. This
particular location had a welded seam, which is depicted in Figure 13. The figure

Figure 13 Piping area next to the valve,
with a welded seam

shows relatively large amounts of contaminant has gathered at the seam, as the seam
acted as a small wall in the pipe. This facilitated the adhesion of contaminants in the
piping. However, the pipe at the valve inlet seemed to overall be cleaner than the pipe
after the valve. Most of the contaminants seemed to be gathered at the seam and not
on the actual pipe wall. Naturally, since the piping inlet to the valve has clear signs of
contamination, it is safe to assume that some contamination also is adhered to the
inside of the valve. This made the valve another point of interest for the sonication
tests. The valve, in between the two pieces of piping, can be seen in Figure 12.

SLIPS® Repel™ Laboratory Tests

3.2.1 Adaptive Surface Technologies and SLIPS® Repel™
AST (Adaptive Surface Technologies, Inc.), is a U.S. based industrial company that
commercially produces materials and coatings including SLIPS® (Slippery Liquid
Infused Porous Surfaces) which is a liquid-based coating. This type of surface is
repellant against many solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons, as well as against
complex fluids, solids such as ice, and against marine biofouling (Awad, Asker, and
Hatton, 2018). Their coatings have proven beneficial across several industries
including food, marine, and industrial manufacturing of chemicals and products. For
example, AST has developed an interior surface coating for consumer packaging
which not only reduces the residual waste remaining but also enables packaging
recyclability. Additionally, to address persistent biofouling on boats, ships, and other
marine structures, they have developed a commercial line of eco-friendly paint.
(Adaptive Surface Technologies, 2020).
Finally, to address the challenges in the manufacturing industry, AST has developed a
surface coating (SLIPS® Repel™) that can be applied to large industrial tanks and
vessels. SLIPS® Repel™ is a liquid-based coating that enables high-value sticky
liquids (e.g. paints, liquid adhesives, creams) to easily flow thus, minimizing the
residue remaining in the tanks and minimizes the associated cleaning burden. SLIPS®
Repel™ is a two-part system that consists of an (1) engineered nanoporous polymer
coating that is applied directly to the vessel walls and a (2) top replenishable liquid
lubricant layer. The system is designed such that the nanoporous polymeric layer
tightly holds the lubricant in place by capillarity and matching surface chemistry
allowing the surface to remain stable in the presence of sticky liquids. A schematic of
the technology can be seen in Figure 14.

25

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________

Figure 14 A Schematic of the Coating (Wong et al., 2011)

In January 2019, AST installed a transfer tank coated with the SLIPS® Repel™ system
at CMT Materials (manufacturer of syntactic foam materials for the thermoforming
industry). For the first test, a 50 gal batch of epoxy paint was transferred using the
vessel, and once emptied a considerably small amount of epoxy remained in the vessel.
Only 200ml of a solvent was required to flush away the remaining paint, where
normally tens of liters are required. After continuous multiple transfers of aggressive
epoxy formulations, the coating remained intact. (Adaptive Surface Technologies,
2020).

3.2.2 SLIPS® Repel™ Coated Stainless Steel Coupons
For the laboratory tests, twenty coupons (15 cm x 7 cm) coated with the SLIPS®
Repel™ were provided by AST. Even though the metal surface used in most
manufacturing facilities is the same, i.e. 316LS electropolished stainless steel, two
different types of metal coupons were used for these tests. The two types were
electropolished metal coupons and non-electropolished metal coupons. These two
types of metal coupons were the ones usually used in the testing laboratory. Using both
types could bring out any potential differences between the two.
Furthermore, two different types of lubricants were provided by AST, a high and a
low-viscosity. On one hand, the low viscosity lubricant enables faster drainage speed
of the product off the surface. However, as a result, the lubricant is also depleted faster
over time, requiring sooner re-lubrication. On the other hand, the high viscosity
lubricant is more resistant to depletion but naturally, this means that the drainage speed
of the same product is not on par with the low viscosity lubricant.

26

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
From the twenty coupons which were available for testing, ten of them were matte
(non-electropolished) and ten were shiny (electropolished). Fourteen of the coupons
were coated with the high viscosity lubricant, of which seven were matte and seven
were shiny and six coupons were coated with the low viscosity lubricant, of which
three were matte and three shiny. An overview of the coupons can be seen in Table 8.
The coupons were numbered 1-20, with an H or an L after the number depending on
the type of lubricant used. In addition to the SLIPS® Repel™ coated coupons, four
reference coupons were used, named R1S-R4M.

Contact Angle Measurement

Due to restricted access to contact angle measurement equipment, as well as the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during this project, alternate methods for contact angle
measurement were favored. The image analysis program ImageJ (Rueden et al., 2017)
has several plugins that analyze the curvature of a drop and estimates the contact angle.
One of the plugins uses the Dropsnake method (Stalder et al., 2006), which utilizes
Young’s equation and defines the contour of the drop as a versatile B-spline curve.
The same plugin also contains the method used in this work, the Low Bond
Axisymmetric Drop Shape Analysis, LBADSA.
As a method of acquiring measurable results of the coupons’ performance, the contact
angles of water droplets on the coupons were measured. To ensure that the contact
angle of each water droplet was measured the same way, a test rig for measuring was
created. When taking the picture for the contact angle measurement, the coupon to be
tested was placed upon 9 plastic coupons. The total height of the plastic coupons was
around 3 cm. To ensure that the pictures were always taken from roughly the same
distance, a plastic coupon was placed between the camera and the elevated platform
for the coupons. The distance between the camera and the platform was around 7 cm.
The elevated platform was in front of a white wall and provided with sufficient lighting.
The pictures taken were scaled down to 1024x768 pixels and 96 dpi. The ImageJ
plugin LBADSA (Stalder et al., 2010; Rueden et al., 2017) was used to measure the
contact angles and the plugin settings can be seen in Figure 15.

3.2.4 Application of Opadry Onto the Coupons
The performance of SLIPS® Repel™ against a relevant foulant (Opadry) was tested
for initial release and cleanability. The Opadry coating solution was applied to the
coupon, spread out by tilting the coupon and dried in an oven at 50℃ for a given
amount of time. After drying, the process was repeated to build multiple layers of
Opadry. This way, the Opadry adheres stronger to the surface and models a real tablet
coating process.
Normally, when Opadry is applied directly to metal coupons, it is spread out with a
metal spatula. This, however, could impact the results in case the spatula touches and
damages the coating. Instead, we decided to simply try to apply Opadry to the coupons
and tilt the coupons, possibly spreading out the solution evenly over the bottom half
of the coupons. A cleaning validation sampling swab was also used to gently try to
spread the Opadry.
After measuring the contact angles, 0.75 ml of Opadry was applied to the coupons to
be tested. The Opadry solution was applied with a mechanically adjustable pipette.
The coupons were also weighed before the application of Opadry, before drying and
after drying. The remaining moisture in the Opadry after drying was measured by mass
on SLIPS® Repel™ and compared to the reference coupons.

3.2.5 Chemical Wash Test
The coupons were tested with a series of standardized wash tests. These tests were
done by immersing the coupons into glass beakers containing a washing solution for a
predetermined amount of time, while simultaneously stirring the liquid with a magnet
stirrer. The glass beakers were immersed in a water bath, to achieve the desired
temperature. Figure 16 shows four test coupons during a chemical wash cycle.

29

Figure 16 SLIPS® Repel™ and reference coupons during a chemical wash cycle

After this, the coupons were carefully rinsed with tap water and left to dry overnight
at room temperature. After drying, the coupons were visually examined, weighed and
the contact angles were measured.
The standardized wash test is based on a cleaning cycle typically used on a tabletcoating drum. The wash recipe can be seen in Table 9. A1 is an alkalic washing
detergent, A2 is an effect booster, and A3 is an acidic washing detergent.

3.2.6 Depletion Rate of Lubricant
The coupons were weighed, washed, then weighed again to try to determine depletion
rates. This is important as it helps to determine the re-lubrication rate of the coupons.
Additionally, it gives insight into potential contamination levels from the lubricant.
However, as the mass loss of lubricant can be on the order of single-digit milligrams
and the mass of coupons is much greater, it was difficult to accurately measure the
migration rates gravimetrically. All mass differences were measured with a precision
scale with three decimal readability. Additionally, the presence of liquid detergents
may have also interfered with the measurements. Another option (not performed) is to
detect the fluorinated lubricant in the wash solution however, the direct measurements
can be tedious, expensive, and requires special techniques such as pyrolysis–gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry. As an addition to weighing the coupons, the
contact angle was measured between each wash cycle.

3.2.7 Resistance of SLIPS® Repel™ to Concentrated Chemical Liquids
To test the chemical resistance of SLIPS® Repel™ undiluted chemical cleaning
agents, acetone, and sulfuric acid were directly applied to the surface of coated
coupons. This is important as in the manufacturing facilities, a range of different
chemicals and solvents may be used. Knowing the chemical resistance properties of
the coated coupons helps understand the coating’s different areas of application. Using
a volumetric pipette, one milliliter of the liquid was applied to the surface and allowed
to sit for 10-20 minutes or until the liquid had evaporated completely. After this, the
coupons were carefully rinsed for 10 seconds with normal tap water and left to dry at
room temperature. The coupons were visually examined for surface damage, weighed,
and the contact angle was measured. Figure 17 shows coupon 4HS with one milliliter
of undiluted acetone on the surface of a coated coupon. Where a reference coupon
would be completely wetted, coupon 4HS was not.

3.2.8 Spray Ball Test
At the test laboratory, where the test was performed, a test rig consisting of a large box
with a spray ball in the ceiling was used. A contaminated test coupon, as well as a
reference coupon, was placed on the inside wall of the box. Normal tap water was
sprayed through the spray ball for a predetermined amount of time, testing the
mechanical cleaning effect of the spray ball on the contaminated coupons. After the
tests, the coupons were visually examined. Unfortunately, during the time of the test,
the rig was limited to only testing with regular, cold tap water, meaning that the
chemical cleaning effect could not be tested. The pressure of the water was about 3.5
bars maximum, with a spray distance of almost 1 meter.
As the test rig is relatively new, a standardized test for this does not yet exist. This
means that the only comparable data for this test is any tested reference coupons.
The spray ball (nozzle) used for the tests is a Lechler 360° (Figure 18) rotating cleaning
nozzle, model 5S2.959.1Y. The spray ball is designed for efficiently cleaning tanks in,
for example, the food and beverage industry, as well as the pharmaceutical industry.
This particular model is one of the models used in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The
narrowest free cross-section is 1.7 mm and at 3.5 bar water pressure, the volume flow
is somewhere between 30-40 liters/minute. (Lechler, 2019)

weighed the coupons, their backsides were wiped with acetone, to remove any excess
dirt that may impact the results. After this, contact angle pictures were taken to get a
starting value for the coupons. Double-sided adhesive tape foam was placed on the
backside of coupon 15LS, after which the coupon was attached to the inside wall of
the spray ball box. This can be seen in Figure 19.

After this, coupon 15LS was mechanically washed with a spray ball for one hour. The
same procedure was repeated for coupons 12HM, 17LS, and 6HS, in that order. The
previously washed coupons were not removed before adding the next coupon, meaning
the first coupon (15LS) was washed for a total duration of 4 hours. In turn, coupons
12HM, 17LS, and 6HS were washed for durations of 3, 2, and 1 hour(s), respectively.
This way, all four coupons were washed identically, with the duration being the only
changed parameter. Both coupons coated with the high and the low viscosity lubricants
were used. This way, any differences between the resistance to mechanical washing
could be highlighted, mainly through weight differences. Figure 20 shows all 4
coupons being washed with the spray ball.

Figure 20 Coupons 6HS, 17LS, 12HM, and 15LS being washed with a spray ball (pictured from the
outside)

After having washed the four coupons with the spray ball for the intended durations,
the double-sided adhesive foam tape was removed with a flat screwdriver and a pair
of pliers. To remove any residual glue from the tape, the backsides of the coupons
were cleaned with acetone and left to dry at room temperature. When dried, the
coupons were weighed again to try to determine the migration rates of the coating.
Theoretically, the wear of the coating should present itself as a difference in coupon
weight after washing. The contact angles of the coupons were also measured.

3.2.9 Ultrasonic Bath Test
To further investigate how well the SLIPS® Repel™ coupons, withstand mechanical
cleaning forces, they were tested in an ultrasonic bath. The ultrasonic bath used was a
Branson 5800 CPX ultrasonic bath (Branson, 2012) (Figure 21).

Figure 21 The Branson 5800 ultrasonic bath (Branson, 2012)

The coupons were placed in glass beakers, which were filled with cold tap water. After
this, the beakers were placed in the ultrasonic bath for a maximum duration of 20
minutes (40 kHz). After sonication, the coupons were carefully rinsed with cold tap
water and left to dry. The contact angle and weight were measured before and after.
Figure 22 shows three test coupons in the ultrasonic bath.

RESULTS & DISCUSSION
Clamp-on Ultrasound Laboratory Tests

After ten minutes of clamp-on ultrasound, both pipe number 1 and number 1 had small
traces of Opadry remaining. Neither pipe two nor five had any clearly noticeable gray
areas remaining. All test pipes were visually clean after 20 minutes of clamp-on
ultrasound, with no visual residue in the washing water. Figure 23 and Figure 24 show
the wash water from pipe two after one minute of clamp-on ultrasound and after 20
minutes. After one minute, the water was clearly unclean, while after 20 minutes, the
wash water was visually completely clean. The same results were achieved for pipe
number five (Figure 25 and Figure 26).

After having rinsed pipe number one with tap water six times, most of the Opadry
coating was gone. Clear traces of Opadry was remaining, as well as significant gray
areas caused by the coating. After five minutes of clamp-on ultrasound, the pipe was
36

visually clean, while the water from the pipe was slightly gray. After ten minutes of
ultrasonic cleaning, both the pipe and the water were completely clean.
Figure 27 shows the results for pipes 1, 2, and 5. Except for clear signs of the pipes
being worn, they are visually completely clean, and no contaminants are noticeable.
However, the pipes were clearly worn, to begin with. Pipe number five was
significantly more worn than the others, due to it being sanded with sandpaper before
the coating layer was added.

Table 11 gives the mass differences of the pipes when coated and after the wash tests,
with the differences varying from 7 to 9 g. This shows that Opadry has been removed.
However, no significant difference in mass reduction between the pipes cleaned with
ultrasound and the reference wash pipes can be determined. Most probably, this is
because the Opadry traces left on the reference pipes do not significantly impact the
weight of the pipes.
The weights of the pipes after the wash tests were, surprisingly, 1-2 g heavier than
after having been thoroughly cleaned. This is probably due to human error. The pipes
were probably not left to dry for a long enough duration.
It is important to consider how possibly faulty conclusions from the laboratory and
reference tests affect future tests. One assumption was that the reference tests would
have good results, while in reality, the reference test washes were not as effective as
the ultrasound tests. This may indicate that the ultrasound tests were simply that much

38

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
more effective. The reference tests may also have been faulty, making the gap of
efficiency between clamp-on ultrasound and the reference tests seem bigger than it is.
The reference wash tests might have been faulty due to possibly insufficient mixing,
or human error. Other reasons may be e.g. the fact that only half of the pipe was
immersed in the washing liquid, for practical reasons. The possibility exists that the
washing liquid did not properly cover the inside of the test pipes. Preventive measures
for this was a tube transporting air from the inside of the pipe, allowing the liquid
pressure to push excess air out of the pipe. If the liquid pressure was not sufficient to
press enough air out of the pipes, the inside of the pipes might not have been properly
exposed to the washing liquid. Since the washing liquid in some steps of the washing
process was relatively hot, Opadry from the bottom part of the pipe may have been
loosened, trickling down to the other half of the pipe. This is highly plausible since
most of the contaminant from the bottom seems to have been washed away in the
reference wash.
It would be safe to assume that clamp-on ultrasound is capable of removing Opadry,
to some degree. It would not, however, be safe to assume that clamp-on ultrasound is
more capable of removing Opadry contaminants than existing washing procedures.
More tests are needed to determine the efficacy of clamp-on ultrasound.
If the conclusions based on the laboratory tests are incorrect, it impacts especially the
proof of concept. The proof of concept is assumed to have been found, while the
possibility exists, however unlikely, that clamp-on ultrasound is not able to remove
the gray remains typically left behind by Opadry coatings.
Factors impacting the conclusions of these laboratory tests are e.g. possible human
error when testing, as well as assumptions made before testing. How well these tests
model actual production circumstances is also unclear. The way e.g. asymmetrical
corners, valves, or welded joints impact contamination and cleaning efficacy needs to
be considered. To determine this, live tests under production circumstances are needed.

Clamp-on Ultrasound Tests in the Production Facilities

The clamp-on ultrasound tests were performed over a weekend in April 2020, on the
CIP pipeline to a tablet coater. The result of 5 minutes of sonication on the pipe after
the valve to the tablet coater can be seen in Figure 29.

Figure 29 Pipeline after 5 minutes of sonication

Figure 29 shows that there was a clear layer of contaminants remaining. However, at
the location where the sonication clamp was attached on the outside of the pipe, a clear
distinction between the contaminant layer and a cleaner section has been created. This
implies that the clamp-on ultrasound did have a significant impact on the
contaminants. Although the sonication was capable of removing a layer of
contaminants, it seems that the radius of efficient removal is small.
Figure 30 shows the valve outlet pipeline after one hour of sonication. The line
between the contaminant layer and the cleaner area had expanded. Approximately, the
radius of the cleaned area had increased by 15 cm. However, the sonication did not
seem to have visually impacted the rest of the contaminant layer.

40

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________

Figure 30 Pipeline after one hour of sonication

After 1.5 hours of sonication, and a standard wash cycle on top of that, the rate of
expansion of the cleaned area seemed to have halted. This can be seen in Figure 31.

Figure 31 Pipeline after 1.5 hours of sonication + a wash cycle

In Figure 31, a line between the sonication effect and the remaining contaminant area
can still be seen. However, the cleaner area, which has been impacted by the effects of
clamp-on ultrasound, was not completely clean. The amount of fouling seems to
gradually decrease with the distance to the sonication clamp. According to QuartlyWatson, sonication cleaning requires the intensity to be above a certain threshold for
the fouling to come loose (Quartly-Watson, 1998). In combination with the fact that

41

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
the ultrasound intensity decreases with the distance (Mason and Peters, 2002), these
results are logical. Mazue et al. also concluded that distance plays an important role in
the efficacy of ultrasonic cleaning (Mazue et al., 2011). They studied the cleaning
efficacy of an underwater ultrasound device for boat cleaning. Even though the
ultrasonic device is different from the one used in this study, with different parameters,
the results are relatable. For ultrasonic cleaning with an external device, if the distance
between the fouling and the source of the ultrasonic waves is too great, the cleaning
efficacy significantly decreases.
To get an idea of how strongly adhered the fouling layer is, the surface was rubbed
with a finger a couple of times. Evidence of this can be seen on the right-hand side in
Figure 31. It can be concluded that even after sonication, contaminant layers relatively
far away from the ultrasound clamp is not easily removable by hand.
Figure 32 shows the piping next to the valve inlet after 1.5 hours of sonication and a
wash cycle. Even though the ultrasound clamp was placed as far from the pipe opening
as the clamp on the other side of the valve, the results were slightly different. Firstly,
it is worth noting that the contaminant layer on top of the welded seam has been
washed away. The level of cleanliness of the seam is difficult to approximate by visual
examination due to the uneven surface of the weld.
Secondly, the rest of the pipe seems to have become almost completely clean. This
result is interesting because the same phenomenon should occur on this side of the
valve – the effect of the sonication is localized at the point of the clamp, with the effect
gradually diminishing with the distance.
Furthermore, the area after the welded seam was not completely clean. Most probably,
the seam impacts the vibrations in the metal caused by the power of ultrasound
technology. If the vibrations are not able to properly travel across the welded seam, it
impacts the cleaning efficiency.

___________________________________________________________________

Figure 32 Pipe next to the valve inlet after 1.5 hours of sonication + a wash cycle

On visual examination, there is significantly less fouling in Figure 32 than in Figure
31. This may be caused by several different reasons. For one, the contaminant layer
may have been thicker at the valve outlet pipe than the valve inlet pipe. This could
cause a more homogenous reduction in overall fouling thickness in the valve inlet pipe.
Thicker fouling may cause areas of extraordinarily hard-to-remove fouling which
could explain the difference in results. Thicker layers of fouling also simply require
more energy to be removed.
The difference in fouling may be caused by, for example, differences in local flow
conditions. The flow conditions before and after the valve may differ in e.g. velocity,
pressure, or laminarity. If the flow before the valve is laminar, while the flow after the
valve is turbulent (or vice versa), it certainly could cause differences in pipe
contamination rates. The difference in contamination levels may also be caused if, for
example, one side of the pipe is filled with liquid at all times but the other side is
occasionally empty. This would enable possible contaminants to dry out, making them
adhere to the pipe wall. At any rate, the results indicate a difference in contamination
levels, which need to be taken into consideration for future tests or clamp-on
ultrasound implementation.

Figure 33 shows the inside of the valve after 1.5 hours of sonication and a wash cycle.
To properly examine the inside of the valve is difficult. However, as the valve is filled
with water, all loosened fouling was easily detectable. A lot of loosened particles were
in the water. This indicates that even if the valve was not completely clean, a
significant amount of fouling had been removed.
The cleanliness level of the valve may also impact the cleanliness of the outlet piping.
If high concentrations of fouling are present in the valve they might gradually cause
increasing levels of fouling in the piping closest to the outlet.

4.3.1 Application of Opadry Onto the Coupons
After having applied 0.75 ml of Opadry to coupons 14HM, 9HM, 5HS, and R1S, in an
attempt to spread the solution without contacting the solution, the SLIPS® Repel™
coupons were tilted. However, this did not work well, instead, the Opadry solution
receded into droplets and easily slid on the coupon, leaving no visible traces on the
surface.

After applying another 0.75 ml of Opadry to the coupons and drying them in the oven,
some of the Opadry had dried. The before and after pictures can be seen in Figure 34.

Figure 34 Before and after pictures of coupons 14HM, 9HM, 5HS, and R1S when coated with the first
layer of Opadry

Normally, metal coupons with Opadry on them dry completely after around 15 minutes
in a 50 ℃ oven. The reference coupons dried after around 15 minutes but after 45
minutes in the oven, the Opadry on the SLIPS® Repel™ coupons had still not yet
dried. After the coupons had been left to dry over the weekend, the Opadry had dried.
The Opadry may dry faster when in direct contact with metal, instead of the liquid
lubricant. Longer drying was favored in this case, as complete drying on reference
coupons leads to stronger adhesion of Opadry.
As the test to try to tilt the coupons to evenly spread the Opadry was not completely
successful, several coupons were coated with the help of a cleaning validation
sampling swab. The coupons coated this way can be seen in Figure 35. The order of
the coupons, from left to right, is 3HS, 4HS, 5HS, 7HS, 8HM, 9HM, 14HM, R1S, R2S,
R3M, and R4M.

Figure 35 SLIPS® Repel™ and reference coupons with Opadry on them that has been spread out with a
sampling swab

Even though the coupons were coated simultaneously and in the same way, the results
are quite different. Firstly, the Opadry on the reference coupons spread thinly,
relatively evenly, and remained this way, while the Opadry solution on the SLIPS®
Repel™ coupons had once again contracted into droplets, even after being spread out.
Secondly, there seemed to be some differences between the SLIPS® Repel™ coupons
as well. Most of the Opadry on coupons 3HS, 8HM, and 14HM has contracted and
coalesced into one big droplet, while the Opadry on the rest of the SLIPS® Repel™
coupons is slightly more spread out. This might be a coincidence but it is worth noting.
Figure 36 shows the mass ratios between the dried and the wet Opadry on the coupons.
The mass ratio was calculated by dividing the mass of the wet Opadry with the mass
of the dried Opadry. During the weighing process, some dried Opadry fell from coupon
5HS, which is why there are no reliable results from coupon 5HS. Coupons 3HS and
8HM had higher mass ratios than the others. The mass ratios of all other SLIPS®
Repel™ coupons tested were similar to those of the reference coupons, indicating that
they have dried similarly as the reference coupons.

46

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________

Figure 36 The mass ratio between the dried and the wet Opadry on the coupons

When examining Figure 36, one could notice that both coupons 3HS and 8HM had
higher mass ratios. The application of the Opadry with a sampling swab may have
impacted the results. However, all of the reference coupons displayed similar results.
The difference in the results between the reference coupons and the coating coupons
are consistent with the results of the contamination test. The coated coupons have an
average mass ratio of 14.62 and a standard deviation of 2.77, while the reference
coupons have an average of 12.69 and a standard deviation of 0.19. This indicates a
significant difference in the way the Opadry dries on coated coupons and reference
coupons. As observed in the contamination tests, the Opadry takes a longer time to dry
on the coated coupons. If one would want to investigate how Opadry dries on SLIPS
coupons, further research is needed. For example, a thermogravimetric analysis, TGA,
could be used for additional data.

4.3.2 Chemical Wash Test
After having coated some coupons with Opadry and performing a pre-rinse, most of
the Opadry on the SLIPS® Repel™ coupons came loose. There were, however, some
small Opadry particles left on the surfaces, so an alkali wash was performed. On the
other hand, the majority of Opadry remained on the reference coupon and could not
even be removed after an alkali wash. The results of the wash on coupons 14HM and
R1S can be seen in Figure 37.

47

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________

Figure 37 Coupons 14HM (left) and R1S (right) after Opadry coating and an alkali wash

Figure 37 shows that there are a couple of small particles of Opadry left on the SLIPS®
Repel™ coupon on the left. The amount of Opadry left on the SLIPS® Repel™
coupon is, however, significantly less than on the reference coupon to the right. Overall,
the performance of the SLIPS® Repel™with regards to repelling Opadry is excellent.
Even though not 100 % of the Opadry was washed away in a 30-minute alkali wash,
the result, when compared to the reference coupon, is great. When compared to the
actual cleaning cycle of the tablet coating drum, the laboratory wash cycles may be
slightly less effective. This indicates that the results in an actual manufacturing
environment may be better.
The SLIPS® Repel™ coupons were subjected to an alkali (pH 10, 2+2% Proset S26E
+ M47T) and acid (pH 3, 3% Proset S26H) wash for 30+30 minutes at 60℃. The
coupons were visually inspected after the exposure and in some instances, areas of the
SLIPS(R) Repel(TM) coated coupons the surface showed a matte appearance
indicative of some lubricant depletion. However, no clear trend was observed. As the
coating is liquid-based there is likely some re-arrangement on the surface. Figure 38
shows coupon 5HS (left) and R1S (right) after the alkali and acid washes. The bottom
half of coupon 5HS displays areas with some slight changes in appearance. The upper
half of the coupon, where there has been no Opadry, seems normal. The reference
coupon is not clean, with clear traces of Opadry remaining, whereas the SLIPS®
Repel™ coupons have no easily detectable traces of Opadry remaining.

4.3.3 Depletion Rate of Lubricant
To determine the depletion rate of the lubricant, the coupons were weighed before the
wash cycles, as well as after a first and a second wash cycle. The results can be seen
in Figure 39.

Figure 39 Weight differences in coupons after chemical wash cycles

49

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
A decrease in mass of the SLIPS® Repel™ coupons was observed likely indicative of
lubricant loss from the surface. On average the weight loss was higher after the first
wash cycle as compared to the second one. This is likely the removal of excess
lubricant which is not tightly bound within the porous structure. This corresponds with
other studies that indicate that the depletion of the lubricant is a non-linear trend (Kim
et al., 2013). The weight of the reference coupon decreased slightly, which is probably
due to the removal of a small amount of fouling on the reference coupon. The scale
had a 3x standard deviation of 1.6 g with a 99.7 % confidence interval when measured
near zero grams. This, however, is probably not the same for the weight ranges of the
coupons.
Additionally, in Figure 40, the mass differences of the coupons from before the
application of Opadry and after the chemical wash are shown. The masses of all
SLIPS® Repel™ coupons decreased, while the masses of all but one of the reference
coupons have increased. The result from the reference coupons was fairly expectable
as most of them had a significant amount of Opadry left on them after the chemical
wash. The masses of the SLIPS® Repel™ coupons decreased.

Figure 40 The mass differences of test coupons from before the application of Opadry and after a chemical
wash cycle

The mass reductions of the SLIPS® Repel™ coupons are around the same range as
the results in Figure 39. However, some of the mass reductions are slightly bigger,
almost as much as the total mass reductions from the two wash cycles in Figure 39.

50

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
This could indicate that the coating of Opadry causes further depletion of the SLIPS®
Repel™ lubricant layer on the coupons. However, it is most likely that most or all of
the Opadry has been washed away.

4.3.4 Spray Ball Test
Overall, the wash tests with a spray ball resulted in almost no visual differences. There
were no visual signs of wear on the coating. After the tests, the coated coupons dried
faster than the reference coupons. The remaining water droplets on the coated coupons
slid off the SLIPS® Repel™ coupons faster than the reference coupons. There were
no significant changes in the contact angles either. However, there were some changes
in mass.
Coupons 7HS, 8HM, and R2S were weighed, washed with a spray ball for one hour,
and then weighed again. Figure 41 shows the mass differences in the coupons
afterward. As can be seen from the figure, the masses of the SLIPS® Repel™ coupons
have decreased, while the mass of the reference coupon has increased. The mass
increase in the reference might be caused by, for example, not enough time to dry
before weighing. This correlates with the signs that the reference coupons seemed to
dry slower than the SLIPS® Repel™ coupons.

Figure 41 The weight differences in coupons 7HS, 8HM, and R2S after one hour of spray ball washing

As the masses of the SLIPS® Repel™ coupons went down, this could mean that the
spray ball wash leads to some of the lubricant layer coming loose, thus resulting in the
mass decrease. However, the stickers on the backsides of the SLIPS® Repel™
coupons came loose during the cleaning cycle, which may have impacted the results.
51

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
To see if the mass reduction is caused by a slow depletion of the liquid lubricant layer
of the SLIPS coupons, four coupons were washed with the spray ball for different
durations. The weight differences were then divided by the duration, giving us a weight
difference per hour. The results can be seen in Figure 42.

Figure 42 Weight difference per hour for SLIPS coupons after spray ball wash

If the lubricant layer on the coupons was depleted linearly, the weight differences of
the coupons per hour should be at the same level. However, as can be seen from the
figure, that is not the case, which corresponds with other studies (Kim et al., 2013)
The weight difference per hour was biggest for coupon 6HS, which was only washed
one hour, while it was the smallest for coupon 15LS, which was washed the longest.
The total weight difference was the biggest for coupon 12HM, which was washed for
three hours.
To test the impact of a spray ball cleaning mechanism on the SLIPS coupons, further
research is needed. With these tests, there were many impacting factors, such as
possible residues left from the tape and a weight difference caused by the loosened
stickers on the backside. Any potential differences in weight caused by the depletion
of the lubricant would, in turn, be small and difficult to notice with this many
uncertainties.

4.3.5 Resistance of SLIPS® Repel™ to Concentrated Chemical Liquids
Figure 43 shows the results from applying the undiluted Proset 26E, Acetone, and
Sulfuric Acid on the SLIPS® Repel™ coupons. The most visible signs came from the

52

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
Proset S26E, with a visible circle in the middle of the coupon. The Acetone also left
behind a circle in the middle, though less visible than the one left behind from Proset.
After applying sulfuric acid to a coupon, a small circle where the liquid had been was
visible. It is difficult to see the circle on the picture. The circle may be due to the mass
of the liquid leaving an imprint on the lubricant.

Figure 43 SLIPS coupons after raw Proset S26E (left), Acetone (middle), and Sulfuric Acid (right)

Overall, the SLIPS coupons performed well with the different chemical liquids. There
were no significant changes in contact angle or mass.

4.3.6 Ultrasonic Bath Tests
After having put the coupons in the ultrasonic bath for 20 minutes, the coupons showed
slightly different results. This can be seen in Figure 44.

Figure 44 Coupons 5HS, R1S, and 15LS after ultrasound bath cleaning

53

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
Coupon 5HS on the far left has a significant amount of bubbles on the surface of the
coupon. The coupon in the middle, reference coupon R1S, seems to have been almost
completely rid of Opadry, with the surrounding water being relatively white. Almost
most interesting though, is the coupon on the right, 15LS. Coupon 15LS seems to have
reacted the least to the ultrasound bath. There is a significantly less amount of bubbles
adhered to the surface of the coupon, with no visible loosened coating on the bottom
of the beaker.
Theoretically, the low-viscosity coupons should withstand less than the high-viscosity
coupons when it comes to durability and resistance to outer forces. However, the speed
at which the low-viscosity coupons repel contaminants should be higher. This could
cause the cavitation bubbles on the low-viscosity coupons to travel faster towards the
surface of the liquid than the bubbles on the high-viscosity coupons. The significantly
lower amount of bubbles on the surface of coupon 15LS could be explained by this
phenomenon.
Figure 45 shows coupons 5HS and 15LS after the ultrasonic bath cleaning and the
post-rinse. As one can see from the picture, coupon 5HS is significantly more worn
than coupon 15LS. In multiple areas on coupon 5HS, the coating shows adhesive
failure. This can be improved with the use of a primer layer. Coupon 15LS, on the
other hand, shows slightly visibly traces of lubricant depletion. On the leftmost side of
the coupon, one can see some signs of the coupon being work or affected. In some
way, the surface looks similar to the middle part of the coupon 5HS. Coupon 15LS is,
however, in significantly better shape than coupon 5HS. As earlier discussed, the
cavitation bubbles caused by the ultrasound bath could, theoretically, travel faster
upwards along the coupon surface on the low-viscosity coupons than on the highviscosity coupons. The difference in performance may also be explained by the fact
that the lower viscosity lubricant can recover faster than the higher viscosity lubricant.

Figure 45 Coupons 5HS (left) and 15LS (right) after ultrasound bath and rinse

Figure 46 shows reference coupons R1S and R2S after the ultrasonic bath. As can be
seen from the figure, the coupons are visually completely clean, except for some
remaining water on coupon R1S. It is worth noting that even though all of the Opadry
has been washed off, the moisture left on coupon R1S seems to be only on the area
where the dried Opadry had been. The Opadry seems to in some way impact the
surface adhesion after removal and even if there are no visual signs of gray areas
anywhere.

The weight differences in the coupons after the ultrasound bath can be seen in Figure
47. Coupon 5HS has had a significant reduction in weight in comparison to the other
SLIPS® Repel™ coupons. This confirms the visual signs that a part of the SLIPS®
Repel™ coating has come loose. This seems to be an adhesion issue between the
polymeric substrate and the liquid lubricant, rather than an issue caused by the
lubricant being worn out. However, the SLIPS® Repel™ coupons used in these
laboratory tests had not been primed, which is something that could have prevented
this issue. As the mass losses from the ultrasonic bath (Figure 47) are of the same order
as the mass losses from the chemical washes (Figure 39), it indicates that the SLIPS®
Repel™ coupons can withstand a spectrum of mechanical cleaning processes.

Figure 47 Weight changes in the coupons washed using the ultrasonic bath

The reference coupons R1S and R2S have also had a significant reduction in their
weights. This can be explained by the fact that before the ultrasonic wash, the reference
coupons had remains of Opadry left on them. In the ultrasonic bath, the Opadry washed
off, resulting in the weight losses.
The SLIPS® Repel™ coating may be less resistant to ultrasonic cleaning mechanisms
than other methods of cleaning. On one hand, since the cavitation bubbles created in
ultrasonic baths, emerge at discontinuities on the metal surface and in the liquid and
the SLIPS® Repel™ coating is such a discontinuity, the cavitation bubbles may cause

56

Martin Ekman

adhesion problems in the coating. On the other hand, the adhesion problems occurring
may have been a coincidence. Further tests are needed to investigate this. Specifically,
testing coupons with a primer layer that adheres to the metal surface would be
beneficial.

4.3.7 Contact Angles
The changes in contact angles in the SLIPS® Repel™ coupons during testing can be
seen in Figure 48. The contact angles of almost all coupons stay within the same range,
between roughly 105 and 135 degrees. However, as one can see from the figure, one
set of values stand out exceptionally. During the laboratory tests, the contact angles of
coupon 5HS stay within the same area as the other SLIPS® Repel™ coupons, until the
angle drops significantly towards the end of the testing, down to around 40 degrees.
This further confirms that the coating did not withstand the ultrasound bath. It is worth
noting that the decrease in contact angles was only in the areas with adhesion problems.
The contact angles for the rest of the coupons were unchanged. Thus, this result is not
representative of the whole surface.

However, seeing as only one of the test coupons had significant changes in contact
angle and visually, it is still unclear if the SLIPS® Repel™ coupons are less resistant
to ultrasonic baths than other cleaning mechanisms. Multiple factors may play a bigger
role in the adhesive problems in the coating, such as e.g. the coating process or the
condition of the metal coupon before coating.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS

In the laboratory tests, the results from the clamp-on ultrasound test were better than
the results from the reference washes. The reference washes were not able to remove
all contaminants from the test pipes. The clamp-on ultrasound, however, was able to
remove all contaminants from the test pipes in 20 minutes, which indicates that the
technology could aid in shortening existing cleaning cycles. In a production
environment, the clamp-on ultrasound was able to remove contaminants, in a hard-toreach pipeline, that traditional chemical wash cycles could not remove. The technology
was able to remove contaminants from an approximately 1 m wide area in 1.5 hours.
This indicates that clamp-on ultrasound could be a beneficial tool for removing
strongly adhered contaminants in CIP pipelines.
The coating technology performs well in standardized laboratory wash tests and a
pharmaceutical environment. The drying duration of a tablet-coating liquid on the
coated coupons in a 50℃ oven was significantly longer than that of the reference
coupons. The coating of metal coupons led to a significant reduction in fouling when
compared to reference coupons. When coupons contaminated with Opadry were
subject to chemical wash tests with both alkaline and acidic solutions, the SLIPS®
Repel™ coupons became completely clean while significant amounts of Opadry
remained on the reference coupons. The coated coupons showed only minor visual
signs when exposed to undiluted chemical liquids, with no significant changes in
contact angle or weight. One coupon displayed signs of adhesion problems, with both
a mass reduction and the contact angle decreasing. Most of the SLIPS coupons
displayed a reduction in mass after tests, while the reference coupons’ masses did not
decrease significantly. This indicates a depletion of the SLIPS® Repel™ coating’s
lubricant layer. Overall, as the SLIPS® Repel™ performed so well, Orion Corporation
is interested in testing the technology in larger vessels.

5.1

Practical Implications

While the clamp-on ultrasound performed well in a production environment, some
practical implications might complicate cost-effective implementation. To completely

59

Martin Ekman

___________________________________________________________________
clean e.g. a pipeline, the pipe needs to be cleaned one area at a time. This may lead to
additional costs in the form of time and money. However, if one looks only at the
results of the technology, it performed well. The technology has the potential to be
financially profitable. To completely understand the possible benefits of the
technology, further testing is necessary.
The SLIPS technology performs better than expected in a pharmaceutical environment.
The coating repels Opadry well and seems to withstand the standardized wash tests.
As the weights of the coupons seem to decrease with wash tests, it is plausible to
assume that the lubricant layer is slowly depleted when in use. How long it takes before
the layer is completely depleted is, however, uncertain. As one coupon showed signs
of adhesion problems, it is necessary to investigate whether that was a coincidence and
whether the problem can be resolved by using a primer in the coating process. To
further understand how the coating performs in a pharmaceutical environment, further
testing with both the same and other types of contaminants is needed.

5.2

Limitations of the Study

As for the ultrasound reference washes, since not many similar wash tests have been
done with pipes, it is still unclear exactly how reliable the reference tests were. If
additional wash tests had been done beforehand, the reference tests could have been
more reliable. As for the tests in the production facilities, it would have been beneficial
to have data on how strongly the contaminants adhered to the inside of the pipes. It
would have been favorable to achieve more measurable data on the cleaning effects of
clamp-on ultrasound technology.
Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, not all of the tests could be completed. Instead, the
most essential tests were performed, giving Orion Corporation a chance to perform
further testing on a later occasion. In addition to the limited amount of testing, the
measurement methods were also limited. With limited access to equipment, the contact
angles were measured with image-processing software. For more accurate and reliable
results, proper equipment would have been needed; e.g. equipment that also measures
the contact angle hysteresis. Additional tests could be done to investigate the
difference in performance between the low and high-viscosity coupons.

Suggestions for Further Research

The clamp-on ultrasound technology should be further studied for other applications
than piping, with other contaminants than Opadry. The technology has the potential to
be used for multiple applications, which could lead to significant reductions in
cleaning durations.
The performance of the SLIPS coating technology should be tested with other
pharmaceutical contaminants, with sufficient methods of measurement, to further
understand the technology’s potential applications. Additionally, the coating should
be tested on a larger scale to see if the coating performs in the same way as in the test
laboratory. Furthermore, the coating should be tested for migration rates and any
loosened material analyzed for safety purposes. It would be beneficial to perform a
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to investigate the way Opadry dries on the coated
coupons.

SUMMARY IN SWEDISH - SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING

Undersökning av ett ultraljudssystem med klämma och en ytbestrykning för
potentiell applikation i läkemedelsindustrin
De flesta industrier som producerar någon typ av produkt har ett behov av att hålla
produktionsomgivningen ren. Speciellt läkemedelsindustrin har ett stort ansvar när det
kommer till produktsäkerhet. Produkterna som tillverkas bör vara av hög kvalité,
överensstämma med innehållsförteckningen och vara säkra för användaren.
För att säkerställa produktsäkerheten, skall all utrustning som används vara ren. Ifall
orenheter eller spår av en tidigare producerad produkt hamnar i fel produkt kan
konsekvenserna vara allvarliga. Kontaminering kan leda till att konsumenten får i sig
orenheter eller fel läkemedel.
Rengöringskraven i läkemedelsindustrin har lett till att många läkemedelsföretag
spenderar en stor andel av tiden på rengöring. Största delen av rengöringen är baserad
på kemiska tvättmedel, medan den mekaniska rengöringen är näst intill obefintlig.
Optimala tvättresultat erhålls genom en kombination av mekaniska och kemiska
tvättmetoder.
Därtill finns det rörledningar som är svåra att rengöra enbart med hjälp av kemiska
rengöringsmedel. Målet med detta arbete är att undersöka ifall ultraljudsanordningar
som fästs på utsidan av rör kan fungera som mekaniska rengöringsverktyg i en
farmaceutisk miljö. I detta arbete undersöks även en bestrykning som repellerar både
vatten- och oljebaserade orenheter. Bestrykningen kunde möjligen förbättra
produktionsutrustningens ytors förmåga att avstöta orenheter. Bestrykningen testas
bland annat genom standardiserade tvättprogram i ett laboratorium.

relativt små behållare, dit föremålet som ska rengöras sänks ner. Problematiskt med
denna metod är att delarna som ska rengöras måste vara tillräckligt små, samt att
rengöringen inte kan ske samtidigt som produktionsanläggningen är igång.

lösningen i behållaren. När en kavitationsbubbla imploderar, höjs temperaturen och
trycket i området kring bubblan, vilket i sin tur skapar en mekanisk rengöringseffekt.
Det finns specialtillverkade ultraljudsklämmor som kan monteras på utsidan av t.ex.
rör. Med dessa kan man rengöra rören medan de är i användning. Ett sådant
ultraljudssystem är en av teknologierna som undersökts i detta arbete.
Ultraljudsystemet testades först i ett testlaboratorium. För att efterlikna rörledningarna
i produktionsutrymmena användes rör med en diameter på 51 mm. Rören fylldes och
tömdes upprepade gånger med uppvärmt tablettdrageringsmedel, för att simulera
produktionsprocessen där medlet ofta fastnar i rörledningarna. Rören testrengjordes
med ett ultraljudssystemet, med ypperliga resultat. Rören var fullständigt rena efter 20
minuter av ultraljudsrengöring.

samband med testen cirkulerades både vatten och tvättlösning i rörlinjen. Resultaten
visade en signifikant minskning av föroreningar i rörlinjen. Terstarna visade att
ultraljudsanläggningen kan användas samtidigt som andra tvättprogram, utan att
inverka negativt på tvättresultatet.
Studien visar ultraljudssystem som fästs på utsidan av rör lämpar sig väl för
farmaceutiska miljöer. Rengöringsmetoden är kapabel att avlägsna en stor del av de
föroreningar som förekommer vid tillverkningen av läkemedelstabletter. Teknologin
lyckades avlägsna orenheter som de standardiserade och validerade tvättmetoderna int
klarat av att avlägsna. Metoden är även ekonomiskt lönsam.
En typ av repellerande bestrykning testades också. Bestrykningen kallas för SLIPS®
Repel™, vilken skapar en yta som inte endast repellerar vatten utan även fettbaserade
lösningar. En mängd bestrykta metallkuponger testades i ett laboratorium. Testerna
gick ut på att undersöka ifall bestrykningen förhindrar tablettdrageringsmedel från att
fastna på metallplattorna. Testerna försökte även visa hur slitage inverkar på
bestrykningen. Tablettdrageringsmedel applicerades på kupongerna, varefter de
torkades i en ugn. Detta gjordes upprepade gånger. Kupongerna utsattes även för ett
antal olika kemiska och mekaniska tvättar. Samma tester ufördes även på ett antal

63

Martin Ekman

___________________________________________________________________
referenskuponger, varefter referenskupongerna jämfördes med de bestrykta
kupongerna. För att få kvantifierbara resultat vägdes kupongerna före och efter alla
olika test. Kontaktvinklar mellan vattendroppar och kupongerna mättes också.
Testandet av bestrykningen i laboratoriemiljö gav goda resultat. Bestrykningen ledde
till att en betydligt mindre mängd tablettdrageringsmedel och smuts fastnar på
metallkupongerna. Bestrykningen tålde även testerna med outspädda kemiska
lösningar och mekaniska tvättar. En metallkupong visade tecken på att bestrykningen
hade lossnat efter tvätt i ett ultraljudsbad, med både nedgång i vikt och kontaktvinkel.
Detta kan antagligen undvikas genom ytbehandling av metallytan före bestrykning.
Vikten minskade hos största delen av de bestrykta kupongerna, medan
referenskupongernas vikt inte minskade lika mycket. Det tyder på att det yttersta lagret
av bestrykningen sakta nöts bort efter upprepade tvättar. Detta överensstämmer med
andra studier som har påvisat att det yttersta lagret av bestrykningen slits bort enligt
en icke-linjär trend. Ifall teknologin i framtiden påvisas vara säker att användas inom
industrin, har den potential att drastiskt minimera tid och energi som spenderas på
rengöring av produktionsapparatur. Flera undersökningar krävs för att utreda ifall
teknologin lämpar sig för farmaceutiska miljöer.

APPENDIX
Purpose of Financial Calculations
The purpose of the financial calculations in this thesis is to provide sufficient
information regarding the profitability of potential future investments in clamp-on
ultrasound. To do this, information about for example electricity costs, working hours
and cleaning cycles is needed. Some sensitive information is left unwritten, as it may
be considered intellectual property.
The financial profitability of an investment can be determined by several methods.
Among these techniques are the Net Present Value (NPV) formula, Discounted Cash
Flow (DCF), Payback rate, and Return on Investment (ROI). In this thesis, mainly
NPV will be used, as well as DCF and Payback rate.
Net Present Value
To calculate the Net Present Value, one needs to understand the Present Value (PV)
formula:

𝑃𝑉 =

𝐶1
(1 + 𝑖)𝑡

5

Where C1 is the cash flow of the period, t is the time of the cash flow and i is the
discount rate (Brealey, Myers and Marcus, 2012). The period is one year. The formula
calculates the present value of future cash flows from a period, while taking the risk
into account. Summing up the present values of all periods, while also taking into
account the initial investment gives us the Net Present Value (NPV) formula:

𝑁

𝑁𝑃𝑉(𝑖, 𝑁) = ∑
𝑡=1

𝑅𝑡
(1 + 𝑖)𝑡

6

68

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________

where t is the time of the cash flow, i is the discount rate, and Rt is the net cash flow
(inflow – outflow) (Brealey, Myers and Marcus, 2012).
The purpose of the NPV formula is to calculate how much an investment would be
worth today if one could calculate the present value of the investment's future cash
flows. The formula calculates the time value of money by adjusting the future cash
flows according to the discount rate. The NPV formula essentially calculates the
present value of the investment, while subtracting all outflows from the value. This
means that for an investment to be profitable, the Net Present Value has to be positive
(Pearce, 1971). If the NPV is negative, then the investment is not profitable.
Payback Period
The payback period for an investment is how long it takes for a project to recover the
initial investment. For example, if a company invests 2,000 euros in a project, with the
project generating 1,000 euros per year after the initial investment, the payback period
is two years. However, the payback period does not take into consideration all possible
cash flows after the cutoff year, i.e. the year when the initial investment has been
recovered. This means that the payback period for a project that generates positive
cash flows long after the cutoff year may be the same as a project which does not
generate nearly as much money.
Furthermore, some companies may use the discounted cash flow while calculating the
payback period. This takes into account the time value of money, instead of assuming
the value of money regardless of the period. However, using the discounted payback
method still does not take into account possible cash flows after the cutoff year. Due
to this, many companies choose to use both NPV and the discounted payback method
when considering investing in a project.(Brealey, Myers and Marcus, 2012)
Financial Calculations for Clamp-on Ultrasound
The financial calculations done in this thesis are based on a potential future
implementation project for clamp-on ultrasound. The project would include clamp-on
ultrasound tests in a production facility and implementation of the technology. The

69

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
implementation location, in this case, would be a hard-to-clean area beneath a tabletcoating drum.
To not disclose any trade secrets, specific numbers and calculations are not disclosed
in this thesis.
To begin with, the total execution costs of the project were calculated. The calculations
included testing in the production facilities with a 2-channel test system, rental and
purchase of the ultrasound equipment, and project management costs.
After this, the cash flow and project profit was calculated. Seeing as an implementation
of clamp-on ultrasound does not generate direct profits, the reduction in need for
cleaning was used as project profit. As relatively large amounts of money is spent on
cleaning cycles and the processing of deviations in surface cleanliness, more efficient
cleaning processes indirectly generates money. Parameters used for calculating the
cash flow and profit of the project can be seen in Table 12. With these parameters, the
total cost per deviation was calculated. The power needed for the ultrasound equipment
and the electricity price were used for calculating the operational costs of the
technology. For this, the number of cleaning cycles and the cycle durations were also
used.

An annual increase of 2 % was used in both the calculations for the maintenance costs
as well as for the electricity price. A discount rate of 15 % was used for the discounted
cash flow and the Net Present Value.

___________________________________________________________________
It is unclear how many cleaning deviations the implementation of the technology
would prevent in a year, making the project profit difficult to accurately estimate.
However, the technology could potentially prevent as many as 15 deviations from
happening per year. To get a good understanding of how this impacts the profitability
of the project, it was decided to calculate the NPV and payback time for three cases: a
reduction of 5, 10, and 15 cleaning deviations per year. The number of reduced
deviations per year was multiplied by the total cost per deviation to achieve the income
of the period. The net cash flow of a period was the sum of the project execution costs,
the income, and the operational costs.
Results & Discussion of Financial Calculations for Clamp-on Ultrasound
The Net Present Values for the three different cases and their payback times can be
seen in Table 13.

15 deviations/year

~1 year

As can be seen from the table, all cases result in a positive Net Present Value, which
means that theoretically, the investment is profitable. There is, however, a few things
that need to be considered concerning the NPV and the technology.
Even though the NPV of the project is positive for all calculated cases, there is still a
lot of uncertainty regarding the profitability of the project. The initial investment cost
for buying clamp-on ultrasound equipment is considerably large, with there being no
guarantees for how well the technology performs in the pharmaceutical industry.
Furthermore, renting the equipment leads to significant costs in the long run.
A relatively large amount of the project execution costs include the testing of the
equipment in the production facilities. If one were to buy the equipment without a
significant amount of testing beforehand, the risk is quite extensive. On the other hand,

71

Martin Ekman
Master’s Thesis
___________________________________________________________________
renting and/or testing the equipment beforehand also leads to expenses that need to be
considered when evaluating the profitability of the technology.
It is worth noting though that the operational costs of the technology are relatively
small in comparison to the overall costs of the project. The operational costs per year
are around 4 % of the total execution costs of the project. This means, that even though
the initial investment of the project is considerable, the economic life as well as the
technical lifetime of the equipment needs to be considered. Even if the economical and
technical lifetimes of the equipment come to an end, the equipment is still relatively
easily replaceable. Furthermore, one needs to take the additional value of having
implemented the technology into a production environment into consideration. This
opens many doors for other application areas in the pharmaceutical industry,
potentially making the technology and knowledge a valuable asset in the future.
As the possibility for rental of the technology is possible, one needs to consider all
possibilities for the usage of the equipment before purchasing or deciding to long-term
rent it. Would it be possible to use the same equipment at multiple locations? If the
utilization need of the equipment is not required at all times at a given location, it
would be beneficial to consider buying a given number of clamp-on ultrasound
channels and using it at multiple locations. This way, if the technology could be used
as a sort of maintenance cleaning system, the equipment could be moved between
pharmaceutical plants or departments, performing maintenance cleaning at one
location at a time. This, however, requires that the equipment could easily be installed
and removed and that it is compatible with e.g. the pipe dimensions at each location.
Overall, the technology seems to be financially profitable. However, before any major
investments are made, further testing should be done to ensure that the technology is
as beneficial as possible.
