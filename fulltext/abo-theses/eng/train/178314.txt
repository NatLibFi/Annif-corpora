Lyocell is a type of man-made cellulosic fibre that is produced via direct dissolution
of dissolving pulp in a non-volatile amine oxide or ionic liquid. The dissolved pulp is
regenerated into long fibre strings by extruding the dissolved mixture through an airgap into a water bath. The fibres coagulate in the bath and are later drawn into another
water bath where they are washed until the solvent is completely removed. The Lyocell
process is known as a sustainable way of producing textile fibres due to its low
emissions, water consumption and land-usage. It is distinguished by its very high
recycling rate of solvent, which in some cases has been reported to be above 99%.
The objective of this thesis was to create a realistic model of the NMMO-based Lyocell
process by using the steady-state simulation software Balas®. The model provides
data from which the accumulation of impurities in the process loops can be studied.
The process impurities are defined as un-utilised pulp components and inorganics.
This data combined with overall mass and energy balances are used to analyse five
solvent recycling concepts: (1) ion exchange and evaporation; (2) flotation, ion
exchange and evaporation; (3) filtration, ion exchange and evaporation; (4) filtration
and liquid/liquid-extraction with butanol; and (5) filtration and liquid/liquid-extraction
with dichloromethane.

Abstract

All process concepts were set to perform at a 99% solvent recovery rate, thus creating
a scenario for an equal comparison of the pre-requisites for each of the recycling
concepts. The concepts were evaluated based on the purity of the recovered solvent,
energy demand and overall complexity. Complexity is based on the number of process
steps and design parameters, as well as dependence on chemicals. The least complex
combination of technologies is Concept 1, followed by Concept 3, 2, 4 and 5. Concept
4 and 5 can provide a highly concentrated solvent stream (99%) with lower amounts
of impurities than the other concepts. Concept 1, 2 and 3 result in very similar solvent
purity rates. Concept 2 has the lowest steam demand, followed by Concept 1, 3, 5 and
4. The model results are in reasonable accordance to published data on water and
energy demand of industrial Lyocell fibre production.

Keywords: Lyocell, regenerated cellulosic fibre, solvent recovery concepts, process

Introduction

1 Introduction
The textile industry is currently one of the largest and most polluting industries in the
world. The industry is continuously growing and the annual global demand for virgin
textile fibres is projected to reach 145 million tonnes by the year 2030. Production of
textile fibres is very resource-intensive and the high usage of energy, land, and water
is regularly discussed. Global Fashion Agenda and Boston Consulting Group
addressed this subject in 2017 by writing an extensive report on the topic, which also
contained global textile producers’ views on the matter. The producers were
specifically asked why the industry is not moving faster towards more sustainable
ways of working, for which they provided multiple answers. Three very popular
answers were consumers’ low willingness to pay premium prices for sustainable
products, lack of technological innovations, and lack of an economically viable
business case. New and innovative process concepts are therefore needed in order to
provide consumers with affordable low-emission textiles in the future.
Textile fibres can be divided into two main groups: natural and man-made fibres.
Natural fibres are harvested from animals or plants and can immediately be spun into
yarn. Man-made fibres on the other hand have to be refined before they can be spun
into threads. Man-made fibres can be produced in many ways and are therefore further
categorised into synthetic and semi-synthetic fibres. Synthetic fibres, such as Nylon,
are purely made from chemicals and are not plant or animal based. Semi-synthetic
fibres, such as Rayon, are in general made from material consisting of long polymer
chains. All semi-synthetic fibres are chemically modified, and some of them are also
partially degraded in the process. A few semi-synthetic fibres can further be
categorised as regenerated fibres, which refer to fibres explicitly made from
biomaterials. Both Rayon and Lyocell fibres belong to this subgroup as they are made
from pulp. Regenerated fibres are generally produced by dissolving the raw material
in a liquid solvent to obtain a homogenous mixture, which then is extruded into strings.
The strings are directly pulled into a bath that contains an anti-solvent (often water),
which will extract the solvent out of the string and let the fibre mixture regenerate into
a solid shape.

Introduction

The negative aspect of some regenerated fibres is the formation of unwanted chemical
derivatives. This is the case for both the Viscose and the Cuprammonium method as
they both form by-products while trying to produce Rayon. Production of Lyocell
fibres does not result in derivative compounds but the solvent used for dissolving pulp,
N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMMO), is in general prone to degradation at nonideal process conditions. The Lyocell process is despite this still considered the
greenest alternative for producing man-made fibres.
The process for producing Lyocell fibres was developed by Lenzing AG in the 1980s
due to a market demand for cheaper and more environmental-friendly cellulosic fibres.
Lyocell was originally a trademark but has later become a generic name for all
regenerated fibres produced by direct dissolution with organic solvents. The amine
oxide NMMO has long been the go-to choice but an alternative to this has always been
desired. The search for an alternative escalated greatly when the lignocellulose
dissolving capabilities of some ionic liquids were discovered. This later led to the
development of a novel process concept for ionic liquids, called Ioncell, developed at
Aalto University and University of Helsinki. Regenerated fibres have not yet been
produced commercially according to the Ioncell concept, as it has only been tested at
lab-scale. Fibres produced according to the Ioncell concept are still considered as
generic Lyocell fibres.
The economic feasibility of the Lyocell process relies very heavily on an efficient
recovery of the solvent NMMO, for which filtration, ion exchange and evaporation are
established key technologies. However, a general study on the recovery of solvent in
the Lyocell process does not exist, and the goal of this thesis is therefore to increase
understanding in this area. In addition, new potential solvents such as ionic liquids
might require other recovery concepts than what is used for the NMMO-based Lyocell
process. An essential part of this thesis is therefore to map out and evaluate existing
solvent recovery concepts, as well as new potential alternatives. A simulation model
is created to obtain mass and energy balances for five chosen solvent recovery
concepts.

Introduction

The benefit of a simulation model is that the resulting mass and energy balances can
provide comprehensive information about the process as a whole. However, one small
challenge with modelling the Lyocell process is the lack of validation data. The results
presented in this thesis are therefore hypothetical as there is no in-depth reference data.
The literature review in Chapter 2 provides a background to the process as a whole,
while Chapter 3 focuses on methodology. The results are presented in Chapter 4 and
discussed in Chapter 5. The model is created by using the steady-state simulation
program Balas®, developed by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd.

Literature review

2 Literature review
2.1 Wood and pulp fundamentals
Pulp is a fibre-based material derived from chemically and/or physically broken down
lignocellulosic material, typically wood. It is most commonly known as raw material
for papermaking, but it is a very versatile material that is used in many applications
besides paper. Pulp is generally formed by 3 main constituents, cellulose,
hemicellulose, and lignin. Small residues of ash-forming elements and extractives are
also normally found. The individual mass fractions usually vary depending wood type
and selected refining process. Pulp can for example be produced by the Kraft method,
which results in a high hemicellulose content. Kraft pulp is commonly used in
papermaking but can also be further refined into dissolving pulp. Dissolving pulp has
a hemicellulose content below 5% combined with a cellulose content over 90% and is
used as raw material in the Lyocell process. The topic of wood and pulp is widely
covered in area-specific literature (Sjöström, 1993; Biermann, 1996; Wertz, Mercier
and Bédué, 2010; Gullichsen and Fogelbolm, 2011).
2.1.1

Cellulose

Cellulose is usually the most desired component in pulp production and constitutes for
approximately 40-45% of the dry mass fraction in wood. Cellulose is a linear
homopolymer chain of β-D-glucose units linked together by β-(1→4)-linkages. An
illustration of the molecular structure can be seen in Figure 2-1 (Sjöström, 1993). The
number of β-D-glucose units determine the degree of polymerisation (DP) and can
reach up to 10,000 in unprocessed wood. Cellulose can reach that high crystal
structures because of their tendency to form intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds.
Cellulose in unprocessed wood is known as cellulose I, which can be either Iα or Iβ
depending on the structure. Cellulose I is known as the natural form of cellulose and
is one of four types (I to IV). The cellulose types vary in DP and molecular bonds but
still consist of the same D-glucose monomers. Cellulose I possess the highest DP and
cellulose IV the lowest.

2.1.2

Hemicellulose

Hemicelluloses is a class of heterogeneous polysaccharides usually formed by a group
of five (xylose, arabinose) and six-carbon sugars (mannose, galactose, glucose).
Hemicelluloses can in some cases also contain small amounts of uronic acids.
Hemicelluloses generally have a DP of 100-200 and are due to this easier to dissolve
and have a lower thermal stability than cellulose. Some hemicelluloses are even partly
or entirely soluble in water, while others require an alkaline solution. Solubility for the
major hemicellulose components can be found in Table 2-1 (Sjöström, 1993).
Table 2-1. Major hemicellulose components. Reproduced from Sjöström (1993)

The hemicellulose content of wood typically contributes 20-30% to the dry mass
fraction. As seen in Table 2-1 galactoglucomannan is the dominant component in
softwood, and it is generally accompanied by small amounts of arabinoglucuronoxylan

5

Andreas Reipsar

Literature review

and arabinogalactan. Hardwood on the other hand contains glucuronoxylan and
glucomannan, where glucuronoxylan is dominant. Other forms of polysaccharides
might also appear for both soft and hardwood, but they are very low in quantity and
usually have a low DP.

2.1.3

Lignin

Unlike cellulose and hemicelluloses, lignin is not a carbohydrate but an amorphous
polymer with an irregular chemical structure. Lignin consists of three building blocks:
p-Coumaryl, Coniferyl and Sinapyl, which can be linked in many various ways. Their
molecular structure can be seen in Figure 2-2 (Biermann, 1996). Softwoods
dominantly contain coniferyl (>90%) together with some sinapyl (<10%), hardwoods
also contain both coniferyl and sinapyl but with a more balanced ratio (50/50).
Polymerisation of the phenylpropane units is a result of bonds formed between free
radicals, usually via C6 and C3 precursors. The bonds formed between the elements are
either ether linkages (C-O-C) or carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds. The ether linkages are
more common and contribute to more than two-thirds of the bonds formed in lignin
polymers. Lignin content differs depending on the wood type but is generally about
20-25% for hardwoods and 25-30% for softwoods. The main task for lignin is to act
as a binder of fibres in the wood, like a glue between the wood cells for more rigidity.

Literature review

Extractives

Extractives are a broad collection of substances with low molar masses, such as fatty
acids, fatty alcohols, ethers, esters and aromatics. The primary function of extractives
is to help provide nutrition and to protect the wood from degradation and
microbiological attacks. Extractives vary in composition from species to species but
usually contribute with 1-5% of the dry wood content. Extractives are usually soluble
in neutral organic solvents or water.

2.1.5

Ash-forming elements

Ash-forming matter is a composition of inorganic component that usually constitutes
between 0.2 and 5% to the mass fraction of trees when taking into account bark,
needles and leaves. However, it rarely exceeds 1% for pure wood. Inorganics usually
appear as metal salts or ions that are bound to cellulose chains. Inorganics are
generally not desired in the pulping process because they might cause corrosion and
speed up the degradation of pulp carbohydrates. The majority of inorganics are
therefore usually removed from the pulp before key steps in the refining process.
Inorganics are usually removed by using either an aqueous acid or chelating agent.
Approximate concentration levels of inorganic elements in dry stem wood can be
found in Table 2-2 (Gullichsen and Fogelbolm, 2011).

2.2 Solubility of pulp
Solubility of lignocellulose has been thoroughly studied since the start of this millennia
and is an important aspect for production of Lyocell fibres. Extensive research has
therefore been carried out by many researchers in this area (Rosenau et al., 2002;
Mäki-Arvela et al., 2010; Hauru et al., 2012). The aim for dissolving pulp when
producing textile fibres is generally to obtain a homogenous mixture that later can be
extruded and regenerated into fibre strings. An additional benefit that comes from
regeneration of pulp is that the chemical structure switches from cellulose I to the more
beneficial cellulose II. Both cellulose types are linked by hydrogen bonds horizontally,
but only cellulose II is vertically linked. The vertical linkages give cellulose II a
stronger structure and higher tensile strength, making it more beneficial for textile
fibres than cellulose I. Horizontal intermolecular hydrogen bonds can be observed in
Figure 2-3 (Festucci-Buselli, Otoni and Joshi, 2007).

Figure 2-3. Cellulose molecular structure with inter (dashed lines) and intramolecular
(dotted lines) hydrogen bonds. Reproduced from Festucci-Buselli, Otoni and Joshi
(2007).
Cellulose is dissolved by either breaking apart the D-glucose units from the polymer
chains or separating the chain from other chains. The former is merely used to reduce
the DP of the polymer, which will also lower the pulp viscosity. The chains can be

Literature review

separated by splitting the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the chains by
introducing a solvent. All hydroxyl groups that formed intermolecular bonds will
instead bond with solvent molecules, thus releasing the chains from one another. The
chains are regenerated by exposing the solvent/cellulose-mixture to an anti-solvent.
The solvent will then leave the cellulose chains and start to interact with the antisolvent. The cellulose chains can then re-create the intermolecular bonds and form a
cellulose II structure. A desired solvent characteristic is therefore strong
hydrophilicity, as it makes the solvent more reluctant to bond with water over
cellulose. The anti-solvent is in most cases water, but the same concepts apply if the
anti-solvent is an alkaline or organic solution.
Solvents used for dissolution of cellulose can be divided into two classes: derivatising
or non-derivatising. By using derivatising solvents, unstable chemical compounds will
be formed as a result of the dissolution process as opposed to non-derivatising
solvents. The absence of by-product formation is what makes the non-derivatising
solvents considered as green solvents. Nevertheless, by-products can be formed at nonideal process conditions due to elevated temperatures or high inorganic content.
Dissolution by using non-derivatising solvents is generally called direct dissolution.
The solvents types presented in Chapter 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 are both classed as nonderivatising. Derivatising solvents are commonly used in the Viscose and the
Cuprammonium process, while non-derivatising solvents are used in the Lyocell
process.

2.2.1

NMMO

4-methylmorpholine-4-oxide (NMMO) is an oxidant organic compound that is known
for its ability to very efficiently dissolve lignocellulose. NMMO appears in three
natural forms: anhydrous NMMO, monohydrate NMMO-1·H2O and NMMO2.5·H2O. In 1979, Chanzy, Dubé and Marchessault discovered that NMMO-1·H2O
could act as a solvent for cellulose, the mixture was also found to crystallise after being
cooled. Furthermore, they found that cellulose retained the same specific morphology
of the solution after the solvent was removed. It was also concluded that anhydrous
NMMO formed cellular textures and monohydrate NMMO spherulites. Navard and

Literature review

Haudin (1981) determined the melting points of the three NMMO types to 182.4°C,
75.6°C and 40.5 °C. In 1982, Chanzy et al. found that crystalline structures of with
anhydrous NMMO were most likely to dominate in solutions with less than 13.3%
mass fraction water (Wertz, Mercier and Bédué, 2010). Likewise, it was found that
solutions with water content at 13.3-24% would be dominated by monohydrate
NMMO crystals. Solutions over 24% would consist of a combination of monohydrate
and NMMO-2.5·H2O.
In order to obtain highly oriented cellulose structures, it is therefore desirable to form
a solution dominated by anhydrous NMMO crystals. In 2002, Biganska, Navard and
Bédué found that a general crystallisation of NMMO/Cellulose/water-solutions
depended on the crystallisation of NMMO, not of cellulose. The study found that the
regenerated cellulose, which had been exposed to excess water, showed a higher
oriented structure for solutions with lower water concentration. Anhydrous NMMO
would therefore seem to be the most beneficial version of NMMO for dissolving
NMMO. However, due to the high melting point, it is too prone to by-product
formation to be industrially feasible. Due to this, the more stable monohydrate is
generally used for dissolving cellulose. A proposed dissolution mechanism of
cellulose in NMMO can be observed in Figure 2-4 (Pinkert, Marsh and Pang, 2010).

Literature review

Degradation of NMMO is unavoidable but can be minimised by controlling
temperature and adding stabilisers. An extensive study on NMMO degradation has
been published by Rosenau et al. in 2001, which covers all known reaction paths. The
most common degradation products of NMMO are N-methylmorpholine (NMM) and
morpholine (M). Degradation is generally sped up after reaching 120°C and becomes
uncontrollable after 150°C. Degradation products can be toxic and dangerous, as well
as cause discolouration and affect fibre quality. Iron and copper ions in particular, but
also metal ions in general, have been reported to have a significant impact on NMMO
degradation (Rosenau et al., 2001; White, 2001). Lignin might also to some extent
support degradation due to its hydroxyl groups, which can lead to formation of toxic
formaldehyde.
2.2.2

Ionic liquids

A general definition of ionic liquids (IL) is a mixture containing (almost) exclusively
ions, but it is limited to mixtures with a melting point below 100°C. The liquids are
specifically considered room temperature ionic liquids when they can stay liquid
below 25°C. Because it only takes two compounds to form an ionic liquid, the number
of possible configurations is very large. There are no general classifications or names
for dividing IL types into larger groups based on purpose or special characteristics.
The chemical name of the anion or the cation is therefore mostly used when describing
the type of liquid. An advantage with the great versatility and endless configurations
is that it provides a possibility to design task-specific ionic liquids. ILs used for
dissolution of lignocellulosic material are examples of this.
Mäki-Arvela et al. carried out an extensive study on this specific type of IL in 2010,
for which the aim was to specifically investigate the correlation of multiple IL
properties on their dissolution capacity. They found that relatively small cations
typically are more efficient in dissolving cellulose than bigger cations, with the same
applying for anions. The cation also has to be polarising and capable of effectively
targeting the cellulose hydroxyl groups. Furthermore, they also noted that the presence
of functional groups could have a crucial impact on solubility. Solubility would
evidently decrease if the cations were equipped with a hydroxyl end-group of their
own.
11

Andreas Reipsar

Literature review

Ionic liquids typically possess very low vapour pressure and low flammability, which
results in a low tendency to form gaseous by-products. It is due to this high chemical
stability that they are generally considered as a greener alternative to NMMO.
However, when degradation does happen, it is most likely to occur when the liquids
are exposed to high temperatures or inorganic compounds. Other negative aspects are
usually linked to potential toxicity, corrosivity and price. These things can often be
minimised by carefully choosing process parameters, mixture of ions and equipment
material.
Phase diagrams and specific composition of IL/cellulose/water-solutions are
individual, but experiments have shown that ILs can dissolve cellulose in solutions of
up to 25 wt.-% of cellulose (Swatloski et al., 2002). However, solutions closer to 10
wt.-% cellulose are generally more common. The amount of water in the solution has
a significant impact on the ILs ability to dissolve cellulose, and especially if the IL is
hydrophilic. An advantage with hydrophilic solvents is that they are easier to separate
from the regenerated fibre in a later stage as they prefer to bond with water over
cellulose. This naturally also comes with the disadvantage that very hydrophilic ILs
are more difficult to separate from water. A proposed dissolution mechanism of
cellulose in an IL is illustrated in Figure 2-5 (Pinkert, Marsh and Pang, 2010).

2.3 Lyocell process description
The Lyocell process has been in industrial use since the 1980s and was developed by
Lenzing AG, one of the biggest producers of regenerated cellulosic fibre in the world.
The commercial name of their Lyocell fibres is Tencel, which can be compared to the
trademarked Ioncell. Both products are Lyocell fibres, but Ioncell is based on a slightly
modified process concept. Ioncell fibres are also yet to be produced commercially, but
studies have been published about fibre properties and manufacturing process (Stepan
et al., 2016; Hauru, 2017). The Ioncell concept uses the ionic liquid [DBNH][OAc]
for direct-dissolution of cellulose instead of NMMO. A benefit is that this ionic liquid
can operate at lower temperatures than NMMO, due to a different thermodynamic
profile.
General process data for the NMMO-based process can be found in publicly available
literature. According to Lenzing, 46 litres water is used to produce one kilogram of
Tencel fibre, covering cradle to production gate (Lenzing Group, 2018). The
corresponding water demand for cradle to produced dissolving pulp in Lenzing’s pulp
mill was reported to be 38 litres/kg (Suhr et al., 2015). The actual production of Tencel
fibres from dissolving pulp can therefore be assumed to require 8 litres of water.
Furthermore, a life-cycle analysis by Roos (2012) claims that the Lyocell process used
by Lenzing has a primary energy demand of 47.6 MJ/kg produced fibre. The general
NMMO-Lyocell process is illustrated in Figure 2-6 (reproduced from Lenzing
Aktiengesellschaft (2019)) and the Ioncell concept in Figure 2-7.
The difference between the concepts is mostly connected to the raw material used. The
Lyocell process is limited to the use of dissolving pulp as raw material, while the
Ioncell can use pulp mixtures with higher DP, such as paper grade pulp or recycled
paper. The Ioncell process is equipped with a pre-treatment and fractionation step,
making it possible to adjust the paper grade pulp to dissolving pulp quality. This might
result in the product not necessarily being that much different than for the Lyocell
process. It is more a question of process definition as the dissolving pulp used in the
Lyocell process is already adjusted to a certain quality. In contrast to the Ioncell
concept, where it is included in the process configuration. Common predominating

methods for producing dissolving pulp are pre-hydrolysis Kraft and acid sulphite
pulping, which both result in noticeable cellulose yield losses in comparison to the
Ioncell concept (Roselli et al., 2014). Ioncell pulp pre-treatment is thoroughly
described in papers by Froschauer et al., (2013) and Roselli et al., (2014).

Andreas Reipsar

Literature review

Besides the difference in raw material, both processes consist of what could be called
a fibre line. The fibre line starts with a mixture step where pulp and solvent are formed
into a highly viscous mixture called dope by direct dissolution. This is followed by
dry-jet wet spinning where the dope is extruded through an air gap into a water bath.
The dope is immediately regenerated into fibres when it makes contact with the water
and is directly drawn into another bath. The regenerated fibre is then drawn through a
long washing stage, where the solvent is washed off by counter-current water flow.
The wet fibre can be further processed according to end-usage.
The use of unadjusted paper grade pulp in the Lyocell process has earlier been
discussed by Rosenau et al. (2001), where it was considered to be theoretically
possible but problems with spinnability might occur. Spinnability refers to the ability
of the formed mixture to be extruded and drawn into long strings. The influence of
hemicellulose on spinnability was later studied by Zhang and Tong (2007). They
concluded that the polysaccharides had a positive impact on fibrillation resistance,
mechanical properties and overall production speed of Lyocell fibres. They further
suggested that this might imply that hemicellulose would act as a plasticiser in the
solution, i.e. give the solution a lower viscosity without any addition of enzymes or
acids. The use of pulp with high hemicellulose content also results in less production
losses, as excess hemicellulose no longer is removed to obtain dissolving pulp.

2.3.1

Pre-treatment, pre-mix and dissolution

Pre-treatment is a required process step for the Ioncell concept in order to obtain a
mixture equal to dissolving pulp, and is thoroughly described by Froschauer et al.
(2013) and Roselli et al. (2014, 2016). The big difference between the high DP paper
grade pulp and dissolving pulp is the viscosity and cellulose content. Pre-treatment in
the Ioncell concept lowers the viscosity of the pulp by addition of enzyme and acid.
Enzymes will target hemicelluloses for fractionation before the acid is introduced to
reduce DP by hydrolysis. This combination can change the intrinsic viscosity from
about 800-900 to ideally 400-500 mL/g. Viscosity and DP adjustment are critical as
they strongly affect rheological properties and spinnability.

15

Andreas Reipsar

Literature review

The addition of acid will not only affect the viscosity, but also the amount of metal
ions that are bound to the pulp (Su et al., 2010). By exposing pulp to strong acids, the
chemical bonds between the metal ions and the pulp will break. Thus resulting in an
increased concentration of free ions in the system. The efficiency of metal removal
can be further increased by addition of chelating agents (Räsänen, 2003; Su et al.,
2010). Both enzyme and acid treatment take place in kneaders, i.e. a type of mixing
devices. Both treatments also end with enzyme and acid being washed off and use
filters to separate pulp and chemicals before entering the pre-mix step.
The pre-treatment is followed by a pre-mix, which is mutual for both the Lyocell
baseline process and the Ioncell concept. The pre-mix aims to homogenise the
pulp/solvent/water-mixture into a slurry before the pulp can be dissolved.
Homogenisation takes place in a kneader (see Figure 2-8), which enables ideal mixing
by shredding the pulp. Pre-mix is the first step of the NMMO-based process where
dissolving pulp is mixed with a 76-78% aqueous amine oxide solution at 70-90 °C
(White, 2001). The pulp will not be able to dissolve at this stage as there is excess
water present and the temperature is too low. The Ioncell concept is almost identical
to the NMMO-based process, apart from the temperature being 60 °C and the pulp
being mixed with an 85% IL/water-mixture.

Andreas Reipsar

Literature review

The Ioncell pre-mix step ends with removal of hemicellulose, IL and water by using
filtration, through which a pulp standard equal to dissolving pulp is obtained. Roselli
et al. (2016) reported a hemicellulose contents of 0.9-2.4% for the modified pulp
(depending on wood and hemicellulose type) by using this method. However, even
though that both the baseline Lyocell process and the Ioncell concept uses dissolving
pulp, the dissolution step slightly differs between the two concepts.
When the NMMO/pulp solution is mixed to a homogenous slurry, it enters an
evaporator. The evaporator is set at 90-120 °C and vacuum pressure, which enables
efficient evaporation of water.

Figure 2-9 Thin-wall evaporator used for cellulose dissolution. Reproduced from
White (2001)
Evaporation of excess water is needed as dissolution will not occur until a feasible
composition of pulp, solvent and water is reached. Excess water is removed because
the solvent prefers to bond with hydrogens in water rather than hydroxyl groups in
cellulose. By reducing the amount of water, the solvent will be forced to start bonding
with hydroxyl groups in cellulose. After slowly diffusing into amorphous regions of
17

Andreas Reipsar

Literature review

the polymer structure and making the fibres swell, the solvent can now begin to
dissolve the pulp completely. The solvent will gradually continue to dis-integrate
crystalline regions near the amorphous cellulose regions by continuously breaking
intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This will then result in a fully dissolved and
homogenous solution.
Dissolution of pulp in the Ioncell concept needs no evaporation because the water
content in the pulp exiting the pre-mix is already sufficiently low, a kneader is utilised
once more. An IL mixture with 13 wt% pulp content was reported to have been used
by Stepan et al. (2016), with kneader parameters at 80 °C and 50 mbar.
2.3.2

Spinning and fibre regeneration

The transformation of dope into regenerated fibres takes place in the spinning step of
the process. The highly viscous solution is pumped through a jet consisting of multiple
tiny holes, forming strings of the solution. The strings are drawn directly into a water
bath where they are regenerated into gelatinous filaments but are almost immediately
pulled up again. If there is a small air gap between the jet and the water, the spinning
is called dry-jet wet spinning. If there is no air gap, it is called wet spinning. The former
is used in both the NMMO-based Lyocell process and the Ioncell concept; the latter is
used in the viscose process.
Dry-jet wet spinning provides the fibres with improved strength and elongation
properties compared to wet spinning, which enables improved spinnability. The choice
of air gap, draw ratio, and anti-solvent temperature plays a key role for the properties
of the produced fibres. The draw ratio is determined by the difference in speed of the
polymer solution entering and leaving the bath. The speed is increased to lengthen the
fibres and straighten their structure as much as possible.

18

Andreas Reipsar

Literature review

Figure 2-10 Schematic illustration of dry-jet wet spinning. Reproduced from Liu et al.
(2017).
The regeneration starts immediately when the dope touches the water. Because the
solvent is very hydrophilic, it will prefer bonding with water over cellulose. When the
solvent is gone, cellulose chains will regenerate intermolecular bonds and form a
cellulose II structure. The temperature of the water is typically much colder than the
solution, as it helps the regeneration (White, 2001). A study by Hauru et al. (2014)
shows that a temperature of 15-25° for the water is suitable.
Compound losses in the regeneration step have been studied by Ma et al. (2016) and
it was found that only small amounts of hemicellulose and lignin are lost. Loss of
cellulose was not explicitly mentioned, but the composition of cellulose, hemicellulose
and lignin in the regenerated fibre was stated to be very close to the pulp composition
before dissolution. This would indicate small or minimal losses of cellulose, which is
supported by similar observations from Zhang et al. (2009).
2.3.3

Washing

After the fibres are regenerated, the remaining solvent is removed by washing the
fibres. Washing is generally done by towing the fibres through a series of wash baths
with a counter-current flow of water. The water exits the bath where the fibres enter
and is then used in the coagulation bath before being sent to water treatment and
solvent recovery. Water is used because it works as an anti-solvent for NMMO and

19

Andreas Reipsar

Literature review

hydrophilic ILs. This means that it can attract NMMO or a hydrophilic IL by providing
free hydrogen ions to bond with, which in return will free the cellulose chains.
However, a pre-requisite for removing solvents is diffusion of anti-solvent into the
towed fibre. It is only then that the solvent can diffuse out of the fibre, by bonding with
the free protons provided by the anti-solvent.
The interaction between solvent and water plays a vital role when studying diffusion
through the fibre. A study by Hauru et al. (2016) found that the diffusion of solvent
on the way out of the fibre generally is slower than the diffusion of water into the fibre.
They could therefore conclude that the efficiency of the washing step is heavily timedependent. Washing efficiency can be optimised by keeping the concentration of
solvent in the water at a low level. A significant counter-flow of freshwater into the
baths is also essential to negate the accumulation of impurities in the bath, and not just
to keep a low solvent concentration. Impurities are not desired as they can affect the
quality of the fibre, by for example discolouration.

2.3.4

Drying and finishing

When the fibre is washed from impurities, it can be modified according to end-usage.
The fibres are always dried after being washed, but can also be combined with stapling,
bleaching, dyeing or chemical treatment. Chemical treatment is generally applied to
alter the material characteristics such as softness or fibre fibrillation. Fibres produced
with NMMO are generally prone to fibrillation. Stapling can be done either before or
after the fibres are dried, the same perforated drum dryer technology can be used in
both cases. The dryers operate by sucking dry hot air through the holes of the
perforated cylinders and thereby also absorb excess water from the fibres. An
illustration of a drum dryer can be seen in Figure 2-11 (Tsotsas, Gnielinski and
Schlünder, 2000). Lyocell fibres have a natural moisture content of 11.5% in normal
air conditions and a water retention ability of 70% (Werz et al., 2001).

2.3.5

Solvent recovery methods

Efficient purification and recovery of the solvent is necessary to achieve a high-quality
fibre and economic feasibility. The process water exiting the regeneration bath will
need a versatile combination of separation technologies as the water contains lignin,
inorganics, solvent and small amounts of non-regenerated pulp. As in most cases at an
industrial scale, it is very hard to achieve a full recovery and 100% purity of chemicals.
This also applies to the Lyocell process, where the accumulation of impurities in the
process loops might affect fibre quality or trigger by-product formation. The amount
of impurities is not necessarily large after one process cycle, but as the solvent is
recovered and re-used, accumulation of impurities will occur. However, an efficiency
below 100% can be acceptable, as long as the amount of specific impurities can be
maintained at a level where the effect of them is dismissible. Metal ions were
mentioned in Chapter 2.2.1 to have a negative impact on NMMO and are therefore of
high priority in this step.
Lenzing AG claims to have a solvent recovery rate of over 99% but does not mention
whether the value is based on the amount of solvent used in the dissolution stage or
the amount of solvent exiting the washing stage for re-circulation. Thus not specifying
if there are small solvent losses to the produced fibre. Potential losses of NMMO
overall in the process are most likely degradation and formation of by-products.

21

Andreas Reipsar

Literature review

Technologies that are used for purifying process water streams are usually evaluated
based on their ability to remove total suspended solids (TSS) and total dissolved solids
(TDS). This can also be applied for the Lyocell process as both organic and inorganic
impurities can be defined as either TSS or TDS. TDS are generally defined as
compounds that are small enough to be filtered through a pore size of 2 micrometer.
Larger compounds are defined as suspended solids. Cellulose, hemicellulose and
lignin can vary in degree of polymerization and polymer size, which means that they
can be defined as both TSS and TDS depending on their specific characteristics.
The general Lyocell process solvent recovery consists of two main steps: ion exchange
and evaporation. Additional separation technologies can be used to obtain a higher
purity rate and lower the load for both ion exchange and evaporation. Some types of
resin beds can only tolerate low amounts of suspended solids, meaning that a
solid/liquid-separation unit would be beneficial for equipment durability. Flotation and
filtration are two basic separation technologies that easily can be combined with the
existing concept. The latter is used by Lenzing AG, and the former is commonly used
in the viscose process. The Ioncell concept appear to only be using ion exchange and
evaporation based on the potential IL-recycling loops exhibited by Stepan et al.
(2016). From a conceptual point of view, liquid/liquid-extraction could also be a
feasible alternative for solvent recovery. The technology is widely used across many
industries and will be considered in the applied part of this thesis when comparing
process concept alternatives.
All technologies mentioned are described in a public research report by Sorsamäki and
Nappa (2015), and additional information on ion exchange is also taken from Harland
(1994).
2.3.5.1 Flotation
Flotation can be used to remove suspended solids, free ions and colour from the water.
Flotation units are separation technologies based on gravitation, where the lightest
compounds can be targeted by separating the surface water. Flotation units can either
be based on dissolved air or electrolytic technique. Dissolved air flotation units have
air bubbles dispersed from underneath, and their role is to attach on to suspended solids
22

Andreas Reipsar

Literature review

and bring them up towards the surface. The unwanted concentrate, clustered on the
water surface, will flow over the edge of the cistern and can be discharged for further
treatment. Flotation might require chemical additives such as flocculants or coagulants
to work efficiently.
Coagulants are added to neutralise charged solids, as the solids would otherwise repel
others of the same charge. The coagulants create a complex of the solid particles were
the charged particles are surrounded by the opposite charge than they themselves
possess. Thus meaning that the complex is charged, but the particles captured are
neutralised. Flocculants are then added, and they possess the opposite charge of the
complex. Flocculants can be considered long polymers that can gather all particle
complexes formed into a bigger complex. The big complex formed is then easier to
separate from the flow. It is worth mentioning that ions are not suspended solids, but
dissolved solids.
Electroflotation relies on the same working principle as the dissolved air flotation.
However, the bubbles are generated by hydrolysis of water by using electricity caused
by an anode and a cathode. The hydrolysis can generate small bubbles filled with
oxygen and hydrogen that are about 0.1% the size of the bubbles in the dissolved air
flotation. A higher amount of bubbles with smaller sizes generally increases the
probability of colliding with a particle.
Flotation is mostly used in the metallurgy industry but can also be utilised for general
solid/liquid-separation processes. Flotation can be a suitable technology to use in the
Lyocell process because aqueous NMMO and IL systems have a higher density than
water alone, meaning that excess water in steady-state would reside in an own phase
above the aqueous solvent system. The excess water would also contain suspended
solids, as air bubbles would lift them towards the surface. A study by Managó, Vidal
and Souza (2016) use process water from the pulp and paper industry to study the
effect of a dissolved air flotation unit on chemical oxygen demand, total suspended
solids and turbidity. Reported removal rates of total suspended solids varied between
92.9 and 99%, depending on what the water had been used for. COD was reported to
decrease by 48% as a result of the flotation.

23

Andreas Reipsar

Literature review

Flotation can also be used for targeting specific ions. However, it will result in other
ions residing in the solution instead. This selectivity often requires adjustment of pH,
and the optimum level depends on the ion type. Féris et al. (2000) studied separation
of the iron complex Fe(OH)3, where NaOH was used to adjust pH. The result in this
case was that sodium became a free ion, while the Fe could form a complex with the
OH-group. The study reported recovery rates of up to 96.5% for the complex Fe(OH)3,
without using extra additives. However, it had to operate at a saturation pressure of 3
atm. The pressure could only be reduced if surfactants were included in the process.
Key design parameters for a flotation unit include area, depth, rising speed of air
bubbles, rising speed of compounds, and air-to-solids ratio.

2.3.5.2 Filtration
Membrane technologies are very common in water treatment processes due to wide
alternatives of pore sizes and overall applicability. Typical pore sizes range from less
than 1 nm in reverse osmosis to 10 µm in microfiltration. The gap between reverse
osmosis and microfiltration is covered by ultra and nanofiltration. Membrane
efficiency is usually described by the molecular weight cut-off value. The cut-off value
is used because it more clearly describes what compounds can pass through the pores,
and what compounds that are stopped. The molecular weight generally correlates with
the pore size, but it is not always completely precise. Two molecules with equal
molecular weight can still slightly differ in physical size, which is usually due to their
chemical structure.

Literature review

The use of ultrafiltration has been tested on flows containing organic compounds and
ions, as well as ionic liquid/water-mixtures (Tavares et al., 2002; Liang, Fu and Chang,
2016). The removal efficiency of ions was reported at 23-29%, although it was
discussed that their complexation with organic matter and membrane charge might
influence the results (Tavares et al., 2002). Some organic matter is naturally due to its
size stopped by the membrane, and an electrically charged membrane can attract free
anions and cations to some extent by itself. The tests by Tavares et al. (2002) also
showed a significant impact on colour removal, with an efficiency of up to 88.3%.
Liang, Fu and Chang (2016) tested two membranes with molecular cut-off values of
0.65 kDa and 1.0 kDa, giving an IL recovery rate of 98.1-97.5% and 96.3-95.8% for
the respective membranes. The unit Dalton (Da) is a measure of mass and is equivalent
to the average molecular weight of a compound, e.g. 1 g/mole equals 1 Da. It is worth
noticing that the ionic liquid used in the study was BmimBr (1-Butyl-3methylimidazolium bromide), which has a molecular weight of about 219 g/mole, i.e.
much larger than NMMO monohydrate at 135.16 g/mole. Permeate lignin content
varied heavily depending on the IL concentration in the inflow, with 6.1% and 10.4%
for 10 g/l, respectively 27% and 62.1% for 100 g/l.
Nanofiltration could also be an option for the Lyocell process as a normal cut-off value
is 500 g/mole. NMMO monohydrate would therefore to a large extent be able to
penetrate the membrane. The benefit of nanofiltration is that it generally has a very
high reject of multivalent ions. Moreover, it has a reject rate of lignin at 78-98%
(Weinwurm, Drljo and Friedl, 2015), and it would completely reject cellulose and
hemicellulose. The pore size for nanofiltration will probably be too small for a high
yield of solvent in the Lyocell process but would give a very pure permeate stream.
By combining membranes in series with the retentate stream as a feed for the following
stage, a high overall solvent yield might be achieved.
Another interesting possibility is to use flotation and filtration in series, which is what
Agarwala, Kanthale and Thakre (2019) conducted a study on. The study aimed to find
the optimal type of flocculant for treating spinbath water in a Lyocell process, which
also provided information on performance of filtration and ion exchange units. The
study found that a combination of flotation and filtration could increase total turbidity

25

removal from 41% (only filtration) to 94%. Moreover, it was found that the added help
of a flotation unit increased the performance of the ion exchange unit by 11%.

2.3.5.3 Ion exchange
The process water in the Lyocell process is concentrated with positively charged metal
ions (cations). To target positively charged ions a cation resin bed is used. A cation
resin bed already contains positively charged hydrogen ions that easily can be
substituted for free cations in the process water. The bed does not have to consist
entirely of cations, but can also include resins of opposite charge. A positively charged
and a negatively charged bed can of course be used in series if needed, but it is not
unusual to have packed beds with positively and negatively charged layers next to each
other. The resin can be either strongly charged or weakly charged, depending on the
targeted ion and its selectivity. The ion exchange-phenomenon can be described by the
following reactions.
𝑅− 𝐻+ + 𝐴+ → 𝑅− 𝐴+ + 𝐻 +
𝑅 + 𝑂𝐻 − + 𝐵 − → 𝑅+ 𝐵 − + 𝑂𝐻 −

Where 𝑅+ /𝑅− represent the charged resin and 𝐴+ /𝐵 − the free ions in the solution.
The resin bed has a specific operating capacity, which dictates how many free ions it
can attract before running out of charge and has to be regenerated. Regeneration is
done by backwash, meaning that the bed is washed in counter current to the normal
flow. First, the bed is filled with a flow of water, expanding the bed volume by 3040%, where after an electrolyte solution is injected to react with the collected ions.
Positively charged beds are washed with a base solution, to collect the anion captured
by the resin and regenerate an 𝑂𝐻 − group. Negatively charged resins are washed with
acids to remove cations and regenerate hydrogen ions. Potential suspended solids are
removed in the same backwash. The resin bed can serve as an absolute filter for
incoming solids, but it can have negative effects. Excess amount of stopped solids can
lead to clogging of the resin bed. Clogging can lead to a higher pressure drop, a
decrease in throughput, and cause channelling. The increased pressure caused by solids
in the bed can also lead to resins being destroyed by the force applied.

Literature review

Industrial ion exchange units can be designed as a column or a tank. The former can
be used for continuous processes, while the latter only can be utilised for batch
processes. The tank design is non-continuous because the resin is removed and washed
when it reaches saturation. The column can be designed either as a fluidised or fixed
bed. The latter utilises a downwards flow and acts as a stop for incoming suspended
solids. A fluidised bed has an upwards flow that will expand the bed, thus making it
easier for solids to enter and possibly exit the bed. A fluidised bed also promotes
channelling, which reduces general separation efficiency. A fluidised bed can in
general handle a flow with up to hundreds of ppm solids, while suspended solids
should be completely avoided for a packed bed (Rousseau, 1987).
The study of pulp components in resin beds is not a widely covered topic and general
information of behaviour of TSS and TDS in resin beds is hard to find. However, a
study of Wang et al. (2016) touched upon the subject of pulp components as they
studied the recovery of hemicellulose-derived saccharides by using lime and ion
exchange resins. Saccharide losses to the packed resin bed increased when more lime
was added, the losses varied between 5% and 25%. The variation was believed to be a
direct result of saccharide degradation due to the lime added. This could mean that
hemicelluloses can be assumed to behave as dissolved components, as suspended
solids in general seem to be stopped by a packed bed.
2.3.5.4 Evaporation
Evaporation is a separation method designed for concentrating non-volatile
compounds by vaporisation of volatile components in a liquid-system. Evaporators are
usually heated with steam and can operate at a wide range of temperature and pressure
conditions. Evaporators are always used in multiple stages if possible, as the pressure
and temperature profile can be optimised for a lower overall thermal duty. Lone
evaporators are only used if the feed is very low. Steam economy can further be
optimised by preheating the feed close to boiling point before entering the evaporator,
thus not wasting high energy steam on heating the feed without evaporation occurring.
Evaporators can be set in forward or backward feed. Where forward feed is a cocurrent flow of steam through the stages and backward feed is a counter-current flow.

Andreas Reipsar

Literature review

Evaporators exist in multiple types, but only two types are generally used in the
Lyocell process: thin-film and wiped-film evaporator. The thin-film evaporator has a
high capacity and is suitable for low viscosity solutions, as it is often designed with
multiple long and small vertical tubes where the liquid system flows along the inside
wall of the tube. The wiped-film evaporator is often designed as big hollow tubes with
rotating blades inside for better distribution and mixture of high viscosity solutions
against the walls. The two evaporators work well together, as the mixture viscosity
varies according to water content. The wiped-film design is used in the dissolution
stage where the viscosity is high, and the thin-film is mainly used in stages with lower
viscosity, for example in the solvent recovery step.

2.3.5.5 Liquid/Liquid-Extraction
Liquid/liquid-extraction (LLE) is generally used to extract a solute from a liquid
system by introducing the system to another liquid. Thus resulting in a two-phase
system in which the solute can migrate from one phase to the other. A pre-requisite for
this to work is that the liquids are immiscible, thus are two-phase systems composed
of an organic and a water phase widely used. The goal is to influence the system
equilibrium by changing pH, temperature and mixture-ratio, thus affecting what phase
the solute will prefer to stay in. The extent of the migration is dictated by the system
distribution ratio, which describes the relative amount of solvent in the two phases at
equilibrium. A general working principle can be seen in Figure 2-12.

Literature review

There are many alternatives regarding equipment for LLE, as the systems and
compounds can have very different requirements or characteristics. Density,
throughput, settling characteristics and number of stages required generally influence
the possibilities. LLE equipment often takes the shape of a modified column with more
or less complex way of working, designed for specific system characteristics. The most
general classification of LLE equipment is agitated static columns, pulsed columns
and agitated extractors.
The static columns operate by feeding the low-density phase in the bottom below a
sieve tray and the high-density phase at the top, and then let the fluids mix by the help
of gravity. Due to the tray, the bottom fluid will enter the column as dispersed droplets
and thereby increase the efficiency of mass transfer. The pulsed columns have the
same working principle, but the column is vertically moved at a specific interval,
resulting in more efficient phase mixing. Both column types can vary in filling and
inside design. Lastly, the agitated extractors consist of rotating disc columns and
mixer-settler, and they are designed to suppress vertical back mixing. Illustrations of
the static columns can be seen in Figure 2-13 (Mersmann, Kind and Stichlmair, 2011),
as well as rotating disc columns and a mixer settler Figure 2-14 (Mersmann, Kind and
Stichlmair, 2011).

LLE can be used for metal extractions and has been studied by Khoutoul et al. (2016),
where dichloromethane represented the organic phase and metal ions mixed in water
the aqueous phase. The results showed that no migration of Fe and Pb-ions from the
aqueous to the organic phase would occur if the system pH were below two.

3.1 Research objective
The objective of this thesis is to study the resulting accumulation of un-utilised pulp
components and inorganic compounds for five distinct solvent recovery concepts in a
Lyocell production process. A realistic model of the NMMO-based Lyocell process is
therefore created to obtain mass and energy balances for the process. The resulting
mass and energy balances are also used to determine the technical requirements for
each solvent recovery concept. The concepts are compared based on general process
complexity, solvent purity and thermal duty. Complexity is based on the number of
process steps and design parameters, as well as dependence on chemicals. The model
is created by using the steady-state simulation software Balas®.

3.2 Overall approach
The study follows a traditional case study-type analysis with the following steps:
1. Definition of concepts
2. Data gathering
3. Simulation model development and validation
4. Simulation of selected concepts
5. Sensitivity analysis
The solvent recovery rate is a key process variable from economic and environmental
perspectives. The recovery rate is fixed to 99% for all simulated concepts. This enables
a qualitative comparison between the concepts, as all process combinations have to
achieve the same result. The new concepts (later referred to as Concept 1, 2, 4, and 5)
are hypothetical as no actual process exist with these recovery configurations.
Therefore the results cannot be validated with real data. The concept representing the
industrially known NMMO configuration (later referred to as Concept 3) is used as
fixing point for water and energy consumption of the plant. This enables the

31

Andreas Reipsar

Method

comparison of new potential concepts with the industrial NMMO concept. The net
demand for water (8 litre/kg fibre) and energy (47.6 MJ/kg fibre) published by Lenzing
AG are used as design values for the industrial NMMO concept (Concept 3).
The solvent recovery step is modelled as a superstructure with four steps, where each
step provides certain technologies to use. This enables great versatility as the
technologies can be combined in many ways. Every step also has a bypass-option,
which means that the technologies in that step do not have to be used in every concept.
The superstructure could be subjected to optimization to obtain the most economical
or overall best performing combination, but this is not included in this work. A
simplified structure of the simulation model is illustrated in Figure 3-1.

Figure 3-1 Simplified structure of the simulation model.

3.3 Case study definition
The model represents a hypothetical process with a yearly production of 50,000 tonnes
Lyocell fibre. The process consists of pulp dissolution, regeneration, washing, drying
and solvent recovery. The five studied concepts for solvent recovery are: (1) ion
exchange and evaporation; (2) flotation, ion exchange and evaporation; (3) filtration,

32

Andreas Reipsar

Method

ion exchange and evaporation; (4) filtration and liquid/liquid-extraction with butanol;
and (5) filtration and liquid/liquid-extraction with dichloromethane. Each concept is
subjected to a technical analysis. Moreover, Concept 3 and 5 are subjected to a partial
sensitivity analysis.
The model is designed according to publicly available data found in literature, which
is presented in Chapter 2. However, modelling of the liquid/liquid-extraction units are
based on unpublished expert opinions. A more detailed description of overall model
implementation, parametrization, and structure can be found in Appendix A and
Appendix B. The characteristics of the simulation tool Balas® are presented in Chapter
3.4. Functionalities of the Balas® unit operations used in the model are not described
in depth.
Totally chlorine-free (TCF) hardwood prehydrolysis kraft (PHK) dissolving pulp is
used as raw material for each concept. The composition of the dissolving pulp follows
that reported by Blechschmidt et al. (2006): cellulose 96.3 wt%, hemicellulose 3.37
wt%, lignin 0.05 wt% and inorganics 0.1 wt%. The incoming pulp has a dry matter of
92% and the produced Lyocell fibre 88.5%. Two types of solvents are used in the
study. The considered solvent in Concept 1, 2, and 3 is NMMO. The considered
solvent in Concept 4 and 5 is a general non-volatile hydrophilic ionic liquid. Volatile
and hydrophobic solvents are thus not included in this model. The mass composition
of incoming make-up of NMMO is 86 wt% anhydrous NMMO and 14 wt% water. The
corresponding composition for incoming make-up ionic liquid is 99 wt% and 1wt%.
The incoming dissolving pulp is for all concepts mixed to a 50% consistency with
freshwater, after which solvent is added according to demand. The dissolution step is
modelled using three evaporation units with a co-current flow of steam and a
decreasing pressure profile (80kPa, 25kPa, 5kPa), the steam has a temperature of
150°C and a pressure of 450kPa. Excess water is evaporated until a mixture of 15%
pulp, 10% water, and 75% solvent is obtained. The spinning step is assumed to produce
a loss of solids (pulp) at 2%. Hemicelluloses lost in regeneration are assumed to take
the shape of low molecular weight hemicellulose at a rate of 50%, the rest is assumed
to be of high molecular weight. The former is considered to behave as dissolved solids,

33

Andreas Reipsar

Method

and the latter as suspended solids. Other solids lost in regeneration (cellulose, lignin,
etc.) are assumed to behave as suspended solids.
The regenerated fibre is washed by using a counter-current flow of water and the
amount of water needed is controlled by the washing efficiency. The Norden efficiency
factor was used to model the washing efficiency. The Norden efficiency factor is
derived from a hypothetical case where the factor is equivalent to the number of ideal
counter-current mixing stages in series. The factor two would thus represent two ideal
mixing stages in series. A factor of 1.3 is used for all concepts simulated. This specific
value is used because it was fitted for the model in order to obtain the same water and
steam demand as the process values published by Lenzing AG. The fibre is assumed
to have a water content of 70% when leaving the washing step. It is then dried to 11.5%
by using air with a temperature of 100°C.
The flotation unit is modelled with a reject ratio of 96% for suspended organic
compounds and 0% for dissolved organic compounds. A 10% reject is set for inorganic
components. The corresponding reject-% for filtration units are 100%, 0%, and 26%.
The ion exchange reject-% for suspended organics is 99.99%, for dissolved organics
5%, and for inorganics 95%. The ions captured by the resin bed are considered divalent
ions, which has an effect on the amount of resin required and the acid demand for
regenerating the bed. The evaporation units in solvent recovery step 4 are modelled
exactly as in the dissolution step. The LLE setup in recovery step 4 is modelled by
using two extraction units and two cascade evaporation units, the configuration is
illustrated in Figure 3-2. The first cascade evaporation unit is used for removing excess
water and the other for separating IL and organic solvents.

Figure 3-2 Process configuration for the LLE concept.
34

Andreas Reipsar

Method

Evaporation of organic solvents is set at a pressure profile of 100kPa, 15kPa, and
10kPa. The LLE units are assumed to operate with a reject of 99.99% for suspended
organics, dissolved organics, inorganics, and water. The extraction efficiency of ionic
liquid for butanol is assumed to 68%, and 75% for dichloromethane.
The wastewater produced in the process is assumed to be treated before discharge. A
water recovery rate of 80% is assumed, along with a purity rate of 100%. The
recovered water is recycled to the washing step. Furthermore, it is assumed that 0.5%
of the solvent used in the process is lost to the washed fibre. An additional 0.5% is lost
in Concept 1, 2, and 3 to NMMO degradation. The same additional amount is also lost
in Concept 4 and 5, but it is lost to the LLE reject stream instead. Thus, resulting in a
solvent recovery rate of 99% for all concepts.

3.4 Simulation tool - Balas®
Balas® is a steady-state simulation software mainly designed for chemical and paper
industry, but it is also usable in general process modelling. Steady-state simulation is
an approach to understand how an integrated system works as a whole and is often
used to predict how the process will react to changes. Simulation with Balas® is based
on two fundamentals: streams and units. Streams carry matter, energy and information,
while units modify what the streams carry. Streams can be connected to units, and the
user can specify stream properties or unit parameters.
Balas® provides significant databases of component alternatives, with specific
thermodynamic and chemical properties. It is also possible to create user defined
databases

and components,

which

enables

flexible modelling.

Dissolved

hemicellulose, NMMO and ionic liquids are examples of compounds that are defined
by the user in this study. An important aspect that is dismissed in this model because
of this is the miscibility of NMMO and IL in water. Evaporation can only be
realistically described if the compound interactions are known because they will affect
the vapour/liquid-equilibrium. This model will only give a realistic result if the
mentioned compounds do not have any interaction between each other. Balas® uses

35

Andreas Reipsar

Method

Redlich-Kwong-Soave for calculating vapour/liquid-equilibrium, with activity
coefficient provided by Reid, Prausnitz and Sherwood (1977). Moreover, solid woodbased model compounds in the Balas® database have their own specific heat
coefficient, which is calculated based on values from Paccot (1987).
In addition to basic process simulation Balas® can also be used for different process
design problems and process optimization. To do this the user can create specific
correlations in the model to describe specific phenomena, for example write a function
that describes chemical dosage for a reactor. Parameter functions and design
constraints are normally used for this. For increased user-friendliness, Balas® can be
linked to excel. Excel can serve as an interface for model parameterization and results
handling. Excel can also be used for measurement and process data pre-processing and
further result processing using more advanced correlations.

4 Results
The overall mass and energy balances are gathered in Appendix C, and calculations
for the technical analysis in Appendix D.

4.1 Concept 1
The first process concept uses an ion exchange resin bed and triple-effect evaporation
to remove organics, inorganics and water. The resulting mass flows can be seen in
Figure 4-1. The figure depicts water and solvent flows in kilogram per second, and the
organic and inorganic flows in gram per second.
The water stream leaving the regeneration and washing step has a solid organic
compound concentration of 435 ppm, a dissolved organic compound concentration of
16 ppm, and an inorganic concentration of 23 ppm. The theoretical resin bed charge
for capturing 95% of the incoming inorganics for 24 hours is 7891 eq, which equals a
resin bed volume of 7.3 m3. The effects that solid organic compounds or dissolved
organic compounds would have on the resin bed are not taken into account. For a 24hour operational period, the resin bed would need 590 kg of sulphuric acid (92 wt%)
to regenerate. Multiple resin beds would be needed, as the beds are taken out of usage
when being backwashed and regenerated.
The heat exchanging areas of the three evaporation units are approximated to 427 m2,
761 m2 and 1007 m2, from the first effect to the third. The steam demand for this
recovery concept is 1758 t/d. The amount of steam required for the dissolution step is
56.8 tonnes/day, and the heat exchanging areas for the evaporation units are
approximated to 15 m2, 17 m2 and 24 m2. The recovered solvent has a water content
of 14%, an organic concentration of 122 ppm, and an inorganic concentration of 9
ppm.

Results

To put the accumulated organic and inorganic mass flows into context, they are
compared to the raw material intake. The organic raw material intake is 1.43 kg/s, and
the inorganic 1.43 g/s. The accumulated organic content is equivalent to 0.07% of the
incoming organic raw material stream. The inorganic equivalence is 5.13%.

4.2 Concept 2
A flotation unit is used in Concept 2 to reduce the organic load of the ion exchange
unit. The corresponding histogram for the studied process streams can be seen in
Figure 4-2. The flotation unit efficiently removes solid organic components at a rate
of 96% and result in a load of 17 ppm for solid organics, 16 ppm for dissolved organics,
and 23 ppm for inorganics. The required bed volume for a 24-hour period is in that
case 7.2 m3 (~7916 eq) and requires 540 kg of sulphuric acid (92 wt%) to regenerate.
The dimensions of the flotation unit depend on the horizontal speed and needed
retention time. Design values of 5 m/h and 30 min require an area of 44.6 m2 and a
depth of 2.5 m. An air-to-solids ratio of 35 l/kg would result in an air demand of 92.7
m3/d. The steam demand for the dissolution step is the same as in Concept 1, but 1743
t/d for the recovery step. The corresponding heat exchange areas are 423 m2, 755 m2
and 998 m2. The recovered solvent in this concept has a water content of 14%, an

organic concentration of 120 ppm, and an inorganic concentration of 9 ppm. The

4.3 Concept 3
The flotation unit from Concept 2 is in this concept replaced by a filtration unit, to
further reduce the organic load of the resin bed. The resulting filtrate has a dissolved
organic concentration of 16 ppm and an inorganic concentration of 17 ppm.
The required membrane area for a specific flow varies with the flux through the
membrane. For a flow of 62 kg/s and a flux of 150 l/m2/h, the required membrane area
is 1488 m2. The area is equivalent to 37 spiral wound modules, with a module-specific
area of 41 m2. The steam demand and the corresponding heat exchange areas are the
same as in Concept 1. The sulphuric acid (92 wt%) demand for resin regeneration is
430 kg/d, and the resin bed volume is approximated to 5.3 m3 (~5864 eq). The
recovered solvent in Concept 3 has a water content of 14%, an organic concentration
of 122 ppm, and an inorganic concentration of 7 ppm. The organic equivalence to the
raw material intake is 0.07%, and the inorganic 3.77%.

4.4 Concept 4
The solvent recovery step in Concept 4 is composed of filtration and liquid/liquidextraction. As presented earlier, the LLE technology consists of two extraction units
and two triple-cascade evaporation units. The cascades are used for evaporating water
and organic solvents. The process data in Figure 4-4 shows that the recovered solvent
contains a dismissible amount of inorganics and pulp-derived organics, but a
noticeable amount of butanol.
The filtration unit requires the same membrane area as Concept 3. The resulting
packed bed dimensions for the first extraction unit is a height of 5.1 meter and a
diameter of 6.9 m. The corresponding dimensions for the second extraction bed is 4.7
m and 0.9 m. The steam demand for the dissolution step is 13.6 t/d and requires
evaporator areas of 4.4 m2, 0 m2 (not needed) and 9.3 m2. The evaporation units for
removal of water need heat exchange areas of 409 m2, 699 m2 and 736 m2. The
corresponding areas for evaporation of butanol are 652 m2, 187 m2 and 5628 m2. The
steam demand for water evaporation is 1692 t/d, and 1487 t/d for organic solvent
evaporation. The butanol demand is 33.2 t/d.

4.5 Concept 5
The organic solvent butanol is switched for dichloromethane in Concept 5. The amount
of organic solvent in the washwater stream is lower than in Concept 4, which means
that a higher percentage of the organic solvent is evaporated in the dissolution step.
This is because dichloromethane has a lower miscibility with water than butanol has.
However, because the amount of organic solvent in the washwater stream is lower than
in Concept 4, the feed of fresh organic solvent is higher in Concept 5. The
dichloromethane demand is therefore 31.4 t/d.
The filtration membrane area is the same as in Concept 3 and 4. The height of the first
extraction column is 2.6 m and the diameter 4.0 m. The second extraction unit require
a height of 2.3 m and a diameter of 0.5 m. The heat exchange areas for water removal
are 411 m2, 713 m2 and 736 m2. Likewise are the areas for organic solvent evaporation
45 m2, 107 m2 and 2531 m2. The respective steam demands for water and organic
solvent evaporation are 1707 t/d and 361 t/d. Evaporator areas and steam demand for
the dissolution step are the same as in Concept 4.

4.6 Summary
The results from the simulated concepts are summarised in this chapter by gathering
relevant information in three figures and one table.
The simulations for Concept 1, 2, and 3 result in very similar values for the recovered
solvent stream due to the efficient ion exchange unit. However, a notable difference
among these concepts is the organic load of the ion exchange unit. An overview of the
organic compound distribution is thus illustrated in Figure 4-6. 97.2% of the organic
load in Concept 1 is TSS and 2.8% TDS. The corresponding for Concept 2 is 75.5%
and 24.5%. The organic load of the ion exchange unit in Concept 3 is 100% TDS.
Concept 4 and 5 are not included in the figure, as the accumulated organic and
inorganic content is dismissible for both concepts. The technical requirements for each
solvent recovery concept are summarised in Table 4-1. Steam demand and freshwater
demand are illustrated in Figure 4-7 and Figure 4-8.

4.7 Sensitivity analysis
A complete sensitivity analysis of all model parameters is not included in the scope of
this work as it is deemed too vast of a task. However, after running several simulations,
it was noted which parameters impacted the results noticeably. Thus, eight parameters
are selected for a partial sensitivity analysis. Concept 3 is used to study the effect of
five parameters, and Concept 5 is used to study the remaining three parameters.
Concept 5 have to be used for three specific parameters because they are connected to
the performance of the LLE unit.
The parameters used for sensitivity analysis of Concept 3 are used to study steam and
freshwater demand, as well as organic and inorganic compound accumulation. The
impact of these five parameters are illustrated in Figure 4-9, Figure 4-10, Figure 4-11,
and Figure 4-12 by varying the parameter value by 50%. The parameters and their
base values are: 1) the Norden factor is 1.3, 2) the percentage of solids lost in fibre
regeneration is 2%, 3) 50% of the hemicellulose lost in fibre regeneration is considered
as dissolved components, 4) 5% of this dissolved hemicellulose is captured by the ion
exchange unit, 5) the inorganic leakage of the IX unit is 5%.

Concept 3.
The Norden factor appears to be the only parameter that affects the freshwater and
steam demand significantly. The accumulation of organic content is more sensitive to
relative changes in overall solids lost and how much hemicellulose acts as dissolved
compounds than how much hemicellulose is captured in the IX unit.
The parameters that are varied for Concept 5 all have an original parameter value of
0%. Their impacts are therefore studied by increasing the parameter values to 5% and
10%, and not by varying with 50%. The parameters affect steam demand, as well as
accumulation of inorganics and pulp-derived organics. Figure 4-13 illustrates what
happens to the steam demand when water is extracted by the organic phase in the LLE
unit. The steam demand clearly increases when small amounts of water migrate into
the organic phase. Figure 4-14 and Figure 4-15 illustrates the accumulation of pulpderived organics and inorganics when these compounds leak into the organic phase of
the LLE unit.

Results

The analysis for Concept 5 shows that steam demand increases if some amount of
water is extracted by the organic phase. Extraction of pulp-derived organics to the
organic phase shows a small increase in accumulation of pulp-derived organics, but
the amount is still smaller than for Concept 3. A more notable result on the other hand
is the major increase in accumulation of inorganics. The amount of inorganic content
in the recovered solvent after 5% leakage is equivalent to 44.2% of the raw material
intake inorganics. A leakage of 10% is equivalent to 67.3% of the raw material
inorganics.

Discussion and observations

5 Discussion and observations
The aim of this thesis was to study five solvent recovery concepts for the Lyocell
process and the resulting accumulation of process impurities in the recovered solvent.
Additionally, the solvent recovery concepts were also subjected to technical analyses
that proposed rough estimations of process equipment sizes. These results, in
combination with a sensitivity analysis, provided useful insight into the Lyocell
process and its behaviour. The concepts are assessed by comparing them to one
another based on recovered solvent purity, energy demand and overall complexity.
However, the studied concepts cannot be thoroughly compared before the results are
validated and an economic assessment is carried out.
The results show that the accumulation of organics and inorganics is small compared
to the amounts entering the process with the raw material, and that Concepts 1, 2, and
3 result in a very similar solvent purity level. The high purity level is a direct result of
the ion exchange unit, as it has a very high reject rate of both organic and inorganic
impurities. The low hemicellulose and inorganic content in dissolving pulp also
contribute to the low accumulations, as those are the compounds that are accumulating.
Cellulose will not accumulate because it behaves as suspended solids and can therefore
easily be removed from the recovered solvent. Hemicelluloses on the other hand can
to some extent behave as dissolved solids, and that makes them harder to eliminate.
Because of the very similar solvent purity and energy demand, the three first concepts
are only compared based on complexity and equipment load. Concept 1 only uses two
technologies, while Concept 2 and 3 both use three technologies. The organic load of
the ion exchange resin bed in Concept 1 is noticeably higher than for Concept 2 and
3. The proportion of TSS in Concept 1 and 2 is notable as suspended solids promote
clogging. Concept 3 is in that sense better than Concept 1 and 2, as the IX will run
smoother. The downside with Concept 3 is its vulnerability to fouling and the required
maintenance. Concept 2 does not require heavy maintenance but is instead dependent
on coagulants and flocculants to perform as planned.

50

Andreas Reipsar

Discussion and observations

Concept 4 and 5 result in a more pure solvent than Concept 1, 2, and 3. The inorganic
and pulp-derived organic content are almost dismissible. However, the recovered
solvent instead contains a significant amount of organic solvent. The LLE technology
used is deemed as very complex due to the uncertainties in mass transfer for organics
and inorganics in butanol/water and dichloromethane/water-mixtures. The separation
efficiencies rely heavily on overall mixture composition, and partly on influence of
pH. This makes the overall LLE efficiency hard to predict, as it relies on partly
unknown data at this moment in time. Dichloromethane is more volatile than butanol
thanks to its low vapour pressure, which results in a noticeably lower energy demand.
Butanol is also more flammable than dichloromethane. However, dichloromethane
have worse effects on human health.
The sensitivity analysis showed that freshwater and steam consumption are strongly
correlated to the Norden factor. This is quite logical as a lower number of washing
steps (higher Norden factor) and less time in contact with water have to be
compensated with higher amounts of freshwater. A higher amount of water in the
process also means that more water has to be evaporated in the solvent recovery step,
i.e. a higher steam demand. The analysis also revealed that the extraction efficiency of
inorganics in the LLE unit heavily influences the level of inorganic content in the
recovered ionic liquid. The analysis clearly showed that even a small leakage of 5%
of inorganics results in a relatively high amount of accumulated inorganic content in
the recovered solvent stream. The reason for this could be the LLE configuration used,
which operates by using an internal recycling loop. The loop returns about 90% of the
flow that exits the water evaporation step back to the inlet to recover more of the ionic
liquid, and thus promotes high accumulation within the LLE configuration.
The freshwater and energy demand for Concept 3 is 7.9 litre and 44.6 MJ per kg
produced fibre, which are fitted to Lenzing AG’s reported process values. The values
represent net demand. Because the internal process flows have not been reported, it is
not possible to fit or validate the simulation model values. The model water demand
is controlled by the efficiency of the wastewater treatment technology, which is set to
produce 100% pure water at an 80% recovery rate. A decrease in recovery rate would
result in higher freshwater demand, but the demand can be lowered again by increasing
the efficiency of the fibre washing step. Improving the washing efficiency can be done
51

Andreas Reipsar

Discussion and observations

by increasing the Norden factor. The overall freshwater demand can thus be controlled
by adjusting two process parameters. This means that the internal water balance cannot
be completely determined until the wastewater treatment technology is specified.
The steady-state simulations provided useful knowledge about the Lyocell process as
a complete process, which is the type of information that targeted equipment studies
are not able to provide. A downside with the model is that it does not take into account
in what way accumulated process impurities affect the final fibre quality. Moreover,
discolouration and water turbidity are not included in the model, as it requires further
knowledge about the process and residing compounds. The complexity of by-product
formation is also overlooked in the model, as it is generalised by only having two
model compounds that represent liquid and gas-phase degradation products. However,
the generalisation made in the model is justifiable, as the scope of this study did not
include detailed chemical interactions but merely overall process behaviour.
The results depict five process concepts that are very good at removing organic and
inorganic impurities from the recovered solvent. The Lyocell process is known for its
closed-loop configuration and efficient usage of solvent, which means that impurities
have to be efficiently removed, as they otherwise would have a negative impact on the
produced fibre. The results in this study could therefore be seen as plausible. However,
in order to obtain more accurate results, the values have to be validated by actual
process data or by targeted experimental studies. The results presented in this work
can act as a reference for other studies, and the technical analysis calculations can be
used for pre-engineering purposes.
There are still a few open questions regarding the Lyocell process that have to be
addressed before results of higher accuracy can be obtained. Information on the actual
performance of solvent recovery technologies and wastewater treatment is of high
interest, as it can have a significant effect on process water quality and accumulation
of impurities. Regeneration yield and the resulting spin bath composition are also of
particularly high interest for obtaining accurate process simulations. Vapour/liquidequilibrium for solvent/water-mixtures is also a necessity for obtaining an accurate
energy balance. Interaction between organic solvents and (in-)organic compounds also
have to be further studied.

Conclusions

6 Conclusions
The results showed that Concept 1, 2, and 3 generate very similar levels of
accumulated process impurities, and also that the levels in general are very low.
Concept 4 and 5 results in higher solvent purity rates than Concept 1, 2, and 3 but
assumptions concerning separation efficiencies of inorganics and pulp-derived
organics are uncertain. The sensitivity analysis showed that the LLE configuration can
promote relatively high accumulations of inorganic compounds at non-ideal
performance. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis also suggested that overall
consumption of freshwater and steam can be lowered by increasing the number of
washing stages in series (Norden).
Concept 2 has the lowest steam demand, followed by Concept 1, 3, 5, and 4. Concept
1 is considered least complex because it only uses two technologies, but it might not
be industrially feasible due to the organic load of the ion exchange unit. Concept 3 is
rated as the second least complex, followed by Concept 2. The latter is more complex
because of the extra chemistry that coagulation and flocculation add to the process.
Concept 4 and 5 are considered more complex than Concept 1, 2 and 3 because of
uncertainties in mass transfer of inorganic and pulp-derived organic compounds.
Concept 5 is deemed as more complex than Concept 4 because dichloromethane has
worse effects on human health than butanol. LLE has the potential to be utilised for
obtaining a very concentrated solvent (>99 wt%). A lower steam demand can
potentially be obtained if an organic solvent with lower vapor pressure is utilised. The
technology has to be further studied to be able to obtain more accurate results.
The choice of steady-state simulation as a tool for studying the Lyocell process
supported the objective of the study and provided results that increased understanding
about the Lyocell process. The study also identified the following knowledge gaps that
hindered more accurate results: fibre regeneration yield, wastewater treatment
performance, solvent/water-interaction, and molecular weight distribution of
regenerated pulp components - all of which were studied through sensitivity analysis.

Textilindustrin är i dagens läge en av världens största förorenare och den årliga globala
produktionen av fibrer antas bara växa i takt med ökad levnadsstandard och mängd
människor. Industrins inverkan på miljön har länge varit känd och 2007 frågades
globala

varför

de

inte

hållbara

produktionsmetoder. Den största anledningen var att konsumenterna inte är villiga att
betala högre priser för hållbarare produkter. Två andra populära svar var brist på
teknologiska innovationer och ekonomiskt hållbara affärskoncept. För att reducera
textilindustrins miljöavtryck behövs därför nya och effektiva processkoncept som i
synnerhet minskar på vatten-, kemikalie- och markanvändning.
Textilfibrer kan delas in i två grupper och fyra undergrupper. Den första gruppen
består av naturfibrer, som kan delas i undergrupperna djurfiber och växtfiber. Till
naturfiber hör t.ex. bomull, ull och silke. Den andra gruppen benämns konstfiber, som
kan delas in i syntetfiber och regenatfiber. Skillnaden mellan naturfiber och konstfiber
är att naturfiber direkt är färdiga fibrer som kan användas i textiler, medan konstfiber
artificiellt måste förädlas för att kunna användas. Till syntetiska fiber används ofta
råolja som råmaterial, medan regenatfiber ofta består av naturliga material som
cellulosa. Regenatfiber är alltså bionedbrytbara, men klassas inte som naturfiber
eftersom regenatfiber måste genomgå en förädlingsprocess innan de kan användas till
textiler. Detta för att fibrerna måste frigöras från materialet, vilket inte är fallet för
naturfibrer som direkt kan användas.
En väldigt känd typ av regenatfiber är RayonTM, produceras enligt viskosprocessen. I
viskosprocessen använder man natriumhydroxid och koldisulfid för upplösning av
cellulosa. Problemet här ligger dock i kemikalieåtervinningen, där koldisulfid och
svavelväte är svårhanterliga. Under slutet av 1900-talet, efter att viskosfiber redan
existerat i nästan 100 år, uppfanns en ny typ av regenatfiber som kallas Lyocell.
Lyocellfibern är också cellulosabaserad, men använder sig istället av en organisk
aminoxid (NMMO) eller en jonisk vätska som lösningsmedel. Fördelen med Lyocell
är att man kan ta tillvara upp till 99 % av lösningsmedlet genom att rena processvattnet,
detta har dock bara bevisats för konfigurationer med NMMO.
54

Andreas Reipsar

Swedish summary - Svensk sammanfattning

NMMO uppvisar dock instabilitet vid högre temperaturer, som t.ex. kan leda till
explosivitet eller formation av kemiska biprodukter. Därför har man i allt större mån
börjat undersöka joniska vätskors lämplighet som lösningsmedel. En omfattande
undersökning av joniska vätskors löslighet har gjorts av Mäki-Arvela et al. (2010) där
flera joniska vätskor konstaterades besitta god löslighet. För en god löslighet krävs att
lösningsmedlets molekyler effektivt kan bryta cellulosamolekylernas intermolekylära
bindningar. Bindningarna kan brytas genom att få vätemolekylerna att binda sig med
lösningsmedlet istället för cellulosa.
I Lyocell-processen används dissolvingmassa som råmaterial. Dissolvingmassa har i
normala fall en väldigt hög halt av cellulosa (>90%), samt låga halter av hemicellulosa
(>5%), lignin (>1%) och oorganiska ämnen (>0.1%). Dissolvingmassa produceras
genom att justera innehållet för pappersmassa till de tidigare nämnda gränserna.
Därutöver justeras också dissolvingmassans gränsviskositet till en lägre nivå, kring
400-500 mL/g. Viskositeten justeras för att lösningen ska kunna extruderas till trådar
utan att deformeras eller gå av. Den inkommande dissolvingmassan blandas med
vatten och blir därefter riven till en finfördelad lösning. Lösningen pumpas därefter
vidare till en avdunstningskolonn där lösningsmedel tillsätts och överflödigt vatten
avdunstar. Lösningen pumpas vidare till en spinneret, som kan beskrivas som ett
duschhuvud med många små hål som lösningen pumpas igenom. Trådarna som formas
dras direkt ner i ett vattenbad för regenerering. Regenerering betyder i praktiken att de
intermolekylära vätebindningarna återuppstår mellan cellulosamolekylerna. Detta
händer för att lösningsmedlen föredrar att binda sig med vatten framom cellulosa.
Fibern utsätts därefter för ett längre tvättsteg genom att långsamt dras motströms
igenom ett stort vattenbad. Lösningsmedlet separeras genom detta från fibern. Vattnet
i badet pumpas kontinuerligt bort för att behandlas, samtidigt som färskvatten fylls på
för att upprätthålla vattenmängden. När fibrerna är rena, torkas det överflödiga vattnet
i fibrerna bort med hjälp av torkcylindrar. Den färdiga fibern kan vid behov färgas
eller kemiskt behandlas för att uppnå önskade materialegenskaper.
För tillfället är det endast företaget Lenzing som tillverkar Lyocell, dock under det
kommersiella namnet TencellTM. Processtegen är allmänt kända, men alla detaljer och
processparametrar har dock inte blivit offentligt publicerade. Målet med denna
avhandling är därför att undersöka potentiella koncept för återvinning av NMMO eller

joniska vätskor, för produktion av Lyocellfibrer. Återvinningsmetoderna består av
olika kombinationer av allmänna separationsteknologier som flotation, filtration,
jonbyte och avdunstning. För att kunna utföra denna typ av utvärdering måste en
simuleringsmodell för lyocellprocessen skapas. Modellen skapas med hjälp av
simuleringsverktyget Balas®, som opererar i fortfarighetstillstånd (steady-state).
Balas® använder Redlich-Kwong-Soave för att beskriva vätskors och gasers
termodynamiska beteenden med aktivitetskoefficienter från Reid, Prausnitz and
Sherwood (1977). Fasta ämnens termodynamiska egenskaper räknas med hjälp av
Paccot (1987). För parametrisering av modellen används publicerade värden för
Lyocell processen, okända värden approximeras med hjälp av studier som tangerar
tillämpningsområdet. En känslighetsanalys utförs också för att se hur modellen
reagerar på förändringar i parametriseringen.
Simuleringsmodellen används för att undersöka fem utvalda processkoncept.
Koncepten skiljer sig från varandra endast när det gäller metoden för tillvaratagning
av lösningsmedlet, dvs. produktionen av fibrer bibehålls oförändrad. De fem
koncepten består av följande kombinationer av separationsteknologier: (1) jonbyte och
avdunstning; (2) flotation, jonbyte och avdunstning; (3) filtration, jonbyte och
avdunstning; (4) filtration och vätske-vätske extraktion med butanol; och (5) filtration
och vätske-vätske extraktion med diklormetan. En heltäckande evaluering av
koncepten kan inte göras förrän mass- och energibalanserna är validerade av
processdata och en tekno-ekonomisk analys har blivit gjord. Koncepten kan dock
jämföras med varandra på basis av det tillvaratagna lösningsmedlets renhetsgrad,
sammanlagt energibehov och generell komplexitet. Komplexitetsgrad definieras enligt
omfattning av kemiska fenomen, toxicitetsgrad, samt antal processteg och design
parametrar. För att alla fem koncept ska vara jämförbara ställs koncepten in så att 99%
av lösningsmedlet tas tillvara i processen. Konceptens teknologiska förutsättningar
kan då jämföras med varandra eftersom tillvaratagningen alltid är lika effektiv.
Koncept 1 bedöms vara minst komplex, eftersom det bara baserar sig på två
processteg. Koncept 3 anses vara näst i tur, följt av 2, 4 och 5. Koncept 2 är mer
komplext än koncept 3 för att flotation är en teknologi som kräver kemikalier för att
fungera, vilket filtrationen i koncept 3 inte behöver. Koncept 4 och 5 anses vara mer
komplexa än koncept 1, 2 och 3, eftersom teknologin är totalt oprövad för Lyocell
56

Andreas Reipsar

Swedish summary - Svensk sammanfattning

sammanhanget. Koncept 4 och 5 baserar sig därför på delvis okänd kemi och ökar
därför osäkerheten kring resultatet. Vätske-vätske extraktionen kan påverkas av både
pH-värde och flödesinnehållet i de inkommande strömmarna, vilket gör teknologin
svårare att reglera. Koncept 4 anses vara mindre komplext än koncept 5 för att
diklormetan är mer skadligt för människor, vilket ökar riskfaktorn. Butanol är dock
mer brandfarligt och kräver mer energi för att förångas. Koncept 2 har lägst
energibehov, följt av 3, 1, 5 och 4. Koncept 1, 2 och 3 har snarlika resultat gällande
lösningsmedlets renhetsgrad. Det beror på att hartskolonnen som används för jonbyte
är väldigt effektiv på att separera både organiska och oorganiska ämnen. Koncept 4
och 5 kan uppnå en renhetsgrad med nästan obetydliga nivåer av oorganiska ämnen
och träbaserade organiska ämnen. Koncept 4 och 5 innehåller dock 1% organiskt
lösningsmedel och det är oklart hur den mängden påverkar resten av processen. Det
tillvaratagna lösningsmedlet i koncept 1, 2 och 3 har ett vatteninnehåll på 14%, medan
det i koncept 4 och 5 inte innehåller vatten alls.
De simulerade resultaten för koncept 3 är 7,9 liter vatten och 44,6 MJ per kg fiber,
vilket är i linje med Lenzing AGs rapporterade värden. Värdena representerar dock
nettobehovet för modellen som helhet, vilket betyder att endast den externa vattenoch energibalans kan valideras. Mer information om processen behövs därför för att
kunna validera interna procesströmmar. I synnerhet behövs information om
materialförluster vid regenereringen av fibrerna och gas-vätska jämviktskurvor för
vattenlösningar av joniska vätskor eller NMMO. Utöver detta är det också viktigt att
veta hur mycket av avfallsvattnet som kan renas och återanvändas, samt dess
renhetsgrad. Dessa faktorer skulle då ge en bra helhetsbild av de interna
massbalanserna, samt ett trovärdigt energibehov. Därutöver vore det också viktigt att
undersöka om de ackumulerade organiska ämnen kan återanvändas till fibrer när dom
följer med lösningsmedlet tillbaka till upplösningssteget. Om ämnenas kemiska
tillstånd och struktur har ändrat kan det tänkas påverka deras förmåga att på nytt binda
sig till cellulosakedjor.

Fibre production
The incoming pulp mass flow is used as a design variable to reach a set production
speed, which is specified in a design constraint. The raw material pulp composition
and water content can be modified by the user, but the inorganic compounds are not
individually specified. Instead are all inorganic compounds modelled as one
homogenous compound.
Dissolution
Because dissolution conditions can vary when using different solvents, the user must
specify the pulp/solvent/water-composition for when dissolution occurs. Complete
dissolution of all pulp components is assumed, but the user can specify a lower
dissolution rate than 100% if needed. A filter unit after the evaporators will in that case
stop the solid components. It is also possible to specify a certain percentage of solvent
that will degrade to by-products. Alias components are created for both solvent and

degraded solvent as they do not exist in the Balas® database. The solvent dosage for
the dissolution step is controlled by a control-valve and the parameter function
𝑚̇𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡,𝑖𝑛 =

𝑋𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡,%
∙ 𝑚̇𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑝,𝑖𝑛
𝑋𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑝,%

After the solvent is added, excess water is evaporated until the specified mixture is
reached. A design constraint is used to find the correct water content 𝑋𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟,% .
𝑚̇𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟,𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑝,𝑜𝑢𝑡
−1 =0
𝑋𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟,% ∙ 𝑚̇𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑝,𝑜𝑢𝑡
The mass flow of steam is used as a design variable. A higher mass flow of steam will
evaporate more water and thus lower the water content in the mixture. A three-stage
cascade evaporation was chosen in this step to ensure a good steam economy. The
three evaporators were set at decreasing pressure profile and with a co-current flow of
steam. The steam is set to 150°C and 4.5 bar, which are normal values for low pressure
steam in the pulp industry.

Spinning and regeneration
Heat and mass transfer are essential when modelling the spinning and washing stages.
Heat transfer is important because the temperature plays a vital role in fibre
regeneration and mass transfer affects solvent diffusion and pulp losses to the process
water. Heat transfer between the dope and a big mass of water is configured by mixing
two streams (red and green), as shown in Figure A-1.

64

Andreas Reipsar

Appendix A

Figure A-1 Process configuration of fibre regeneration in the model. Red stream
represents fibre; green represents washing water, and blue represents water free from
impurities. The cooling unit is followed by two separation units, which are used to
describe compound losses in occurrence with fibre regeneration.
A parameter function is created for the control-valve connected to the process water
(green stream). The function contains a user-specified fibre-to-water ratio
𝑋𝐹𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑒 / 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 to calculate the flux of the process water mixed with the incoming dope
(red stream).
𝑚̇𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟,𝑏𝑎𝑡ℎ = 𝑋𝐹𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑒 / 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ∙ 𝑚̇𝐹𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑒
The temperature of the process water is set by the user and controlled via a design
constraint.
𝑇𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟
−1=0
𝑇𝐵𝑎𝑡ℎ
The flux of cooling water (blue stream) is used as a design variable for this constraint.
The mass transfer concerning pulp losses is connected to the solid/liquid-separation
unit in Figure A-1. The losses are assumed to 2% and will affect all pulp components
equally. The components lost are assumed to 100% regenerate into solid compounds,
apart from hemicellulose. Hemicellulose can be described as low and high molecular
weight hemicellulose when they are dissolved, but only high weight hemicellulose is
assumed to be regenerated into solid compounds. The low weight compounds are
therefore only accumulating in the loops and not contributing to fibre production. Out
of the hemicellulose lost in fibre regeneration, 50% is assumed to behave as low weight
hemicellulose. The rest of the hemicelluloses are assumed to stay as solids.

65

Appendix A

Regeneration of pulp components from a dissolved state to solid is specified by using
a reactor unit.
Washing and drying
The challenge with modelling the washing step is that the specific freshwater demand
per kg dope is unknown. Furthermore, the mass fraction of un-diffused solvent left in
the washed fibre is also unknown. These two aspects therefore have to be userspecified, because a general assumption cannot be assumed for all fibre and solvent
types. The water bath is modelled by using the Norden efficiency factor. The Norden
efficiency factor is derived from a hypothetical case where the number used is
equivalent to the number of ideal counter-current mixing stages in series. The amount
of solvent left in the fibre Xsolvent is used to create a design constraint
𝑚̇𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡,𝑤𝑒𝑡 𝑓𝑖𝑏𝑒𝑟
−1 = 0
𝑋𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡 ∙ 𝑚̇𝑤𝑒𝑡 𝑓𝑖𝑏𝑒𝑟
A solvent amount of 0.5% is assumed to be lost in this stage. The design variable used
for this constraint is the valve that controls the counter-current flow of freshwater. The
counter-current flow can be also be adjusted by changing the Norden efficiency factor.
This gives the model excellent flexibility for describing scenarios with both better and
worse washing efficiencies. The results presented in Chapter 4 are simulated with an
efficiency factor of 1.3. The wet fibre is assumed to have a dry content of 30% when
leaving the bath, after which it is dried to 88.5%. The fibre is dried by using air
flotation dryer, which is a Balas® built-in unit operation.

Solvent recovery
To enable smoother transition between the chosen solvent recovery concepts a partial
superstructure was created for the recovery step. A partial superstructure comprises of
multiple steps, where every step offers selected separation technologies to treat the
incoming flow. The separation technologies are placed parallel to each other in every
step and the user can then choose which technology to use. This is steered via Excel
and a user-friendly logic table. An example of a superstructure step can be seen in
Figure A-2.
66

Andreas Reipsar

Appendix A

Figure A-2 Example of a separation step in the superstructure.
Splitters are placed after every outlet streams of every unit and the splitters are
connected to the superstructure logic table. The splitters are modelled to let the mass
flow through to the next step if the unit is in use but will stop the flow if the unit is not
in use. The created Lyocell model has four steps in the superstructure with the
following set-up (1) flotation and filtration; (2) flotation and filtration; (3) ion
exchange; (4) evaporation and liquid/liquid-extraction. Furthermore, all steps have the
option of letting the flow through without any treatment. This is also controlled from
the logic table and is based on the same splitter-technique as for the separation units.
The superstructure strategy is the most flexible alternative for the model and the user
when comparing multiple concepts. All separation parameters presented in this chapter
are derived from the information presented in Chapter 2.

Flotation
Flotation exists as a simple separation module in Balas® with the possibility to specify
reject consistency and component separation efficiency. The flotation unit works
because of the principle that density for aqueous NMMO is higher than for pure water.
This means that pure water and flotation rejects can be gathered at the surface of a
flotation unit, from where they can be removed. Thus, resulting in a pure aqueous
NMMO stream leaving the flotation unit from the bottom of the tank. The process
parameters for the flotation unit can be found in Table A-3. Reject efficiencies for the
organic compounds are based on the values presented in Chapter 2.3.5.1. The ion
rejection rate is based on the assumption that the coagulants and flocculants will
capture a small amount of ions.

2.3.5.1. Compound-% describes the amount removed from the feed stream

Filtration
The working principle of filtration units in Balas® is that they automatically separate
all solid substances. Dissolved and aqueous compounds are assumed to completely
flow through the membrane, if not specified otherwise. Ultrafiltration is chosen as the
technology used in this model. Nanofiltration was deemed to not be able to reach the
needed solvent recovery rate, as for microfiltration it was assumed that not enough
organic matter would be removed. The filtration unit is set to separate a certain
percentage of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, free ions and solvent according to
values found in Table A-4.

Ion exchange
Realistic modelling of a resin bed is challenging, as all ions must be defined in the
model. The ion exchange is therefore only described as a simple separation unit with
a user-defined general separation efficiency for all inorganic compounds. The resin
bed is assumed to operate as a filter, thereby stopping all solids. Dissolved components
are assumed to be captured at a user-specified rate.
Because the bed will lose its electrical charge at some point, it has to be regenerated.
The acid demand is described by using the ideal reaction
𝑅− 𝐻+ + 𝐴+ → 𝑅 − 𝐴+ + 𝐻 +
meaning that the same charge used for capturing a free ion must be used to regenerate
the resin. Acid or base is therefore added until all ions are obtained. Regeneration time
for a resin bed depends on the size of the bed, i.e. its operating capacity. For ideal
regeneration in a theoretical case, the acid or base should provide enough charge to at
least match the level of the operating capacity. A resin bed will start to let ions through
when the operating capacity reaches zero, i.e. when the bed reaches a neutral charge.

Evaporation
The evaporation step is set to operate equivalently to the dissolution step, with three
stages, a dropping pressure profile and co-current flow of steam. An equivalent design

𝑋𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟,% ∙ 𝑚̇𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑝,𝑜𝑢𝑡
and the incoming mass flow of steam is used as a design variable. Process parameters

Liquid/Liquid-extraction
The LLE is modelled in two steps because both water and organic solvent has to be
removed. Organic solvent is added before both LLE steps, which are modelled as
simple separation units. The LLE units are set to separate the organic solvent at 100%
efficiency and the solvent at a user-specified extraction efficiency. The organic solvent
dosage is steered by a control-valve with the following parameter function
𝑚̇𝑂𝑟𝑔.,𝑖𝑛 =

𝑋𝑂𝑟𝑔.1,%
𝑋𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑐.𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟,%

∙ 𝑚̇𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑐.𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟

where 𝑋𝑂𝑟𝑔.,% and 𝑋𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑐.𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟,% are user-specified mixture ratios of organic solvent
and process water in the LLE unit. The process configuration can be seen in Figure
A-3.

70

Andreas Reipsar

Appendix A

Figure A-3 Process configuration for the LLE concept.
The flow of process water recycled back to LLE 1 after evaporation 1 is governed by
a splitter, which can divide the flow into two streams. The splitter operates at values
between zero and one, where one means that everything is recycled to LLE 1. The
splitter value is set by the following parameter function
𝑋𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠,%
∙ 𝑚̇𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡,𝐿𝐿𝐸 1,𝑖𝑛
100 − 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡,%
𝑆𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟 = 1 −
𝑚̇𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡,𝐿𝐿𝐸 2,𝑖𝑛
Where 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡,% stands for extraction efficiency and 𝑋𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠,% for solvent
losses to the wastewater, both values are user-specified. Evaporation 1 and 2 have the
same set-up as the other evaporators in the model and are controlled by the following
design constraints
𝑚̇𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟,𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑝 1,𝑜𝑢𝑡
−1=0
𝑋𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟,% ∙ 𝑚̇𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑝 1,𝑜𝑢𝑡
𝑚̇𝑂𝑟𝑔.,𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑝 2,𝑜𝑢𝑡
−1=0
𝑋𝑂𝑟𝑔.2,% ∙ 𝑚̇𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑝 2,𝑜𝑢𝑡
Incoming mass flows of steam are used as design variables for these constraints. Solid
components, dissolved components, and inorganics are all assumed to migrate into the
organic phase at a dismissible low rate (=0.0001%). The components are assumed to
stay in the aqueous phase because they have a higher density than the organic solvent.
This in accordance with the principles of an LLE unit as high density compounds will
move downwards and light compounds upwards. The impacts of overall mixture
composition and pH are not taken into account because of great uncertainty. All
parameters can be found in Table A-7.

Flotation
The surface area of the flotation unit can be calculated from the following equation
𝐴𝑆𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎

𝑄̇ [𝑚3 /ℎ]
[𝑚 ] =
𝑣𝑡 [𝑚/ℎ]
2

Where 𝑣𝑡 is the vertical rise speed of suspended solids and 𝑄̇ is the total flowrate. The
equation can be used in combination with the next one to obtain depth and retention
time for the flotation unit
𝑣 𝑇 [𝑚/ℎ] =

𝐷𝑒𝑝𝑡ℎ [𝑚]
𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 [ℎ]

Common design values for flotation units are 3-8 [m/h], which would give the
following result for retention at 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 90 minutes. An incoming
mass flow of 65 kg/s is used as a design value.

Membrane area required for a specific flow is given by the following general equation,
which is based on the flux through the membrane
𝐴𝑀𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑒 [𝑚2 ] =

Spiral-wound modules have a standard membrane area of 41m2, which means that the
number of filtration modules needed can be calculated. Common flux values for
ultrafiltration units at 15-150 [l/m2/h] are used to approximate the area. An incoming
mass flow of 65 kg/s is used as a design value.

Ion exchange
The operating capacity of a resin is expressed as equivalents per litre resin (eq/l), which
the incoming inorganic flow has to be converted to. Equivalent is a unit and it
corresponds to mole per valence of the incoming flow. The incoming flow can be
converted by using the following formula
𝑒𝑞 =

m [g] ∙ ion valence number
M [g/mole]

The size of the resin bed is dictated by the operating time and resin capacity per litre.
When the amount of equivalents in the incoming flow is known, it can be used to
calculate the corresponding equivalents capacity for the resin bed. The molecular
weight and ion valence number are calculated based on the distribution of ions in PHK
TCF dissolving pulp according to Blechschmidt et al. (2006) (see Table D-2).

Evaporation
The evaporator unit areas are approximated by using the following equation
𝐴𝐸𝑣𝑎𝑝 =

𝑄̇
𝑈Δ𝑇

Where U is overall heat transfer coefficient for the evaporator, 𝑄̇ is heat flux required
for evaporating a specific amount of incoming liquid and Δ𝑇 is the temperature
difference between incoming and outgoing vapour.
More accurate results can be obtained by describing heat and mass transfer in detail,
but these types of approximations require more extensive calculations (Lopez-Toledo,
2006). Because detailed equipment design is not a central topic of this thesis, the more
simple approach is opted for. The results are found in Table D-4.

Liquid/Liquid-extraction
The liquid/liquid-extraction equipment is assumed to operate as a packed bed. The
design procedure for this type of equipment is taken from Couper, Penney and Fair
(2012).
A packed bed operates by utilizing two immiscible liquids with different densities. The
lighter of the two phases is injected from the bottom of the bed and is dispersed into
droplets before starting to ascend to the top. The heavier phase enters from the top of
the column from where it flows down through the packing material and interacts with
the dispersed phase. Both the dispersed and the continuous phase have to be described
to obtain the dimensions of a packed bed. The dispersed phase is described by the size
of its droplets and their velocity. The size of the droplets can be described by the Sauter
mean drop diameter, which is calculated by the following equation
𝑑𝑣𝑠 = 1.15 ∙ 𝑛 ∙ √

𝜎
g ∙ Δ𝜌

Where 𝑛 = 1.0 if mass transfer occurs from the continuous phase to the dispersed
phase, and 𝑛 = 1.4 for the opposite. Gravity is denoted by g, the interfacial tension is
represented by 𝜎, and the difference in density by Δ𝜌. The drop diameter can be used
to calculate the characteristic drop velocity according to
𝑈𝑠𝑜 =

𝑁𝑅𝐸 ∙ 𝜇𝑐
𝑑𝑣𝑠 ∙ 𝜌𝑐

Where 𝜇𝑐 represents the viscosity of the dispersed phase and 𝜌𝑐 is the density of the
dispersed phase. The Reynolds number 𝑁𝑅𝐸 is calculated by
𝑁𝑅𝐸 = (0.94 ∙ 𝐻 0.757 − 0.857) ∙ 𝑃 0.149
when 𝐻 ≤ 59.3, or
𝑁𝑅𝐸 = (3.42 ∙ 𝐻 0.441 − 0.857) ∙ 𝑃 0.149
when 𝐻 > 59.3. The dimensionless numbers 𝑃 and 𝐻 are obtained by using the two
following formulas
𝑃=
𝐻=(

𝜌𝑐 2 ∙ 𝜎 3
𝜇𝑐 4 ∙ g ∙ Δ𝜌

Where 𝜇𝑤 is a reference value for viscosity (0.009 P). The resulting drop velocity 𝑈𝑠𝑜
is then used to obtain the flooding velocity 𝑈𝑐𝑓 from

Where 𝜀 denotes porosity, 𝑎𝑝 is the specific surface area of the packing material, and
𝜁 is a dimensionless coefficient. The volumetric flows are expressed as 𝑄̇𝑐 and 𝑄̇𝑑 .
The flooding velocity is used as a reference point to determine the superficial velocity
𝑈𝑐 of the continuous phase. The velocity is used as a design value for the bed and is
obtained by multiplying the flooding velocity with a certain factor
𝑈𝑐 = 𝑥𝑓 ∙ 𝑈𝑐𝑓
The factor is denoted by 𝑥𝑓 and would for example be 0.6 when designing for 60% of
flood. The superficial velocity is required for calculating the area of the bed and bed
diameter, which is done by
𝐴𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 =

𝐷𝐵𝑒𝑑 = √

𝑄̇𝑐
𝑈𝑐

4 ∙ 𝐴𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠
𝜋

The height of the packed tower 𝐻 is calculated from the following formula
𝐻𝐵𝑒𝑑 = 𝑁𝑡 ∙ 𝐻𝐸𝑃𝑇
Where 𝐻𝐸𝑇𝑃 is the theoretical plate height and 𝑁𝑡 is the number of theoretical plates.
The theoretical plate height is calculated by
𝐻𝐸𝑇𝑃 = 𝑓1 + 𝑓2
Where 𝑓1 and 𝑓2 are defined as
𝑈𝑐 0.8

𝑓1 = 𝐴 ∙ 𝐵 ∙ ( ) ∙ ( 𝑎

The symbols A, B and C are dimensionless constants. D stands for bed diameter, and
𝑍𝑝 for the packed height between redistributors. The superficial velocity of the
