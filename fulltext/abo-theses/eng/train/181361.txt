Abstract:
The Covid-19 pandemic changed the whole world in 2020. The amount of information about
Covid-19 increased explosively in the spring of 2020, affecting people's information
behaviour. The increased use of social media has changed information behaviour as well,
and this study focuses on social media use and information behaviour during the Covid-19
pandemic.
This master's thesis studies if people seek information about the Covid-19 pandemic from
social media and how they cope with the large amount of information. The aspect of
information overload and information avoiding is also studied.
The data for this master's thesis were gathered in the spring of 2020 from March to May,
and the survey was conducted by the subject of information studies at Åbo Akademi
University. This study is conducted using a mixed study method, as it includes both
quantitative and qualitative aspects. Furthermore, two different age groups are studied:
people born in the 1960s and before that representing digital immigrants and people born in
the 1980s and after that representing digital natives.
The theoretical framework for this master's thesis is based on three main themes: the theory
of digital immigrants and digital natives, the theory of information overload and the theory
of monitoring and blunting. First, the theory about digital immigrants and digital natives is
used to compare two different age groups. Second, the theory about information overload
gives insight into how people cope with such a large amount of information. Third, the
theory about monitoring and blunting offers insights regarding how people react to
information during the crisis situation.
The results of this thesis indicated that almost half of the survey participants use social
media as a source of information, and over half of the participants experience information
overload. Significant differences between digital natives and digital immigrants could not
be found, even though digital natives used social media slightly more than digital
immigrants and digital immigrants experienced information overload somewhat more than
digital natives.

1. INTRODUCTION
During the past year, the focus of our everyday flow of information has undergone
profound changes. The global pandemic Covid-19 has changed the information we see
every day to be constantly more about the pandemic. Social media constitute a universal
place to share information fast and lately they have been filled with information about
Covid-19. The large amount of information in different channels has affected people’s
information behaviour (Dreisiebner et al., 2020). During the year of 2020, a good deal of
research about the impacts of information related to Covid-19 has been implemented, for
example, by Nielsen et al., (2020), by Dreisiebner et al. (2020) and by Hong & Kim
(2020). However, the situation with Covid-19 is still evolving (World Health
Organization, 2020). The present study examines if people use social media as a source
of information about the Covid-19 pandemic and how people cope with the large amount
of Covid-19 -related information.

1.1. Background
Everyday life all around the world changed drastically in March 2020, when the WHO
declared that Covid-19 is a global pandemic. In Finland, the government also declared an
emergency powers act to be in effect because of the global pandemic. The amount of
information on the issue increased remarkably in March 2020 and still plenty of new
information is available about the corona-virus pandemic every day.
To determine the world and the risks associated with living in it, our modern culture and
community rely increasingly on written and verbal messages on a daily basis. Such
messages do more than just provide data; they may cause large numbers of individuals to
act in certain ways and change their views of the world around them (Walaski, 2011, p.
2). One of the risks is global pandemics, which cause a situation that requires good
communicating of the information. The information behaviour of people can vary
considerably due to different circumstances and human information behaviour has been
studied widely, for example, by Tom Wilson (Wilson, 2000). The importance of studying

6

Eeva Virtanen 2021

human information behaviour is highlighted in new situations such as global pandemics
and this further motivated the subject of this master’s thesis study.
Risk and crisis communication is a mechanism by which a public or private entity
communicates information to an audience. Usually, the information is shared following
a structured or informal risk evaluation process that delineates risks that may occur and
involves some degree of awareness imparted to the audience about how the risks will
affect them and how they can plan for the risk (Walaski, 2011, p. 2).
However, the modern world allows anyone to share information through the Internet and
social media channels are a common way to share it. This has affected the quality and
amount of information we see every day. Internet plays a key role in information
searching in today’s world (Nazim, 2008). By browsing the Internet, the information
about the Covid-19 pandemic is continuous and it is difficult to avoid seeing information
about the global pandemic.
People have a natural need for information, but their information behaviour might vary
greatly in a time of crisis. Information in crisis situations and large amounts of
information might cause information overload and that can lead to feelings of anxiety and
feeling overwhelmed (Gorman & Gorman, 2020). Since the amount of information about
Covid-19 exploded, how people experience the amount of information has been studied
widely. For instance, Dreisiebner et al. studied the information behaviour during the
Covid-19 crisis (Dreisiebner et al., 2020), whereas Hong & Kim studied antecedents and
consequences of information overload in the Covid-19 pandemic (Hong & Kim, 2020)
and Nielsen et al. studied how people in six countries access and rate news and
information about the coronavirus (Nielsen et al., 2020).
The subject information studies at Åbo Akademi University was interested in knowing
how people feel about sources of information about Covid-19 and how people cope with
the huge amount of information about the virus and disease. The survey that provided the
data for this study was implemented from March to May in the spring of 2020 and it is a
period of time when many similar surveys were made.

1.2. Aim and research questions
In this master’s thesis, the aspect of social media usage is studied more specifically.
The aim is divided into a two-fold study. Firstly, the study explores the patterns of two
different age groups using social media as a source of information. Secondly, it
examines how people cope with the large amount of information and if they experience
information overload or avoid information.
The main research question is: Do people search for information about the Covid-19
pandemic in social media? The main research question is further divided into subquestions, which focus on people’s emotions about the amount of information.
Two different age groups will be compared: people born before 1960 and people born
after 1980. These two different age groups represent digital immigrants (born before
1960) and digital natives (born after 1980) (Prensky, 2001a). The theory about digital
immigrants and digital natives was developed by Mark Prensky and the theory is further
described in the third chapter of this master’s thesis.
The sub-questions of this study compare differences between digital immigrants and
digital natives. The sub-questions for this study are:
Q1: Are there differences concerning how many of the study participants uses social
media as a source of information?
Q2: Are there differences concerning why they use social media?
Q3: Are there differences concerning whether they experience information overload?
Q4: Are there differences concerning whether they avoid information?
This study strives to provide new empirically based knowledge concerning the situation
with the Covid-19 pandemic and information regarding it. The study will use both a
qualitative and a quantitative study methods to answer the research questions. Firstly, the
qualitative aspect is provided and the survey responses are divided into groups
thematically. The quantitative aspect will be given about how many from each of these

8

Eeva Virtanen 2021

two different age groups use social media as a source of information and how many
experience information overload. This study also examines why people choose their
sources and what kinds of feelings people have experienced about the amount of Covid19-related information.

1.3. Limitations
The data for the survey has been collected in three different languages: English, Finnish
and Swedish. This master’s thesis study will only focus on the answers given in Finnish
because the number of answers given in English was quite limited. Also, other studies
have been conducted based on this survey data, for example, by Ojaranta and ErikssonBacka (Eriksson-Backa, 2020) (Ojaranta et al., 2020). Overall, the survey included 160
answers in Finnish. However, this study seeks differences between digital immigrants
and digital natives, so this study does not examine all the Finnish answers but focuses
only on a portion of them. Including the answers from people born in 1960 or before and
people born in 1980 or after strives to give insight into two different generations, and
there is approximately the same number of participants in each age group. By quantitative
analysis, it is also tested if different variables, for instance, belonging to a risk group or
gender, might affect participants social media usage or information overload. However,
the survey respondents included only 12 male participants and 73 female participants.
Three participants did not want to answer the question about gender. The small number
of male participants contribute to the fact that the quantitative outcomes are not
necessarily credible. The participants for this survey were recruited through the Internet,
and the survey was conducted as an online questionnaire, which means that only
participants who use the Internet could participate.
Answers to this survey are unique because of the open questions in the survey. In every
question, there was a possibility to give either long or short answers and there was also a
possibility to not answer the question at all. The survey responses are divided thematically
using qualitative analysis because the survey questions are designed to be open questions.
Overall, the survey has six central questions, but this study will focus only on three of
them to answer the research questions. A large amount of false information about the

9

Eeva Virtanen 2021

coronavirus is spread continuously, and the survey includes questions regarding
misinformation as well. However, this study will focus on the information overload
aspect and where these two different age groups find their information from. Because of
the earlier studies conducted by Eriksson-Backa and Ojaranta et al. based on this survey,
this study will focus on the social media aspect of the survey answers (Eriksson-Backa,
2020) (Ojaranta et al., 2020).

1.4. Structure of the thesis
This study starts with chapter 1, including introducing the topic and the research aim and
questions. Chapter 1 also includes the limitations of this master's thesis study.
Chapter 2 provides an overview of the literature and central concepts of this study. The
concepts of information behaviour, information need and information seeking are opened
up in this chapter. Information behaviour in the crisis situation is also described in this
chapter. Information about the Covid-19 pandemic and the so-called infodemic are
presented to provide an overview of the situation this pandemic has caused and why it is
essential to study information behaviour during a crisis. As the focus of the present study
is on social media usage, the concept of social media as a source of information is also
described in this chapter.
In Chapter 3, the focus is on the theoretical framework of this study. It
presents the main theories of this study: the theory of digital immigrants and digital
natives, the theory of information overload, and monitoring and blunting.
Chapter 4 describes the research methods and design, how the study approach has been
applied and the methodological choices. This study uses a mixed-method approach that
combines qualitative and quantitative analysis of the research data. Chapter 5 presents
the results and the analysis of the research data. In Chapter 6, the results are discussed in
relation to previous research and compared to the study's theoretical framework. Finally,
in chapter 7, conclusions and key findings of this study and ideas for future research are
presented.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
This chapter starts with an outline of the definitions of information behaviour and how
the crisis situation and the large amount of information relate to people's information
behaviour. The definitions of information need, information seeking and information
avoidance are described in this chapter which also includes knowledge about the
pandemic and the infodemic it has caused. Information has increased, especially on social
media channels, and this chapter opens the concepts of social media, information source
and misinformation.

2.1.

Information behaviour

"Information" is an ancient word, which appears early in one of Chaucer's stories between
1372 and 1386 (Case & Given, 2016). Information can often be seen as a social
phenomenon, since it is an instrument by which the sender/source attempts to influence
the recipient/user—even though this individual can be influenced in a way that is not
expected. The influence or impact of the information is defined as something the obtained
information does to the recipient of the message (Spink & Heinström, 2011 p. 258).
Information behaviour aims to explain how people look for and use information in
different ways, and it is an area of information science study. The word 'information
behaviour' was coined by Thomas D. Wilson in 1981 (Wilson, 1981). The concept has
now been embraced, and Wilson's information behaviour model is widely quoted in
information behaviour literature. According to Wilson, information behaviour can be
described as "those activities a person may engage in when identifying his or her own
needs for information, searching for such information in any way, and using or
transferring that information" (Wilson, 1999, p. 249). In 2000, Wilson described
information behaviour as the "totality of human behaviour in relation to sources and
channels of information." (Wilson, 2000 p. 1).
Information behaviour is conceptualised as dynamic information systems that are rooted
in an individual's daily social and life context. The influence of information is closely
11

Eeva Virtanen 2021

connected to the idea of the use of information, which is one of the most critical forms of
information behaviour (Spink & Heinström, 2011). Because of the increased amount of
information, especially in online form, the description of the term information behaviour
has also developed over the years. Information behaviour in a modern world could be
described as the entirety of human behaviour in relation to information sources and
networks, covering the use of information as well as both active and passive information
searching (Wilson, 2000). This includes face-to-face communication with others as well
as the passive reception of information (such as watching TV commercials) without any
intention of acting on the given information (Wilson, 2000).

2.1.1. Information need
Information need is an essential part of the information seeking process. According to
Grunig, a "need" is usually defined as an "inner motivational state" that gives rise to
thinking, and it leads to action (Grunig, 1989, p. 209). The concept of need can be divided
into four general conclusions, according to Green. The first of these conclusions is that
need is always instrumental, because it is about reaching a particular goal. Usually, it
helps to find the answer to something needed. The second conclusion about need is that
"needs" are often contestable when "wants" are not. According to Green, the third
conclusion of need is that it is often related to the concept of necessity, for example, "basic
human needs", and fourth, need is not necessarily just a state of mind, so it is possible
that one might not be aware of one's own needs (Green, 1990).
Wilson proposed the idea of information need. Understanding the information needs of a
person concerns three elements: Why the user wants to seek information, what purpose
the information will fulfil, and how the information will be used after it is obtained
(Wilson, 1981). According to Case and Given, the term information need is often simply
described as a cause of information seeking, and it might even be a requirement for the
act of information seeking (Case & Given, 2016, p. 82). Information needs in the case of
a global pandemic might arise from knowing about an unfamiliar or worrying situation.
The information need can also arise from a practical situation, such as the need to know

12

Eeva Virtanen 2021

the most recent decrees by the government to act in a certain way or to seek information
about how to act if one feels symptoms Covid-19 might cause.
Information need has been studied during the Covid-19 pandemic as well, and studies
have shown that the information need of people has increased because of the pandemic.
For instance, according to the study conducted by Dreisiebner et al., information needs
and information consumption have increased substantially among German-speaking
people since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic (Dreisiebner et al., 2020).

2.1.2. Information seeking
The roots of human information seeking activity can be found in the work of library users
and readership research in general. The post-war rise in the volume of science literature,
either newly written or recently removed from war-time constraints, in 1948 led, to the
Royal Society Scientific Intelligence Conference (1948), which marks the beginning of a
modern study of human information seeking behaviour (Wilson, 2000). However, the
topic goes further along. Perhaps the sense of "seeking information" is often considered
to be obvious. The seeking for information is closely related to the idea of need. It is
counter-intuitive, but scholars have invested less time in describing the seeking than the
need. Many reports of empiric inquiries do not bother to include a description of the
information seeking because it is seen simply as an act of what people do in response to
the need for information. Instead, studies appear to focus on organisational descriptions
of the search, that is, what activities are detected by respondents to the survey (Case &
Given, 2016, p. 91).
Johnson describes information seeking like this: "Information seeking can be defined as
the purposive acquisition of information from selected information carriers" (Johnson,
1997, p. 26). Information seeking can be done in many different ways. That is why plenty
of different models for seeking information have been created, such as the Ellis model,
the Kulthau model, the Savolainen model, and the Krikelas model (Dipak, 2017).

13

Eeva Virtanen 2021

Information-seeking behaviour has changed over the years, especially as technology has
rapidly developed. Technological advances have brought us constant availability of crisis
information through the Internet and increased participation via increased use of
technology and social media (Gutteling & de Vries, 2016). Studies suggest that digital
media can be influential in supplying information and promoting self-reliance. In
particular, recent research has shown that the Internet is used as the most effective tool
for acquiring information in urgent circumstances and that people often view it in addition
to expert sources (Gutteling & de Vries, 2016).
Kalayou et al. studied people's information seeking during the Covid-19 pandemic, and
their results show that often the primary reasons for obtaining information about Covid19 were to seek information about the disease, diagnosis, or treatment, and to seek for
both local and global case reports (Kalayou et al., 2020). According to the study
conducted by Kalayou et al., 82.1% of the respondents used different Internet sources for
Covid-19-related information seeking (Kalayou et al., 2020).

2.1.3. Information avoidance
The selective use of information and the large amount of it might also lead to avoiding
information (Case & Given, 2016, p. 117). Avoidance of information is a widespread
phenomenon in everyday life. Information avoidance has implications for numerous
aspects of people´s lives, including finance, health, and personal relationships (Case et
al., 2012).
Information avoidance has two different forms: active and passive avoidance of
information. The avoidance of information is active when it is short-term, and the person
knows there is information available and chooses not to read it, even if it is free of charge
(Golman et al., 2017). Active avoidance of information might be, for example, avoiding
information about serious illness to avoid facing bad news as a coping mechanism.
Passive information avoidance is a long-term habituated behaviour seen when people
prevent the conscious processing of information that they experience in their daily lives
for such a long time that it becomes a passive and subconscious behaviour. Passive

14

Eeva Virtanen 2021

information avoidance often involves information relevant to political or religious views
(Case et al., 2012).
In a situation with a global pandemic, information avoidance can have multiple negative
consequences. Avoiding information can lead, for example, to unawareness of given
instructions, not knowing what the symptoms of Covid-19 are, and not knowing how to
act when suspecting infection or unawareness of how the disease spreads. Unawareness
can lead to spreading the virus without knowing.
Siebenhaar et al. studied dealing with the Covid-19 infodemic and information avoidance
during the pandemic. Their study shows that the distress caused by the Covid-19-related
information predicted higher compliance with preventive measures and, in some cases,
higher information avoidance. Avoiding information, in turn, predicted lower compliance
with preventive measures (Siebenhaar et al., 2020).

2.1.4. Information behaviour in crisis situation
Information behaviour and the need for information changes widely in times of crisis
(Butenaité et al., 2016). In everyday situations, people search for information about their
interests and goals, but people search for information that focuses on their safety and
health in a crisis. Basic needs like survival assurance and safety become relevant and will
affect the information seeking behaviour of people (Dreisiebner et al., 2020). As
information ecology is rapidly evolving, the Covid-19 pandemic is the first global
pandemic to occur in the modern information environment, with all the latest resources
on the Internet, such as easy access to global information and user-created social media
content (Dreisiebner et al., 2020). In this kind of crisis situation, the information
behaviour and needs can change dramatically (Butenaité et al., 2016). Stressful
information can affect people differently since some want to have as much information
as possible, whereas others might start avoiding information (Miller, 1987).
During the current crisis with the Covid-19 pandemic, health-related information seeking
is an essential part of people’s information behaviour. Health-related information seeking

15

Eeva Virtanen 2021

could be described as a “knowledge gathering process, resulting from a health query or
need” (Mukherjee & Bawden, 2012, p. 242) and health-related information seeking is an
important part of people’s information seeking behaviour even when there is no threat of
a global pandemic.
According to Beck et al. (2014), 48.5% of the Web users aged 15-30 years use the Internet
for health purposes, and about 80% of these people considered that the information they
found online was reliable (Beck et al. 2014). Dreisiebner et al. (2020) studied information
behaviour during the Covid-19 crisis in German-speaking countries and found that the
crisis has led to increased demand for reliable information. From the participants in their
study, 75% confirmed that their use of information and news has increased since the
pandemic began. (Dreisiebner et al., 2020) The criteria for reliable information were high
quality of journalistic, credible information, research facts and that the source of
information is official (for example, health organisation) (Dreisiebner et al., 2020).
Nielsen et al. studied how people in six countries access and rate news and information
about the coronavirus. Their study also determines that people often use social media as
a source of information, even though they might not find the information to be very
accurate (Nielsen et al., 2020). The data for their study were collected in March and early
April from people located in six different countries: Argentina, Germany, South Korea,
Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States (Nielsen et al., 2020).
The study shows how people accessed news and information about Covid-19, how they
rate the trustworthiness of the different sources and platforms on which they rely and how
much misinformation they misinterpret (Nielsen et al., 2020). The data in their study
indicate that the use of news has increased in all of the six countries, and people in these
countries most likely use social media, video sites, messaging apps and search engines,
or combinations of these, to access news and information about the coronavirus (Nielsen
et al., 2020).
According to the Nielsen et al. study, people with a low degree of formal education are
much less likely to state that they rely on Covid-19 news and they are much more likely

16

Eeva Virtanen 2021

to rely on social media. In South Korea, Argentina, the US and Spain, young people are
much more likely to rely on social media, and in Germany and the UK they are more
likely to rely on messaging apps (Nielsen et al., 2020). In addition to the differences based
on geography, there are differences based on age and educational background, as well.
People with higher education trust information coming from scientists, doctors, and
health experts (Nielsen et al., 2020).

2.2.

Covid-19 pandemic

In February 2020, the WHO named the disease "Covid-19", which is short for coronavirus
disease 2019 (Adhanom, 2020). In the spring of 2020, The World Health Organisation
(WHO) declared Covid-19 as a global pandemic. This drastically changed people's lives
all around the world and has also affected the world economy (Fernandes, 2020). While
it is still unclear precisely where the pandemic began, several early cases of Covid-19
were traced to people who visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, based in
Wuhan, Hubei, China (Sun et al. 2020).
With the explosive increase of confirmed cases, on January 30th, 2020, the WHO
declared this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (Sun et al.
2020). The symptoms of Covid-19 are highly variable, varying from none to severe
disease. The virus travels primarily across the air while people are close to each other. It
leaves an affected person through breathing, coughing, sneezing, or speaking and
reaching another person through their mouth, nose, or eyes. It can also spread across
infected surfaces (World Health Organization. 2020).
The number of confirmed cases increases fast. On March 13th, 2021, there were 126 890
643 confirmed cases and 2 778 619 Covid-19-related confirmed deaths worldwide. There
are confirmed cases in 223 different countries (WHO 2021).
Since Covid-19 was labelled as a global pandemic, exchanging essential information
from various sources is continuous and ever-changing (Poonia & Rajasekaran, 2020).
New statistics is continuously created about Covid-19, and new information, government
17

Eeva Virtanen 2021

briefs and comments from experts are presented all the time. Covid-19 has dominated the
news since March 2020, when the WHO announced it as a pandemic (Hong & Kim,
2020).
Providing health information is vital, because it allows people to acquire insights and
make better choices about their health. In fact, in times of health emergencies such as
Covid-19, people become very attentive to this knowledge and, by doing so, attempt to
reduce the fear and destructive emotions associated with the previously unknown illness.
However, studies have shown that the constant overload of information has negatively
affected people, leading to information avoidance, failure to comply with the given
recommendations, and uncertainty in decision-making (Hong & Kim, 2020).

2.2.1. Infodemic during the Covid-19 pandemic
During a pandemic, an infodemic is described as an abundance of information, including
inaccurate or misleading information, in both digital and physical environments. It leads
to uncertainty and risk-taking habits that may be harmful to one's wellbeing. It also breeds
cynicism towards health authorities, weakening public health response (Bradd, 2021).
When people are uncertain of what they need to do to protect their wellbeing and the
health of those around them, an infodemic will worsen or lengthen outbreaks. In addition,
with increased digitisation – an increase in social media and Internet use – information
will spread more quickly. This can help to fill information voids more efficiently, but it
can also intensify negative signals (Bradd, 2021).
The excessive amount of information and knowledge is one of the features of the modern
world. Power is no longer a matter of having access to information but of handling it.
Indeed, the introduction of the Internet and social media has undoubtedly encouraged the
circulation and distribution of information, opening up opportunities for consumers to
access, communicate and create content. This situation has led to a democratisation of the
current relationship between information and people (Pulido et al., 2020).

Misinformation and fake news have been widespread in the era of social media and have
been on the enormous rise since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Misinformation
is false or inaccurate, especially false information that is deliberately intended to deceive
and fake news has no basis but is presented as factually accurate. This condition is severe,
because it destroys confidence in health services and health institutions. Therefore, on 29
June 2020, the WHO officially opened its 1st Infodemiology Conference on Global
Impacts and Control of Infodemics, which brought together foreign experts from diverse
science and political perspectives.
Immediate and universal sharing of medical and other scientific knowledge outside of
specialist circles until it has been fully tested can be risky, particularly in the case of a
pandemic (The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 2020). The impacts of the infodemic during
Covid-19 have been studied during the past year. For example, Islam et al. studied the
Covid-19-related infodemic and its impact on public health (Islam et al., 2020). Their
study focused on analysing rumours, stigma and conspiracy theories in social media
posts. They studied 2311 social media reports related to Covid-19 from 87 countries and
found that 89% of the reports could be classified as rumours, 7.8% conspiracy theories
and 3.5% stigma (Islam et al., 2020).
The WHO is collaborating with partners across the world to strengthen the research field
of infodemiology. Infodemiology can be defined as the study of the determinants and
distribution of information primarily on the Internet or society, with the overall goal of
informing about public health and public policy (Eysenbach, 2009). The aim is to create
and provide long-term tools that health authorities and societies can use to avoid and
mitigate the detrimental consequences of infodemics (Bradd, 2021). The WHO
cooperates to strengthen digital capacity in order to increase digital and health awareness,
develop resistance to disinformation (false or misleading information), and access new
ways to provide audiences with trustworthy health details (Bradd, 2021).

2.3.

Information source

The source of information is an object, person or place from which the information arises,
originates or is received. The source of information may be referred to as primary or
secondary, and the source may advise a person about something or provide information
about it. Virtually, information can come from almost everywhere: blogs, books,
newspapers, social media, articles, magazines or journals, personal experiences and
websites. The need for information usually defines where the information should be
searched from (Kosrow, 2020).

2.3.1. Social media as a source of information about Covid-19
Social media means collaborative Internet-based technologies that promote the
development or exchange of content, thoughts, and other modes of expression across
virtual communities and networks (Hoffmann & Bublitz, 2017 p. 31). Perhaps the most
distinguishing aspect between social media and traditional media is the ability for people
to engage in conversation and add information. It provides a contrast to conventional
mass media communication, in which communication is usually one-way, from a
specialist text creator to a broad anonymous mass audience. Anyone on social media can
participate, share messages, and communicate with any number of other people
(Hoffmann & Bublitz, 2017 p. 31). Social networking sites and social media apps are
tools that enhance our capacity to communicate and participate in collaborative action,
all beyond the context of conventional hierarchical structures and organisations (Fuchs,
2014).
Liu et al. (2016) examined social media use during disasters and found that in a crisis
situation, people communicate about the disaster via interpersonal forms, for example,
face-to-face, telephone call and direct messages, rather than through social media
channels (Liu et al. 2016). However, their study was done in 2016 as a field experiment
simulating a hypothetical disaster, and the use of social media channels has increased
since. Research done by Dreisiebner et al. in 2020 about information behaviour during
the Covid-19 pandemic shows that participants did not react by communicating via
interpersonal forms. However, they instead read the information from trusted traditional
20

Eeva Virtanen 2021

sources, for instance, official health organisations. However, there are different outcomes
between the studies about information behaviour during the Covid-19 pandemic. Nielsen
et al. studied how people in six countries access and rate news and information about
Covid-19. Their study shows that most people in these countries are using social media,
video sites, search engines, or messaging applications to get information and news about
Covid-19. Especially people with a lower education level were likely to use social media
(Nielsen et al., 2020).
Social media sources are the most commonly used channels of information in the world.
Fast and cheap Internet access, as well as a vast number of registered users, make them
one of the simplest and most powerful ways to disseminate information (González-Padilla
& Tortolero-Blanco, 2020). During big events, whether it is a sporting event, an illness,
or a natural disaster, the general reaction is usually a larger quest for information
(González-Padilla & Tortolero-Blanco, 2020). The quick distribution of protocols at the
regional, global, and international levels has been one of the most significant
characteristics of social media networks in this pandemic (González-Padilla & TortoleroBlanco, 2020). Cinelli et al. studied the Covid-19 infodemic in social media, and
according to their findings, information spread is influenced by the engagement model
imposed by the specific social media channel or by the specific interaction patterns of
groups of social media users (Cinelli et al., 2020).
Social media as an information source has both disadvantages and advantages. For
instance, in the Covid-19 period, social media channels significantly benefit from the
accelerated distribution of instructive and educational material about the pandemic. There
is a broad interest in the quicker distribution of knowledge about prevention measures
(González-Padilla & Tortolero-Blanco, 2020). Studies have shown that disseminating
science literature on social media sites raises the number of downloads, requests, and
citations of these posts, which, along with the Covid-19 pandemic, have undeniably
provided for the rapid propagation of information worldwide (González-Padilla &
Tortolero-Blanco, 2020). Among the weaknesses is the probability that the material
communicated is out of date, has not been peer-reviewed, is invalid, wrong, irrelevant to
our environment, or even misleading. Also, the capacity for incorrect, alarmist and

21

Eeva Virtanen 2021

misleading facts to be disseminated on social media may induce panic, stress, depression,
and anxiety in individuals (González-Padilla & Tortolero-Blanco, 2020). Soroya et al.
studied information avoidance in the time of the Covid-19 pandemic, and they stated that
when comparing different information channels, only exposure to information from social
media resulted in information overload and information anxiety (Soroya et al., 2021).

2.3.2.

Misinformation in social media

When using social media as a source of information, people often come across
misinformation. Misinformation is misleading or incorrect information that is transmitted
regardless of the purpose to mislead. Mass communication has affected the history of
misinformation as well as propaganda and disinformation (Posetti & Matthews 2018).
The amount of information people create every day is more significant than ever, and
according to the IBM report in 2016, 90 per cent of all the information that exists in the
world was created in the past two years, and the amount of information has only increased
since. Unfortunately, when the information is created and published quickly, it does not
leave time for serious reflection or testing if the information is true or false (Helfand,
2016 p. 2).
The amount of misinformation has increased because the amount of information overall
has increased. Sharing and validating information has been rewarded and valued
throughout human history. In history, there was very little information, but it was
relatively reliable and of high quality. Now the situation is the opposite when virtual
information is unlimited, but the quality of information is not good, and the information
is not reliable (Helfand, 2016 p. 3).
Several data collections have already been conducted for the current Covid-19 crisis, and
some initial findings of data-oriented studies have been released. The spread of
knowledge on social media has shown some essential preliminary findings. A significant
amount of misinformation is being disseminated during the Covid-19 crisis (Yang et al.,
2020). In addition, artificially generated content from bots affects the dissemination of
misinformation (Ferrara, 2020).
22

Eeva Virtanen 2021

An online experiment was done by van der Meer and Jin (2020) about decreasing the
amount of misinformation in a public health crisis. They found that the existence of
corrective information contributes to the debunking of false misinformation-based
assumptions. In addition, government institutions and news media sources are more
effective in increasing the consistency of opinion than social peers (Van der Meer & Jin,
2020).

3. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
This chapter starts with an outline of the theoretical framework of the study. The central
theories used in this study are described in this chapter.

3.1.

Theoretical framework of the study

The theoretical framework of this master’s thesis consists of three different theories: the
theory about digital natives and digital immigrants, the information overload theory and
the theory about monitoring and blunting. Figure 1 shows the theoretical framework of
this master’s thesis study. The main question is to solve if people search for information
about Covid-19 from social media and how people cope with a large amount of
information.

Figure 1: Theoretical framework of the study

24

Eeva Virtanen 2021

The first part of the theoretical framework of this study is the theory of digital immigrants
and digital natives. The survey participants are divided into two different age groups:
people born before 1960 and people born after 1980. These groups represent digital
immigrants and digital natives. The study examines if these people use social media as a
source of information about the Covid-19 pandemic and compare the differences between
digital immigrants and digital natives. This study also examines their coping with a large
amount of information, for example, if they experience information overload and if they
do, are they monitors or blunters?

3.1.1. Theory of digital natives and digital immigrants
"Digital natives" are the latest generation of young people born into the digital world,
while "digital immigrants" are those who have learned to use technology at some point in
their adult life. According to Prensky, people born in 1980 or later are digital natives and
people born before 1980 are seen as digital immigrants. The name "digital native" refers
to their ability to be "native speakers" of the digital language of the Internet, computers
and, for example, video games (Prensky 2001, a). Digital Natives represent the first
generation to grow up with new technology. They have lived their entire life around
computers, video games, portable music players, video cameras, mobile phones, and all
the other technologies and tools of the digital age. According to Prensky, an average
college graduate in the year of 2001 spent less than 5,000 hours reading in their lives, but
more than 10,000 hours playing video games (Prensky 2001, b). Since digital natives have
grown as surrounded by digital sources and technology, their information seeking
behaviour is different from that of digital immigrants, as well. Digital natives have
become accustomed to finding information quickly and multitasking, whereas digital
immigrants might use more time to become familiar with a specific subject (Prensky
2001, a).
Prensky's theory about digital immigrants and digital natives has been criticised. For
example, Wang et al. suggested that rather than seeing the difference between digital
immigrants and digital natives as a strict dichotomy, this difference might be

25

Eeva Virtanen 2021

conceptualised best as a continuum because some people are technologically more
capable than others (Wang et al. 2013).
This study uses Prensky's theory about digital natives and digital immigrants to see if
there are differences in how these two age groups search for information. The theory
about digital immigrants and digital natives has also been criticised by Bennett et al.
because it presents the differences between digital natives and digital immigrants as too
straightforward (Bennett et al. 2008). For example, there are not necessarily differences
between people born in 1979 and 1980, although Prensky's theory suggests that those
born in 1979 are digital immigrants and those born in 1980 are digital natives. However,
in the case of this study, respondents are counted as digital immigrants if they were born
in the year 1960 and before that and those who are counted as digital natives were born
in the year 1980 and later, so there may be differences between these age groups for this
study.

3.1.2. Information overload theory
According to Rogers, information overload "is the state of an individual or system in
which excessive communication inputs cannot be processed, leading to a breakdown."
(Rogers 1986, p. 181).
The term information overload has become more common since the increased amount of
information on the Internet. Especially in a crisis situation, the amount of information can
lead to experiencing information overload. Management theorist Henry Mintzberg has
written about information overload and its effects on making decisions, that the brain
sometimes has difficulties processing all the relevant information because there is simply
too much of it or it may not fit with previous patterns and our expectations, and some of
the information may be too threatening to accept at all (Mintzberg, 1975, p. 17). In the
case of the Covid-19 pandemic, in addition to a large amount of information, the
information might also be too threatening to accept (Soroya et al., 2021).

26

Eeva Virtanen 2021

Even though it is customary to treat information selectively (Case & Given, 2016) and
selecting the information is a phenomenon that people do just to have the information that
is nice to know, it exposes challenges in a crisis. The amount of information is enormous,
and it is in principle negative, so that information overload might lead to information
avoidance in a problematic way. Such selective exposure to environmental inputs is,
however, referred to as "filtering" by psychologists Miller G. A. et al. (1960), who point
out that it is normal for humans to filter their information experience (Miller et al., 1960).
Information overload has also been studied during the Covid-19 pandemic. For example,
Mohammad et al. examined the assessment of Covid-19 information overload among the
general public. Their study measured the level of information overload related to Covid19, and their study was conducted as an online survey with a total number of 584
respondents. Their study determined that the frequency of information and the source of
information was associated with experiencing the information overload about Covid-19related information. According to the study by Mohammed et al., people who received
information about Covid-19 through mass media were more likely to experience
information overload than the people who received Covid-19-related information via
social media. The Covid-19-related information is often contradictory, causing
uncertainty and information overload in the general public. This will have a negative
impact on the steps put in place to monitor the spread and management of the Covid-19
infection (Mohammed et al., 2021).
Information overload has many downsides. Poonia and Rajasekaran also studied
information overload during the Covid-19 crisis, and they suggested a method to share
updates among frontline staff during the Covid-19 pandemic (Poonia & Rajasekaran,
2020). When the amount of information is enormous, there is a risk that important
information goes unnoticed because of all the other information. Therefore, it is crucial
that health workers, for example, get the information they need efficiently and reliably.
Poonia and Rajasekaran studied information overload from the point of view that the large
amount of information would not hamper health workers information receiving and they
could be guaranteed a rapid transfer of important and trustworthy information (Poonia &
Rajasekaran, 2020).

27

Eeva Virtanen 2021

3.1.3. Theory of monitoring and blunting
The study done by Dreisiebner et al. in 2020 found that most of the participants had
increased their use of information during the Covid-19 pandemic (Dreisiebner et al.,
2020), but that is always not the case. People react differently in a crisis situation, and S.
M. Miller has developed a theory about monitors and blunters, which refers to different
kinds of personalities and their information behaviour changes during a crisis. The
situation with the Covid-19 pandemic has increased both; active information seeking but
also information avoiding (Dreisiebner et al., 2020).
People’s information seeking behaviour changes dramatically in a stressful situation
according to the theory of monitors and blunters. Monitoring and blunting theory is based
on the theory of avoidance and vigilance or alertness. It was developed by S. M. Miller,
a psychologist who researched stress and information behaviour. The theory explains
people’s information seeking behaviour in stressful or negative situations. According to
the theory, people differ in their preference for information when they face a stressful
situation. Monitors are the people who seek information to keep informed of the threatrelated situation because knowing “what is happening” helps them to decrease their stress.
On the other hand, blunters tend to avoid information about a stressful event because it
increases their stress levels (Miller, 1987).
Miller’s theory about monitoring and blunting is taken into account in this master’s thesis
study because this master’s thesis also strives to find out if a group of people avoids seeing
information and a group that wishes to see plenty of information about the subject. The
theory might be slightly straightforward because people who might do both actively seek
information and avoid seeing information in other situations. However, Miller has created
a scale of high monitors and low monitors as well as high blunters and low blunters to
show that people might have different stages of monitoring and blunting (Miller, 1987).
Siebenhaar et al. studied dealing with the Covid-19 infodemic and their study included
discussion about the monitoring and blunting theory, as well. Their findings suggest that
avoidance of information can play a role in the negative consequences of informationrelated anxiety, interfering with crisis management. Whether or not information-related
28

Eeva Virtanen 2021

anxiety leads to avoidance is most likely a result of the personal coping style of
monitoring or blunting (Siebenhaar et al., 2020). As a result, in their study, monitoring
behaviour (e.g., watching more television than before the crisis, looking for health facts
on the Internet) was the optimum predictor of higher compliance with prevention
measures (Siebenhaar et al., 2020). They also suggested in their research that future
research about the coping styles regarding the Covid-19-related information could be
implemented (Siebenhaar et al., 2020)

4. RESEACH METHODS AND DESIGN
This chapter includes knowledge about the data collection for this study and how the
survey was structured. This chapter also includes information about the design of this
study and how the data were analysed. The present study is conducted using a mixedmethod approach. In this chapter, the purpose and structure of the data collection methods
and data analysis are described. The study collects the data for the research from a survey
done by the subject of information studies at Åbo Akademi University. This study uses
two different approaches in analysing the data from the survey: First the answers are
analysed using thematic analysis which is one method of qualitative analysis. For the
questions on whether people use social media to search for information about the Covid19 pandemic and whether they experience information overload, a quantitative analysis
of survey data was also conducted based on the qualitative analysis. For the quantitative
aspect, the respondents of the survey are divided into the groups of digital immigrants
and digital natives by age. With a quantitative method, differences between variables such
as gender and belonging to a risk group are also tested. In addition, a qualitative aspect is
analysed from the sub-questions of the survey. The qualitative aspect also offers insights
into the question of how people feel about the amount of information and why they choose
their information sources.

4.1.

Data collection

The data for this study were collected by the subject of information studies at Åbo
Akademi University in the spring of 2020. The answers were collected via an online form
and the survey was open during March 24th to May 15th, 2020. The participants were
anonymous, but some background information was collected, for example their age,
occupation, city they live in, gender and whether they belong to a risk group or not.
However, it was not obligatory for the participants to give any information about
themselves. The survey answers were collected in three different languages, Finnish,
English and Swedish. This study uses only the Finnish answers of the survey and the total
number of Finnish answers is 160. This study only uses the answers from people born
before 1960 and people born after 1980 to compare differences between digital
30

Eeva Virtanen 2021

immigrants and digital natives, so the participants are divided into two different groups
based on their age. This study includes 45 answers from people born 1980 or after and 43
answers from people born in 1960 or before.
Eight researchers from information studies at Åbo Akademi University shared the survey
on their own social media pages (for example Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook and
Instagram) and some of them shared the survey in their own personal Whatsapp groups.
The survey was also shared in Åbo Akademi University’s Yammer page, Åbo Akademi
University’s web page as well as in the kirjastot.fi and biblioteken.fi pages. Kirjastot.fi is
a web page that includes knowledge about libraries in Finland. It has collected a large
amount of information about libraries, literature, music, news and information seeking in
one place. Biblioteken.fi is the same kind of page in Swedish. The participants had six
weeks to answer to this survey, starting from March 24th, 2020. From all of the answers,
73.3% were received in March, 22.4% of the answers were submitted in April and only
4.2% of the answers came in May. This means that most of the data were collected from
the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The idea of the survey was to find out participants’ feelings and behaviour regarding the
information about Covid-19. The survey included multiple questions, such as from where
the participants obtain the information they need, how they handle the amount of
information and how they evaluate the reliability of the information.
The amount of data collected with this survey was large and other studies are conducted
based on the survey as well. However, this study is mainly focused on the social media
and information overload aspects of the survey. That is why this study mainly analyses
the data from questions one and three of the survey. The survey questions can be seen in
section 4.1.1. on page 32 and in appendix 1 on page 80. The question about participants’
background is also taken into consideration in this study, because the background
information helps to divide the participants into categories based on different variables.

31

Eeva Virtanen 2021

4.1.1. The structure of the survey
The survey contained seven background questions and five main questions with subquestions (see Appendix 1 on page 80). The participants had the option to choose how
many questions they want to answer, and both short and long answers were welcomed.
Background information that was gathered from the participants included age, gender,
city or municipality, educational background/occupation, in what language(s) the
participant searches for information, if they belong to a risk group and if someone in their
near environment has been diagnosed with the coronavirus disease. These questions were
mainly structured in a way that the participants can answer with one word or select a
number. The five main questions in the survey are open questions with a possibility to
give long or short answers. These five main questions and their sub-questions were:
1)

From where do you get information/news about the corona epidemic at the
moment? How do you update yourself about the corona situation?
(For example, government health services websites, Yle news on television
and/or radio, on websites, newspapers, friends, relatives, social media such as
Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, Snapchat, TikTok etc.)?
a)

Why do you choose these sources? People can have a need to
receive different kinds of information, and both formal and
informal information can be important.

2)

Is false/unreliable information about the corona situation a problem for you (for
example rumors, misunderstandings, misleading information (disinformation) or
contradicting information)?
a)

Why is it a problem?

b)

How do you evaluate the reliability of the corona information or
news?

32

Eeva Virtanen 2021

3)

How do you cope with the amount of information/news about the corona
situation (too much information, too little information)?
a)

What kinds of feelings do you have about the amount of
information?

4)

Can you give us 1-2 examples of good and 1-2 examples of bad experiences
regarding the information about the corona epidemic.

5)

Any other experiences you would like to share regarding corona information in
general?

4.2.

The design of the study

The critical methodological decision includes the choice between quantitative and
qualitative approaches and determining whether they are effective in answering the study
questions. Although qualitative methods are used to achieve deep and comprehensive
knowledge on the subject, quantitative methods are used to collect more significant
quantities of information on a specific subject (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Therefore,
this study is designed to offer both qualitative and quantitative aspects to answer the
research questions.
The goal of the study was to obtain knowledge of feelings regarding the amount of
information and the use of information sources. Because of that, the qualitative approach
with open-ended questions was applied. However, the quantitative aspect was conducted
as well because the main question of this study is to find out if people use social media
as a source of information about Covid-19 and the quantitative aspect was conducted to
see if there are statistical differences between digital immigrants and digital natives with
choosing the information source. In addition, the aspect of information overload is tested
using quantitative analysis.

33

4.3.

Data analysis

Qualitative and quantitative analysis approaches are frequently contrasted as reflecting
two world views. In quantitative circles, qualitative analysis is generally regarded with
scepticism and perceived to be lightweight since it includes limited surveys that may not
be reflective of the larger community, and it is seen as non-objective, and findings are
judged as biased from the participants' own perspectives or views. On the other hand,
quantitative analysis in qualitative circles may be discounted as oversimplifying a
person's knowledge in the cause of generalisation, failing to consider researcher
prejudices and preferences in study design, and needing guesswork to grasp the subjective
sense of aggregate results (Hammarberg et al. 2016).
However, the qualitative and quantitative methods can be used together in the same
research. They can be used sequentially, where the first approach is used to facilitate the
design of the second, they can also be used in parallel as different approaches to the same
question, or the prevailing approach can be enriched by a small portion of the alternative
method (Hammarberg et al. 2016).
Qualitative approaches are used to address questions about reality, context, and
viewpoint, most often from the researcher's point of view. Typically, these data cannot
be counted or calculated. Qualitative analysis strategies can include small-group
conversations to explore values, behaviours and normative behaviour concepts, semistructured interviews to seek perspectives on a given subject, or key informants, context
knowledge, or institutional insight. Qualitative research can also be done as in-depth
interviews to explain the situation, experience or occurrence from a particular perspective
and study of texts and records, such as government papers, newspaper stories, blogs or
publications, to learn about distributed or private information (Hammarberg et al. 2016).
Data analysis of this study was conducted using qualitative and quantitative analysis, so
the analysis includes two perspectives. A qualitative approach is the primary analysis
approach in this study because of the structure of the survey questions. The survey was
conducted with open questions, and that is why the data were analysed with thematic

34

Eeva Virtanen 2021

analysis, which is a type of qualitative analysis. Thematic analysis is a successful
approach to study when the researcher wants to determine people's values, knowledge,
opinions, views or experiences from a collection of qualitative data, such as interview
transcripts, survey responses or social media accounts (Caulfield, J. 2019).
In addition, quantitative analysis was conducted to gain insight into differences in using
social media as a source of information between two different age groups. It was also
used to see if there are differences in feeling information overload between digital natives
and digital immigrants.
Quantitative analysis approaches are suitable where facts are needed to address the
research query; when general or probability knowledge is sought on viewpoints,
behaviours, perceptions, beliefs or preferences; when variables must be separated and
defined; when variables may be related to hypotheses prior to data collection and when
the question or issue is identified, it is transparent and unequivocal. (Hammarberg et al.
2016) In this study, quantitative analysis is tested using chi-square tests to see if there is
a statistical difference between digital immigrants and digital natives in using social
media as a source of information and if they experience information overload. Different
background variables like belonging to a risk group and gender were also tested.
The Chi-square test is one approach to demonstrate an association between two
categorical variables (Glen, 2013). A chi-squared statistic is a single number that shows
how much difference there is between the measured counts (Glen, 2013). The chi-square
test is commonly used in testing the independence of distributions or random variables
from the classified frequency range (Tilastokeskus, n.d.).

5 RESULTS
This chapter contains results of both the quantitative and qualitative analyses. The
quantitative analysis of the differences in social media usage between the different age
groups is presented. The information overload aspect is also presented as well as
differences between digital immigrants and digital natives in that area. In the quantitative
analysis, it is also tested if variables such as belonging to a risk group or gender affect the
use of social media or experiencing information overload. Qualitative analysis was
conducted on the survey answers to be able to divide the answers thematically and then
by quantitative analysis to see if the differences between these groups based on different
variables are significant. In the end, the main findings of both analysis methods are
summarised.
This study uses only the Finnish answers of the survey and only the age groups born in
1960 or earlier and born in 1980 or after are analysed. First, the answers were divided
into the groups: people born before 1960 and people born after 1980 (digital immigrants
and digital natives). Figure 2 shows information about the survey participants. This study
includes 88 participants in total: 43 participants (48.9%) are digital immigrants and 45
participants (51.1%) are digital natives. The digital immigrants were born between 1941
and 1960 and the digital natives were born between 1980 and 1998. From the altogether
43 digital immigrants, five were male participants and 38 were female participants. From
the total of 45 digital natives, seven were male participants, three participants did not
want to categorise their gender and 35 were female participants. Overall, only 13.6% of
participants were male and 83% were female. Nineteen digital immigrants belong to a
risk group which constitutes 44.2% of the digital immigrants. Of the digital natives, only
three belong to a risk group which is 6.7% of all the digital natives. Overall, 25% of
participants belong to a risk group and 60.2% do not belong to a risk group. There were
14.8% of participants who did not know, if they belong to a risk group or not. Participants
extensively live in different parts of Finland. Five participants (5.7%) were students, 50
participants (56.8%) were employed, one participant (1.1%) was self-employed, three
participants (3.4%) were unemployed, whereas one participant (1.1%) was a homemaker
and 28 participants (31.8%) were retired.

5.1. Social media as a source of information

This part analyses the use of social media as a source of information among two different
age groups: digital immigrants born before 1960 and digital natives born after 1980. Data
for analysing the use of social media are collected from the first question of the survey:
1)

From where do you get information/news about the corona epidemic at the
moment? How do you update yourself about the corona situation?
(For example, government health services websites, Yle news on television
and/or radio, on websites, newspapers, friends, relatives, social media such as
Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, Snapchat, TikTok etc.)?

The first step of thematic analysis is familiarisation. Therefore, it is essential to provide
an overview of all the data gathered before analysing specific items. (Caulfield, 2019).
Once the overview of the survey answers was provided, the data were colour-coded into
different groups based on the answers that included mentions on using social media as

37

Eeva Virtanen 2021

sources of information and the answers that did not include any mentions about social
media.
The sources counted as social media were platforms that enable any people to create
information, share information and comment on it. The platforms mentioned were
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, WhatsApp and LinkedIn. All of these
are platforms that permit the users to participate in creating, commenting, and sharing the
information.
A few participants had mentioned social media just as "social media". For example, one
participant wrote this:
“TV/radio, social media, newspaper (local). I'm used to using these channels
and they are in my opinion reliable”
– Female, digital immigrant born in 1946
whereas other participants listed different social media channels, for example:
“Facebook, Instagram, whatsapp, BBC, CNN, YLE, TV news, newspapers,
friends, family members”.
– Female, digital immigrant born in 1948
The colour-coded answers were then grouped into two themes, depending on whether
they contained mentions of uses of social media as a source of information or if they did
not mention anything about using social media as a source of information. Table 1
presents the use of social media as a source of information among the digital natives and
the digital immigrants. Overall, 42 people (47.7%) out of 88 participants have mentioned
one or several social media channels that they use as an information source. Forty-six
people (52.3%) out of 88 participants have not mentioned any social media sites as their
source of information. All of the participants that mentioned social media as a source of
information mentioned other sources as well, for instance news (Different kind of news
channels were mentioned, for example international news channel BBC and Finnish news

38

Eeva Virtanen 2021

channels Yle news, Ilta-Sanomat, Iltalehti, MTV news), television, radio, and official
websites of health organisations like THL or the WHO. THL is a Finnish health
organisation, and the shortening THL comes from the words Terveyden ja Hyvinvoinnin
Laitos, which means the Institute for Health and Welfare in English. The WHO is an
international health organisation, and the shortening WHO comes from words World
Health Organisation. The participants who did not mention social media as their source
of information mentioned other sources like news, television, radio, and official websites
of health organisations. Some participants had mentioned that they do not read social
media channels because they do not trust that the information is reliable..

5.1.1. Differences between digital immigrants and digital natives
Table 1 shows that eighteen of the 43 digital immigrants have mentioned one or several
social media channels in their reply to the question on information sources about the
Covid-19 pandemic. This is 41.9% of the digital immigrants overall. Twenty-five (58.1%)
of the digital immigrants have not mentioned social media as their source of information.
Of 45 digital natives, 24 participants have mentioned one or several social media channels
in their reply to the question on information sources about the Covid-19 pandemic. This
is 53.3% of the digital natives overall. Twenty-one (46.7%) of the digital natives have not
mentioned social media as their source of information. Because of the open form of the
questions, it is impossible to say that some participants use social media and others do
not. We can only assume that those who did not mention social media do not necessarily
use them as a source of information.
Based on the results of the qualitative analysis, quantitative aspects were also analysed.
Chi-square tests were made to see if there are statistical differences between different
groups. According to the chi-square test made concerning using social media as a source
of information, there were no significant differences between digital immigrants and
digital natives about their use of social media (p>0.05, see Table 7 in the appendix). With
chi-square test, a p-value of 0.05 and smaller numbers usually indicate that the difference
between the two groups is significant. The significance between the digital immigrants

39

Eeva Virtanen 2021

and digital natives in this case was 0.281 which means that the difference is not
statistically significant.

5.1.2. Differences between risk group and not belonging to risk group
Different background variables of the participants were also tested, for example, is there
differences in using specific information sources depending on if the participant belongs
to a risk group or not. Most of the participants who belong to a risk group are digital
immigrants, and a large amount of them might be in a risk group based on their age. Table
2 presents the differences in using social media as a source of information between the
people in a risk group and people who do not belong to a risk group. From the total
number of participants (88), there were 22 participants (25%) who knew they belong to a
risk group and 53 participants (60.2%) who knew they do not belong to a risk group.
Thirteen participants (14.8%) did not know if they belong to a risk group or not. Nine
participants (40.9%) belonging to a risk group mentioned some social media channel as
their sources of information, and 13 risk group participants (59.1%) had not mentioned

40

Eeva Virtanen 2021

anything about social media as their sources of information about the Covid-19 pandemic.
Of people who do not belong to a risk group, 26 participants (49.1%) had mentioned using
some social media channels as their source of information, and 27 participants (50.1%)
did not mention anything about social media channels. Of those in a risk group, 40.9% of
the participants use social media, and of participants who do not belong to a risk group,
49.1% use social media, so the difference between these two groups is 8.2%.
Based on the results of qualitative analysis, a quantitative aspect was also analysed using
the chi-square tests to see any statistical differences between these different groups.
According to the chi-square test made about using social media as a source of
information, there were no significant differences between people who belong to a risk
group and people who do not belong to a risk group (p>0.05, see Table 8 in the appendix).
The significance between the people who belong to a risk group and people who do not
belong to a risk group, in this case, was 0.725, which means that the difference is not
statistically significant.

5.1.3. Differences between genders
Table 3 presents the relationship between using social media as a source of information
between different genders. From the total number of participants (88), there were 73
female (83%) participants and only 12 male (14%) participants. Three participants did
not want to answer this part. The fact that 83% of the participants are female might
somewhat affect the results. Thirty-six female participants mentioned that they use social
media as their source of information, and 37 had not mentioned social media as one of
their source of information about the Covid-19 pandemic. Of the male participants, four
had mentioned using social media as their source of information, whereas eight
participants did not mention social media. Thus, among the female participants, 49.3%
uses social media, and among the male participants, 33.3% uses social media. Even
though some percentual difference between male and female participants can be seen, it
is impossible to claim that there are differences between genders based on this sampling
because this sample included so few male participants.
According to the chi-square test made about using social media as a source of
information, there were no significant differences between different genders (p>0.05, see
Table 9 in the appendix). The significance between the female and male participants, in
this case, was 0.472, which means that the difference is not statistically significant.

5.1.4. Reasons to use social media as a source of information
The first survey question about information source included a sub-question, which
gathers information about why people choose their information sources. The additional
question was:
a) Why do you choose these sources? People can have a need to receive
different kinds of information, and both formal and informal
information can be important.
Since this question was a sub-question to the first question, all participants did not answer
why they choose a specific source of information. Here the answers were also categorised
using thematic analysis, which is a form of qualitative analysis. There were 42 people
(47.7%) that mentioned using at least one social media channel as their source of
information. Eighteen (42.9%) of these were digital immigrants, and 24 (57.1%) were
digital natives.

43

Eeva Virtanen 2021

First, the answers that included mentions about using social media as a source of
information were familiarised and colour-coded based on the answers that included
reasons to use social media as a source of information. From the total 18 digital
immigrants who had mentioned social media as their source of information, 10 (55.6%)
had answered the sub-question "why they choose these sources?". Of the digital natives,
12 of 24 (50%) participants who mentioned social media as their source of information
also mentioned why they choose these sources.
Figure 3 shows the number (n) of digital immigrants (18) and digital natives (24) who
use social media as their source. Four themes came up in the answers to why the
participants would choose social media. The most common answer among digital
immigrants and digital natives was that their friends share information on social media,
so they use social media as their source of information because of their friends. Also,
family was mentioned in addition to friends. Therefore, all answers that included some
mentions about family or friends were counted in this category.
One example of this kind of answer was from a digital immigrant:
Yle (mainly TV news and special broadcasts), the newspapers I subscribe to; the
websites of international health organisations and the site of domestic THL
[National Institute of Health and Welfare]; foreign digital magazines. Also,
Facebook & personal email. Reason: so that I can maintain and date my own
knowledge and my relatives and friends about the pandemic at home and abroad,
and so that we can, together with my spouse, comply with the guidance of duty.
– Male, digital immigrant born in 1948
Five digital immigrants and seven digital natives had a mention about friends or family
in their answers. Three digital immigrants and two digital natives had mentioned that the
information is timely or easy/fast to find from social media. For example, one digital
immigrant wrote this:

44

Eeva Virtanen 2021

Yle, authorities, newspapers, twitter (social media). They are the easiest to
access.
-Female, digital immigrant born in 1950
Two of the digital immigrants mentioned that they choose their sources because the
information is international in these sources. Three digital natives mentioned that they get
peer support from their sources of information. Of those digital immigrants who had
mentioned using social media as their information source, eight participants did not
explain why they choose it as their source. Of the digital natives who have mentioned
using social media as their information source, 12 participants did not explain why they
chose it.

5.2. Information overload
This part analyses the feeling of information overload and differences in how digital
immigrants (born before 1960) and digital natives (born after 1980) experience
information overload.
Data for analysing experiencing information overload are collected from the third
question of the survey:
3)

How do you cope with the amount of information/news about the corona
situation (too much information, too little information)?

The answers that were counted as experiencing information overload included mentions
about feeling stressed or anxious about the amount of information, feeling that there is
too much information or experiencing that the amount of information is so large that they
need to avoid it. Examples of answers that were counted as experiencing information
overload are:
“I'm stressed about the amount of information I receive, but I try to limit the
amount of information I receive based on what I estimate I need and what I
estimate is necessary for my work and myself.”
-Female, a digital immigrant, born in 1956
“There is too much information and disinformation. It gives me anxiety, so I
only stick to certain sources of information.”
-Gender unknown, a digital native, born in 1983
“Constant information about coronavirus from everywhere irritates. I watch the
corona situation once a day from the pages of thl, and possibly the news. And I'll
follow if any new restrictions come from the government. Otherwise, I'll try to
close my eyes and ears and focus on something else.”
-Female, a digital immigrant, born in 1956

46

Eeva Virtanen 2021

5.2.1. Differences between digital immigrants and digital natives
Table 4 presents the experience of information overload among digital natives and digital
immigrants. Overall, 45 people out of 88 participants (51.1%) have mentioned that they
experience information overload on some level: they have either felt that there is too much
information or felt stress or anxiety about the large amount of information. Of the 88
participants, 43 (48.9%) have not mentioned that they have felt information overload or
stress and anxiety about the large amount of information. Some of the people who have
not experienced information overload have also mentioned that it is good to have much
information about the coronavirus. For example, one participant has written like this:
“I think it is good that there is much information - especially information and
not beliefs that scare. Everyone does not have to follow everything along the day.
News come in anyway in the media - radio, television, the Internet, for example
- and I believe following "once in a while” is enough for now. (If the situation
changes dramatically, the follow-up needs may change, but that's speculation
even now.)
-Male, a digital immigrant, born in 1953
All of the participants that mentioned something about feeling the information overload
or who had experienced information overload on some level have been counted to the
"too much information/overload" column of table 4. The participants who have not
mentioned that they experience information overload or do not feel that the amount of
information is too much have been counted in the column "not too much information / no
overload" column of table 4.
Table 4 presents that 25 out of 43 digital immigrants have mentioned that they experience
information overload on a certain level. This is 58.1% of the digital immigrants overall.
They have mentioned, for example, that they feel anxiety or stress about the amount of
information or that they feel the need to avoid the information, or that there is simply too
much information about the coronavirus. From the group of digital immigrants, 18 people
(41.9%) have not mentioned that they feel information overload or see too much
information about the coronavirus. The part of the group that does not see the large
47

Eeva Virtanen 2021

amount of information as an issue has also mentioned that it is good to have much
information.
Digital natives did not experience information overload as much as digital immigrants
did. Of the 45 digital natives, 20 participants have mentioned that they either experience
information overload on a certain level, or then they have told that there is too much
information or that they get stressed about the amount of information. This is 44.4% of
the digital natives overall. Of the digital natives, 25 people have not mentioned anything
negative about the large amount of information and part of the digital natives also
experiences the large amount of information as a good thing.
According to the chi-square test made about experiencing information overload, there
were no significant differences between digital immigrants and digital natives (p>0.05,
see Table 10 in the appendix) even though it seems that digital natives did not experience
information overload as much as digital immigrants. The significance between the digital
immigrants and digital natives, in this case, was 0.199, which means the difference is not
statistically significant.

5.2.2. Differences between risk group and not belonging to risk group
Different background variables between the participants were also tested, for example,
are there differences in experiencing information overload depending on if they belong
to a risk group or not. Most of the participants that belong to a risk group are digital
immigrants, and some of them might be in the risk group based on their age. Table 5
presents the differences in experiencing information overload between the people in a
risk group and those who do not belong to a risk group. Of those who belong to a risk
group, 13 participants mentioned that they experience information overload on some
level. This is 59.1% of the participants in a risk group overall. The people who were
counted as experiencing information overload had mentioned that there is too much
information, that they cannot handle the large amount of information, they avoid seeing
information, or get stressed or feel anxiety about the amount of information. Of the
participants who belong to a risk group, nine people did not mention that they would feel
overloaded/stressed/anxious about the amount of information. This is 40.9% of the
participants in a risk group.
Of the participants who do not belong to a risk group, 25 participants (47.2%) had
mentioned something about information overload, and 28 participants (52.8%) did not
mention anything about the large amount of information being an issue. Of those in a risk
group, 59.1% of the participants experience information overload, and of the participants
who do not belong to a risk group, 47.2% experience information overload, so there seems
to be a percentual difference between people who belong to a risk group and people who
do not belong to a risk group.
According to the chi-square test made about experiencing information overload, there
were no significant differences between people who belong to a risk group and people
who do not belong to a risk group (p>0.05, see Table 11 in the appendix), even though
the percentual difference between these groups seems big. The significance between the
digital immigrants and digital natives, in this case, was 0.628, which means that it is not
statistically significant difference.

5.2.3. Differences between genders
Table 6 presents the relationships between experiencing information overload and
different genders. Of the female participants, 39 mentioned that they experience
information overload on some level, and 34 had not mentioned information overload. Of
the male participants, three had mentioned information overload, and nine participants
did not mention it. Of the female participants, 53.4% experience information overload
and 25% experience information overload from the male participants. It can be seen that
a clearly more significant percentage of female participants experienced information
overload than male participants. However, this sample included very few male
participants in total, which might affect the results.
The chi-square test showed a significant relationship between gender and experienced
overload (chi-square=6.300, p<0.05, see Table 12 in the appendix). The significance
between the digital immigrants and digital natives, in this case, was 0.043, which means

50

Eeva Virtanen 2021

that the difference is significant. However, the small number of male participants might
influence the chi-square test results, as well.

5.2.4. Coping with the large amount of information
The third survey question about coping with the amount of information included a subquestion, which gathers information about participants' feelings concerning the large
amount of information. The additional sub-question was:
a)

What kinds of feelings do you have about the amount of
information?

Since this question was a sub-question of the third question, all participants did not
answer what kinds of feelings they have about the amount of information. Here the
answers were also categorised using thematic analysis. There were 45 participants
(51.1%) that mentioned experiencing information overload at least on a certain level or

51

Eeva Virtanen 2021

had stress/anxiousness about the amount of information. Of these 45 participants, 25 were
digital immigrants, and 20 were digital natives.
First, the answers that included mentions about information overload, that there is too
much information to cope with or that the participants have negative thoughts about the
amount of information were familiarised and colour-coded into one category. Second, the
answers that included mentions about avoiding information were further collected into
one category.
Figure 4 shows the number (n) of digital immigrants (43) and digital natives (45) and
their feelings about the amount of information. A few participants mentioned several
different feelings regarding the amount of information, and these participants have been
counted into more than just one category.
Four different themes came up from the survey answers that included mentions of the
feelings about the amount of information. The four themes were: It is good to have much
information, the large amount of information is stressful, there is too little factual
information, and there is too much information, I avoid it.
The most common answer among both digital immigrants and digital natives was that
there is too much information, and the participants try to avoid it. Of the digital
immigrants, 15 (34.9% of digital immigrants overall) and of the digital natives, 18 (40%
of digital natives overall) had a mention about avoiding too much information in their
answers.
For example, to the question “how do you cope with the amount of information”, two
digital immigrants wrote about restricting their own access to information following:
“I am rationing access to information; I'm only clearing the situation 2-3 times per day.
Too much information distresses.”

“I have started limiting the reception of information to today's newspaper and TV or
radio news. I will also watch the briefings of the government and the city of Helsinki.”
-Female, a digital immigrant, born in 1959
However, participants from opposite views also think that getting much information
about the subject is a good thing. This is why the theory of monitors and blunters is
included in this study.
For example, one of the participants wrote this:
I am a news addict meaning that I daily follow several different news channels at home.
Occasionally this somewhat distresses but I must keep up to date. There is a lot of
conversations with my friends on WhatsApp between two persons or in groups.
Information is must-be heard and received. I am interested in the information.”
-Female, a digital immigrant, born in 1958
Of the digital immigrants, 14 (32.6%) and of the digital natives, 15 (33.3%) had
mentioned that the large amount of information causes stress for them. Among the digital
immigrants, nine (20.1%) had mentioned that it is good to have much information and six
digital natives (13.3% of digital natives) felt the same way. Eight digital natives
mentioned that they receive actually too little information, especially factual information.
This means that 17.8% of the digital natives would hope to see even more factual
information about the Covid-19 pandemic.

5.3. Summary and analysis of the results
The analysis of the survey data to answer the research questions was done by thematic
analysis, because the survey was structured with open questions. The main research
question is: “Do people search for information about the Covid-19 pandemic in social
media?” Of the total 88 included participants, 42 mentioned one or several social media
channel as their source of information about the Covid-19 pandemic. This means that
47.7% of the participants in this sample use social media as their source of information.
However, these answers included mentions from participants that they use social media
merely to see what their friends have written about the subject, but they still did not
consider social media as a reliable source of information even if they use them. With this
sample, we could think that almost half of the people use social media as one of their

54

Eeva Virtanen 2021

sources of information. All the participants who had mentioned using social media as
their source of information had mentioned other sources as well.
The main research question was further divided into sub-questions, which focused on the
differences between the two different age groups and on people’s emotions about the
amount of information. Two different age groups were compared: people born in 1960 or
before and people born in 1980 or after. These two different age groups represent digital
immigrants and digital natives. The sub-questions for this study were:
Q1: Are there differences concerning how many of the study participants uses social
media as a source of information?
Q2: Are there differences concerning why they use social media?
Q3: Are there differences concerning whether they experience information overload?
Q4: Are there differences concerning whether they avoid information?
Q1: Are there differences concerning how many of the study participants uses social
media as a source of information?
For the first sub-question, it could be seen that there were some differences between these
two age groups. Out of a total of 43 digital immigrants, 18 mentioned using social media
channels as a source of information. Out of a total of 45 digital natives, 24 mentioned
using social media as a source of information. It means that about 40 percent of digital
immigrants use social media as a source of information and over half of the digital natives
use social media as a source of information. There was a percentual difference between
these two groups, so with this sample it appears that digital natives use social media as a
source of information more that digital immigrants do. However, in the chi-square tests
that were made to see, if the difference between these groups is significant, the
significance could not be proved.
Q2: Are there differences concerning why they use social media?

55

Eeva Virtanen 2021

For the second sub-question, “Are there differences concerning why they use social
media?”, no considerable differences could be identified between the two age groups. The
sampling for this question was small, because only part of the participants used social
media as their source of information and of them, everyone did not answer this optional
question. For the question why people choose their sources, four themes were identified.
There were quite similar percentages of digital immigrants and digital natives, who
mentioned friends or family in their answers concerning the choice of source of
information. Three digital immigrants and two digital natives mentioned that they choose
their information sources because the information in these sources is timely, fast or easy
to access. There were no major differences between digital immigrants and digital natives.
Two digital immigrants had mentioned international information as a reason for choosing
social media as an information source, whereas three digital natives had mentioned peer
support as a reason for choosing social media. In this area, there are differences between
digital natives and digital immigrants because digital immigrants use social media as a
place to search for international information, while digital natives use social media as a
source of information, because they receive peer support from there.
As was stated, the sampling for this question was small, because everyone did not want
to explain why they choose their information sources. It is difficult to indicate clear
differences between these two groups, due to the size of the sampling and the openformed questions. However, it seems that the digital natives would use social media more
to connect with people and have peer support, whereas the digital immigrants would use
social media to obtain international information as well as to connect with their friends.
Q3: Are there differences concerning whether they experience information overload?
Overall, of the 88 participants, 45 mentioned something about information overload in
their answers. Out of the total of 43 digital immigrants, 25 had negative feelings about
the amount of information and were counted as the ones experiencing information
overload. This means that the clear majority of the digital immigrants felt information
overload. Of the overall 45 digital natives, 20 participants answered that they felt
negatively about the amount of information and they were counted as the ones

56

Eeva Virtanen 2021

experiencing information overload. This constitutes over 40 percent of the participating
digital natives. It is striking that there are slight differences between the two age groups:
digital immigrants might feel information overload more easily than digital natives do.
The age difference might have affected this, because digital natives have grown up
surrounded by large amounts of information and, that way, there is a possibility that they
do not feel overwhelmed by the information as easily as digital immigrants do. However,
the chi-square tests about the information overload did not show significant differences
between the two age groups, even though it seems that there is a percentual difference
between digital immigrants and digital natives.
Q4: Are there differences concerning whether they avoid information?
The survey question concerning peoples’ feelings about the amount of information and
coping with the amount of information was a wide question and the answers included
many different mentions about avoidance of information. The fourth sub-question of this
research was “Are there differences on whether they avoid information?”. When
researching the coping with large amount of information, 15 digital immigrants (about
35% of digital immigrants overall) and 18 digital natives (about 40% of digital natives
overall) had mentioned that they avoid information, so there was just a slight difference
between these two age groups but not significant differences between these two groups
concerning the information avoidance. Even if it does seem by percentage as if digital
natives are avoiding information slightly more than digital immigrants do, the responses
of digital immigrants about the avoidance of information are still more direct and clearer
from the perspective of information avoidance. Many digital immigrants have directly
stated that they are avoiding information or restricting their own access to information.
Of the digital natives, there were participants who avoid and limit their access for
information as well as participants who seek as much information as possible, which
supports the theory of monitoring and blunting in this study. The number of the
information avoiders and information seekers was quite the same between digital natives
and digital immigrants.

6 DISCUSSION
After discussing the questionnaire findings in chapter five, this chapter aims to link the
research results to the theoretical framework of this study to understand better the
differences between digital immigrants' and digital natives' information behaviour during
the Covid-19 pandemic. Also, this chapter aims to discuss the results in relation to
previous research; if people search for information about the Covid-19 pandemic from
social media and how they cope with the large amount of information.

6.1. Discussion of results in relation to previous research
Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic began, the amount of information related to the
pandemic has been extensive and new information has constantly been coming from
different sources. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been an extensive
amount of research related to the coronavirus. For example, Siebenhaar et al. studied
dealing with the Covid-19 crisis (Siebenhaar et al., 2020), whereas Pulido et al. studied
the Covid-19 infodemic (Pulido et al., 2020). In addition, Poonia and Rajasekaran have
studied the information overload aspect of the Covid-19 crisis (Poonia & Rajasekaran
2020), and Nielsen et al. studied how people access and rate news about Covid-19
(Nielsen et al., 2020).
The pandemic situation has inspired many researchers to study human information
behaviour, and now the results of previous studies are reflected with the results of this
present master's thesis study. This study offers insights into Finnish people's information
behaviour during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, when assessing the data, it is
important to remember that the number of included respondents in this study was 88
merely participants, and the findings could hence not be applicable to the whole
population.

Eeva Virtanen 2021

6.1.1. Differences between digital immigrants and digital natives
When studying the differences between digital immigrants and digital natives, this study
included four sub-questions:
Q1: Are there differences concerning how many of the study participants uses social
media as a source of information?
Q2: Are there differences concerning why they use social media?
Q3: Are there differences concerning whether they experience information overload?
Q4: Are there differences concerning whether they avoid information?
Around 40% of the digital immigrants and over half of the digital natives mentioned one
or several social media channels in their reply. To answer the first research sub-question,
it seems that digital natives would use social media a bit more than digital immigrants
based on this sample. According to Prensky, digital natives think about and process
information fundamentally differently from digital immigrants (Prensky 2001, a), which
lead to the assumption that the difference between digital immigrants' and digital natives'
social media use could be much more significant. The differences based on this sample
were, however, not significant according to the chi-square test. However, the participants
of this study are active users of the Internet because they were recruited to answer the
survey through the Internet, mainly through social media channels. The difference
between digital immigrants and digital natives could have been more significant if the
answers were collected through a paper survey, for instance.
The answers to the second sub-question, "Are there differences in why they choose social
media?" showed some differences between the two groups. Both groups had quite similar
numbers of answers about family and friends, as well about the information being timely
and easy or fast to get. However, digital natives used social media more to get peer
support, whereas digital immigrants used social media more to read international
information. That might indicate that digital immigrants use social media for different
purposes than digital natives do. This can be linked to Prensky's vision about digital

59

Eeva Virtanen 2021

immigrants and digital natives thinking differently about digital sources (Prensky, 2001
b).
The sub-question about the information overload aspect of the study also included a
comparison between the two age groups. Almost 60% of the digital immigrants
mentioned that they experience information overload on a certain level. Digital natives
did not experience information overload as much as digital immigrants since only over
40% of the digital natives experienced information overload. The digital natives might
feel a bit less information overload because, according to Prensky, they have grown up
surrounded by the large amount of digital information, whereas digital immigrants have
learned to adapt to the new digital environment (Prensky, 2001 a). However, the
difference between digital immigrants and digital natives was not significant according
to the chi-square test.
Information avoidance occurred in multiple answers when the participants were asked
how they cope with the amount of information. Whereas 40% of the digital natives avoid
information about Covid-19, this was the case for only about one-third of the digital
immigrants. Even though the digital natives are used to the large amounts of digital
information, they still seem to avoid information more than digital immigrants. That
might be because most of the digital immigrants who participated in this survey belong
to a risk group. According to the study done by Dreisiebner et al., people who belong to
a risk group avoid information about the Covid-19 pandemic less than people who do not
belong to a risk group do (Dreisiebner et al., 2020).
To conclude, there were no significant differences between the group of digital
immigrants and the group of digital natives in this particular study. Prensky's theory about
digital immigrants and digital natives can be seen as slightly straightforward, and the
differences between digital immigrants and digital natives are not necessary as
significant. However, this study has a limited number of participants from both groups,
so it is impossible to generalise based on this study.

6.1.2. Covid-19-related information seeking from social media
The main question of this master's thesis study was to find out if people search for
information about the Covid-19 pandemic from social media. The study done by Nielsen
et al. in 2020 studied how people in six countries access and rate news and information
about coronavirus, and their study included mentions about the use of social media.
According to their study, in the United Kingdom and the United States, 47% of
participants used social media as their source of information, whereas in Germany, only
39% use social media. Furthermore, in Spain, 63%, in Argentina, 78% and in South
Korea, 51% of participants use social media (Nielsen et al., 2020). They suggested that
the use of news was up in all six countries, with most people in most countries using
social media, search engines, video pages, and chat apps (or variations of these) to get
news and updates about the coronavirus (Nielsen et al., 2020). In this present master's
thesis study, nearly 48% mentioned one or several social media channels that they use as
an information source, so almost half of the respondents in this survey uses social media.
A slight majority have not mentioned any social media sites as their source of
information. Compared to the study done by Nielsen et al., it would seem that the United
States and the United Kingdom have similar percentages of social media use as in this
present study, whereas Germany has a lower percentage and Spain, Argentina, and South
Korea have considerably higher percentages of using social media than this study. So, it
can be seen that this study somewhat links with their results.
However, because of the open form of the survey questions, we cannot know that the
participants who have not mentioned social media as a source of information do not use
it at all. They might use social media as a source as well, but have decided not to mention
it in the questionnaire. In this case, all of the respondents who did not mention anything
about social media were divided into the category "Have not mentioned social media"
and were interpreted as not using social media.
The study done by Soroya et al. provided interesting findings of information behaviour
in the Covid-19 crisis, as well. Their study suggests that Finnish people do not prefer
social media and personal networks when choosing information sources but instead want

61

Eeva Virtanen 2021

to have trustworthy information from official sources (Soroya et al., 2021). However, in
their study, the participants were part of a university with educational qualifications,
which might affect the results. The study included answers from students, staff, and
faculty members of three universities (Soroya et al., 2021). The findings of this study do
not correlate very well with their study because almost half of the people use social media,
according to this sample.
In the study by Nielsen et al., it was as well mentioned that young people and people with
a low level of education use social media as their source of information a lot more than
older people with higher education (Nielsen et al., 2020). However, in this present
master's thesis study, the educational level of the participants was not taken into account,
and the difference between the two age groups was merely small, even though digital
natives might use social media as an information source more than digital immigrants.
Based on the survey results of this study, about 42% of the digital immigrants use social
media as a source of information compared to over 50% of digital natives. However, the
chi-square test did not show any significant differences between these two groups.
The other background variables tested in this study were belonging or not belonging to a
risk group and gender. There were no significant differences between these groups either,
even though people who do not belong to a risk group used social media slightly more
than participants who belong to a risk group. Most of the participants who belong to a
risk group were digital immigrants, so the difference was quite the same as when
comparing the digital immigrants and digital natives. Between genders, there were more
differences, since almost half of the female participants use social media, but of male
participants, about 30% uses social media. However, there were so few male participants
in this study that the percentage does not necessarily indicate the true divide between men
and women. This result still links with earlier studies, since a study done by Duggan and
Brenner in 2013 indicated that 62% of males use social media sites and 71% of females
use social media sites, meaning that according to their study, females use social media
more compared to male participants (Duggan & Brenner, 2013).

62

Eeva Virtanen 2021

Cuello-Garcia et al. studied social media use in the Covid-19 pandemic, and they
suggested that health workers and scientists should engage in social media more to share
accurate information about the coronavirus (Cuello-Garcia et al., 2020). A similar
expectation could be seen among the respondents of the present study as well because
some participants were hoping to see even more factual information about the Covid-19
pandemic in different channels. However, among the respondents of this survey, it was
seen that social media was only seen as a place where "normal people" share information,
and the official social media sites of health organisations were not taken into account.
In the study by Soroya et al., they suggested that people do not trust the information in
social media, and that is why they choose not to use social media as a source of
information (Soroya et al., 2021). Similar thoughts could be seen among the respondents
of this present study as the people who did not choose social media as their information
source stated in their answers that they like to read information only from trusted sources.
However, reasons to choose social media as an information source according to the
respondents in this study were friends and family, whereas others wanted to find
information quickly and easy. In addition, others wanted to have peer support and
international information from social media. Soroya et al. also found that information in
social media has a strong correlation with information overload.

6.1.3. Information overload in the Covid-19 crisis
The respondents who were counted to be experiencing information overload provided
mentions that they receive too much information, that they cannot handle all the
information, or cannot cope with such a large amount of information. This is because
information overload can be defined as a "state of an individual or system in which
excessive communication inputs cannot be processed, leading to a breakdown." (Rogers
1986, p. 181). The answers that included mentions about feeling stressed or anxious about
the amount of information were, as well, counted as experiencing information overload.
According to the study done by Soroya et al., information overload correlates to a great
extent with information anxiety (Soroya et al., 2021).

63

Eeva Virtanen 2021

Overall, slightly more than one-half of the participants in this present study mentioned
that they experience information overload on some level. Digital immigrants experienced
information overload slightly more than digital natives did, and participants who belong
to a risk group experienced somewhat more information overload than people who do not
belong to a risk group did. However, there were no significant differences between the
different groups concerning age and belonging to a risk group. However, gender did show
a significant difference, while more than half of the female participants experienced
information overload compared to only 25% of male participants. It still needs to be
highlighted that there were only 12 male participants included.
Mohammed et al. studied the assessment of Covid-19 information overload among the
general public. Their study found that Covid-19 information overload is common among
the general population. The information overload about Covid-19 information
substantially correlated with the source of information and the frequency with which
Covid-19 information was received (Mohammed et al., 2021). This master's thesis study
did not examine the frequency of received information, but from the respondents of this
survey, we can see that over half of them experience information overload about Covid19.

6.1.4. Monitoring and blunting coping styles in the Covid-19 crisis
Among the respondents of the survey, there were examples of both coping styles,
monitoring and blunting. Some respondents wrote that they need large amount of
information and that they feel better when they read much information about the Covid19 situation, whereas others wrote that Covid-19-related information gives them
anxiousness and they avoid seeing it.
In the study done by Soroya et al., they found that people who felt information anxiety
avoided further Covid-19-related information (Soroya et al., 2021). Similar answers were
found in this study since most of the participants who mentioned avoiding information
mentioned also having anxiousness or stress about the large amount of information or the

64

Eeva Virtanen 2021

Covid-19-related information overall. Of the total 88 included participants, 33 (about
38%) wrote about information avoiding in their responses.
In the study done by Dreisiebner et al., only 4% of the participants reported having
actively avoided reports and information about the Covid-19 pandemic (Dreisiebner et
al., 2020). Of people who belong to a risk group, none reported having actively avoided
information and reports on Covid-19 in the study by Dreisiebner et al. (Dreisiebner et al.,
2020). Even though their study has quite different outcome about information avoidance
than this study, in this master's thesis study, the active and passive forms of information
avoidance were not considered, but all the answers including mentions about avoidance
of information, were counted as avoiding information. That might affect the outcome of
information avoiders in this study.
According to the study done by Siebenhaar et al., information avoidance is more common
among the participants who do not trust the information about the Covid-19 pandemic.
With people who trusted the information and had higher eHealth literacy, the information
avoidance was not as common (Siebenhaar et al., 2020). The same kinds of answers could
be seen from the respondents of this survey because some people who wrote that they
avoid information also wrote that there is much false information.

6.2. Critical review

As is typical for most studies, this master’s thesis also has its limitations that need to be
addressed. The number of respondents included in this master’s thesis study was quite
small, 88 participants in total. There were answers in three different languages, but only
the answers in Finnish were included in this study. The reason why all of the answers
were not included was that to gain understanding about differences between digital
immigrants and digital natives, samples of the same size were needed. There were 45
participants born in 1980 or after that, who could represent the digital natives. According
to Prensky’s theory, people born before 1980 are digital immigrants (Prensky, 2001 a).
In order to find a sample of nearly the same size as the group of digital natives, the people
born in 1960 and before that were included in the study. Hence, the answers from people

65

Eeva Virtanen 2021

born between 1961 and 1979 were excluded. In order to gain a better understanding of
Covid-19-related information behaviour, a larger number of the answers would have been
needed. However, with the open form of the survey questions, a large number of answers
would have been more difficult to examine, and the research could have been too wide
for a master’s thesis study.
Different background variables were tested to gain knowledge about relationships
between the different groups. In this study, the different variables tested were age,
whether or not the participant belongs to a risk group, and gender. However, it turned out
that most of the participants who belong to a risk group were digital immigrants and most
of the participants who did not belong to a risk group were digital natives. Of course,
there were some exceptions, but examining risk groups gave somewhat similar results as
examining differences between the digital immigrants and digital natives. Also, there
were so few male participants that the results of testing differences between male and
female participants should be treated cautiously. There were more background questions
that could have been used as variables to search for relationships between the groups. For
example, the occupational background or the place of residence could have been tested.
For instance, Nielsen et al. found that education has an effect on where people search for
their information about the Covid-19 pandemic (Nielsen et al., 2020).
The quantitative aspect of this study was done by using chi-square tests. The different
variables, such as gender, age and whether the participant belongs to a risk group or not,
were tested. However, the chi-square tests only showed significant differences for one of
these variables, and that also for one aspect. Only when studying the information overload
aspect, female participants experienced significantly more information overload than
male participants did. However, as said, the number of male participants was small, and
the significance should be treated with caution. To conclude, the chi-square tests were
not the optimum way to examine such a limited number of responses. The responses could
have been examined more specifically using different kinds of qualitative analysis
methods or, from quantitative methods, descriptive statistics could have been used.

66

Eeva Virtanen 2021

The survey also included a question about false information and it could have been
studied how the experiences of false information correlate with information anxiety and
then information overload which can lead to information avoidance. This was initially
thought of, when this master’s thesis was planned, but in the end left out so that the area
of research would not become too wide.

7 CONCLUSIONS
This chapter concludes the findings of this master's thesis study and gives ideas for future
research. The purpose of this master's thesis was to create a better understanding of
people's information behaviour during the Covid-19 pandemic and to see if they use social
media as their source of information about the pandemic and how they cope with the large
amount of information. This master's thesis also strove to find differences in the
information behaviour of digital natives and digital immigrants.

7.1. Key findings
It is important to recognise that the study only considered the responses of 88 participants,
which means that the results reached cannot be generalised to a wider population of
people. Furthermore, this study only examines the Finnish language responses to the
questionnaire, and people's information behaviour can vary greatly in other areas of the
world. Having said that, the findings also provide a general understanding of how people
respond to the vast volume of information about Covid-19 and whether or not they use
social media as a source of information. There were some themes to look for, but some
responses were entirely unique.
Firstly, we determined that almost half of participants (47.7%) included in this study use
social media as one of their sources of information about Covid-19. There were many
different reasons to use social media as a source of information, but four main themes
emerged in the answers. Some participants used social media because of their friends or
family, whereas others used it to obtain timely information quickly or easily. Some
participants also mentioned that they use social media to obtain international information
and others used it for peer support.
Secondly, we found that over half (51.1%) of the participants included in this study
experienced information overload to a certain degree. The question about coping with the
amount of information received many different kinds of answers and four themes
emerged. Some participants thought that it is good to have plenty of information, whereas

68

Eeva Virtanen 2021

others found the large amount of information to be stressful or to cause anxiety. There
were participants who felt that there is too much information and they need to avoid it,
whereas some respondents said that there is actually too little information, especially
factual information.
Thirdly, what was interesting to see was that there were no major differences between
digital natives and digital immigrants based on this sample. Digital natives used social
media slightly more than digital immigrants did, whereas digital immigrants experienced
somewhat more information overload than digital natives did.
Fourthly, when studying the quantitative aspect of the research using chi-square tests,
almost no significant differences could be identified between the background variables
tested. Differences between the age groups were not significant concerning social media
usage or information overload. Also, belonging to a risk group or not did not show any
significant differences in social media usage or experiencing information overload.
Differences between genders were not significant in using social media, but female
participants did experience information overload significantly more than male
participants did. However, the small number of male participants can affect the results.
Fifthly, when information avoidance was studied, there were answers that included both
monitoring and blunting coping mechanisms. There were answers that included mentions
about avoiding of information because it is too stressful, but also answers where the
participants said that they read as much information as possible. Overall, 37.5% of the
respondents mentioned avoiding information to some extent.

7.2. Suggestions for future research

Concerning the survey this study got the data from, there is a lot more data to study. This
study only used 88 answers of the survey and only the answers given in Finnish, so the
conclusions drawn from these results are not applicable to the entire population. In other
words, it could be needed to take into account a more significant number of responses
from the survey in order to form a more accurate picture of Covid-19-related information
69

Eeva Virtanen 2021

behaviour. However, the smaller number of responses allowed for the study to be
conducted partially qualitatively. Since there are many more survey responses, the social
media usage or information overload aspects could be studied more widely.
One aspect is that there were answers in three different languages in this dataset.
Therefore, the responses could be studied in three different languages and examine if
there are differences between the Finnish, Swedish or English answers. This could be
possible with Finnish and Swedish answers since the survey includes enough answers this
kind of study would require.
Also, the aspect of false information could be studied since the survey included a question
about how the participants experience false information related to the Covid-19
pandemic. It could be interesting to study the relationship between false information and
information anxiety. The correlation between information anxiety and information
avoidance could also be studied further based on this survey data.
Finally, the situation with the Covid-19 pandemic is still ongoing, and it has now been a
year since the survey was conducted. Therefore, at the moment, the answers to the same
questions about Covid-19-related information could be very different, so the survey could
be reimplemented to permit for comparison of the answers when a year has passed
between the surveys.

Corona - information and emotions
Information Studies in Åbo Akademi University launches a short survey to collect
research material during the Emergency Power Act caused by the coronavirus.
The survey is open 24.3.–15.5.2020
The everyday life in Finland changed drastically in March 2020 when the government
declared Emergency Powers Act to be in effect because of the global coronavirus
pandemic (COVID-19). There is a lot of information available right now about the
corona epidemic and we are interested in hearing particularly your experiences of the
flow of information in this new situation.
From where do you get the information you need? How do you handle the amount of
information? How do you evaluate the reliability of the information? All the
experiences are valuable and help us to better understand your attitude to information
during a state of emergency.
Participating in this study is anonymous and all possible references to identification of
persons will be removed from the material. Materials will be stored in the Finnish
Social Science Data Archive (FSD) so that it can be used broadly according to the open
science recommendations, www.fsd.tuni.fi
Additional information from professor Gunilla Widén, Åbo Akademi University,
Information studies, gunilla.widen@abo.fi
You can answer the survey through an online form. The survey contains a few
background questions and five main questions. You can choose how many questions
you want to answer and both short and longer answers are welcomed.

Korona - tieto ja tunteet
Åbo Akademin informaatiotutkimuksen oppiaine kerää lyhyen kyselyn avulla aineistoa
kokemuksista, koronaepidemiaan liittyvästä tiedonkulusta valmiuslain ajalta.
Kysely on auki 24.3.–15.5.2020
Suomalaisten arki muuttui merkittävästi maaliskuussa 2020, kun Suomen hallitus julisti
poikkeustilan Covid-19-koronavirusepidemian takia. Juuri nyt on tarjolla paljon tietoa
koronaepidemiasta ja me haluamme kuulla sinun kokemuksiasi tiedonkulusta
tilanteessa, joka on uusi meille kaikille. Mistä saat sen tiedon, jota tarvitset, miten
käsittelet tiedon määrää ja miten arvioit tiedon luotettavuutta? Kaikki kokemukset ovat
arvokkaita ja auttavat meitä paremmin ymmärtämään suhtautumista tietoon
poikkeustilan aikana.
Osallistuminen tapahtuu nimettömästi ja tutkimusaineistosta poistetaan kaikki
mahdolliset viitteet, joista voi tunnistaa yksittäisiä henkilöitä. Aineisto kerätään
avoimen tutkimuksen periaatteita noudattaen Yhteiskuntatieteelliseen tietoarkistoon,
jossa se on avoimesti saatavilla eri tarkoituksiin tutkimuksen jälkeen. www.fsd.tuni.fi
Lisätiedot: Professori Gunilla Widén, Åbo Akademi, informaatiotutkimus, s-posti:
gunilla.widen@abo.fi
Voit vastata kyselyyn alla olevan linkin kautta. Kysely sisältää muutaman
taustakysymyksen lisäksi viisi pääkysymystä. Voit valita kuinka moneen kysymykseen
vastaat. Sekä lyhyet että pidemmät vastaukset ovat tervetulleita.

5. Appendix: Quotations from survey and their translations in the text

”Tv/radio sosiaalinen media sanomalehti paikallinen olen tottunut käyttämään näitä
kanavia ja ovat minun mielestä luotettavia.” / “TV/radio social media newspaper
(local). I'm used to using these channels and they are in my opinion reliable”
– Female, digital immigrant born in 1946
“Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, BBC, CNN, YLE, Tv-uutiset, sanomalehdet,
Ystävät, perheenjäsenet” / “Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, BBC, CNN, YLE, TV
news, newspapers, friends, family members”.
– Female, digital immigrant born in 1948
Yle (lähinnä tv-uutiset ja erikoislähetykset), tilaamani sanomalehdet; kansainvälisten
terveysjärjestöjen sivustot ja kotimaisen THL:n sivusto; ulkomaiset digilehdet. Myös
Facebook. Henk.koht. sähköposti. Syy: jotta voin ylläpitää ja päivättää omaa ja
läheisteni tietoutta pandemiasta kotimaassa ja ulkomailla, ja jotta voimme yhdessä
puolisoni kanssa noudattaa viransomaisohjeita, niistä mitenkään tinkimättä. / Yle
(mainly TV news and special broadcasts), the newspapers I subscribe to; the websites of
international health organisations and the site of domestic THL; foreign digital
magazines. Also, Facebook & personal email. Reason: so that I can maintain and date
my own knowledge and that of my relatives and friends about the pandemic at home
and abroad, and so that we can, together with my spouse, comply with the guidance of
duty.
– Male, digital immigrant born in 1948
“Stressaannun tiedon määrästä, mutta yritän rajoittaa vastaanottamani tiedon määrää
sen perusteella mitä arvioin tarvitsevani ja minkä arvioin olevan välttämätöntä työni ja
itseni kannalta.” / “I'm stressed about the amount of information I receive, but I try to
limit the amount of information I receive based on what I estimate I need and what I
estimate is necessary for my work and myself.”
-Female, digital immigrant born in 1956

86

Eeva Virtanen 2021

”Tietoa ja disinformaatiota tulee liian paljon. Se ahdistaa, joten pitäydyn vain tietyissä
tiedonlähteissä.” / “There is too much information and disinformation. It gives me
anxiety, so I only stick to certain sources of information.”
-Gender unknown, digital native born in 1983
”Joka tuutista ja jatkuvasti tuleva koronahössötys ärsyttää. Katson kerran päivässä
koronatilanteen thl:n sivuilta ja mahdollisesti uutisista. Ja seuraan, jos hallitukselta
tulee uusia rajoituksia. Muuten koetan sulkea silmäni ja korvani ja keskittyä johonkin
muuhun.” / Constant information about coronavirus from everywhere irritates. I watch
the corona situation once a day from the pages of thl, and possibly the news. I also
follow if any new restrictions come from the government. Otherwise, I try to close my
eyes and ears and focus on something else.
-Female, digital immigrant born in 1956
"Minusta on hyvä, että tietoa - nimenomaan tietoa eikä pelottelevaa luuloa - tulee
paljon. Kaikkea ei ole pakko seurata pitkin päivää. Uutisia tulee muutenkin mediassa esimerkiksi radio, televisio, internet - pitkin päivää ja uskon ""silloin tällöin""
seuraamisen riittävän toistaiseksi. (Jos tilanne muuttuu dramaatisesti, voi
seurantatarvekin muuttua, mutta se on spekulaatiota vielä nyt.) Tunne tiedon määrän
suhteen on hyvä ja turvallisuutta luova." /“I think it is good that there is much
information - especially information and not a beliefs that scares. Everyone does not
have to follow everything along the day. News come in anyway in the media - radio,
television, Internet, for example - and I believe following " once in a while” is enough
for now. (If the situation changes dramatically, the follow-up needs may change, but
that's speculation even now.)

”Yle, viranomaiset, sanomalehdet, twitter. Ne ovat helpoimmin saavutettavia.” / ”Yle,
authorities, newspapers, twitter (social media). They are the easiest to achieve.”

”Säännöstelen tiedonsaantia, selvitän tilannetta vain 2-3x/vrk. Liika tieto ahdistaa.” /
“I am rationing access to information; I'm only clearing the situation 2-3 times per day.
Too much information distresses.”
-Female, digital immigrant born in 1960
”Olen alkanut rajoittaa tiedon vastaanottoa päivän lehteen ja tv- tai radiouutisiin.
Katson myös hallituksen ja Helsingin kaupungin tiedotustilaisuudet.” / “I have started
limiting the reception of information to the day's paper and TV or radio news. I will
also watch the briefings of the government and the city of Helsinki.”
-Female, digital immigrant born in 1959
”Olen uutisaddikti eli seuraan päivittäin useista eri kanavista kotonauutisia. Toisinaan
tämä jonkin verran ahdistaa mutta on pysyttävä ajan tasalla. Ystävien kanssa tulee
paljon keskustelua whatsappissa kahden kesken tai ryhmissä. Tietoa on pakko kuulla ja
saada. Se kiinnostaa.” / I am a news addict meaning I follow daily several different
news channels at home. Occasionally this somewhat distresses but I must keep up to
date. There is a lot of conversations with my friends on WhatsApp between two or in
groups. Information is must-be heard and received. I am interested about the
information.”
