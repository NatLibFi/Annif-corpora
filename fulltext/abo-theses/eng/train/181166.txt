ABSTRACT
There is currently a great global interest to raise efficiency and sustainability in
the marine sector. The waterjet propulsion system is a significant contributing
factor to the vessel’s overall propulsion efficiency. One component leading to
losses is the thrust bearing unit which transmits the generated thrust to the
vessel hull. A thrust bearing unit is made up of a bearing housing, bearings and
seals. Optimisation of the thrust bearing unit efficiency can, in addition to reduce
power losses, also increase the lifespan of the internal components.
The objective of this thesis is to analyse whether there is a possibility to extend
the lifespan and reliability of radial shaft seals used is thrust bearing units, and to
identify possible ways that this could be achieved.
The analysis of whether it is possible to increase the lifespan and dependability
of radial shaft seals are based on existing vessel service data. Root cause analysis
and tools defined in this method were used as base for this analysis in order to
identify possible causes leading to reduced radial shaft seal lifespan and
dependability. The tool logic tree is used to organise failure modes and causes.
The results are summarised in two logic trees. The first shows radial shaft seal
failure modes and the most common causes for these failure modes. The second
logic tree shows more in depth causes for the four most common failure modes.
This logic tree has been split into 13 sub logic trees.
Future work could focus on eliminating uncertain causes in these logic trees in
order to identify factors, which should be considered when developing new
products.
Key words: Thrust bearing unit, logic tree, failure mode

INTRODUCTION

According to IEA (2020), 2% of the global energy-related CO2 emissions is caused
by international shipping. Ambitious and concrete policies are required to meet
the goal of carbon neutrality in the second half of the century set by the
International Maritime Organisation.
There is an increasing demand to raise the efficiency and sustainability of
technologies across the marine sector. Among these technologies is the waterjet
propulsion system which is a significant contributing factor of a vessel’s overall
propulsion efficiency and, thereby, emissions from the power unit. The efficiency
of a waterjet propulsion unit can be described as how efficiently it can convert
the rotating power from the engine to thrust needed to propel the vessel. One of
the components leading to conversion losses is the thrust bearing unit which
transmits the generated thrust to the vessel hull. A thrust bearing unit is made up
of a bearing housing, bearings, seals and a lubricant.
Optimisation of the thrust bearing unit efficiency is of high importance, as it does
not only lead to decreased power losses in the propulsion system, but also
reduces the risk of premature failure of the internal components, most notably
the bearings, lubricant and radial shaft seals. This is of high interest for the vessel
operator as the required thrust bearing unit’s time between overhaul should be
as long and dependable as possible to be able to plan in the vessel maintenance
properly.
This thesis focuses on to analyse whether there is a possibility to extend the
lifespan and dependability of radial shaft seals used in thrust bearing units, and
to identify possible ways that this could be achieved. This is done by using root
cause analysis methodology and tools. Some of the processes in this methodology
need to be adopted for this work as it is commonly used for reactive problem
solving and not proactive product improvement that it will be used for in this

2
work.
The analysis is based on existing vessel service data. The scope of the thesis is
delimited to not include proving causes that will lead to increased efficiency,
extended radial shaft seal life and dependability, as this is deemed an extended
process which might need several tests before they can be confirmed with a high
confidence.

LITERATURE REVIEW

2

This chapter covers the theory used in this master’s thesis. First, there is an
introduction to information about waterjet propulsion, the thrust bearing unit
components, common radial shaft seal failure modes, main variables influencing
radial shaft seal life and root cause analysis.
2.1

Waterjet propulsion fundamentals

According to Carlton (2008), the concept of using a waterjet to propel a vessel
can be dated to 1661, when an English patent was granted to Thomas Toogood
and James Hayes that described this function. Waterjet propulsion is currently
often used in place of a propeller on small- to medium sized high-speed vessels.
The main advantages and disadvantages for using waterjet propulsion compared
to propeller propulsion is covered in Table 1.
Table 1. Main advantages and disadvantages for waterjet propulsion systems (Ghose & Gokarn,
2004).

Advantages

High efficiency at high speed
Good maneuverability
Can be used in shallow waters
Even load on power unit
Little noise and vibrations

Disadvantages

Pump easily damaged if debris is sucked in
Takes up room inside vessel
Decreases vessel buoyancy

4
Waterjet units can have different designs depending on the manufacturer and
application. An illustration of a typical waterjet unit is shown in Figure 1. The
basic function is that water is lead through an inlet duct from underneath a vessel
to a pump. This pump is usually either of an axial- or mixed flow type, consisting
of an impeller residing inside a housing, with stator blades located after the
impeller to reduce rotational energy loss. The water leaves through a nozzle
which, due to its small area, accelerates the water flow speed to form a waterjet.
This nozzle can be rotated around a vertical axis to turn the vessel. A revering
bucket can be lowered to produce astern thrust by deflecting the waterjet
forward (Ghose & Gokarn, 2004).

Figure 1. Illustration of a waterjet propulsion unit (Carlton, 2018).

The impeller is connected to the impeller shaft that is usually powered by a highspeed diesel engine through an intermediate shaft. A thrust bearing unit
transmits the thrust force generated by the impeller to the hull through the
impeller shaft. A reduction gearbox is often needed on larger waterjet units to
match the power bands of the engine and waterjet unit (Carlton, 2018). An
example of a waterjet propulsion system is shown in Figure 2.

gearbox and intermediate shaft (Haun, 2016).

2.2

Thrust bearing unit

Bloch & Budris (2004) describe the mission of a thrust bearing unit as to support
the hydraulic thrust load that is imposed on the impeller, the mass of the impeller,
the impeller shaft, the shaft coupling and the intermediate shaft. It also needs to
support loads caused by unbalance and misalignment of the shaft assembly. The
thrust bearing unit keeps the impeller shaft axial and radial deflection at an
acceptable level for proper operation of the pump unit and the mechanical and
radial shaft seals.
2.2.1

Rolling element bearing

A rolling element bearing is a machine element that supports and guides
oscillating, or rotating machine elements and transfers loads between machine
components. These bearings provide low friction and high precision and,
therefore, enable therefore high rotational speeds while maintaining low noise,
heat, energy consumption and wear. Rolling element bearings typically consist of
four main components: rolling elements, cage and inner and outer ring. These
components are shown in Figure 3. There are two basic types of rolling bearings
that are distinguished by their different rolling element geometry. These are balls
in ball bearings and rollers in roller bearings. Ball rolling elements have a small
contact point with the inner- and outer ring raceways, which enables high

6
rotational speeds due to low rolling friction but limits load-carrying capability.
The roller elements have a larger contact area with the raceways than a ball
element with the same diameter. Because of this larger area a roller bearing can
accommodate larger loads but lower rotational speeds due to higher rolling
friction than a same-sized ball bearing (SKF Group, 2018).

Figure 3. Rolling bearing components (SKF Group, 2018).

Rolling element bearings are classified into two main groups based on load
direction. These groups are radial- and thrust bearings. There are bearing designs
that only support radial or thrust load in one direction, while there are other
designs that support a combination of both radial and thrust load in both
directions (SKF Group, 2018).

2.2.2

Oil lubrication

Lubrication is important to be able to optimise the service life of a bearing unit
that utilises rolling element bearings. The function of oil lubricants in a bearing
unit is to form a film on the surface roughness of the working surfaces in the
bearing and radial shaft seal to prevent wear and premature fatigue, dissipate
heat from the bearing and dynamic seals, provide sound dampening and protect
the bearing unit components against corrosion. A wide selection of oil and grease
lubricants are available for different kinds of applications (Harnoy, 2002;
Schaeffler Technologies AG & Co. KG, 2016).

7
There are different methods to distribute oil to the different components in a
bearing unit. These methods are selected based mainly on the bearing speed, the
need to transfer heat and the need to remove contaminants in the oil. The method
used in the thrust bearing units that this thesis covers is the oil bath with selfcirculating oil. This method uses the spherical thrust roller bearing to pump the
oil from the oil bath, which partially covers the lowest rolling element. The oil is
then salvaged and directed to the other bearing and radial shaft seals through
drains and ducts in the bearing housing (SKF Group, 2018).
2.2.3

Radial shaft seal

Machines containing a fluid and moving parts need a dynamic seal to prevent
leakage of fluid out of the machine, contaminants to get into the machine and
leakage of fluids from one machine component to another. Dynamic seals in
general contain one or more interfaces between a moving and a stationary
surface. The radial shaft seal is the type of dynamic seal that is most widely used
(Bhushan, 2001).
There are many different designs of radial shaft seals depending on their
application, but they all generally consist of a flexible lip made of an elastomeric
material bonded to a rigid metal case. Most radial shaft seals also include a garter
spring that is fitted into the flexible lip to provide additional sealing force, as the
elastomeric material gradually loses its original properties due to age, Figure 4.

Figure 4. Schematic of a radial shaft seal (Trelleborg Sealing Solutions, 2018).

8
The total radial force on the lip edge is a function of the lip pre-tension, the garter
spring force and the pressure difference between the oil side and air side of the
lip (Trelleborg Sealing Solutions, 2018).
The most widely used elastomeric material for radial shaft seals is nitrile rubber
(NBR), due to its low cost together with good oil and abrasion resistance. It is
suitable for applications where it operates in moderate temperatures, from -40
°C to 110 °C. Hydrogenated nitrile (HNBR) is frequently used when temperatures
reach up to 135 °C, although at a higher cost compared to NBR. Increasingly
popular, but even more expensive, is fluoroelastomer (FPM). It is recommended
for high temperature, up to 200 °C, and high-speed applications (Bhushan, 2001).
For a radial shaft seal to have a long service life and perform as efficiently as
possible under operation, it must be able to pump oil from the air side to the oil
side. How much oil a seal can pump depends on the seal lip design and material.
As shown in Figure 5, the seal lip approach angle on the oil side is steeper than
on the air side. This difference generates a contact pressure curve that is higher
towards the oil side, which affects the handling of the thin oil film between the
seal lip and the shaft. When the shaft rotates against a new seal lip, it wears
surface features onto the seal lip in a specific pattern. When the shaft rotates,
these features, or asperities, distort along the shaft surface and form a pattern
where the maximum distortion of the asperities appears where the pressure
curve is the highest. The distorted asperities function as micro vanes, and because
there are more vanes facing the oil side than the air side, there is a net pumping
effect towards the oil side of the seal (Salant, 2010).

Figure 6 shows how a rotating shaft induces a hydrodynamic pumping effect that
makes the fluid molecules move back towards the oil side of the seal.

Figure 6. Radial shaft seal pumping oil (SKF Group, 2018).

10

2.2.4

Mechanical shaft seal

The mechanical shaft seal is a dynamic seal that is widely used to prevent water
leakage around rotating shafts on ships and pumps. The concept of this seal is
that a spring presses a stationary and a rotating rubbing ring against each other,
while the process fluid lubricates and cools the contact surfaces. These contact
surfaces are in most cases made of one hard material, such as silicon carbide, and
a relatively soft material such as graphite (Harnoy, 2002).
2.2.5

Bearing housing

The bearing housing is a component that generally houses the rolling element
bearings, and in the case of oil-bath lubrication, radial shaft seals and oil. A
dipstick or a sight glass is often used to visually monitor the oil level when the
machine is stationary. A bearing housing should be designed to allow good oil
flow at bearings and radial shaft seals, withstand transferred bearing forces and
cool the components inside the bearing housing (Harnoy, 2002; Bloch & Budris,
2004).
2.3

Common radial shaft seal failure modes

An examination by Prem & Vogt (2008) of prematurely failing radial shaft seal,
with under 10 000 km operational period or under 100 operating hours,
indicated that failure causes can be subdivided as 30% caused by improper shaft
preparation, 30% caused by improper seal installation, 10% caused by faulty seal
manufacture, 15% caused by apparent leakage / short-term leakage.
Furthermore, 15% is caused by other factors, such as excessive temperature,
vibrations, contaminants or lubricant incompatibility with elastomer.

11
A failure mode can be defined as a physical description of the way a function has
failed to be performed as intended. A failure mode might have more than one
level depending on the complexity of the defined function (Stamatis, 2003).
Some common radial shaft seal failure modes and their causes are explained in
the following subchapters.
2.3.1

Mechanical damage to seal lip

The lip on radial shaft seals is easily damaged on assembly. An example of this is
shown in Figure 7. Common causes for this damage are sharp edge on shaft end
and seal dragged over splines or keyway on shaft (Flitney, 2007).

Figure 7. A cut damaged seal lip (Horve, 1992).

2.3.2

Axial cracking or hardening of the seal lip

12
Fine cracks can be formed on the seal lip creating a path for the sealing fluid past
the seal, as shown in Figure 8. This failure can be caused by exposure of excessive
or prolonged high temperature or exposure to ozone (Flitney, 2007).

Figure 8. Fine cracks on seal lip (Horve, 1992).

2.3.3

Carbon deposit around or on seal lip

Carbon deposits are a result of oil coking. These deposits can be found on the
shaft or the air side of the seal lip, as shown in Figure 9. This carbon crust can
block the lip’s pumping ability, leading to leakage. This failure can be caused by
oil overheating and breaking down at seal contact patch (Flitney, 2007).

Figure 9. Seal lip covered in coked oil (Horve, 1992).

13
2.3.4

Excessive seal lip wear

Heavy wear on the seal lip is normal during the seal’s run-in period when the
shaft roughness forms asperities on the seal’s wear band. There are, however,
factors that can lead this heavy wear to continue, as shown in Figure 10. Common
causes for this type of damage are excessive shaft surface roughness, insufficient
lubrication at seal lip or excessive radial lip load (Horve, 1992).

Figure 10. Heavy wear on seal lip (Koyo Sealing Techno, 2020).

2.3.5

Excessive grooving of shaft surface

It is normal that the shaft wear band is, similarly as the seal lip, subjected to some
wear. The sealing process polishes the wear band during operation. Excessive
shaft wear can also occur leading to shaft grooving, as shown in Figure 11. The
cause is commonly either shaft surface too soft, abrasive contaminant in wear
band or excessive radial lip load (Horve, 1992).

Figure 11. Shaft grooving (Parker Hannifin Corporation, 2018).

14
2.4
2.4.1

Main variables influencing radial shaft seal lifespan
Radial shaft seal

Many radial shaft seals function effectively with the mechanism and lip design
mentioned in Chapter 2.2.3. There are, however, several methods to improve the
pumping performance of the conventional radial shaft seal by microscopic
mechanisms and, thus, increase the seal life. Several seals are produced with
pumping vanes, sealing aids or hydrodynamic aids, as they are termed by
manufacturers. These sealing aids produce a more effective seal pumping effect
that can overcome a potential leakage during a critical phase of the seal operation.
This critical phase can be during bedding-in of the seal lip, when seals might be
prone to leak as the lip is run into an effective profile. These sealing aids will also
help extending the performance parameters of a seal which might continue
sealing when, otherwise, it would be considered worn out. They can also enable
higher shaft speeds or run-out conditions. Most of these sealing aids are small,
raised ribs that are moulded on the air side of the seal lip. These ribs need to have
contact with the shaft to be effective. Many sealing aids are unidirectional, which
is often adequate for applications where the shaft only has one direction of
rotation. There are also bidirectional seal designs available where the shaft
rotation is bidirectional or if the seal is used in a variety of applications. These
bidirectional sealing aids have a potential disadvantage, as their pumping
capacity is lower than that of the unidirectional sealing aids. Examples of sealing
aids and required shaft rotations are shown in Figure 12 (Flitney, 2007).

15

Figure 12. Example of sealing aids (Freudenberg Sealing Technologies, 2018).

There is also, in addition to the primary pumping mechanism mentioned in
Chapter 2.2.3, a secondary pumping mechanism that works by the seal lip moving
axially along the shaft surface as it rotates. This can be accomplished by the seal
lip being moved radially caused by shaft out of roundness, dynamic run-out, etc.
This radial movement translates into small axial movements of the lip. The lip
geometry will act as a pump encouraging oil liquid under the seal lip as it moves
towards the air side and wiping it back as the lip moves towards the oil side.
Another contributor to this effect is that, due to installation of the seal and
manufacturing tolerances, the seal lip will have a slight angular misalignment
with the centre-line axis of the shaft, also called cocking. This creates a wiping
action by the seal lip on the shaft, which can have a positive effect within limits,
as the heat dispersion from the lip is spread over a larger area on the shaft. This
wiping action will also pump oil in a similar manner to the seal lip movement
caused by the shaft. The misalignment will, however, create regions of high and
low pressure between the seal lip and the shaft. This will cause cocked seals to
run hotter, and this increased lip temperature will reduce the seal life. There are
also seal designs that are set to take advantage of this axial pumping effect in a
controlled manner, called wave seals. These have a sinusoidal profile
circumferentially around the lip that creates the same reciprocating pumping

16
motion as with the cocked seal but with the big difference that the inner radius of
the wave seal is a true circle. The dynamic contact path on the shaft by the cocked
seal and wave seal is shown in Figure 13. As shown, the covered area is much
bigger with the wave seal than with a conventional seal. Because most of the
frictional heat is dissipated by conduction through the shaft will the wave seal lip
temperature be reduced and thereby seal life increased (Flitney, 2007; Baart, et
al., 2009).

Figure 13. Contact areas of a cocked seal and a wave seal (Baart, et al., 2009).

Garter springs are installed in radial shaft seal to augment the sealing force
between the shaft and the elastomeric lip. The spring also compensates for the
alterations that occur when the seal elastomer is exposed to lubricants at
elevated temperatures. If the spring force is insufficient, the lip might swell
outward which will result in leakage. The spring force also increases the ability
of the seal to follow shaft dynamic runout. Improper garter spring force might be
caused by improper spring design, wrong dimensions, corroded springs,
separated springs, missing springs or double springs installed. Any of these can
cause early seal leakage (Horve, 1992).
The type of media which should be sealed needs to be known for proper selection
of sealing element material. This selection should be based on chemical
compatibility and operating temperature (Horve, 1992).

17
2.4.2

Housing bore

Radial shaft seals are typically mounted into the housing bore with a press fit to
assure seal retention in the housing and proper sealing between the bore and seal
outer surface. Care must be taken when housings are made from softer materials
with a high thermal expansion rate e.g., aluminium. The press fit must be tighter
when the housing is made of these materials compared to housings made of steel
that has a low thermal expansion rate. A seal with the outer diameter made of
aluminium, composite or rubber should be used for aluminium housing. These
materials help maintain a proper press fit in the aluminium housing during heat
cycles which lowers the risk of dislocation of the seal in the housing when under
operation. The surface finish of the housing bore should be kept between 1.0 and
2.5 μm Ra. However, it the housing is made of aluminium, should the bore not be
smoother than 1.5 μm Ra to keep the seal from spinning or be pushed out by the
system pressure (Parker Hannifin Corporation, 2018).
2.4.3

Shaft surface

The elastomeric material of the shaft seal is much softer than the shaft that runs
against it, but it is possible due to friction that wear occurs on the contact surface
of the shaft. The shaft wear rate depends highly on operating conditions and
material selection. In general, the shaft should be made from a material with
minimum hardness of 45 HRC that has a homogeneous fine granulose structure.
The harness of the shaft surface should be increased to a minimum of 55 HRC if
lubrication reaching the seal is doubtful, the lubricant is contaminated, dirt can
enter from the outside environment or the shaft surface speed is over 4 m/s.
Shafts made of carbon steel or stainless steel are generally most suitable, while it
is recommended that these should be surface hardened. In case the shaft is
equipped with a hard chrome surface, is it required that the uniformity of this
chrome plating meet very high requirements. These optimum requirements are
generally not met in practice with hard chrome surfaces. Shafts coated with for
example chrome oxide (ceramics) should be carefully machined to prevent pores

18
larger than 0.05 mm on the surface. This applies also for shafts made of cast iron
with a pearlitic structure (ERIKS, 2009).
The shaft diameter should be machined to the tolerance ISO h11 and out of
roundness less than 0.005 mm at a maximum of 2 lobes or 0.0025 mm at a
maximum of 7 lobes. It is also recommended to chamfer or round off the shaft
ends or shoulders to avoid damaging the sealing lip when installing (SKF Group,
2018).
A proper surface finish of the shaft should have small pockets for holding the
needed lubrication film between the seal lip and shaft. This oil film prevents
direct contact between the seal lip and shaft, which would cause friction and wear
as the shaft rotates (Parker Hannifin Corporation, 2018).
The shaft surface should not be too rough or too smooth. If it is too rough, there
will be excessive wear on the seal lip because of surface peaks damaging the lip
before the lubrication film is formed and the surface peaks breaking through the
lubrication film after it is formed. If the surface on the other hand is too smooth
the seal lip contact surface will not be properly conditioned during the break in
period and will also affect the lubricant supply to the sealing lip, causing higher
lip temperature leading to premature failure of the seal (Bhushan, 2001; SKF
Group, 2018).
Studies by Parker Hannifin Corporation (2008) shows that the Ra (roughness
average) surface roughness measurement alone is insufficient to quantify a
proper sealing surface. Figure 14 shows three surfaces with the same Ra
measurement that have a varying impact on seal performance.

19

Figure 14. Different surface finishes with the same Ra measurements (Parker Hannifin
Corporation, 2018).

It is therefore recommended that two surface finish measurements should be
used in addition to Ra. These are Rz (the average peak to valley height) and Rpm
(the average peak to mean height). These measurements should be kept within
the values described in tolerance RMA OS-1-1, which are shown in Table 2
(Parker Hannifin Corporation, 2018).

The shaft lead should also be kept below 0.05 degree. This continuous spiral
groove that is produced when the shaft is turned to size acts as an auger and
pumps depending on the direction of shaft rotation either oil past the seal lip or
contaminants into the bearing housing. Oil can also leak between the groove and
seal when the shaft is stationary. It is recommended that the shaft surface should

20
be finish machined by plunge grounding to achieve these requirements (Parker
Hannifin Corporation, 2018).
2.4.4

Operating environment

Standard radial shaft seals are designed for operation in an environment with
lubricants splashing or normally flooded against the inner side of the seal but
with very little or zero applied internal pressure. Major manufacturers are
recommending a maximum internal pressure between 0.3 and 0.5 bar. Increased
internal pressure causes the lip to distort which increases the contact area and a
rise in contact pressure between the lip and shaft. The combination of these
causes increased friction between the lip and shaft leading to increased
temperature and wear. Special seal designs are available for when the internal
pressure cannot be kept at the required level for standard radial shaft seals
(Flitney, 2007).
Shaft to bore misalignment (STBM) is the offset distance between the shaft and
the housing bore centre. STBM comes from normal machining tolerances and
assembly add up inaccuracies. Excessive STBM will lead to light interference and
wear on one side of the seal and substantial interference and wear on the other
side of the seal. Dynamic runout (DRO) is another type of misalignment caused
by shaft distortion, shaft lobing, shaft vibration due to imbalance and other
manufacturing inaccuracies. It is measured as the distance by which the shaft
surface does not rotate around the true shaft centre. DRO causes a local point on
the seal lip to more radially as the shaft rotates. This will cause leakage if the seal
lip flexibility is insufficient and is not able to follow the radially moving shaft
surface without allowing a gap to form (Horve, 1992).
Radial shaft seal life can be negatively affected by external contaminants such as
mud, dust and water. Contaminants able to pass the seal and enter the oil sump
can severely damage other machine components (Horve, 1992).

21
The total heat generation is a sum of heat generated by friction losses in the
bearing, seals and the heat flow from adjacent processes and parts (SKF Group,
2018).
Seal life for radial shaft seals made of nitrile rubber can be predicted using
Equation (1) where LNBR is seal life in hours and TK is the oil sump temperature
in Kelvin. A general rule of thumb is that the radial shaft seal life is doubled for a
given elastomer every 14 °C the oil sump temperature is lowered (Horve, 1992).

Oil lubrication

Modern lubricants contain several chemicals to improve their performance.
These additives that improve the lube may unfortunately be incompatible with
the seal elastomer. Disulphide additives for example give lubricants anti-wear
properties but also cure or harden the sealing element. Several of the EP (extreme
pressure) lubricant additives increase their chemical activity when heated,
affecting the elastomer far more at 110 °C than at 82 °C. This will lead some
materials to revert and fall apart. When a sealing member softens excessively or
hardens without sufficient temperature present to explain it, is it likely that seal
material and lubricant are chemically incompatible. EP additives can also create
a chemical etching process leading to excessive shaft wear. This wear can be
eliminated by using chrome plated shafts or wear sleeves capable of resisting
chemical attacks (Horve, 1992).
It is normal that oil lubricants degrade caused by partial evaporation,
contamination and oxidation. The aim of proper lubricant formulation for a
specific application is to control the lubricant’s deterioration in a planned manner
over an established period, distance, work or operation. At the end of this period
must the lubricant be replaced. This period is reached when further lubricant
degradation would lead to inadequate system protection from further excessive

22
wear. This arises because the oil lubricant has become physically inappropriate
for further usage for several separate or joint causes. The main causes for
lubricant replacing are lubricant being too laden with dirt particles, viscosity
increase or decrease beyond specifications, depleted additive pack or abrasive
and corrosive materials in lubricant. The most important of the chemical causes
of lubricant deterioration is oxidation. It often leads to formation of organic acids
and sludge. This sludge leads to formation of resins and varnish which bond
carbonaceous deposits onto internal system components which can decrease oil
circulation rapidly causing severe wear problems. The oxidation rate of a
lubricant is temperature dependent and is subject to the Arrhenius effect of
reaction rates doubling or trebling for every 10 °C increase in temperature. A high
concentration of oxygen in the oil lubricant will also increase the rate of
oxidation. The source of this can often be excessive mechanical movement of the
lubricant leading to foaming or water contamination. Water contamination also
leads to reduced load carrying capacity and increased wear. The maximum
allowable level of water in oil is often defined as between 0.1-0.2%. (Totten,
2006)
The oil level for bearings using lubrication by oil bath with self-circulating oil is
recommended by SKF as up to half of the lowest rolling element when the bearing
is stationary. Oil levels higher than this will increase the heat generation by the
bearing due to churning (SKF Group, 2018).
Changing the oil level effects radial shaft seal performance and life. The seal life
decreases as the oil level is decreased. The reduction in life is because the lower
quantity of oil in contact with the seal cannot remove friction heat as effectively
as a full head of oil. This results in an increase of underlip temperature even
though friction heat generation decrease as the oil level is reduced. High lip
temperature results in lower seal life. Figure 15 shows what effect oil level
relative to shaft centre have on the rise of underlip temperature where the
elastomer is NBR and shaft diameter is 76.2 mm (Horve, 1992).

23

Figure 15. Underlip temperature rise for various oil levels (Horve, 1992).

Radial shaft seals should not be operated without lubrication for any prolonged
period. In many applications is the lubrication of the seal area sparse or nonexistent under a brief period before oil reaches the seal under start up. These
circumstances increase direct contact between the seal lip and shaft leading to
high wear or stick-slip which may destroy the seal (Horve, 1992).
2.4.6

Installation

The seal lip bedding-in period is very important for long seal life, as the surface
of the seal lip is very smooth after it is moulded. Mixed lubrication occurs
between the lip and shaft during the bedding-in period, which makes the shaft
roughness wear asperities onto the seal lip. As described in 2.2.3, these lip seal
asperities are critical for the seal pump rate which creates an oil film between the
shaft surface and the lip, and thus increases sea life. The seal lip is bedded-in
during the first hour or so of running. It is recommended during this period that
the shaft speed is gradually built up to full speed to prevent seal damage (Horve,
1992; Bhushan, 2001; Flitney, 2007).
2.5

Root cause analysis

To solve a problem, one must first recognize and understand what is causing the

24
problem. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) can be described as a process to investigate
the cause or causes of a problem. The goal with this practice is to uncover what
caused something to go wrong so action can be taken to avoid a recurrence of the
problem. If the real cause of the problem is not uncovered then one is simply
addressing the symptoms and the problem will continue to exist. This problem
can be a customer complaint, nonfulfillment of a requirement, non-conformance
or an undesirable condition. RCA is often a part of an organisations corrective
action process, which in turn is a component of the quality management system
(Robitaille, 2004; Doggett, 2004).
Root cause analysis is a collective term that consists of a wide range of
approaches, techniques and tools used to expose causes of a problem. Some of the
approaches are adapted more towards identifying the true root causes than
others, some are more general problem-solving techniques while others only
offer support for the core activity of root cause analysis. Some tools are
characterised by a structured approach while others are more creative and
unsystematic in nature (Andersen & Fagerhaug, 2006).
2.5.1

10-step Problem-solving method

There are several existing problem-solving methods that are used within
organisations that includes a root cause analysis. Some of the more popular ones
are shown in Table 3. These models are built up of several steps that each include
tools that help groups and individuals solving problems and make decisions. The
models have different strengths and weaknesses and should be chosen based on
several factors for example the complexity of the problem on hand and the scope
of the analysis (Okes, 2019).

25

Table 3. Comparison between problem-solving models (Okes, 2019).

The method chosen for this thesis was the 10-step problem solving method
developed by Okes (2019) which embodies the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle of
management while providing more depth for developing the plan. The model is
made up of two major phases. Steps 1 to 5 are the diagnostic phase i.e., finding
the root cause and steps 6 to 10 are the solution phase i.e., fixing the problem.
These phases and steps are shown in Figure 16.

26

Figure 16. 10-step problem solving method (Okes, 2019).

This method is deeply influenced by the deductive process used in applied
research where first a problem worth investigating is identified, then relevant
literature is reviewed and hypotheses are developed for what may be causing the
problem, and last, data is collected and analysed to test each of the theories. Most
doctoral dissertations and master’s theses follow this model that is based on the
scientific method (Okes, 2019).
The objective of the 10-step method is to provide very specific instructions that
help guide the thinking of persons who are trying to solve problems. It ensures
that solutions conform with an actual cause or causes rather than to leaps of faith.
The intention with this method is not to replace an organisations corrective
action procedure since root cause analysis and problem solving are only a part of
the procedure. This method does not for example include any containment and
remedial actions, which are important steps of a corrective action process. The
method or some derivation of it could however be incorporated within the
corrective action process to greatly enhance the guidance provided (Okes, 2019).
It is useful when talking about causes of a problem to think about what the

27
obvious cause might be and what the deeper underlying reason is that the
problem occurred. The term physical cause can be used to define the immediate
reason and system cause to define why the physical cause occurred. Figure 17
shows examples of the connections between symptoms, physical causes and
system causes (Okes, 2019).

Figure 17. Example of differentiation between symptoms, physical causes and system causes
(Okes, 2019).

It can sometimes be difficult to differentiate whether something should be
considered a physical cause or a system cause. One way to identify physical
causes is to ask whether the cause could simply be replaced. A cause that requires
a change in policy or procedure is usually a good sign that it is a system cause
(Okes, 2019).
Only the five first steps in this method were used in this thesis as they describe
the process of root cause analysis that was the scope. These five steps are
described below.
Step 1: Define the problem. A well-done problem definition can help make the
diagnosis process more focused and productive. Rather than jumping to
conclusions it will save a lot of time later in the analysis if it is early known and
understood what the problem really is and is not. It is however worth considering

28
before defining the problem if the problem has enough importance to be worked
on relative to other issues and whether its scope is suitably narrow to allow an
analysis having a high signal-to-noise ratio. A low signal-to-noise ratio makes it
hard to distinguish between cause-and-effect relationships as a focus that is
excessively broad includes many similar problems with different causes (Okes,
2019).

Step 2: Understand the process. One problem solving step that many
organisations fail to take is a review of the processes that could have failed. Quick
intuitive (but often biased) decisions are instead made regarding where the
problem most likely was created. This leaves many potential causes
unconsidered. Understanding the process means taking a step back and looking
at the problem broadly before jumping to possible causes. It is necessary to
establish a set of process boundaries for the diagnosis to help limit the scope of
the analysis. The ending boundary is usually set to where the problem was found
but the beginning boundary is a little more difficult to define. It is recommended
that the boundaries are first set on well understood processes inside the
organisation which are directly controllable. If information becomes available
that gives indication the boundaries should be broadened, then doing so makes
sense. A process flowchart can be constructed when the boundaries have been
set (Okes, 2019).

Step 3: Identify possible causes. The deductive thinking process starts with
development of theories regarding what is causing the problem followed by
collecting empirical evidence that refutes or supports each theory. The result
from the previous step provides a broad view of the system that has failed which
is used as input for this step when identifying what factors are likely and less
likely to have caused the problem. The amount of data to be collected will be
reduced by identifying what factors are likely to have caused the problem as these
will be prioritised. Some assumptions regarding the causal factor might later be

29
found to be wrong and need to be revised, which is normal.
There are three main approaches for identifying possible causes. The first is to
treat each step of the process flowchart as a possible cause, the second is to utilise
a logic tree to identify possible causes at each system level, and the third
approach is to brainstorm a list of possible causes with a cause-and-effect
diagram. It is likely that the best result will be achieved by utilising some
combination of these approaches. The two first approaches are more logical,
scientific and structured than the third, which might be most suitable to simpler
problems (Okes, 2019).

Step 4: Collect the data. The use of data in decision making in the field of quality
management has been highlighted for decades. For problem solving, data is
providing empirical evidence used to test established theories of cause and effect.
The term data refers not only to numerical values but any information that can
be evaluated to improve the probability of good decision-making. Data does not
guarantee correct results, but it does reduce uncertainty in most cases.
The process of data collections starts with knowing what possible causes are to
be tested and where the involved variables can be measured. It should then be
known what form the data will be in so it can be decided how and when it should
be collected. A prediction should also be made regarding what the data will look
like if the possible causes are proven to be true or not and decide how it will be
analysed to evaluate the evidence. After all this is done, the data collection can
begin.
There are cases where some of the needed data may already be available on
record from some other process and thus new data is not necessary to be
collected. The available data will need to be inspected and is deemed sufficient in
terms of perceived accuracy, precision of measurement, sample size and if the
data covers all considered possible causes (Okes, 2019).

30

Step 5: Analyse the data. After the data has been collected, the analyses of it
commence with the goal to determine which previously developed causal
theories are correct and which are not. The process starts with having a good idea
of what possible causes are to be tested and the collected data to test it.
Predictions should also be clear regarding what the data would look like if the
possible cause was true. When these factors are known, the data analysis and
interpretation can be processed. It should then also be considered what other
conclusions the data might support, what other ways the data could be
interpreted and other data that might confirm or deny the same conclusions.
One should keep in mind that it is impossible to prove something to be true since
all data are almost never available. Theories can however be proven wrong with
one single accurate piece of data (Okes, 2019).
2.5.2

Root cause analysis tools

Many tools and techniques have been developed for usage in root cause analysis.
Some of the tools are characterised by having a structured approach while others
are more orientated towards creativity. Tools can be grouped based on their
purpose and at which point they are used. Many of the tools can however be used
on multiple points of the root cause analysis, and for different purposes
(Andersen & Fagerhaug, 2006).
Underneath is a presentation of the major tools used in this thesis.

31
Pareto diagram is based on the Pareto principle which states that 80% of effects
are the results of 20% of causes, also known as the 80/20 rule. This tool is often
used when selecting which problem or failure mode should be prioritised in a
root cause analysis. As shown in Figure 18, the factors under consideration listed
on the x-axis while the left side y-axis is used to indicate the number of
occurrences or units of each factor. The factors are organized on the x-axis with
the ones having the most occurrences starting from the left. A line is also used to
show the cumulative percentage of the factors from left to right. This percentage
is shown on the secondary y-axis on the right side (Barsalou, 2015; Latino, et al.,
2020).

Figure 18. Pareto diagram (Barsalou, 2015).

5 Why’s is a tool often used for identification of possible root causes for a
problem. Its process is to delve deeper into levels of causes by constantly asking
“why?”. As the name states is it a rule of thumb that five rounds of the question
“why?” is needed to reach the level of the true root cause of a problem. The
advantage of this tool is its ease of use, while some of the weaknesses are poor
cause identification repeatability and requirement of a deep knowledge of the
problem (Andersen & Fagerhaug, 2006).
Logic tree is a tool that can be used to identify possible causes during a root cause

32
analysis. It is a way to document the idea of a 5 why’s analysis and is a simplified
version of a fault tree analysis, which is used to analyse different ways a system
can fail. The logic tree breaks down the analysed system into logical and
incremental cause and effect relationships. One substantial advantage of the
logical tree is that it permits infinite depth in drilling down into the system being
analysed. The system can be broken down in different ways in the logic tree.
Figure 19 shows a logic tree breaking down a system by failure modes (Okes,
2019).

Figure 19. Failure mode focused logic tree (Okes, 2019).

It is often undesirable to have a long list of possible causes for which it is
necessary to collect and analyse data. It is a good idea to narrow down the list to
include only what is thought to be the worthiest of exploration in greater depth
(Okes, 2019).
One method to differentiate between the remaining cause hypothesis is to assign
each with a confidence factor rating by evaluating the validity of the hypothesis.
This scale runs from 0 to 5 where 0 means that the cause hypothesis is not true
and 5 that it is true. The cause hypothesis with rating 3 or higher will be pursued
while the ones with rating 0 will be crossed out, as shown in Figure 20 (Latino, et
al., 2020).

MATERIAL AND METHODS

This chapter focuses on explaining the work process and different steps of the
thesis.
3.1

Choosing root cause analysis method

The 10-step problem-solving method presented in Chapter 2.5.1 was used as base
for this thesis. This method was chosen as it gave relevant guidance for this
analysis. Only the first five steps were used as they describe the process of root
cause analysis that is the scope of this thesis.
3.2

Defining the problem

The goal of the problem definition was to identify what thrust bearing units and
seals should be included in the analysis. This was also done to verify that it is
possible to improve thrust bearing unit radial shaft seal life by comparing if the
perceived needed improvement could be seen in data. Data of shipped-out spare
parts were used to define the problem. These data were opened in Microsoft
Excel, where spare part shipments not including any items used in thrust bearing
units were removed. Information from service reports was used to remove data
from thrust bearing unit overhauls initiated by service schedules. Based on the
type and quantity of available data, bar, pareto, bubble and pie diagrams were
used to be able to look at the problem in different ways and assess what problem
should be prioritised. This was done by categorising gathered thrust bearing unit
overhaul data in diagrams by waterjet unit model, waterjet units per vessel
series, and waterjet units delivered during the period data were collected etc. The
data of waterjet units delivered were offset by six months to take into account
time between vessel commissioning and waterjet unit delivery date. A bar
diagram of estimated costs per premature failure of a component was also made
to be used to choose and define the problem to be analysed further. Based on this
it was determined that a further analysis was viable.

35
A discussion was held regarding definition of the term leakage. It was noted when
defining the problem that customers can have different definitions of oil leakage.
Sometimes when the leakage is defined as minor the vessel can be operated until
the next scheduled service, but if the leakage is defined as major the vessel can be
taken out of commission until the leakage can be corrected, often at a great
economic cost.
3.3

Understanding the process

Flowcharts from different viewpoints and processes were made to be able to
understand the radial shaft seal and its surrounding environment. These
flowcharts included all steps that could possibly influence the duration of radial
shaft seal life. The relevant processes chosen for this were radial shaft seal
enquiry and install, thrust bearing unit assembly, thrust bearing unit bench test,
thrust bearing unit field overhaul and test, shaft sleeve enquiry and install, and
waterjet unit operation. A flowchart of a radial shaft seal operation cycle was also
made, which is shown in Figure 21. Drill down type flowcharts were used for
these processes to receive adequate depth needed for this analysis.

3.4

Identifying possible failure causes

The possible causes were categorised by radial shaft seal failure mode to make
identification easier, as the different failure modes can largely be identified by
specific symptoms visible after failure. The most common failure modes and their
possible causes were identified based on information presented in Chapter 2.3.
These failure modes and possible causes were compared, and their naming were
standardised across all failure modes for easy identification and possibility to
disprove multiple failure modes by disproving one cause. This was necessary, as
the sources used different names for what was the same failure modes and
causes. The failure modes and possible causes were added to a logic tree. This
logic tree also included the logic gates commonly found in fault tree diagrams
symbolising Boolean and/or relationships between possible causes. It was
chosen, based on the number of initial failure modes, the logic tree would be built
up vertically as it made it easier to navigate in the software program. Colours
were assigned to the boxes for easier identification: green for the location of
leakage, light blue for the failure modes, purple for the causes and dark blue for
the logic gates.
This logic tree was used when choosing what failure modes should be prioritised
for this analysis. This prioritisation was mainly done to save time by starting to
analyse failure modes most likely to have appeared previously, but it might be
needed to re-evaluate the remaining failure modes, if data do not confirm the
failure modes prioritised.
This was done by having senior service engineer Lindkvist (2021) study the list
of identified failure modes and indicate what failure modes had been
encountered in the field, and how often. Service reports from between 2010 and
2020 were accessed for information regarding failure modes of radial shaft seals.
Each failure mode was assigned two rating values, one rating by the service
engineer based on the considered rate of failure mode occurrence, and another
rating based on the failure mode’s presence in service reports. These ratings were

38
summarised to give each failure mode a probability factor between 0 and 100%.
Based on the distribution of confidence factors across the failure modes, it was
chosen to prioritise the analysis of failure modes with the confidence factor above
50%. By doing this, four failure modes remained. A more comprehensive logic
tree was made for these in a horizontal configuration, as it made it easier to
navigate visually. The change to horizontal position was possible, as the failure
mode quantity had been reduced compared to the first logic tree. As some causes
are linked with multiple failure modes, these causes were modelled in a separate
logic tree that is referred to in the main logic tree. This reduces the size of the
main logic tree and the need to keep multiple versions of the same logic tree
branch up to date.
The identification of possible causes was primarily based on information
gathered in Chapter 3.3, after which root cause hypotheses for the failure modes
were accessed from Horve (1992) and SKF Group (2018).
It was noticed that the four prioritised failure modes could be caused by high
radial shaft seal temperature. This triggered a more comprehensive analysis of
possible root causes related to high temperature.
An energy balance was done for the thrust bearing unit which was used to
organise and base the high temperature logic tree on. This energy balance is
shown in Equation (2).
𝑃𝑖𝑛 = Pout + 𝑄̇𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑒𝑡 + 𝑄̇𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑓𝑡 + 𝑄̇𝑎𝑖𝑟

where
𝑃𝑖𝑛 is power transmitted into the waterjet unit,
𝑃𝑜𝑢𝑡 is power transmitted from thrust bearing unit,
𝑄̇𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑒𝑡 is heat flow transmitted from thrust bearing unit to inlet,
𝑄̇𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑓𝑡 is heat flow transmitted from thrust bearing unit to shaft,

(2)

39
𝑄̇𝑎𝑖𝑟 is heat flow transmitted from thrust bearing unit to air.

The energy balance for the heat producing components inside the thrust bearing
unit is shown in Equation (3). This shows all the components that could produce
excessive heat leading to premature radial shaft seal failure.
𝑄̇𝑡𝑜𝑡 = 𝑄̇𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑓𝑡 + 𝑄̇𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑒𝑡 + 𝑄̇𝑎𝑖𝑟 = 𝑄̇𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑙,𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑎𝑙 + 𝑄̇𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑙,𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑙 + 𝑄̇𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑙,𝑚𝑒𝑐ℎ + 𝑄̇𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑏𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 +
𝑄̇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑏𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 + 𝑄̇𝑜𝑖𝑙

(3)

where
𝑄̇𝑡𝑜𝑡 is thrust bearing unit total heat generation,
𝑄̇𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑙,𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑎𝑙 is heat generation from radial shaft seal at the axial bearing,
𝑄̇𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑙,𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑙 is heat generation from radial shaft seal at the radial bearing,
𝑄̇𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑙,𝑚𝑒𝑐ℎ is heat generation from radial shaft seal at the mechanical shaft seal,
𝑄̇𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑏𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 is axial bearing heat generation,
𝑄̇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑏𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 is radial bearing heat generation,
𝑄̇𝑜𝑖𝑙 is oil viscous heat generation.
Causes that could lead these components to produce excessive heat were
developed based on the process flowcharts developed in Chapter 3.2 and the
knowledge gathered when these were made. In the same way, causes were
developed that would lead to inadequate heat transfer from the radial shaft seals
directly and indirectly. These possible causes were organised in the logic tree
based on the sequence they would appear.
As many of the developed causes could lead to different outcomes, these split into
separate sub logic trees that would be referred to in the main logic tree. This
reduced the size of the main logic tree making it easier to navigate, while
decreasing the work needed to update a possible root cause sequence used at
several failure modes.

RESULTS

The most important results from the analysis performed in the previous chapter
will be presented in this chapter and following subchapters. Further results can
be found in the appendices.
4.1

Failure modes

The most common failure modes a radial shaft seal experiences are shown in the
logic tree in Figure 22. These are grouped based on where the leakage occurs at
the radial shaft seal. The leakage groups were identified as leakage between shaft
and shaft sleeve, between shaft sleeve and seal lip, and between seal outer
diameter and housing bore. These leakage groups are shown in green boxes,
Boolean gates in dark blue, failure modes in light blue and causes in purple. The
causes shown are only of the first level, and not the root causes which are on
lower levels.
Some of these failure modes are related to each other and can all appear at a
single radial shaft seal failure. These are detectable when the same possible cause
descriptions are used at several failure modes. The failure modes can also appear
either at the same time or in a sequence. The failure modes “Coked oil on seal lip
and/or shaft sleeve air side” and “Cracked or hardened lip” can both, for example,
be caused by high temperature at radial shaft seal. Identification of the actual first
failure mode can be difficult when the seal area is inspected, depending on how
long the machine has been operated after the seal leakage has started. This is
particularly the case at leakage between seal lip and shaft surface, as most of the
failure modes at this leakage location result in a reduced lip oil pump effect. This
will likely end at the failure mode “Cracked or hardened lip”, as the raised
temperature due to inadequate oil film will lead to rapid elastomer oxidation and
ageing.

Figure 23. Failure mode probability percentages with the ones prioritised marked in green.

Based on the distribution of the failure modes’ probabilities, it was decided to
make a logic tree of the four highest probable failure modes. This logic tree is
shown in Figure 24. The logic tree consists of 13 separate causal logic tree
attachments which are referred to at different levels and failure modes in the
main logic tree shown by orange-coloured logic tree boxes. The possible root
causes shown are primarily related to internally produced components, waterjet

43
unit assembly processes, shipyard processes, operation processes and
maintenance processes. Possible root causes related to externally produced
components are not included in this logic tree as they are deemed difficult to
correct compared to components whose production are internally controlled.
Commonly externally produced trust bearing unit components are radial shaft
seals and rolling element bearings. The producers of these components have
generally extensive quality control systems which can lead to them not always
taking unfounded accusations of quality problems seriously. If none of the root
causes in the logic tree can be proven to contribute to reduced radial shaft seal
lifespan can this finding be used as evidence that the root cause could be at the
external component producer’s production process. This should help the external
producer in finding what should be corrected in their production process.

The most important part of the logic tree showing causes leading to high
temperature at a radial shaft seal is shown in Figure 25. The part not shown in
this figure are found in appendix 1. As stated in energy balance Equations (2) and
(3) in Chapter 3.4, the temperature at the radial shaft seal is depending on the
level of heat produced by the seal lip and how efficiently this heat is transferred
from the seal. Based on this, the cause logic tree is split into two main branches
with the causes leading to high seal heat generation to the right side and low heat
transfer from seal to the left.
The factors leading to high seal heat generation are categorised under two main
causes, which are shaft surface speed and friction force between lip and shaft.
Causes leading to excessive friction force between lip and shaft is in turn
categorised based on applied normal force and the coefficient of friction. As high
load on lip contact point also can contribute to other failure modes, this cause is
split into a separate logic tree attachment. Causes for high coefficient of friction
are based on the lubricant film not being able to keep the lip from direct contact
with the shaft. It is assumed excessive shaft surface roughness poking through
the lubricant film will result in lip wear through abrasion, and not a substantial
increase of the coefficient of friction. Excessive lip wear can however cause the
lips lubricant pumping effect to become inadequate, leading to increased
coefficient of friction, and if the cooling effect is inadequate, high temperature at
seal.
On the other branch of the logic tree attachment are causes leading to inadequate
heat flow from seal shown. This can either appear as not enough seal cooling, but
also seal heating if the intended sealing cooling methods are at a higher
temperature than the seal. These methods are categorised in the tree as seal to
oil, seal to shaft, seal to air and seal to housing bore heat flow. The seal heat
transfer method with the most possible causes for efficiency reduction is heat
transfer via oil.

The other logic tree attachments used to describe the possible causes for the
failure modes presented in the main logic tree shown in Figure 24 can be seen in
the appendices. Causes leading to excessive load on the seal contact point with
the shaft is shown in appendix 2. The causes are grouped based on three main
possibilities, too much seal lip displacement, seal lip having too high radial
stiffness, or an outside force acting on the seal lip.
A logic tree of possible causes leading to inadequate lubricant lubricity can be
seen in appendix 4. This logic tree attachment
Although some of the results are confidential and are either normalised or left
out, the results show a comprehensive list of possible causes that could
contribute to shortened lifespan of a radial shaft seal in a thrust bearing unit.

DISCUSSION

The purpose of this thesis was to analyse if there was a possibility to extend radial
shaft seal lifespan, and if so, what factors could be causing the reduced lifespan.
The results from the analysis shows that it is possible to extend the lifespan of
radial shaft seals in a thrust bearing unit. When looking at the logic trees of
possible causes, it can be concluded that the number of possible causes is quite
large.
One of the most time-consuming parts of this project was finding and organising
the possible radial shaft seal failure modes. The reason for this is that it is quite
uncommon to sort radial shaft seal failures by failure mode as the list of possible
failure modes is long and not always easily distinguishable. It was however
chosen for this project to focus on organising by failure modes as they are easily
identified by personnel without extensive knowledge about tribology, which
should become useful in future analyses.
The possible root causes for each failure mode were extensively researched and
these were mostly similar between different sources, which raised the
confidence. During the project, the focus shifted a little from only processing the
radial shaft seal to also include rolling element bearings, shaft, lubricant and
other adjacent components. This was largely due to high temperature being a
possible cause for several radial shaft seal failure modes. A possibility was
identified that some failure modes could be caused by other components not
operating as intended and this would be first noticed by radial shaft seal leakage
working as a weak link.
The number of possible causes is quite large when looking at the presented
results in the logic tree. This tree of possible causes had to be contained at a
reasonable size mainly because of time constraints. If more time be allocated, the
amount of identified possible root causes could be almost infinite. The confidence
that the most relevant higher-level causes have been identified is high. This was

49
deemed of high importance as the next step in the root cause analysis method
used in this thesis is disproving the cause hypotheses from the top of the logic
tree. More root causes will then be identified when the number of possible higher
causes are reduced.
There was quite a lot of work needed in Excel to make the logic tree in all its parts.
Although there are several benefits of using this piece of software, among others
that it is installed on most business computers, good compatibility between
software versions and that people are familiar with using it, there were some
things that could have been better. These shortcomings were difficulty to
efficiently organise boxes in logic trees, no way to link boxes apart from drawing
a line between them and no standard way to do a search for text in logic tree
boxes. Lack of these functions makes it more time-consuming and difficult to
navigate the large logic tree without a comprehensive tutorial or guide. It might
however not be possible in reality to get a logic tree of this complexity to be easy
to understand without assistance.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Even though the best possible result of this project would have been one possible
cause with high certainty that would be easy to correct in order to extend radial
shaft seal lifespan, it can be concluded that it is better to know what is unknown.
Possible next steps are to continue with the next root cause analysis steps which
are to collect and analyse data. Preparations will be needed to know what data to
collect and how it should be collected. Based on cost, it can be attractive to use
existing data from production registers and maintenance data to get an indication
of the likelihood the different possible causes have to actually influence seal
lifespan. It is likely that there are more than one of the presented possible causes
that are currently lowering the possible radial shaft seal lifespan as there are so
many influencing factors in the current system.

SWEDISH SUMMARY
Identifiering av möjliga sätt att förlänga livslängden på
radialtätningar i trycklagerenheter med hjälp av
rotorsaksanalys

Globalt läggs stora resurser på att öka effektiviteten och samtidigt minska på
utsläpp inom den marina sektorn. I ett fartygs framdrivningssystem har
vattenjetaggregat en stor inverkan på den totala effektiviteten. En komponent i
vattenjetframdrivningsaggregat som bidrar till effektivitetsförlust är
trycklagerenheten som överför framdrivningskraft till fartygets skrov. En
trycklagerenhet består av lagerhus, lager och tätningar.
Då effektiviteten i en trycklagerenhet optimeras leder det inte enbart till
minskade effektförluster utan det kan även ha en positiv inverkan på livslängden
på de interna komponenterna i trycklagerenheten, huvudsakligen lager,
radialtätningar och smörjmedel. Detta är ofta av stort intresse för
fartygsoperatören då det möjliggör längre driftstid mellan underhållsavbrott
samt högre tillförlitlighet vad gäller den beräknade maximala driftstiden mellan
underhåll, vilket medför att framtida underhåll kan bättre planeras.
Syftet med detta arbete är att undersöka om det är möjligt att förlänga
livslängden på radialtätningar i trycklagerenheter och på vilka sätt detta kan
uppnås. Studien baserar på underhållsdata från fartyg. Syftet med detta är att
fastställa om förbättringsförslaget överensstämmer med analyserade data från
tidigare underhåll.
Ifall dataanalysen påvisar att det är möjligt att förbättra livslängden på
radialtätningar utförs en analys för att visa vad som kan påverka livslängden

52
negativt. I arbetet samlas och analyseras inte data för att bevisa vilka framtagna
möjliga påverkande orsaker som medför förkortad livslängd på radialtätningar i
trycklagerenheter.
Rotorsaksanalysmetoden används som bas för detta arbete och verktyg som
definieras i denna metod. Denna metod är främst framtagen för att retroaktivt
undersöka och åtgärda kvalitetsproblem vilket inte är syftet med detta arbete,
men grundprocessen samt vissa verktyg antogs vara tillämpbara. Arbetet delas
in i tre steg baserat på rotorsaksanalysmetodprocessen som inleds med att
definiera problemet, sedan ska en processbeskrivning tas fram och sist
identifieras möjliga orsaker som kan ge upphov till det definierade problemet.
Processbeskrivningen består i detta arbete av de moment som en radialtätning
utsätts för under dess livslängd i en trycklagerenhet.
Underhållsdata analyseras för att hitta fall där underhåll av trycklagerenheter
inte initierats av planerat underhåll utan av problem hos någon komponent i
trycklagerenheten. Datavisualisering med diagram utförs för att kunna så bra
som möjligt avgöra vilket problem som bör prioriteras. I dessa diagram viktas
underhållsdata mot aggregatmodeller, antal levererade aggregat av en specifik
modell samt antal aggregat som levererats till ett specifikt fartygs projekt. Med
detta kontrolleras om det finns dataunderlag för förbättringsförslaget angående
förlängd livslängd på radialtätningar.
Ett antal processer som har koppling till radialtätningar dokumenteras i
flödesscheman för att få förståelse av hur dessa kan påverka radialtätningarnas
livslängd. Processen för tillverkning av radialtätningarna beaktas inte då den är
en extern process som utförs hos leverantören och är svår att påverka jämfört
med interna processer. Huvudprocesserna som behandlas är införskaffning av
komponenter, montering, bänktest av trycklagerenheten, underhåll samt ett
generiskt fartygs operationsprocess. Under dessa huvudprocesser skapas
ingående flödesscheman som fokuserar på radialtätningar och axelholkar. Med
dessa flödesscheman fås en god grund angående hur radialtätningarna belastas

53
under deras livslängd och därmed vad som kan påverka dem.
Utgående från den stora mängden möjliga påverkande orsaker som identifierats
när flödesscheman upprättats, ansågs verktyget logikträd vara lämpat för att
ordna de olika faktorer som ska prioriteras och analyseras. För att enkelt kunna
välja vilka möjliga orsaker som anses ha högre sannolikhet att ha påverkat
radialtätningslivslängderna negativt organiseras logikträdet efter feltyp.
Källorna till de vanligaste feltyperna samt orsakerna till dem identifierades med
hjälp av litteratur från tre radialtätningstillverkare.
Endast den första nivån av påverkande orsaker läggs till i logikträdet, varefter en
prioriteringsanalys utförs med målet att ge varje feltyp en sannolikhet mellan 0
och 100 %. Analysen utförs utgående från vilka feltyper som uppgetts i
underhållsrapporter och en underhållsingenjörs utlåtande angående vilka
feltyper som har upptäckts under underhållsarbeten.
Utav alla feltyper valdes de som har en sannolikhet på över 50 %. Dessa fyra
feltyper behandlas vidare i logikträdet där flera nivåer av möjliga påverkande
orsaker läggs till, varefter nya hypoteser utvecklas. Hypoteserna tas fram
utgående från studier av processflödesscheman.
Alla fyra feltyperna kan orsakas av hög temperatur vid radialtätning. Detta gav
upphov till en analys av energibalansen i trycklagerenheter där orsaker framkom
som kan bidra till hög värmeutveckling hos radialtätningar och lågt värmeflöde
från radialtätningar.
Logikträdet delas upp i 13 separata underlogikträd som hänvisas till när en
möjlig orsak kan ge upphov till flera olika feltyper. Med detta fås ett mindre
logikträd vilket förbättrar överskådligheten och minskar arbetet vid uppdatering
av en orsakssekvens som används vid flera feltyper.
Utgående från antalet möjliga påverkande orsaker som ingår i logikträdet kan det

54
konstateras att en omfattande analys krävs för att få bevisat vilka av dessa som
kan åtgärdas för att uppnå en längre livslängd på radialtätningar i
trycklagerenheter. Informationen som presenteras i logikträdet ger goda
förutsättningar att välja vilka möjliga påverkande orsaker som är mest sannolika
och bör studeras vidare.
Med tanke på fortsatt utvecklingsarbete kan logikträdet ge ett bra underlag för
vilka faktorer som bör beaktas då nya produkter tas fram där radialtätningar kan
användas. Detta kan även skapa behov av att studera andra tätningsalternativ i
situationer där en faktor inte kan tillfredsställas.
