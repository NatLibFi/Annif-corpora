Title: Using the 5G 8K-quality live stream to improve Finnish cities’ functions, school
infrastructure and learning experience.
Supervisor: Prof. Anssi Öörni
Abstract:
The global digitalization and the rapid pace of network development have created a massive
demand for technology manufacturers to develop new devices and software to improve the
easiness and effectiveness of businesses and individuals. The recent launch of fifth generation
(5G) networks has offered unforeseen possibilities with more efficient and powerful network. As
the global pandemic of corona virus impacted heavily around the world, the school system faced a
challenge on how to arrange remote schooling of the students as efficiently as possible without a
decrease in the quality of teaching or the students’ motivation to study. With the new technology
and 5G-network, students and teachers were able to test new methods of studying and teaching.
The aim of this thesis is to identify the possibilities and challenges of the 5G 8K-quality 360degree live stream and how to use it to improve the current school infrastructure and learning
experience of the students. To gain wide understanding of the current mindset of the students, the
data covered in this thesis, was gathered after the experiments in participating schools. The
students’ answers from the question forms and technical input from the streaming site are covered
and analysed in this thesis. The gathered knowledge from the experiments is also used to create a
new learning theory which can be seen as a more suitable option for modern era of studying when
compared to the traditional learning theories.
The results of this thesis are limited but directional. They show that the students are already ready
to try modern ways of studying as majority of students were interested in using the 5G 8K-live
stream in their future studies as well. The participating students also gave important insight on
which type of events or lectures they would be interested to watch in the future with the new
technology. The identified challenges of the used technology were mainly related to the technical
issues. The recently deployed 5G-network and its requirements are significantly higher when
compared to the previous networks which caused several issues in the experiments of this thesis’
project as well. It was discovered that the best possible outcome was achieved when the stream
was sent from outdoors with stable and fast internet connection. However, the used equipment in
participating schools was not on the necessary level to fully benefit from the ultra-high streaming
quality of 8K.
Based on the results, it was possible to build a new learning theory which better describes the
current era of studying. This was made by connecting useful parts of the traditional leaning
theories of behaviourism, connectivism, constructivism and humanistic learning theory.
With the world heading towards more digital world, there is a massive need for improving and
developing our infrastructure to meet the new requirements and achieve the full potential of the
digital tools. This thesis introduces different possibilities that could be used in the future and
describes the current limitations of the new technology.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Introduction to the topic
During the last few decades, there has been a major evolution in the technology of mobile
generations. Digitalization has dramatically impacted the earlier way of living and doing
business, which has led to fast evolution of mobile networks and different digital tools to
improve business functions in all kinds of businesses. The era of mobile communication
networks started in the early 1980’s when the first generation network was built. This
network enabled making domestic calls with very poor quality of voice. Mobile phones
were large, and they had poor battery life with very limited capacity overall. Today,
almost 30 years later, fifth generation networks (5G) have become more and more
common around the world. We are able to reach anyone anywhere in the world within
seconds and often just via internet. Where first generation networks enabled data speed
of 2 kilobits per second, 5G easily introduces data speed of over 1 gigabit per second.
Especially since the third generation networks (3G) and the beginning of the era of smart
phones, daily life at home and in different business functions has become more and more
dependent on the quality and availability of internet connection.
The fifth generation network is expected to revolutionize the wireless mobile
communication technology. Even though it is already available in many countries, it is
under continuous development and there are numerous people constantly thinking of
where this technology could bring advantage when comparing with the functions based
on the older generations. With the highly increased demand of higher data speed and more
reliable infrastructure from industrial users and private customers, 5G has ways to
respond to the consumers’ demands. 5G introduces more speed, more reliability and
lower latency which means that it can handle the rapidly growing amounts of data better
than its precursors. That is the reason why 5G also enables many possibilities for
industrial users and is expected to improve Internet of Things (IoT) with massive impact.
(Salih et al. 2020)
The 5G network with its high speed and improved stability is expected to play a major
role in the development of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) which
require more bandwidth than traditional forms of video communication. Higher

1

uploading and downloading speed of 5G provide better average speed for video
communication which leads to more stable connection between parties inside the video
communication platform. It also means that video calls can be made with better quality
in terms of voice and resolution of the video than before with slower and more unreliable
connection.
In 2020, communication via different video communication applications and websites
became more popular than anyone expected. The Corona virus, or Covid-19, led many
countries to encourage people to work remotely from home, as restrictions around the
world became unforeseen strict to prevent the virus to spread even more than it has so far.
In some countries, students on all levels of education, from elementary schools to
universities, have been sent home to study as schools are closed. Remote education has
faced a test unlike any before, as students with different backgrounds are simultaneously
all suddenly working from home. This has increased the demand for video conference
system providers, as the customer base has massively increased when compared to the
normal circumstances.
The Corona virus has affected the Finnish school system tremendously as most of
universities, universities of applied sciences and other schools with students at an older
age have been restricted to only remote studies. According to the magazine of the
University of Oulu, half of the respondents report to be struggling with their motivation
and feel more exhausted compared to the traditional learning methods. Many of the
respondents report that the transformation to remote studying has gone quite well but the
quality of the teaching has decreased. Finnish high-school students feel more stressed
than usually as the teaching has become more based on individual tasks and there are
fewer social contacts. (Oulun Ylioppilaslehti 2020.)
During the difficult times of the pandemic, even elementary level students started to study
remotely. Finnish news was filled with issues regarding the consequences of the decision.
Students’ studying environment at home is not necessarily very good, children are used
to a good-quality food in their schools and other side effects connected to the remote
schooling of young students were discussed in several meetings with different
perspectives around the country. Especially in the families with low-level salaries, issues
with providing required equipment and parents being able to work remotely have been
noticed. (ETK 2020).

Remote studying is becoming more and more popular around the world as digitalization
and improved access to technology is increasing globally. Different tools are continuously
considered and tested, as companies are trying to find new innovations on how to provide
better ways for students to learn from home. Traditional learning theories and ways of
learning are being challenged in high pace. Finding the right technology and digital tools
itself is not enough as there are many obstacles concerning how the students are able to
learn remotely. The global pandemic has accelerated the development of the digital
teaching tools and led to many experiments, where enterprises, countries and individuals
are trying to find suitable ways to teach the students around the world with no access to
traditional contact teaching methods.

1.2 Aim and guidelines for this thesis
The aim for this thesis is to find out the possibilities of the 5G-based 360-degree live
video stream in remote schooling as well as using it in cities’ functions, challenges of
deploying this type of technology and connecting the students’ experiences with the
traditional learning theories to understand more on how the developing technology will
challenge the traditional learning. The research of this thesis is based on an experimental
project executed by Elisa Oyj, The City of Turku and the City of Helsinki in the end of
2020. The project took place in several schools in two Finnish cities: Turku and Helsinki.
This project tested the 360-degree live streaming in remote schooling and remote
teaching. The goal of the project was to test the 5G-network and its capability to live
stream high-quality 8K-video straight to the receiving end in different schools. According
to the research covered in the topic introduction of this thesis, there has been remarkable
changes in students’ motivation when the school systems were globally transferred to the
remote schooling. In order to understand the requirements of this new technology and its
possibilities to improve the remote learning experience of the students, three research
questions have been identified:
•

What possibilities does the new 5G 360-degree high-quality live stream offer?

•

What are the biggest challenges and obstacles in deploying the new technology?

•

How does studying with the new technology challenging the traditional learning
theories and the traditional learning environment?

3

The research questions are narrowed to three different themes since these can be assumed
to be connected to the gathered data from the experiments. The feedback is gathered from
the participating students to identify different perspectives and ideas on where this
technology could be used. Obviously, these ideas are most likely to be mainly connected
to the school environment since all of the experiments were executed in schools. Positive
feedback and technical capabilities of this new technology can be used in identifying
different possible using purposes in the future, also outside the school infrastructure.
Challenges and obstacles from the experiments are based on the user experience of
students and teachers from the schools and also from the producing site persons from
Elisa and City of Turku/Helsinki. Notes from all experiments help to understand the areas
where this technology still needs improvement. These observations can also help
companies to prioritize certain areas where this type of equipment can already be used
and where it should be forgotten or where it needs major development to work properly.
Finally, as the feedback is gathered from students and the experiments are made in
schools, it is important to connect these experiences and observations from all parties
with learning theories. The traditional learning theories could be challenged by modern
ways of teaching and learning, and this project is a great example of that. Ideally, based
on the results, traditional learning theories could be modified or improved to the modern
era of learning with new methods and growing access to different digital teaching tools
around the world.
Results may vary since the students that participated in this experiment are studying
different subjects and their age may differ. Some results came from the adult students as
well, but a major part of this experiment is focusing on students from the seventh to the
ninth grade, which is important since they are in the final phase of their studies before
heading to the general upper secondary schools or vocational institutions. However, this
research also holds experiences and observations from other parties that took part in the
project in which all of the participants are adults, and most of them are professional and
working in the area of business which is very closely connected to this experimental
project. Based on the gathered data, we are expected to find answers to the research
questions and have certain knowledge on how to move forward with this technology and
have ideas of what to study related to this project in the future.

2 LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1 Evolution of networks
A history of network evolution contributes vitally with the development of an
electromagnetic theory, the radio-based wireless signals and antennas that are capable of
both, transmitting and receiving signals. Italian Guglielmo Marconi can be seen as the
creator of a wireless telegraphy with his early experimentations in the beginning of the
20th century. Still, Marconi was mainly focusing on the wireless telegraphy and did not
consider much on a wireless telephony which was the subject of focus for Reginald
Fessenden from Canada. Marconi kept the Morse codes adequate enough and had no
interest in developing voice transmitting. In 1894, Marconi started testing with Heinrich
Hertz’s equipment, which were used in his experiments before Marconi. With Hertzian
waves it was possible to send signals without a wire and this led to the fact that by the
year of 1896, Marconi was already able to send signals with a transmission distance of
2.5 kilometres. After five years of experimenting and testing, Marconi and his team
received a signal from 3500 kilometres away in 1901. It was the first successful
transatlantic experiment ever reported. Five years after that, it was Fessenden’s turn. On
the Christmas Eve of 1906, the first ever wireless broadcast that included music and
speech by Fessenden himself, was aired. (Belrose 1995.)

2.1.1 1G to 2.5G
Approximately 80 years after the first successful experiments of the wireless networks
and wireless telephony, the first generation of mobile communication (1G) was invented.
It was based on an analogue system. Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), Nordic
Mobile Telephone (NMT) and Total Access Communication System (TACS) were
among the first systems in the 1980’s. The first generation analog systems were very
limited, and the system provided only voice communication with no data communication
at all. The speed of data was supported up to 2.4 kilobits per second (kbps). However,
one of the key features and improvements of the 1G was that it introduced a wireless

5

telephone. Still, the capacity was very low, and its voice link was poor. It also made the
communication process less secure. (Agrawal et al. 2015.)
The first 1G analogue system was introduced in Japan in 1979 called Nippon Telephone
and Telegraph (NTT), which was followed with the AMPS, NMT and TACS two years
later in 1981. All systems were using a frequency modulation technique for the radio
transmission. They used an access called Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA),
which had a capacity of 30 kilohertz (kHz) and a frequency band between 824 and 890
megahertz (MHz) and was based on AMPS. (Kalra & Chauhan 2014.)
2G and 2.5G
The second-generation (2G) followed the first generation in the late 1980's. The 2G
systems used a different access technology as the digital multiple access technology was
introduced with technologies such as Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and Code
Division Multiple Access (CDMA). Besides the speech services that were already
invented in 1G, the second generation had also the data support. The second generation
network introduced significant improvements on the data services, roaming and spectrum
efficiency when compared to the first-generation technology. The Global System for
Mobile Communications (GSM) was created in Europe to enable services around Europe
and to begin international roaming. GSM works with TDMA technology which supports
multiple users simultaneously (Gupta 2013.)
The GSM became very popular around the world and it was the most popular cellular
technology in 2009, with nearly four billion users in more than 200 countries. In the same
year, its market share was almost ninety percent of the global wireless market worth of
approximately 4.3 billion. The GSM introduced more bands than the previous
technologies with 450, 850, 900, 1800 and 1900 MHz and created an infrastructure, which
enabled it to be almost always possible to have at least one network available to connect
to, wherever the user physically was at the time. With these several new improvements
of the network technology, the GSM was also more secure than the previously introduced
systems. All of the data it is using is encrypted, which makes it hard to hack into. All of
the GSM-users have their own Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards which consists of
a user’s identity number and an authentication key with an algorithm and the card is used
to gain access to the network and features of the system. (Mishra & Poellabauer 2010, 7.)

The 2G focused mainly on providing services such as message delivering. The digital
signals and the data support were basis of a new technology which allowed text messages,
picture messages and multimedia messages (MMS) to be sent. However, it was the most
that the 2G was able to handle. More demanding types of data such as videos were not
available for 2G usage as it already required strong digital signals to cope with the pictures
and the multimedia messages. The capacity was better than with the previous generation,
but the 2G still needed a strong network coverage to work efficiently with the data speed
capped at 64 kbps (Vora 2015.)
The second generation networking created much more possibilities with the new digital
technology which created an important phase between second and third generation
systems called 2.5G. The 2.5G was based on the similar technology and the same GSMsystem than the 2G but it was an improved version of the previous one. New technologies
were once again introduced first in the United States and Japan. In the year of 1990, Japan
had created a system called Personal Digital Cellular (PDC), while in 1991, the IS-54
became in use in the United States. The new technology enabled more efficient handoff,
Voice Mail Service (VMS) and Short Message Service Centre (SMSC). SMS became
very popular and created the most traffic in many networks. (Gupta 2013.)
The 2.5G improved the data support up to 144 kbps with the new systems called General
Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and Enhanced Data rates in GSM Environment (EDGE).
A continuing improvement of the GSM technology led to many new features before
reaching a new era of 3G. Phone calls were provided in a new efficient way with an
improved technology. Receiving and sending e-mails became possible with the improved
data support. GPRS and EDGE also enabled web browsing for the first time.
Downloading music straight to the mobile phone was now possible with a download time
of six to nine minutes for a song of approximately three minutes long. A camera phone
was also introduced for the first time during the 2.5G era. (Vora 2015.)
The GPRS is considered as being the most important factor in the route from 2G to 3G.
The GPRS used a technique called packet-switching, which means that the sent
information such as voice or data was divided into the packets. Each packet was capped
at couple kilobytes at most and then moved through the network to a destination based on
the data of each packet. Network resources were needed only in handling the packets.
Optimizing the network resources, continuous connection to the network and the flexible

7

data transmission rates made the GPRS a crucial part of the evolution towards the future
networks (Gupta 2013.)
After the increased need of data rate regarding the voice and data traffic towards the
system, the old form of GPRS was improved to the new technology called EDGE. EDGE
used even more efficient coding and increased the data rate from 144 to 384 kbps. EDGE
used the same technology of TDMA as the previous versions of network which made it
quite easy to implement these fixes to improve GPRS to the new form of EDGE. (Gupta
2013.)
Common devices such as PC modules, phones, routers and modems were capable of using
EDGE due to its simplicity with no need of software changes in GSM-networks. EDGE
was used first time in 2003 by AT&T (former Cingular) in the United States and six years
later EDGE was used in 181 countries with over 440 networks of EDGE or GSM. (Mishra
& Poellabauer 2010, 8.)

2.1.2 3G
The creation of the third generation network (3G) started in 1980’s by International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) working on it. The first versions of the upcoming 3G
technology were called Future Public Land Mobile Telecommunications Systems
(FPLMTS) in 1990, which was revised later to IMT-2000.A task group named as Group
8/1, was a group that defined recommendations and frameworks for the IMT-2000 and
the group set the evaluation criteria which included the target rates for a new technology.
These target rates for a new 3G system were: 2 mbps (indoor environment), 144 kbps
(pedestrian environment) and 64 kbps (vehicular environment). (Dahlman et al. 2007, 56.)
The 3G is a GSM-based system and it was introduced in 2000. The third generation
network enables the data support up to 14 Mbps. The 3G network is still based on similar
idea of packet switching than there was in the 2G. Wide Band Wireless Network improves
on clarity, which makes it more efficient when comparing to the older generation
networks. The 3G has a range of 2100MHz and a bandwidth of 15-20 MHz which enables
the use of 3G for video chatting and internet services. With the new possibilities related
to the bandwidth and data transferring, the 3G also introduced applications and
audio/video files for the global use. (Vora 2015.)
8

The improved technology allowed sending and receiving larger email messages, video
conferences and faster communication. While it took six to nine minutes to download a
three-minute song with the 2G, the 3G downloaded the same song in the time range of 11
second to one and a half minute. The 3G brought new cell phones to the markets, usually
referred as “smart phones”, which were often quite large with several new features such
as mobile tv, gaming, high-speed internet browsing and better phone calls than with the
previous versions. (Vora 2015.)
One of the technologies that emerged from the era of the third generation networks, was
the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). The improved speed of data,
better networks to support services such as video calls, streaming, gaming and improved
browsing with higher speed than ever, were among the main reasons that led to the
development of the new system UMTS. (Mishra & Poellabauer 2010, 6.)
The UMTS is based on the GSM-technology. It was firstly introduced in Japan in 2001.
Its popularity grew rapidly and by the year of 2009, it was used by more than 330 million
users in 123 different countries with 282 unique operators providing the new UMTS technology for end users. One of the key features of the UMTS was its flexibility when it
comes to the international roaming. The UMTS can use a very wide range of different
bands (from 850 to 2600 MHz with future possibilities of 450 and 700 MHz) which allows
its flexible use around the world with access to core networks. The UMTS can use also
the previous technologies such as the GSM, EDGE, WCDMA, HSPA etc. to provide its
services with the help of the local common core networks. (Mishra & Poe2010, 8.)

2.1.3 4G
History of a smartphone
The first cellular telephone was reportedly introduced by Motorola in 1973, when a
company employee called from Manhattan to New Jersey. The call was made with
Motorola DynaTAC 8000x, which was sold for public ten years after the first call.
However, the first ever analogic first-generation phone service was launched in Tokyo by
NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone). Despite of the first mobile phone services
launched in the late 1970's, the technology itself became popular much later. A US-based
company Ameritech Mobile introduced the first 1G phone in the United States which was
followed by Motorola with Motorola DynaTAC 800x within six months from the
9

Ameritech Mobile's first launch. DynaTAC was quite heavy with the weight of over two
pounds, and it took ten hours of charging for a half an hour call. In 1989, Motorola
launched a new model called 9800x which was a smaller version with flip-up mouthpiece
system. (ScienceNode 2018.)
Following the first GSM-call in 1991, Nokia introduced the first GSM-phone in 1992.
Nokia 1011 supported text-messaging which was a new feature for the smartphones of
that era. Two years later, IBM released a model named "Simon" which can be seen as the
first actual smartphone since it had features such as sending email and faxes, touchscreen
with stylus, calendar, address book and other features that were not introduced before.
However, even though it was ahead of its time, the web browsing was not available at all
in IBM Simon. (ScienceNode 2018.)
The first 3G network was created in 2001 in Japan, which allowed people to attend video
conferences and send e-mails with attachments, but the revolution of smartphones took
place several years later. The most drastic change in the history of smartphones became
in 2007 when Steve Jobs and Apple introduced the first model of iPhone. There were
many differences between the iPhone and other mobile phones of the time. The Apple
iPhone had a large touchscreen as others were mainly using keypads. The Apple iPhone
was also able to browse web sites in the similar fashion than a desktop computer when
the alternative phones were only able to use much more simple versions of websites.
(ScienceNode 2018.)
Reasons for 4G/LTE development
A Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and the fourth generation networks (4G) were the results
of the hugely increased growth of data in the third generation era of the mobile networks.
Mobile data faced an explosive peak of growth after 2007, when Apple launched their
first smartphone called “iPhone” which became widely popular. Apple was followed by
Google a year later as Google launched their own new devices with a new system of
Android. During the years from 2007 to 2011, the amount of data increased with a factor
of more than a hundred. The new Apple and Google smartphones supported mobile
applications in a way that was never seen before which led to a massive change in the
culture of using the mobile phones. The smartphones were also much more appealing and
offered unforeseen user experience, which resulted in numerous sold smartphones in the

10

start of 4G era. All of the changes led to a point where the rates of data consumption had
exploded and the current second and third generation networks were struggling with the
requirements of a new user base. Increased demand of the better data capacity was one of
the main reasons to the need of fourth generation networks. (Cox 2012,8-10.)
Launch of 4G
The first commercial launch of the fourth generation mobile telephony was introduced by
Finnish company called TeliaSonera in the end of 2009. The launch was proceeded in
two of the company's Nordic headquarters: Stockholm and Oslo. Approximately a year
later, the 4G was launched in Finland with its services available to two cities: Helsinki
(capital) and Turku. (Telia.com 2020.)

2.1.4 5G
Launch of 5G
The fifth generation networks (5G) were launched in the end of 2010's. The idea and
purpose of the 5G is to provide better coverage and connectivity when compared to the
previous versions of networks such as the 4G. The 5G supports wireless World Wide
Web (referred also as WWWW) which can be seen as wireless and limitless
communication as the 4G is more about WiFi and LTE networks. The 5G provides high
speed with the data bandwidth of more than one gigabit per second (gbps). The 5G
network should also maintain better performance levels and have much less latency than
the previous technologies. (Lopa 2015.)
All of the networks from the 1G to the 4G have brought new technology, which has led
to the increasing number of mobile users and a massive growth of the whole industry.
With more connected devices with different usages, the capability of the 3G and the 4G
has been questioned when it comes to Internet of Things (IoT). The 5G is expected to
make a big improvement on e-commerce, e-transactions and e-management due to its
improved ability to provide high-speed internet and better capacity. While the 5G will
improve the current possibilities with higher speed and better data handling, it needs to
support the IoT which will have billions of different types of devices connected through
the internet. This link between the 5G and the IoT will consist of all elements of a society
with different dimensions, which means that it will likely control a massive number of

11

functions in all areas of life. The 5G is also expected to fulfil the wishes of several future
innovations that have lacked from network requirements before. (Salih et al. 2020.)
5G and IoT
The IoT is already in a wide use with the current 4G networks. However, there are many
future applications with a major need of improved networks that would support their
technology. With its improved coverage and connectivity, the 5G is expected to be the
solution for many of these concerns and the increasing number of requirements of the
future innovations. Besides already mentioned coverage and connectivity, there is a
growing need of security, lower latency, increased reliability and trustworthy for many
IoT devices waiting for the actual implementation of the new 5G technology. Gartner
expects over 20 billion IoT devices to be connected through machine-to-machine (M2M)
by the end of 2020. Evolving 5G network has a major role in the development of the new
economic and social needs around the world. The current 4G network supports the
transmission speed of 1Gbps which can be improved up to 10 Gbps with the 5G
technology. Where the 4G has challenges with disruptions such as signal problems, the
5G provides more stable connection. (Li et al. 2018.)

Figure 1 - 5G coverage map (Speedtest.net: Ookla 5G Map)

Picture 1 is a screenshot from the continuously updating map of worldwide 5G-coverage.
From the picture, we are able to say that 5G is still mainly located in more developed

12

countries. For example, almost the whole continent of Africa is still without the 5Gcoverage. The US and multiple countries from Europe are among the most covered areas
with Japan, Australia and few others from the other continents. However, there are big
differences on how crowded the countries with the most coverage are. For instance,
Finland seems to have 309 locations with 5G, where Australia has about 800 which is
much more but Australia is multiple times bigger than Finland. Thus, the map shows well
where the technology is deployed and developed, but it does not provide that much
information on whether the coverage around the country is good or not. (Speedtest.net
2021.)
According to the MIT Technology Review, the impact of 5G to the global GDP (Gross
Domestic Product) can be the size of the entire economy of the country of India. The
research expects this to take place before the year of 2035. It is commonly believed by
scientists that the 5G could create and renew the entire ecosystem in the future. The 5G
is also expected to lower the costs of manufacturing as smart factories could be
introduced, and 5G’s efficiency to gather and process data could improve the efficiency
and lower the amount of energy consumption. (Forbes 2019.)

2.1.5 5G coverage in Finland
The three of the major network providers in Finland are Elisa Saunalahti, DNA and Telia,
which are used by most of the individuals and companies based in Finland. There are also
few other operators that are operating in Finland but their impact on the 5G and its future
is relatively small and therefore we are focusing on the three major operators.
According to Elisa’s annual report of 2020, Elisa’s 5G-network is covering over 2 million
people in Finland. The company also announced that they had sold over 200 000 5G
phone subscriptions in the end of 2020. Elisa, Nokia and Qualcomm Technologies
worked together to achieve the highest speed of the 5G networks in the world, 8 gigabytes
per second. Elisa increased the number of 5G devices from four to over 50 and the amount
of data used by their customers was increased by 34%. (Elisa 2020.)
The 5G-coverage of DNA in Finland was over 1,8 million in the end of 2020. The
company announced that in the end of 2020, their 5G was covering over 80 different
locations. According to their annual report, the customers of DNA used the most data per

13

person in the world with over 33 gigabytes per month, which introduced an increase of
over 7 gigabytes from 2019 (25,4 gigabytes per month). (DNA 2020.)
Telia announced in the end of 2020, that their 5G-coverage was over 40% of the Finnish
people. According to their annual report, Telia seeks to provide their customers a better
5G service via their new collaboration with Nokia and Ericsson, which aims to overall
5G development. Telia’s 5G network covers 57 different locations throughout Finland.
(Telia 2020.)
In June of 2020, Finland held an auction of the 5G-licenses for the next 13 years (until
2033). The auction consisted of three 800 MHz bands of 25.1-27.5 GHz range that could
be used in Finland. All of the three bands were sold by their starting price of
approximately 7 million euros each. Elisa won the frequencies of 25.1 to 25.9, Telia got
25.9 to 26.7 and DNA won the frequencies from 26.7 to 27.5. (Reuters 2020.)

2.2 High-definition video and live streaming
2.2.1 Evolution of video technology
Virtual reality (VR) and 3D technology have gathered growing interest from developers
and potential end users in the recent years. A 360-degree VR-video simply means that the
camera is constantly filming to all directions and forms a picture where the end user can
decide what and where to look during the playback. It can be done with VR-glasses where
the user can look around with head movement or using a platform where the picture can
be moved by touching the screen or by mouse clicks. However, despite its advanced
technology, the VR and 3D media are struggling with the video quality and resolution.
As it is the most developed system so far, it has a large number of requirements. Higher
bitrate needs of VR displays creates major challenges on how to transfer the heavy 360
degrees video which enables virtual reality. It is often considered that a 4K resolution is
a minimum requirement for VR video. The 4K resolution (usual standard of 3840x2160
horizontal pixels) requires a major bandwidth support to make the streamed video appear
with reasonable quality and the challenge will be even bigger with the evolving 8K
(7680x4320 horizontal pixels) technology.(Hosseini & Swaminathan 2017.)
Even though the 360 live videos are still lacking certain things such as acceptable quality
or properly functioning motions due to its requirements of the bandwidth, the 360-degree
14

videos have become more popular. Worldwide platforms such as Facebook, Periscope
and YouTube support 360-degree videos in which their users can control the video and
look around. However, these are mainly for the playback videos and live streaming of the
360 video is still rare. To run the high-quality 360-degree live stream, it requires a lot
from the broadcasting site and also from the viewers point of view, as the equipment and
connection requirements for a seamless video broadcast are much harder to gain than the
ones with the still content or playback video. The whole process consists of three parts: a
broadcaster, a streaming server and viewers. The broadcaster uses a 360-degree
panoramic camera to film and uploads it to the server where it is re-encoded (in real time)
in several possible qualities and forwarded for the viewers, who are able to choose
suitable quality in which to watch the live stream. With several qualities to choose from,
more people are able to watch the video, even if their connection is not enough for the
top quality that the broadcasting site and the streaming server are capable of sending.
(Xing et al. 2019.)

2.2.2 Virtual reality (VR)
The virtual reality is based on an interface which is a simulation of the environment where
the video is being filmed at the certain time. The VR provides new features for users such
as different camera angles, zooming, grabbing the picture and moving it to the wanted
direction with just touch of the fingers. This also reduces, or completely removes, the
need of all symbols and figures that take place in the traditional form of video. The basis
of the VR are immersion and interactivity. Immersion can be explained as its key idea is
to remove distractions and everything aims to the results wanted by the participating
workers. Interactive communication between humans through the virtual world has been
part of the technology development for a long time but with the virtual reality, it has taken
a whole new level. The VR can be seen as a three-part technology, which includes
response to the user actions, a real time three-dimension (3D) graphics and a sense of
immersion. (Zheng et al. 1998.)
Despite its breakthrough during the last few decades, the VR-technology is not a new
invention. In the early forms of the VR, it could be seen in the certain sectors such as
automobile and military, where first VR-related applications were introduced and used in
a specific use at the 1970’s. Since the development of the recent years, the VR has recently
become more affordable for everyone. Computers have developed massively in the recent

15

years, which has also made a significant difference in VR technology as the new graphic
cards are much more likely to meet the requirements of the VR live video. Additionally,
there has been major improvements in the VR-technology related to ergonomic use and
comfort for the users. As it was mentioned before, virtual reality devices and access to
the technology has become more affordable with software and devices developed by the
companies such as Microsoft and HTC. (El Beheiry et al. 2019.)
The user-experience has major differences between the traditional 3D and VR. With the
3D, the user usually watches the video or picture from the monitor of the computer. With
the VR, the user has access to the feeling of being inside the video, which generates more
realistic experience compared to the traditional 3D. Especially in the beginning and in the
first-time experiences, there are positive surprises for the users which helps the VRproducts to become more popular. This can be seen in the recent development of the VRtechnology used in video games and film industry, where these forms of VR have become
very popular, even though there are still much room to improve in the systems and
software. (El Beheiry et al. 2019.)
However, even though the VR is still not a leading force in science, the technology has a
lot of potential for the science usage as well. Due to its interactive and immersive
possibilities, the VR could totally change the traditional laboratory work as it provides
the workers with a lot of new tools. For instance, different objects can be seen from
different angles with different point-of-view than before, which could offer the scientists
more insight and more data to help their work. With its hands-free technology, the VR
could also help workers to be able to do something else with their hands, while having
access to the object under experimentation, which reduces time and could possibly
improve the effectiveness of the work. El Beheiry et al. have forecasted, based on their
research in 2019, that the virtual reality technologies will have a major impact in scientific
research in the future, and challenge the current way of how research is being done around
the world. The forecast is based on the VR’s capability with visualisation and data
treatment that challenges the traditional approach to data processing. (El Beheiry et al.
2019.)

2.3 Learning theories
Learning theories are made to provide guidance and knowledge around people’s
individual learning. The main goal of the learning theory is to avoid unnecessary activism
which does not lead to one’s learning or development. Obviously, there are no exact
theory that can be seen as the right one. People have different ways of learning and some
of the learning methods that may work well with one, may be really ineffective for the
other one. There have been discussions on whether the one theory is better than the
another but due to humans’ different preferences, abilities and ways of learning, this
superior theory has not been found. Therefore, the common believe can be seen as that
the individuals are learning in different ways and having several learning theories is the
most suitable way to guide and support individual learning. (Wang 2012.)

2.3.1 History of learning theories
Learning theories are based on people’s efforts to understand learning. This movement
started more than two thousand years ago and is still studied. Even the Greek philosophers
such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle are told to have had debates on individuals’ learning
capabilities and the learning process. The history of learning theories can be divided into
two major fields: philosophy-based learning theory and psychology-based learning
theory. (Hammond et al. 2001)
Philosophy-based learning theory
All of the three famous Greek philosophers had quite similar thoughts on how people
learn and build their knowledge. Plato was known for his rational thinking and he thought
that knowledge and truth can be found individually via self-reflection. Aristotle studied
the world around him to discover truth and build knowledge. Socrates used his
communication with other citizens to improve his knowledge and understanding of the
world. Currently used inquire methods are based on the thinking and vision of Aristotle,
whereas tools with the reflection methods are formed based on the thinking of Socrates
and Plato over 2000 years ago. (Hammond et al. 2001)
Romans had a different state of mind regarding the education of the people. They were
more interested in studies that would improve society in a practical way, and they were
not as interested in mind and meaning of life compared to the Greeks. The Romans’

17

mindset was that of practical studies: they would have more impact on the development
of society by learning to how to build roads and aqueducts, which they found more
important than understanding the truth of the world. Roman education led to a point,
where the Roman Catholic Church was a very strong and powerful European institution
from 500 A.D to 1500 A.D. During this period of time, the world saw its first universities
built during the 12th century, where education was handled by the local priest and taught
to the citizens. A similar way of transmitting information can be seen in many schools
today, where teaching is approached in that sense rather than by transforming the
available information. (Hammond et al. 2001)
From the 15th to 17th centuries, the era of The Renaissance started, where Greeks’ way of
education became relevant again. The Romans faced challenges from scientists such as
Copernicus, who presented the idea that the sun is the middle of the Solar System
(whereas Romans thought that it is the Earth) and Martin Luther aimed for less religionbased education and a more down-to-earth type of an approach. Individual inquiry and
discovery were the basis of learning in the Renaissance era and the ideology of thinking
and knowledge was the priority again, ahead of the practical skills and practical-based
education purposes. (Hammond et al. 2001)
Understanding the impact of the environment to behaviour was stressed by Rene
Descartes in the early 1600’s. He identified the mind as a separate part from the body.
His findings were the basis for many scientists when they started to research genesis or
understanding human’s ability to think. After Descartes, John Locke presented slightly
different perspective. He described a child’s mind as a “tabula rasa”, which means “blank
tablet” and the term is still in use to describe Locke’s perception. Tabula rasa means that
the child’s mind will be formed by his/her own experiences. Human senses gather data
and form ideas from experiences, which continue to develop to more complex ones. His
approach for teaching was that schools should arrange experiences for students, who
would develop their skills and improve the learning process. In the 1700’s Jean-Jacques
Rousseau introduced an idea where child should be given enough time to grow and
develop. This means that the child could learn all the necessary aspects from life and what
is surrounding him/her. This philosophy was later followed by Kant later on with the
approach that the mind is a fundamental part of the thinking process and it can impact the
development of thoughts. He also thought that certain knowledge exists even before

18

experiences which could create a basis for the data gathered from lived experiences. All
of these theories and approaches to learning have showed the way for future cognitive
scientists who have developed these existing theories further. (Hammond et al. 2001)
Psychology-based learning theories
At the 20th century, focus moved more towards the direction, where psychologists debated
on whether humans are actually able to use their brains to create knowledge from the
sense-gathered data (cognitive) or whether they are only operating by a stimulus response
mechanism (behaviourism). Based on earlier researchers and their ideas, many scientists
started experiments to analyse and study people’s learning and to identify the best way to
teach. (Hammond et al 2001.)
In the early 1900’s, Edward Thorndike introduced an approach stating that people learn
from experiences described as trial-and-error. His idea was that by connecting positive
responses with some particular stimuli, people are able to form mental binds and learn
from them. In his mind, the process was about forming a connection with sense
impressions and action impulses. Teaching should be active, and the learning
environment needs to be inspiring to improve the learning process. Thorndike’s theory
was followed by B.F. Skinner who did research on rats and pigeons where positive
reinforcement was given for correct answers and he denied the possibility of any mental
influence on learning. Skinner’s approach was that instead of punishment and penalties,
there should be rewards and allowing the students to learn at their own pace. (Hammond
et al. 2001)
Jean Piaget created an idea that students learn by their own knowledge building rather
than from the information given by teachers. He identified that the creation of students’
knowledge was based on their own experiences and their learning from these experiences
vary on their own state of development in different sectors. This was later extended by a
Russian scientist Vygotsky, who believed that learning should always include social
interaction. He stressed the major role of students’ culture and language in advanced
thinking and improving their skills and ideas with their teachers. All this aimed for the
point, where teachers could be able to give responding teaching to the child’s stage of
mind at the particular time. This would bring out the best results in terms of child’s ability

19

to receive and adopt the given information and transfer it to knowledge. (Hammond et al.
2001)

2.3.2 Behaviourism
The important development of science during the early 20th century led to new
approaches to the existing knowledge of different learning theories. Experimentations and
different tests of learning using animals and their behaviour were introduced at the
beginning of the 20th century. The most famous scientist was Ivan Pavlov, whose
experiments on dogs and bells were among the first ones studying behavioural actions in
1903. During his experiments, Pavlov noticed that dogs' behaviour changed over time.
Dogs were able to learn to anticipate food with different stimuli such as a bowl where the
food is served, sounds that were related to the fact that they are about to get food, and it
was noticeable that dogs learned all these quite quickly. Since the success of these
experimentations, Pavlov created a learning process where changing behaviour was
paired with stimuli. This process was the key to the upcoming general advancement in
understanding learning by association. (Stewart 2012.)
Pavlov's conditioning brings together every-day learning and shaping of perceptions.
Stewart describes this with the following example: "Students are not born, for example
with a fear of exams, but test anxiety can develop from association with previous negative
experiences. Similar experimental work blossomed in the United States, deepening our
understanding of learning through association, reinforcement and incremental growth
(Thorndike 1898)". Pavlov's stimuli pairing -based learning was followed by Skinner's
experiments in the late 1930's. Skinner's experiments were based on rewarding animals
such as rats and pigeons after they had performed a task they were supposed to do. Results
of these experiments showed that behaviour could be guided in the wanted direction using
different tasks connected to different positive rewards. (Stewart 2012.)

2.3.3 Constructivism
The research of cognitivists consists of how we store, retrieve and process information,
as well as how our thinking improves and how we absorb all new experiences to
understand the world better. Researchers are seeking more insight on the unanswered
questions from the behavioural experiments. For instance, they are trying to find answers
on why different age groups think differently, what are moral and ethical thinking is or
20

how do we adapt different information to solve problems. Cognitive research also
strongly focuses on how different people act and think differently than others and what
this is based on. (Stewart 2012.)
The first early known researcher was Jean Piaget, starting in the 1920's, as he compared
children’s thinking with adults’ and noticed that it seemed illogical, which was the basis
on the next research on how thinking changes when humans grow up and mature. In the
year of 1952, Piaget introduced his theory that children are developing different ways off
perceiving, interpreting and gaining meaning in different phases of their growth. With
different tests and observations, Piaget formed a sequence of cognitive levels which were
progressed by children which was crucial for teaching as it stated that there are different
stages in children's growth, which indicated that they are adopting the information
differently and it should modify the teaching models depending on the age group in
question. (Stewart 2012.)
Besides his interest in children's cognitive capabilities, Piaget also focused on maturing
brains. He noticed that during growth, humans started to develop frameworks where we
store knowledge and experience and as children grow, they are more and more capable
of having more of these frameworks before being adults with massive amount of
information and experiences that are being used in everyday life. The following was said
by Piaget in 1970: "To present an adequate notion of learning one must first explain how
the individual manages to construct and invent, not merely how he repeats and copies".
This was his basis on the understanding that learning must be self-active which means
that children need to understand and learn something themselves and they need time to
process everything. With too rapid pace of teaching, children are not able to learn on their
own which has negative impact on their progress. (Stewart 2012.)

2.3.4 Humanistic learning theory
Humanistic learning theory (humanism) is similar to constructivism in many ways. In the
centre of humanism is the thought of self-actualization and the idea that everyone is
working towards fulfilling their needs. It has been described as hierarchy of needs where
self-actualization is at the top. Self-actualization means that one feels that all needs are
being met - at least for brief moments. Self-actualization is the ultimate goal that everyone
is working for and the environment where one is working plays a major role in either

21

making it easier to fulfil the needs or making it harder. These needs can be both physical
and emotional and to achieve self-actualization, all of these need to be met. For instance,
a safe and comfortable place to learn, enough food and support from teachers or other
relevant persons to one's learning are factors that can lead to better results of learning and
achieving self-actualization. (WGU 2020.)
Well-performed humanistic learning theory can lead to a point where knowledge and skill
set is developing when students start to understand themselves and others better. With
more understanding, students are more likely to make personal connections which also
improves their learning. Meaningful and important connections are connected to more
effective learning as students have already connected to the topic on some level. Despite
of its many positive parts, there are also problems with humanistic learning theory.
Students can suffer from teachers expecting them to be passive learners or they can be
influenced by rewards, competition or they are worrying about what happens if they fail.
Students can be also forced to learn in ways that are unnatural for them. With an emotional
side in humanistic learning theory as well, a cold approach by the teachers or pressure to
think or act similarly with the common group of humans inside this particular learning
environment can cause big obstacles on a way to more effective learning experience for
both, teachers and students. However, the humanistic theory challenges the traditional
methods of studying where all students are expected to study in similar ways, learn the
same contents and following the same path with each other. In humanistic theory,
students' learning should be more self-directed and requires less guidance from teachers
and the traditional curriculum. Also, the topics of the classes should be relevant for the
students studying inside the classroom, and they should be interested in the particular
subject to enable the best possible outcome. Students should be treated individually and
by understanding that all of them are unique and have different interests and emotions.
The best outcome could be produced in non-threatening environment where students are
keen to learn and have been taught different ways to improve their learning. (Johnson
2014.)

2.3.5 Connectivism
Connectivism is one of the most recent learning theories. It is based on people's
connections and the main idea is that people are learning through these formed
connections. Connections can be between people or with hobbies, or objectives that have

22

influence in one's learning. For instance, using digital tools to teach students can cause
positive effects on their learning and mean that they are having desired connections to
learning, and thus it helps them to learn better than without these tools. Group work and
working with other people creates connections and can also have positive impact on
motivation and learning of the individuals. (WGU 2020.)
Connectivism and formed connections build a network where all members of the network
are sharing information inside the network, which can be used to build important
knowledge for the network members, often referred as nodes. Learning can be seen as
actionable since all nodes of the network are working on behalf of the group as they are
learning and developing the network all the time with their own actions. Interaction inside
the group means that all nodes of the group are learning without a doubt through the
interactive environment. (Herlo 2016.)
Characterizing connectivism can be described with three different approaches:
knowledge, learning and community. All of these three are connected to each other and
forming a cycle, where knowledge informs learning, our learning informs a community
and the community creates knowledge. The cycle in question can also be reversed and it
would work in that sense as well. (Herlo 2016.)
A precise example of connectivism in action is massive open online courses (MOOC),
which were created by Siemens, Downes and Cormier who have also published important
studies regarding connectivism. Downes (2014) describes the MOOC as a course, where
individuals can engage, collaborate and connect with others in a specific network.
Courses are arranged online with study tools such as e-books, videos, e-library and other
online tools and online tasks created by the arranging personnel for the students
participating in a usually free and open course. MOOC also gives students options
compared to the traditional school systems. Students are able to choose only the courses
they want, and they can take those courses in their free time, but they are often accepted
as the school courses as well and help to move students’ studies forward in addition to
their learning and being able to study something that they have interest in. Connectivism
has faced much criticism since it is the first approach to heavily challenge the traditional
way of learning. However, connectivism and its way of learning could become more and
more useful and popular since it is deeply linked with the evolving technology and
Internet. (Herlo 2016.)

3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
3.1 Data collecting methods
3.1.1 Question forms for students
The data was collected from students and teachers from participating schools with an
electronic question form. The students had access to the question form from their own
school intranet called “Wilma”. Teachers were also asked to remind the students to fill
in the questionnaire after the lessons and give feedback. Three of the questions were
answered with numbers from zero to ten (0-10). The fourth question was answered by
choosing from two alternatives: Yes or No. The example of question form (in Finnish)
can be seen below in Picture 1.

All informal feedback was gathered in every single lecture that took part in the
experimental project. All three questions used in this thesis are analysed individually with
an additional part of each lecture where text feedback is discussed in its own sector. All
of the answers were given in Finnish, so the results are translated as accurately as possible
to English.

3.1.2 Data collection by Elisa employees
The Finnish mobile operator and network provider company Elisa was a leading force in
this experimental project. Elisa provided all the necessary equipment such as cameras,
laptops, virtual reality glasses and 5G routers. Where cities of Turku and Helsinki took
more responsibility in finding participating schools and organizing the lectures, Elisa took
care of all the technical requirements and needs for this project. Obviously, it was very
important to gather information and knowledge on how the equipment responded to the
cause and what issues or difficulties was detected during this project. All information was
put together in a Excel-file which was shared around the employees of Elisa who took
part in this project to get as much information as possible.
Before every lecture, employees tested the speed of the internet, connection, virtual reality
glasses, voice volume and other factors that could cause problems if there are issues in
any of these. Usually, the testing started about an hour before the actual lecture was
scheduled to start, to have enough time to make adjustments or change something if there
were any issues discovered during the testing phase. In some cases, when was more
reason to expect issues with connection, employees took tests before the actual streaming
day to know what needs to be improved or is there a possibility to send stream for certain
places at all. These tests were found to be very important since there were several
problems discovered in some locations and even more little issues, that were possible to
be fixed before the lectures.
Since all the relevant information related to the used equipment and networks was stored
and all phases of this experimental project were monitored, much of the issues were
identified and if there was not a possibility to fix it immediately, it could help in the future
in similar projects.

26

3.1.3 Other feedback and data
Several parties participated in this project, which means that there are different objectives
from different parties. This thesis mainly discusses the project from the Elisa’s
perspective which means that there are also other perspectives where this project could
be seen from. However, in this thesis, there is a purpose to understand the results also
from another angles. Still, there could be different studies regarding how this project was
seen in participating schools or from the cities’ perspective. For this reason, Elisa also
gathered more data from the participating parties to understand more on how the project
was for each site that participated in it. Unfortunately, since this thesis has its limitations
and the amount of data and information is large, the data and information collected from
the two cities and participating schools’ contact persons cannot be covered entirely in this
thesis. Elisa held meetings with the other parties of the project to understand their
expectations and how those expectations were met, but these conversations are not
featured in this thesis.

PURPOSES
4.1 Introduction
The following part of the thesis focuses on the experimental project which was carried
out in the end of 2020 by City of Turku/Helsinki and Elisa Oyj. Three master-level
students from Åbo Akademi took part in the project including the author of this thesis.
All three students participated in the project, which was executed in Turku. The gathered
data and feedback from the experiments made in Helsinki are collected by other
employees of Elisa. All of the participating schools are introduced in the following
sections where detailed analysis of the experiments is discussed individually.
The participating schools were mostly upper comprehensive schools but there was also
one vocational school that took part in the experiment in Turku. Due to the global
pandemic of the coronavirus, there are differences according to the number of students
that were present in the classroom or took part remotely. In total, there are five
individually different experiments analysed in this thesis; three in Helsinki and two in
Turku. The topics of the lessons are very different, since there are live streams sent from
a fire station, a theatre and a church but also testing of the new teaching methods such as
live stream for barber school students remotely watching the cut. Interaction between
students and sending site of the stream was made possible via WhatsApp. Few of the
streams were sent via YouTube, which enabled the possibility for the students to comment
to the live chat of the stream. After lessons, the feedback was gathered from the
participating students and teachers. Both had different question forms with slightly
different perspective to the lessons. The students were asked about their learning
experience and ideas on how to develop the technique to improve the user experience and
produce better learning experiences. The teachers were asked more about using this type
of technology as a teaching method. All questions were answered with the scale from 0
to 10 with the additional possibility for open feedback outside the given questions. All of
the data gathered from students is included in this thesis.

28

The basic technology used in this project was based on the 5G -network and connection.
The main object was to test how the 360-degree live stream with the 8K-quality could be
send via 5G-connection, and how to use it for teaching purposes. The VR-glasses were
also available for students to watch the live feed at classrooms. The sending site was
equipped with the 360-degree 8K camera. In schools, the live stream was mirrored to the
large screen where students were able to follow it. Two of the participating schools had a
traditional system with a HDMI-cable and a laptop where the live stream was projected
to a screen. One of the schools had a Huawei Ideahub, which is one of the most recent
and most developed smartboards. It could be described as a really big tabloid as it has all
the functions of the traditional laptop in a form of a really big screen. It is also a touch
pad, so everything is controlled with finger movement.
The 8K 360-degree camera means that there are four cameras in all four sides of the
device that are simultaneously recording. Four different angles are combined together,
enabling that the video can be turned around and the viewers are able to watch it from
any angle. However, there is a noticeable seam in the video, which means that if the video
angle is right on that exact spot, that video angle could be unusable or really poor
compared to all the other camera angles. The 8K resolution demands a stable and very
high-speed connection with low latency to work efficiently. The required speed of the
internet for the stable 8K live stream should be approximately 40 megabits per second.
Even though the objective of the project was to test the 8K live stream, there was a
possibility on the camera to choose lower resolution such as 4K, which requires lower
speed and can perform with higher latency than 8K. Obviously, there was also an audio
support for this live stream. It was arranged with an external microphone to improve the
quality and volume of voice, especially when moving around and having conversations
with multiple people. The external microphone was connected to the camera via an USBcable. The actual live stream was sent through a software which was downloaded to the
computers, the smart board and the VR-glasses. After the live stream is in the sending
mode from the camera, there was a requirement for one employee of Elisa to execute a
command from remote to enable it to be opened from the receiving ends. The same
protocol had to be followed every time, also if the stream was disconnected for some
reason during the experiment, which means that it took usually a few minutes to get the
stream up again. One of the live streams that was sent via YouTube, with 4K-quality,
followed different protocols as there was no additional software and it was aired on

29

Elisa’s YouTube channel, which was linked to the students physically watching it at
school or remotely from home. All receiving sites were tested several times by the
participating personnel before sending the first live stream.

4.2 Participating schools and used equipment
4.2.1 School A / Turku
School A from Turku is an upper comprehensive school with over five hundred students
(2019). School A differed from the other receiving ends as there was the only smart board
used in these experiments. The smart board was located in a normal size classroom during
the live streams. During the tests before the actual project, there was noticeable issues
with the connection in School A. It was discovered that quite old and thick concrete walls
were blocking the internet signal, which created issues on gaining the required speed.
This was solved by wiring the smart board to the school internet. The speed of the internet
was tested before all live streams and it was always over 100 mbps, which easily meets
the requirements for the 8K quality live stream. Virtual reality glasses were also provided
to this school for the students to try.

4.2.2 School B / Turku
School B from Turku is an upper comprehensive school with approximately two hundred
students (2019). School B’s live streams were showed in a small auditorium. The stream
was opened at the laptop and then mirrored to screen with the HDMI-cable. There were
no issues with the speed of the connection at School B. The download speed was about
120 mbps and the upload speed around 160 mbps. The VR-glasses were provided in
School B for the students to try.

4.2.3 School C / Turku
School C is a vocational school for adults, which has eight school units around the city of
Turku. School C had a similar setup with School B where the laptop was used to stream
and the HDMI-cable to mirror it to the screen. In School C, there was two different
internet connections available. Wired connection had similar download and upload speed
with other two schools, around 100 mbps. The 4G-connection was also tested in this

30

school with similar download speed but with very poor upload speed. The upload speed
was only around five megabytes per second, which is very low for this video format.

4.2.4 School D / Helsinki
As mentioned before, this project took place in both cities, Turku and Helsinki. In
Helsinki, School D was the only participating school. School D is a high school which
has around 860 students. The used equipment was similar with School B and School C.

4.3 Helsinki 1 (18 students)
The topic of the lecture was 3D modelling, 3D printing and teaching with virtual reality.
It also had a virtual introduction to the university of applied sciences called “Metropolia”
which is a University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki with over 16 000 students. This
lecture was part of art studies in School D. The survey received answers from 18 students.

4.3.1 Question 1
How easy was it to use all of the necessary equipment?

Figure 3 – Question 1 of Helsinki 1

Helsinki 1 was the most popular experiment of all in terms of received answers from the
students. The total amount of answers was 18 and the average for the first question was
5.38 with the scale from 0 to 10.

31

Despite of the scale from 0 to 10, all answers in Question 1 were between 4 and 7, which
shows that not that much fluctuation existed between the respondents’ answers. However,
four of the respondents gave a grade 7 and five of the respondents gave grade 5, so even
though the results were all divided between four grades, there were some differences
between students’ reactions on how easy it was to use the needed equipment. Having the
average over 5 when asked about how easy it was to use all the necessary equipment
could seem low, but in this type of project with new technology, it could also be seen as
decent. Results show that there were no answers under a grade 4 which most likely
indicates that none of the students were facing major issues with the technology.
However, all of the grades were under seven and this could mean that the highest
expectations from the students were not totally fulfilled.

4.3.2 Question 2
Did you find the stream pleasant to follow?

Figure 4 – Question 2 of Helsinki 1

The second question was answered by 18 students, just as the first one. The average of
these 18 answers was 4.16 with the scale from 0 to 10. This question, showed a wide scale
of answers. The largest margin between the answers was eight grades as respondent
number 10 gave a grade 1 and respondent number 15 gave a grade 9. One remarkable
notice is that respondent number 10 was among one of the three respondents in Question

32

1 with the best overall grade of 7. However, respondent number 15 was also among those
three in Question 1.
In the second question, only four answers provided grades of 7 or over and seven answers
gave a grade of at least 5. 50% of the respondents gave a grade of 3 or lower and more
than 55% with grades of 4 or lower. The scale of answers was wide in Question 2 which
might be connected to the fact, that Question 2 is more concerned with students’ own
opinions of the lecture and less with technical “facts” such as how the equipment worked.
This might also explain the wide scale of given grades with many lower-level grades, but
also a few high ones. Students’ attitudes, interests and expectations are likely to be
important factors when giving grades which means that a student with less interest in such
a project might give lower grades if something is not working perfectly, while a student
with high interest can still really enjoy the lecture.
The average of 4.16 is quite low and lower-level grades are more common than higher
scores. This could implicate that some issues have existed that have made the experience
less enjoyable than the students would have expected.

4.3.3 Question 3
Did you find the live stream more interesting than a traditional lecture?

Figure 5 – Question 3 of Helsinki 1

33

Question 3 had 18 answers with an average of 3.94. Question 3 could be seen as the most
important of these three questions as it measures if the students are more interested in this
type of lectures than in traditional ones.
There are three grades of zero among the answers which could be a result of one of two
factors: either the respondent has not answered at all, or the given grade is actually zero.
In this case, the first of these respondents has given grades of 4 and 2 in the previous two
questions. The second respondent has given grades of 7 and 1. The third respondent gave
grades of 5 and 2. This could implicate that all of the respondents may actually have given
grades of 0 to the Question 3, as both of their answers in Question 2 were really low.
Also, there were two other answers with grades of 1 so this could also implicate that these
are actually given grades from these respondents. If we assume that these answers were
actually blanks, the average of 15 answers would be 4.73 which would obviously be a
considerable improvement.
The answers in Question 3 fluctuated much. Five answers provided the grade of 6 or
higher and nine answers with 4 or less. Also two grades of 8 and one 7 existed, which
indicates that there were also students that would be clearly interested in this type of
lectures.
The average of 3.94 is the lowest average in all three questions in Helsinki 1. However,
several answers show inspiring grades as well. Remarkable is, that most of the
respondents who gave good grades in Question 2, gave good grades in Question 3 as well
which might be a result of these students’ interest in the topic and their less strict approach
to this type of technology and its possible issues. In Question 3, students’ learning
processes are also very important to consider as the question concerns their preferences
on how they would like to learn: with traditional methods or with the new technology and
modern teaching methods.

4.3.4 Feedback and summary
The combined average from Question 1, Question 2 and Question 3 in Helsinki 1 was
4.49. All three questions were answered by 18 students, which resulted to 54 unique
answers when combining all three questions. The combined average of the three questions
was lower than in any other experiments. However, Helsinki 1 was the first lecture given
with the new technology and it can have significant impact on students’ answers, and how
34

the actual stream worked in terms of equipment and connections and other key features
that are making the stream enjoyable to watch.
Feedback
The students were able to give feedback of their opinion on how the stream worked and
how they feel on if this technology could be used in the future studies. Below are the most
frequent comments from the students:
•

1st: Problems regarding the voice of the stream

The most common problem among the students’ answers was that there were significant
problems with voice of the stream. There were comments on how the quality of voice was
very poor and unstable. This is strongly connected to the second recognized problem.
•

2nd: FPS (Frames Per Second)

The FPS measures frame rate. If the frame rate of the stream is too high for the equipment
such as portable screens or laptops that are mirroring the stream for the students, it will
cause an unstable stream with many possible problems. In this case, the video and voice
have not been totally synchronized, which resulted to that the image was moving ahead
of the voice and has made the watching experience less enjoyable for the students in the
classroom.
•

3rd: Unnecessary teaching method

There were few answers by the students that this teaching method is not needed to replace
the traditional methods. It is very difficult to find reasons behind this feedback, but most
likely it is connected with the first two as the whole experience has not been on a level
the students would like it to be.

Figure 6 – Question 4 of Helsinki 1

When asked on if the students would like to use this teaching method in the future in
other subjects, the results are clear. 14 of the 18 students answered “No” which means
that over 75% of the respondents would not be interested in using the 360 live streams
in the future. Obviously, since the first experiment was not that big of a success in terms
of the stream quality, it is definitely noticeable in these results as well. We can see in
the upcoming analysis of other experiments that there is a clear connection between the
learning experience and how the stream worked.
Summary
All of the results presented above are clearly stating a fact, that several technical issues
existed in this first experiment. Since there were no previous experiments, no gathered
results, no student feedback and other data that could have been used before the first
stream to improve the numbers, there are no reason to think that this experiment was not
successful. In terms of the students’ learning experience, it might not have been the best
lecture, but it gave important data on how to improve in the future live streams.
The problems with voice and unstable stream caused many students to give out low
grades which is totally understandable. Most of these young students have used all
kinds of devices for their whole life and they are used to a well-functioning technology.
Even though the average of 4.49 can be seen as a bottom-level result, it is not that poor
of a result. If there were nothing but issues, and students were completely frustrated

36

with the stream, the average would be much lower. Also, there were approximately 25%
of the students that would like to use this technology in their lectures in the future,
despite of its technical problems during the first experiment. Improving the issues with
the voice and FPS, the results are likely to look a lot different.

4.4 Helsinki 2 (10 students)
The topic of the lecture was to virtually introduce Aalto University and its different
possibilities for the upper comprehensive school students. This lecture was part of media
art studies. Aalto University is a respected Finnish university with over 17 000 students.
Since the watching students are studying in school, which is mainly focusing on media
studies, it was also a virtual presentation of Aalto University’s media studios and other
working spaces.

4.4.1 Question 1
How easy was it to use all of the necessary equipment?

Figure 7 – Question 1 of Helsinki 2

In this experiment, a total of ten students gave answers to the questionnaire. It was among
the most popular experiments regarding the number of answers. The average from these
eight answers in Question 1 was 6.0 with one zero, which can be either blank or an actual
grade.

37

If we forget the one zero, all answers are between 4 and 8. The most popular grade was 7
with 4 answers out of nine grades. There are also two eights, two sixes and one four and
without the one grade of zero, the average would rise to 6.6. Overall, when students are
asked about easiness of using the new technology and equipment, they are most likely
unfamiliar with, having the average over 6 is an excellent result. However, there are also
couple grades of 4, which indicates that some of the students have not found it as easy as
most of the other students have. Obviously, with the technology, which is much based on
connection and internet speed, there can be some kind of interruptions or disconnects
which can explain the lower grades in certain situations.
Apart from the one zero, there are no grades under four and only two under six. The
results indicate that there has not been significant issues with the equipment, and
everything worked quite smoothly in terms of adapting the different teaching method.

4.4.2 Question 2
Did you find the stream pleasant to follow?

Figure 8 – Question 2 of Helsinki 2

The same number of students answered to the second question of how pleasant it was to
follow the live stream. The average out of ten answers was 6.1 with one grade of zero
from the same respondent than in the previous question. The respondent has given an

38

actual grade in the Question 3, which could indicate that these zeros in the first two are
also grades. Still, it can also be possible that the respondent has just skipped the first two
questions or forgot to give out grades for those two. Again, without the zero, the average
would be 6.78.
Question 2 followed a similar pattern with the Question 1. In Question 2, all the answers
were between the grades of 5 and 9 excluding the one zero. Nine answers consisted of
one nine, two eights, two sevens, two sixes and one five. From these results, we can
clearly see that the students were able to enjoy the stream, as almost all of the grades are
closer to the top grades than they are to the bottom ones. The level of the average in this
case is decent as we must remember that most likely, it is the first time the students are
trying this kind of learning methods and it could be confusing or difficult to follow for
many if the stream was not working that well. Therefore, we can assume at some level
that the flow of the stream has been really good and there have not been many problems
that would have affected the stream and the students' learning process.

4.4.3 Question 3
Did you find the live stream more interesting than a traditional lecture?

Figure 9 – Question 3 of Helsinki 2

In Question 3, there was one zero as well, but it was from another respondent so in this
case we cannot be sure if it is an actual grade or if the respondent just left it blank.

39

The average of the answers for Question 3 was 4.70 with a zero and 5.2 without it.
Typically for Question 3, the grades are more spread around the scale than in the Question
1 and Question 2. Question 3 is more about the students' own opinion on whether they
like this teaching method more than the traditional lectures. The bottom-half grades
consisted of one 1, one 2 and one 4. There were also two fives followed with one 6, one
7, one 8 and one 9. When comparing to the Helsinki 1's Question 3, similar fluctuation
can be seen also in Helsinki 2.
When analysing the results from the Question 3, the important factor is to compare the
third grade with the previous two grades from Questions 1 and 2. Often it seems to follow
the same pattern, where good grades in first questions are followed by a good grade in
Question 3 but it is not necessarily so. For instance, respondent number two gave two
grades of 8 in previous questions and gave a grade 2 in third and thought that this type of
teaching method is not better than the traditional teaching methods. However, the other
respondents who gave good grades in the earlier questions seem to be more interested in
using the technology in their future studies.
Again, the average of Question 3 is also remarkably lower than the averages of Question
1 and 2. Similarly with the results of Helsinki 1, it was common that students who gave
better grades in first two questions were more interested in this type of lectures and it also
backs up the thought from Helsinki 1 that these students could be more receptive to the
minor technical issues if they are more interested in learning with new methods than their
fellow students. Obviously, both Helsinki 1 and Helsinki 2 are quite similar experiments
with a little different topic, which can mean that these results are somehow following the
similar patterns.

4.4.4 Feedback and summary
The combined average of Question 1, Question 2 and Question 3 was 5.6 in Helsinki 2.
The questions were answered by the total of ten students so there are 30 unique answers
included in the combined average.
Feedback
The students were able to give feedback and Helsinki 2 produced a lot of comments by
the participating students. Three of the most frequent comments are showed below:

40

•

1st: Quality of voice

Similar issues appeared in Helsinki 2 than which existed also in Helsinki 1. The students
gave most feedback on how the quality of voice was changing during the stream and some
of the students just mentioned a poor quality of voice.
•

2nd: Unstable connection

This follows the same pattern than Helsinki 1 and is connected with the voice problems.
There has been issues with the connection, which has caused changes in the stream quality
and made the experience less enjoyable for the students.
•

3rd: Nice lecture with interesting topic

Despite of the issues showed above, there were several comments of that the lecture was
nice and the topic was interesting. One student also added that it was nice to be able to
watch the tour remotely and see all the premises with this technology.

Figure 10 – Question 4 of Helsinki 2

In Helsinki 2, more students were willing to use this method in the future than ones that
would not. 6 out of 10 students answered “Yes” when asked about their preference on
whether they would like to use the live stream in other subjects. In Helsinki 1, 75% of the
students were not interested in participating to the future lectures with live stream
teaching, which means that there was a complete turnover when comparing these two

41

experiments, as 60% of the students in Helsinki 2 are interested to use the live stream also
in their future studies.
Summary
The average of 5.6 indicates that there was an improvement of more than a grade when
compared to Helsinki 1 (4.49). Despite of the similar issues with the quality of stream and
voice, the results were better than in the first experiment. Therefore, it could be assumed
that the problems were not as major as in the first one. Obviously, the difference might
also be that there were different students with different opinions on this technology but
either way, it is a great improvement from the first one.
A noticeable point seems to be, that the topic of the lecture seems to have a significant
impact on how the students feel about the lecture. In the first experiment, there were few
comments on how the topic was not interesting, which most likely had an effect on the
grades of these students. In Helsinki 2, the effect was completely opposite as there were
multiple answers on how interesting the topic was. This seems to be a reason on why the
results were better in Helsinki 2 than the results in the previous experiment. It also shows
that there seems to be more factors on how the students are giving out the grades than just
the actual factors of the stream itself. Obviously, these assumptions make the analysis
even tougher since the answers are not seeming to be completely related only on the
different factors of the stream and used technology.

4.5 Helsinki 3 (8 students)
The lecture of the topic was very different when compared to the other two live streams
since it was streamed from an atelier of a Finnish artist and the main idea was to introduce
the workshop of the artist and the students were able to ask questions and interact with
the well-known Finnish artist. There was also an introduction to clay and ceramic art.

4.5.1 Question 1
How easy was it to use all of the necessary equipment?

42

Figure 11 – Question 1 of Helsinki 3

Helsinki 3 was answered by eight students and all students answered in all three questions.
The average of Question 1 was 8.1 which is an excellent result. The average consisted of
one six, three sevens, two nines and two tens, with no grades under 6. The average of
Question 1 is so high that we can assume that there were only minor issues with
equipment in this experiment, if any issues at all. Two grades of nine with two tens cover
half of the respondents, so at least 50% of the respondents had their equipment working
as well as it should.
Since the equipment is used for the virtual reality and live streaming, having such a high
average grade is even better than in many cases as the technology and equipment is almost
entirely based on how the connection works and even small issues can cause major
disappointments in the following live audience. An important fact is also that much of the
millennials and young students are very used to different devices and technology, which
can lead to the higher expectations as they are used to the well-functioning systems and
devices. In this sense, the results are on a remarkable level in this experiment.

4.5.2 Question 2
Did you find the stream pleasant to follow?

43

Figure 12 – Question 2 of Helsinki 3

The total average from the eight respondents in Question 2 was 8.25, which means that
the average was even better than in Question 1. The average consists of one ten, two
nines, three eights and two sevens. Obviously, after receicing great results in the Question
1, it was most likely to receive such results in Question 2 as well since these questions
are proved to be connected together.
Without having a working infrastructure (Question 1), the results would not be this good
in Question 2. It can be seen from the previous Helsinki 1 and Helsinki 2 that if there
have been some issues with the equipment, also Question 2 often follows the same
pattern. This can be seen from the fact that it varies between the respondents, as ones with
better experiences in Question 1, have usually given better grades in Question 2 and vice
versa. Similar pattern is not necessarily there between Questions 2 and 3, as even if the
respondent thinks that the stream was easy to follow, it does not mean that the student
thinks that it is a better method to learn than the traditional lectures are. Having such a
high average is also a good sign in terms of the students' learning process. If they find the
live stream easy to follow, it could mean that they are also following it with more caution,
which could produce better learning experiences when compared to the situation where
everything is not working that well, stream is difficult to follow, and they lose their
concentration to the lecture due to these issues.

44

4.5.3 Question 3
Did you find the live stream more interesting than a traditional lecture?

Figure 13 – Question 3 of Helsinki 3

The average of Question 3 is exactly the same than in Question 2, 8.25. However, the
biggest difference between these two questions is that in Question 3, there is a grade of 1
which is by far the lowest grade in any of the three questions of Helsinki 3. The third
question of if the students prefer these teaching methods over the traditional ones has
been the most fluctuating question in all experiments in Helsinki.
However, this is the first where a gap of this size between respondents appears. There is
one grade of 1 and all the other grades are 8 or higher. The respondent who gave the
lowest grade has given a grade 6 and a grade 8 in the previous two questions, which could
imply that the respondent is simply not that interested in using these teaching methods
over traditional ones, even though it seems like everything worked quite well for this
student as well.
If we leave out the one grade of 1, the average would be 9.28 which is close to perfect,
and it is very hard to find any flaws in terms of how students felt about the lecture and if
they are interested in using similar methods in their learning processes in the future. Even
if the average is the actual 8.25, it is so high that we can say with confidence that these
students are definitely ready to use the methods in their future studies. Whether their
actual learning is better or worse with these methods than it is with traditional methods,
45

that information might be available in the future after gathering more data with bigger
samplings.

4.5.4 Feedback and summary
The combined average of Question 1, Question 2 and Question 3 in Helsinki 3 was 8.2.
Eight students gave answers in each question so there were 24 unique answers in total.
Feedback
The open feedback section was not that popular in Helsinki 3, but it gathered some
interesting feedback to look at. Three feedbacks are introduced below:
•

1st: Quality of the video could be better

Despite of the excellent combined average in Helsinki 3, there has still been some room
to improve in terms of the video quality. It is not totally clear from the feedback according
to the quality of video, that if it was about the video resolution or some other aspects in
the video. However, we can assume that it is about the screen resolution. In all of the
other experiments, there has been comments on how the voice and video are not totally
synchronized. In Helsinki 3, there is only a few comments on how the video quality could
have been better.
•

2nd: Interesting and enjoyable lecture

This feedback was received as many times as the first one. It is completely in line with
the great results that were noticed already in the answers of the first three questions.
•

3rd: Possibility to use own devices (missing)

A student gave feedback that it would be nice to use own devices to watch the live stream.
As we know, there has been experiments where this has been possible, and these
experiments have gained excellent results. A proactive feedback from the students only
backs up the fact even more, that this could be the most popular form of the live stream
teaching, at least at the moment.

Figure 14 – Question 4 of Helsinki 3

Similar results followed in the fourth question. Six of the eight total students (75%)
answered “Yes” as they would be interested in using the technology in other subjects as
well. Two of the eight (25%) students answered “No” in the same question. It is the
highest percentage when comparing with the first two experiments of Helsinki (Helsinki
1 and Helsinki 2). Obviously, there are also fewer answers in Helsinki 3 but when
comparing the percentage, it can be considered as the most successful experiment in the
city.
Summary
The results of Helsinki 3 are remarkable. When comparing the combined average of
Helsinki 1 (4.49) and Helsinki 2 (5.56), there is a massive improvement in the results of
the third experiment of Helsinki. The combined average of Helsinki 3 was 8.2, which
means that there is an improvement of 2,64 grades in the results. Also, the average of 8.2
is already in the level where it might be very hard to improve it even more, as there seem
to be always a few students in the classroom who are not that interested in certain method
of teaching. However, in this experiment, there were even couple comments on the quality
of the stream which means that there are still ways to improve the learning experience.
According to the results, major issues with the voice and video quality are not showing
up in this third experiment. These problems were mainly covering the first two
experiments’ feedback section and it clearly stands out in the averages as well. Fixing
these problems seem to have a positive impact of over 2.5 grade, which can be considered
47

as a major improvement in the results, and also shows how the overall experience of the
students was much better than in the previous two lectures.

4.6 Turku 1 (11 students)
The topic of the lecture was a virtual tour from the Central Fire Station of Turku. The
purpose of this tour was to introduce the used equipment, services and personnel from the
department. The actual tour was held in approximately 50 metres high as cameramen, city
workers, equipment and fireman were lifted up with the fire truck. The students were able
to see the fire station from above and it was a unique opportunity to explore city of Turku
from air.
The live stream was sent with a wireless 5G-router, a 360-degree 8K camera and a
portable microphone and it was sent via Elisa’s streaming software to the participating
schools.

4.6.1 Question 1
How easy was it to use all of the necessary equipment?

Figure 15 – Question 1 of Turku 1

Turku 1 got answers from total of 11 students. The average of the Question 1 was 7.0
which consisted of three tens, one eight, one seven, two sixes and four fives. All eleven
students answered to all three questions.
48

The first thing that pops up from the results of the Question 1 is the three tens, which is
more than in any other experiment from Helsinki. However, results of this question have
some more fluctuation than we have seen in previous results from Helsinki regarding the
Question 1 as there are three tens, but also four fives, and these two grades are the two
most popular selections from the respondents.
Even though there are three tens given by the respondents, there are more grades below
seven than over it, which means that all the students have not been as thrilled than the
others have. This could be explained by the factor that maybe the used equipment such
as the VR-glasses have not worked as well for all the students to encourage them to give
higher grades. These devices are connected to the network, which always means that there
is a possibility that the connection is not as stable for everyone and there might be network
problems that do not affect all of the students in similar ways.
Overall, the average of 7.0 is a really good number. It was the first experiment made in
Turku, so despite all the testing before the stream, there can always be something that the
team has not prepared for, or what was working well in the testing phase before the
lecture.

4.6.2 Question 2
Did you find the stream pleasant to follow?

Figure 16 – Question 2 of Turku 1

49

Second question of Turku 1 was answered by eleven students and the average of this
question was 7.54. The individual grades given were two tens, four eights, three sevens
and two fives.
Out of the eleven individual answers, nine of them were grades of 7 or over which is a
remarkably great result. Question 2 is about how much the students enjoyed watching the
stream, and from the results it is clear that most of the students did enjoy it. There were
no grades under five so even the lower grades were in the middle of the scale.
When comparing the results with the ones gained from Helsinki, the results of Turku 1
are really good. Only the third experiment from Helsinki did slightly better in Question 2
than Turku 1, which was a first experiment done in the city. Obviously, there are many
reasons behind students’ opinions on whether they enjoy the stream or not, and all of the
reasons are not necessarily connected to the actual stream and its performance, but with
the students’ own thoughts on this kind of streams and their own personal interest on the
topic.

4.6.3 Question 3
Did you find the live stream more interesting than a traditional lecture?

Figure 17 – Question 3 of Turku 1

The average of Question 3 was 8.54 from the eleven grades given by the students. It is
the highest average of all questions in all experiments so far. The average consisted of

50

five tens, four nines, one eight and one zero. Without the one zero, the average would be
9.4, which is almost as high as it could be. However, it could be assumed that in this case,
the respondent has actually given the grade of zero since the first two grades from the
same respondent were both fives, and the respondent has given the lowest grades in the
previous two questions when compared to the other respondents.
Overall, there is not much to analyse in the results of this question. Ten students out of
eleven gave excellent grades and would clearly be excited to use this teaching method in
the future. All of these students found it more interesting than traditional lectures. One
student did not feel the same way with the others, which can be assumed as a personal
opinion towards this technology and way of teaching, since there should not have been
many issues with the equipment or other parts of the stream as all the other respondents
were enjoying the lecture.

4.6.4 Feedback and summary
The combined average of the first three questions in Turku 1 was 7.69. Eleven students
gave answers in all three questions so there are 33 unique answers in total.
Feedback
Turku 1 received some answers in the feedback section, even though it was not really
popular. Three of the most popular answers are introduced below:
•

1st: Good / ok

Having positive feedback as the most popular comment is always a great sign. It can be
assumed, that if there were some issues or room to improve in the experiment, these have
not been that major that it would have created a negative experience for the students.
•

2nd: Slight interruptions in the stream

There have been some problems with the voice and video quality during the live stream.
In this experiment, the equipment was lifted approximately 50 meters up in the air as the
fire station was introduced from the air. This type of test brought out interesting results
when discussing about technology and equipment, and its effectiveness. These are
analysed more deeply in the section of technology analysis later in this thesis.

51

•

3rd: This technology to be used in geography studies

This comment appeared three times in the feedback section from the participating
students and it is something to consider. The geographic studies with a possibility to
watch something from your own device and being able to control the directions to watch
to and so on, could be a really interesting and effective learning method for the students.
There are a lot of interesting things around the world and in the nature so it could be
something to try in the future.

Figure 18 – Question 4 of Turku 1

Eleven students gave answers in the fourth question. Eight of the respondents (73%) were
interested in using the method in other subjects in the future. Three of the eleven students
(27%) were not interested in further experiences with the technology. As this is the first
experiment of Turku, the results are really good. The combined average of 7.69 and 73%
of the students interested in this teaching method compares well with Helsinki 3, which
was the best experiment in Helsinki, in terms of the results and grades.
Summary
Turku 1 achieved excellent results as a first experiment done in the city. Obviously, it
cannot be fully compared with all the previous experiments, as the camera and other
equipment was lifted to the air with the fire truck, which strengthens the signal very much
and was not the case in other experiments. However, it is very important to have such

52

experience and to be able to compare the results to find out which kind of actions can be
carried out to improve the quality of the stream.

4.7 Turku 2 (8 students)
The topic of the lecture was to introduce a historic church in Turku, “Turun
Tuomiokirkko”. A worker of the church gave a tour around the church and explained all
the relevant facts about the church’s history and events during the last 900 to 1000 years.
The live stream was sent with the wireless 5G-router, the 8K 360-degree camera and the
portable microphone. However, in this experiment, the quality was lowered to the 4K
resolution and the actual live stream was sent via YouTube. With YouTube, the students
were able to test and watch the tour with their own devices such as tabloids and mobile
phones.
The link to this live stream was also spread out around the schools of Turku and it was
also published in the city’s web site. The feedback was still gathered only by the
participating schools and personnel in this project.

4.7.1 Question 1
How easy was it to use all of the necessary equipment?

Figure 19 – Question 1 in Turku 2

53

The second experiment of Turku was graded by eight students. All of the students were
older than in the other experiments as the participating school was a vocational school,
which means that the students were at least 16 years old. The average of Question 1 in
Turku 2 was 8.125. The average includes one ten, four nines, one eight, one six and one
five.
The average of the Question 1 is on a respectable level. This experiment differed from
the others as some of the students were watching the stream from home and some were
physically in the classroom. There is no data on whether the student that answered to the
question was watching remotely or in the classroom, which means that we cannot
compare these two factors in their answers. However, when the average is this high, it
most likely indicates that there were no major technical problems among the group of
students.
In this experiment, the students were able to use their own devices to watch the live
stream. Therefore, comparing the results with other experiments is slightly different.
Luckily, the overall grades in other streams have been quite good as well, as if the grades
would have been worse, it could mean that the reason is the equipment provided by the
team working for this project. Now, we can assume that the equipment has worked well
enough in all of these different circumstances.

4.7.2 Question 2
Did you find the stream pleasant to follow?

54

Figure 20 – Question 2 of Turku 2

The same eight students gave grades for Question 2. The average from these eight answers
was 6.8. The average included four nines, one six, one five and two fours. It is lower than
in Question 1 but still a decent number.
As usual, the second and the third question are showing more fluctuation between
answers. All of the answers are between five grades in both of the questions, but in the
Question 2, there is four excellent grades (9) and four lower grades (4 to 6). The important
notice is that the respondents 6 and 7 gave grades of 9 and 10 in the first question, but
these grades were then followed by grades of 4 and 5 in Question 2. This could indicate
that even though the equipment and the live stream was working as expected, they did
not enjoy following the stream that much for some reason. Both of their grades were
better in Question 3 and it could be connected to the fact that they think that the setup is
good, and this teaching method is usable, but it was not a right lecture or an interesting
topic to teach this way.
All of the other grades were similar with the first ones and most of the students seemed
to enjoy the stream if they had given good grades in Question 1.

4.7.3 Question 3
Did you find the live stream more interesting than a traditional lecture?

55

Figure 21 – Question 3 of Turku 2

Question 3 had the average of 7.5. It consisted of one ten, four nines, one seven, one three
and one four. Overall, the average is higher than in Question 2 and six of the eight students
gave grades of at least 7, which is an inspiring result.
As it was already mentioned in the previous sector, there were big differences on how
some of the students were answering between the first two questions. Apart from the
respondent number 7, all of the grades were following similar patterns with the previous
question. Remarkable is, that most of the students gave good grades in all three questions.
Gaining good results in all questions in this kind of experiment indicates that the live
stream has been well produced and executed and there have been only minor problems,
if any problems at all.
For the few lower grades, it must be remembered that some of the students might not like
this teaching method when comparing to the traditional methods or they are not interested
in the topic of the lecture, which can have effect on their grades.

4.7.4 Feedback and summary
The combined average of Question 1, Question 2 and Question 3 in Turku 2 was 7.475.
There were total of eight students that gave answers to all questions so there are total of
24 unique answers in Turku 2.
Feedback

56

Turku 2 got a very few answers to the open feedback section, but still a few comments
that should be pointed out.
•

1st: Good and well-functioning system

Among the total of eight students, five of them gave answers that were related to the good
and working teaching method. It is an excellent result as this experiment was made in the
vocational school and part of their studies to the profession, and if there were many
problems with the teaching method, it can be assumed that the results would look very
different.
•

2nd: Could be used in the remote studies

Several students thought that this technology would suit the remote schooling purposes
really well. These comments are really promising since this is one of the main ideas
behind the whole project that this equipment and knowledge could be used in remote
schooling purposes in the future. Especially, during these times with the pandemic, these
are very promising comments from the students as they are proactively saying that this
could work well in remote studies. Some of the students were already following this
stream remotely, but we are not able to identify these students from the answers/grades.

Figure 22 – Question 4 of Turku 2

Total of eight students answered in the fourth question. Six of the students (75%) would
be interested in using this teaching method and technology in other subjects and two

57

students (25%) are not interested in similar future experiments. Once again, the results
are excellent in terms of the percentages. It would be interesting to find out, how the small
number of answers is impacting the percentage, and if there more answers, would the
results be better or worse. Unfortunately, in this experiment, we do not have a possibility
to gain more answers. Overall, the results can be seen as great since the experiment was
made in the vocational school and the students are older, more experienced and chose to
study this subject, which most likely also means that their interest is more likely higher
in all lectures than it is in a compulsory level of school.
Summary
The combined average of approximately 7.5 and 75% of the students willing to participate
in similar lectures in the future, is an impressive result. In this case, it must be considered
that these students are already studying for the profession, which means that they are more
likely also more interested in the lectures and could also have slight impact on why they
enjoy the lecture. With the younger students, there has been some results indicating the
fact that they are giving lower grades as they are not that interested in the topic of the
lecture. To some distance, we could be able to assume that this effect is lower in this
particular experiment and therefore the lecture and its results should be seen as really
successful.

4.8 Analysis of used technology and equipment
In this section, we are trying to identify the different issues and problems during the live
stream experiments. We are also attempting to solve these issues by finding reasons
causing these problems and suggesting solutions for the future experiments. All of the
issues gathered in this section are related to the used equipment, connections or other
technology-related factors.
THE ISSUE: Voice and video problems (not in sync, interruptions etc.)
SOLUTION:
The issues with the voice and video were faced in several experiments, especially in
Helsinki 1 and 2, and also in the experiment in Turku, which was not featured in the
question form analysis since there were not enough answers to use. When comparing

58

these three experiments with the successful experiments, there are few solutions to these
issues.
The internet connection must be very stable and big differences in the connection speed
during the stream can cause several problems. This was identified in Turku, where we
had to cancel the planned experiment since the connection was not stable enough. An
unstable connection caused total disconnections and major issues with the voice and
video.
These problems also appeared in the experiments where the 8K-quality was used, and the
receiving devices were not able to handle the continuous requirements of this highdefinition live stream. The best example of this was in Turku, where Huawei IdealHub
(portable screen) was used. Screen’s FPS was not high enough for the 8K live stream and
it caused major issues with the quality of voice and video.
The issues were much lower in Turku 1, where the live stream was sent from outdoors
and the equipment was lifted up in the air. The signal and speed of the internet in the
sending site was much better. An opposite example was the cancelled experiment in
Turku where the signal was too weak in the indoor building and it was not possible to
send the live stream for more than couple minutes before it got disconnected. This backs
up the basic assumption that outdoor objects are much easier for the current equipment
and technology.
THE ISSUE: Virtual reality glasses did not work (disconnections and other problems)
SOLUTION:
There were some issues with the VR-glasses in several experiments, but these were
mainly connected with the issues of connections and internet speeds. However, in one of
the participating schools, the VR-glasses needed to be taken completely off from the
students as the glasses did not work for more than a minute at once. This issue was tried
to be fixed with internet speed tests, software updates and other actions but we were not
able to identify the reason to this problem. Internet speeds were similar with others and
software were up to date but still the glasses did not work as they should. The most likely
explanation is that there was something wrong with this pair of glasses, even though it
was not anything obvious.

59

THE ISSUE: Issues with the FPS
SOLUTION
Frames per second -issues appeared in several experiments. In some schools, the
mirroring devices were not able to completely meet the requirements of the stream and it
caused issues where the stream was delayed or buffering. These issues were also
identified in one school in Turku, where Huawei Idealhub -screen was not able to keep
up with the 8K- live stream due to its lower FPS. In this case, there is a simple fix. The
problem is solved by using the device with enough capacity to meet the requirements of
the high-definition live stream. At the moment, it is not that easy, especially in the
educational environment as many of the schools do not have that type of equipment.
THE ISSUE: Video quality (low resolution)
SOLUTION
There were several comments in the feedback sections that the quality of the video was
not as good as it could be. We identified this as a low resolution -issue, which means that
the video quality is lower than it is expected to be. In this project, the idea was to send
the 8K-quality, which is extremely high when it is working as it should. The devices that
are able to mirror the 8K-quality as it is sent, are still quite rare which we can also see in
this experiment. In many experiments, the quality of the video was really good but not
necessarily in the level of the 8K, as schools’ devices were not able to completely mirror
that quality.
These comments are still more likely related to the issues with the changing connection
when moving around the sending location, which caused issues with stable connection
and led to the lower quality video and the voice problems. This could be solved by finding
and testing a proper location with a high signal and a stable connection. The perfect result
would be achieved by a good location, a strong and stable connection and a receiving end
with devices that are able to meet the requirements of the high-definition live stream.
Summary
When discussing the functionality of the used technology and equipment in all
experiments, the results are really inspiring. Obviously, there were some flaws and issues,

60

especially in the first couple experiments, but overall, the technology worked well
considering that this was probably the first time in the world, that something like this was
tried. As we can see from the results, the best overall experience for the students was still
achieved with the 4K-quality and the ability for the students to use their own devices, as
the current equipment in the participating schools were much more ready to receive the
live stream in 4K-quality than they were to receive it in the 8K-quality, which is still
extremely high and demanding quality for current equipment.
Some issues with VR-glasses and FPS were detected, which are most likely a result from
the lack of stable high-speed internet connection as well as the devices that are not entirely
build for receiving such high-quality video than the 8K-video is. Still, it is an important
result to find out that the actual system and software are working reasonably well since
the devices are getting better and better all the time as they are being developed by the
manufacturers. Due to this development, we can expect major improvement in this
technology in the upcoming years. However, issues with the FPS in certain locations
caused major problems for the students trying to follow the lecture and that is something
that needs to be fixed as the objective is to challenge the traditional teaching methods and
if the students miss out some of the sentences, or other important aspects, it will not be
ready to use on a daily basis. These issues are simply fixed by the connection of devices
with the necessary capability in both ends, sending and receiving.
The changes of the equipment in the different locations and the different experiments
which gave us important insight on which of the combinations worked really well and
which had the most issues. Using this data and knowledge from the experiments, we can
create suggestions on what type of equipment and what kind of crucial aspects we have
to consider to be able to create a live stream with the best possible outcome. Later on, in
this thesis, we are discussing more on the identified working solutions for the live streams
to be sent in the future and also on how to improve the results even more.

61

5 CONCLUSIONS
5.1 Possibilities for the 5G high-quality 360-degree live
streams
The research question 1 was “What possibilities does the new 5G 360-degree high-quality
live stream offer?”. Through the results we gained from the experiments made in both
cities, we are able to identify successful experiments and reasons behind them as well as
the possibilities on where this technology could be implemented in the future.
Teaching and learning purposes
The ultimate purpose of the research was to gain insight and feedback on how the students
feel about the technology as a teaching method, if they are willing to continue with these
methods also in the future and obviously, if the technology works well enough to be used
in the lectures.
Due to the global pandemic of coronavirus, most of the students were aimed to the remote
learning, which has caused a massive impact on educational systems and future learning
methods. Teachers, students and other members of the school society were forced to
perform a quick transformation to the remote studying, which also led to a growing
demand for the useful and effective remote-teaching methods. An education theory
professor Eero Ropo from the University of Tampere believes that the remote studying
will remain as a big part of the study program also after the pandemic. He also mentions
that the technology is already capable of transferring the information effectively to the
students, but the school lectures are also a big part of the growing process of the students,
and it brings out the new challenges of the remote schooling. Testing and choosing the
different remote teaching methods is very important to remain the same level of education
than in traditional lectures. (University of Tampere 2020.)
The experiments were executed in the perfect time, in terms of the global need of
developing the new teaching and learning methods. In four of the five experiments, the
students were more interested in using these methods in the future than to not use, which
is a promising basis for the future development of the teaching methods. From these
results, we can make an assumption that many of the students are interested in challenging

62

the current methods with new and modern technology. The feedback section also received
many comments that the students would like to follow the lectures with their own devices
such as laptops, tabloids or mobile phones, which most likely would be quite easy to
manage, especially in the future when the used technology evolves more into the devices
in the common use.
Often, as a part of the study schedule, students are taking trips to the certain locations to
visit different places connected to the certain subject. Obviously, these trips are usually
not free, and they require resources such as money and logistics to perform, which means
that it varies between schools that how often students have the possibility to have such
lectures. In this experiment, there were multiple different locations that were introduced
for the students. With this technology, students are able to visit the locations virtually
without moving away from home or school. This could bring decreases on costs as the
only investment is to acquire the necessary equipment for the students. It would most
likely improve the number of different lectures arranged for the students which could
cause increased learning motivation or increase students’ interest to certain subjects. For
instance, students could have access to explore world’s most famous locations in
geography with the virtual reality glasses or take a virtual tour around the most visited
museums from their home.
The experts from around the world are expecting virtual reality to become more and more
popular as a part of the teaching and learning process. Microsoft, Google, Amazon and
other companies are investing to their development of the VR, which indicates that the
overall costs are likely to be lower in the upcoming years as more people will gain access
to the VR around the world. Many universities have already taken steps towards to an
approach where students are taught via different experiences instead of the traditional
theory lectures. (EHL.edu 2021.)
The similar technology (lower quality or 4G) is already known to be used in study
purposes, especially in the medical studies. The doctors are able to send the live stream
over the network to the students watching real-time at their home or school. With the new
improved technology with the 5G and the 8K-quality, the quality of these remote lectures
could be improved a lot, which could have impact on their results on how the students are
learning without them actually being in a procedure room themselves.

63

The virtual reality and its massive potential are expected to be a groundbreaking
transformation to the global school system. The results of these experiments are
indicating that the students are mainly ready for the change and the required technology
is already on a decent level. However, the implementation of such technology into a
school infrastructure requires resources and a lot of tests before it can be actually
considered to be a permanent part of the study program.
Possibilities in Finnish cities
The cities of Turku and Helsinki were the two participating cities where these experiments
were executed. The results of the experiments in both of the cities have introduced several
possibilities that could be developed further in the future and used to improve different
functions with the help of the new technology.
As the development of devices with the 8K-technology and high FPS is continuous, and
will be more common in the upcoming years, it is likely to introduce many different
options where cities are able to use modern digital tools to improve their functions, or at
least give out an option to the traditional methods that are currently used. With widen
coverage of the 5G-network, desired internet speeds and requirements for smooth 8Ktechnology can be soon reached. The modern technology provides another perspective to
the traditional methods and ways of doing.
Events
As the term of “Virtual Reality” already indicates, the idea of the system is to be
somewhere without actually being there. We have already seen VR-based traveling where
people are able to virtually visit cities and other locations using their smart devices.
Similarly, this idea could be implemented to the events that are arranged by the cities.
Due to the global pandemic situation of Covid-19, one of the main celebrations of the
year for Finnish people, the May Day and its parties around the country were not able to
take place in 2020. From VR’s point of view, it introduced a new way to celebrate and
arrange events, even though people were not allowed to move physically from their
homes. The best example was introduced by Finnish rap duo called JVG as they
performed a live concert with a green screen technology. The city of Helsinki usually
celebrates the May Day at the market square. With the green screen technology, the

64

Finnish duo performed in a way that it seemed like they had been outside at the market
square as they were actually in large hall with the green screen. The hashtag
#virtuaalivappu was seen over 11 million times in social media which is nearly twice the
number of Finland’s population. There were over 54 000 unique viewers on the website
and through all the attention in media, the event reached possibly over 18 million
readings. (PingHelsinki 2020.)
In a similar sense, all this could be done without the green screen technology. Having the
actual high-quality 360-degree camera in the city event would mean that anyone could
follow the event from home and feel as close to being present as one possible could
without physically being there. This could be also used as an assistance for people who
have disabilities or movement restrictions and are not able to physically go to the certain
event. With the live stream, VR-glasses and working infrastructure, it would definitely be
more enjoyable experience for many viewers compared to just watching it from the
television or website.
In the future, popular live events such as concerts or sporting events could be streamed
over the 5G-network with the 360-degree 8K camera. This could mean that fans could be
able to watch the final of FIFA World Cup of Football from their own sofa with the
camera placed somewhere in the stadium. For example, watching a football game where
the camera is placed on a good place and being able to feel the atmosphere and watch the
game with your VR-glasses in a similar way than actually being at the stadium, could
become quite popular. However, this requires that the infrastructure is ready and able to
meet all the requirements in terms of speed, latency and other necessary equipment.
Similarly, music concerts could be streamed with several cameras placed in the audience
and the fans could watch their favourite band or singer from anywhere in the world, just
with their own laptops.
Tourism and traveling
The virtual tours for tourists and travellers are already a very common thing to see in
many tour operators’ websites. However, the current stage of virtual content for tourists
planning their trip is nowhere near its full potential. Most of the attractions are offering
videos and images at their websites but virtual reality is still quite rarely used. Obviously,
using the virtual reality videos when most of the potential customers or tourists do not

65

have access to the working VR-glasses is not necessarily worth a while just yet. As
consumers are becoming more familiar with the VR-technology and when common
people get the access to the 8K-ready devices and higher internet speeds, there is a
massive possibility to introduce Finnish cities and attract more tourists to visit Finland.
One could argue that many tourists could be quite interested in visiting Finland after
successful virtual introduction to the Archipelago of Turku at summer, snowy nature of
Lapland at winter or intellectual tour around the museums, libraries and other interesting
locations of Helsinki. With such virtual tours, there is a big possibility that the potential
tourists would think that this is something that I need to see myself. Even though the
current YouTube-videos and pictures can also be appealing, it could be assumed that an
actual virtual reality experience would have greater impact for possible tourists.

5.2 Identified challenges and issues
The research question 2 was “What are the biggest challenges and obstacles in deploying
the new technology?”. The results of the experiments showed us several issues and
challenges that need to be taken care of before being able to maintain the high-quality
live stream and making the experience enjoyable for its sending site as well as its viewers.
Many of the issues reported by the students or the sending site were connected with the
lack of stability of the internet speed or other issues with the internet connection.
Obviously, the live stream relies completely on the internet connection and with
fluctuation or other interruptions during the live stream, the quality of stream decreases
and the effects are inescapable. In this project, all of the participating receiving ends had
the needed speed of the internet. However, the actual fluctuation of the connection and
the speed was an issue in certain locations in the sending site. It was also verified through
the results and tests that outdoor locations were providing better and more stable
connection than when filming indoors. As it is widely known, the connection is usually
strongest when there is a minimum number of buildings or other obstacles blocking the
signal. This was also verified in Turku 1 with a massive improvement of the quality when
the camera and router were lifted up to the air while streaming. While 5G-network is still
being built and strengthened, these issues with stability of the connection were expected
but we can be happy with the small amount of these issues appearing.

66

When discussing the results of the experiments and the whole project, there was a big
challenge with the required equipment to be able to experience the actual quality of such
a high-definition video as the 8K. As the 8K-technology is still quite new and there are
only a few devices that can actually meet the unforeseen requirements, it had to show up
also in the results of the experiments in this project. For instance, in the participating
school that I took part personally, many of the students were asking about the quality of
the live stream as it was nowhere near the actual quality of 8K as was expected. This was
mainly about the issue of FPS of the smartboard and the low resolution of the classroom’s
screen, but it describes the issue that was identified in several experiments that the
receiving devices were not able to introduce the 8K-quality in a way that is expected when
talking about ultra-high resolution. Obviously, it is a common issue as the equipment is
still mainly in the development process and not available in a sense that we are used to
with many other devices. To indicate this, Finnish price comparison software shows 11
results with keyword “8K TV” where “4K TV” gives out 649 results (Vertaa.fi 2021).
Prices of these 8K TVs are starting from 1000+ euros and most of the devices have prices
of several thousand euros which well emphasizes the rarity of these devices.

Figure 23 – Deloitte’s 8K predictions

The figure shows Deloitte’s prediction of 8K sales for the upcoming years. From the
figure we can see that we are most likely facing a major increase in 8K sales between the
years of 2021 and 2022. Additionally, Deloitte is predicting that 8K won’t be that popular
in the year of 2021 as the amount of content created in 8K-quality is still very low and

67

the costs of the devices are extremely high when comparing to the 4K-devices. (Deloitte
2020.)
According to the forecast of ABI Research, the 5G-network is expected to overtake the
4G at 2021 (RCRWireless.com 2021). Since the 8K-quality and its overtake of the 4Kquality is expected to be years away, it can be predicted that the issue of finding the right
devices for such technology can last for few years. Due to the high costs and lack of
content in the 8K-quality, we can expect that the 5G-network will be there for the 8Kquality well in advance, at least in Finland where the 5G-network is already covering a
major part of Finland. When considering the live streaming, the development of the
network before the devices could be seen as the right order, as the devices could be quite
useless if the network is not powerful enough for offering the enjoyable user experience.
Based on these forecasts and the results of the experiments of this thesis, we can assume
that the 8K-quality live stream could be sent flawlessly via 5G in the few years’ time after
both of the factors have faced more development, especially the sector of the 8K-devices.

5.3 Students’ changing learning experience
Research question 3 was “How does studying with the new technology challenging the
traditional learning theories and the traditional learning environment?”. Based on the
results and the feedback of these experiments, it is possible to discuss on how the new
technology and new learning methods challenge the traditional way of learning. The
question is approached from the perspective of four different learning theories:
Behaviourism, Constructivism, Humanistic learning theory and Connectivism. The
analysis of changing the learning experience and environment should also be considered
based on the results.
The new approach to the traditional learning theories
Behaviourism is an old and very traditional learning theory where learning is connected
to positive experiences. The famous experiences of Ivan Pavlov’s dogs and how they
were able to widen their skillset with positive associations and rewards is a well-known
experiment around the world. Despite of the theory being discovered over a hundred years
ago; its basic idea can be connected to the modern way of learning as well. Actually, the
question form provided to the students after the lectures, had a question, which measured

68

the willingness of students to try this technology again in other studies. It is deeply
connected with behaviourism, since students with a positive experience are more likely
to be willing to try the technology in future studies. This is also the main reason on why
the results can be seen as very promising as approximately three of the four students were
interested in trying the new teaching method again. When connecting this feedback with
the behaviouristic approach of positive experiences, there is a considerable potential for
such teaching methods to be used in the future.
The learning theory of constructivism focuses on students’ different phases and different
ways of learning. The children and youth have different ways to improve their knowledge
and their skillset, and it is often based on finding their own way to learn. It is also proved
by researchers that teaching with too quick pace can cause significant decrease in
students’ ability to learn. The new technology of 5G and 8K challenges the theory of
constructivism in several ways. Are the students of the modern era of digitalization all
familiar with technology and ready to use it as a teaching method? Based on the results
of this project, many of them are, and with developed infrastructure, the numbers could
be even higher. However, we are only able to measure the students’ feedback on how
they felt about these lectures and do not know much about whether they are actually
learning more than with the traditional methods. As constructivism focuses on the
different phases and stages of learning of the students, it needs to be considered when
using the new technology as a part of their studies. Understanding the right phase of their
development where this type of methods could be used is crucial in terms of creating a
positive learning environment and improving the results of their learning. The children of
today have been surrounded with different types of technology nearly their whole life,
which might indicate that as the world moves more and more towards digitalization,
finding the right phase of deploying technology as a part of the studies could also become
easier.
The humanistic learning theory is based on one’s ability to fulfil the individual needs and
reach the part of self-actualization where one can feel that all needs are met, at least for a
brief moment. The theory indicates that knowledge and skillset of the students will
develop as soon as they are able to understand themselves and other students better.
Leaning on this belief, they are able to build personal connections to their studies and to
the certain subjects. The usual challenges are identified by wrong ways of learning (or by

69

the wrong teaching methods) and passive teaching. Humanistic learning theory seeks new
ways to learn and believes in the self-guidance of the students. If we compare this basic
purpose of the theory with the deployment of the new 5G 8K-technology, it could be seen
as a potential match. The new technology offers a completely new way of learning and it
could also be pointed more towards to the direction where students are able to use their
own devices and control their own learning. This was also noticed in the comments by
the students that participated the lectures and the best results were from the experiments
where students were able to use their own devices. The humanistic learning theory is
fairly recent, and it fits quite well in the ideal learning theory for this technology-based
learning.
Connectivism is a learning theory where the connections between students are crucial in
terms of their learning. Sharing thoughts and knowledge between the group of students
can be a very rewarding and positive experience when executed rightfully. Encouraging
students to use digital tools as a part of their learning process could have major positive
impacts as we can see also from the results of this thesis. The majority of students thought
that these types of lectures were more interesting than the traditional ones which indicates
that they enjoyed the learning experience and the learning environment when comparing
them with the usual ones. If the students feel that studying with certain devices or
technology is more interesting, it might have positive impact on their motivation towards
the studies and by that, towards their development in their studies. Having several
students using their devices in a different way, could lead to more discussion, opinions
and different perspectives to many matters which could also improve the learning
environment for the whole group.
Based on these comparisons, a new approach to the learning with modern technology can
be created. Below, these findings are brought together into an ideal learning theory for
the way of learning that was covered in this thesis:
•

A positive learning experience from the lectures indicates that the student is more
likely to be interested in using such technology again. (Behaviourism)

•

Finding the right phase for the students when to apply such technology as a part
of their studies is crucial to prevent negative outcome (Constructivism)

70

•

Future students are likely to be more and more responsive to the modern learning
environment and methods as they are more experienced in using such technology
also outside the educational environment (Constructivism)

•

Finding the right (and new) learning methods for individual students to improve
their learning and motivation towards their studies (Humanistic learning theory)

•

Understanding the students’ interest on using new methods to learn and using it
to improve motivation and create positive learning experiences (Connectivism)

•

Freedom for the students to be able to use digital tools in different ways to
encourage discussion, opinions and different perspectives (Connectivism)

Combining all of these learning theories to build up a model which is more responding to
the needs of the new learning methods of the modern era is very important, as societies
and educational systems are facing drastic changes of digitalization. As the world moves
forward, the traditional theories of learning need to move in that direction as well and
become more suitable for future ways of learning. Using this new approach towards the
learning of students will help to understand the individual way of learning and overcome
challenges when all students are not responsive to the similar methods.
