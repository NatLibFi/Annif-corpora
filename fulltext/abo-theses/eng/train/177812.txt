Abstract
Brain cancer is difficult to treat due to the blood brain barrier, which blocks
most drug molecules from passing from the blood into the brain. A common way of circumventing this barrier is using convection enhanced delivery,
where a catheter is inserted through a hole in the skull and drug solution
is administered into the tumour by applying a low pressure. This method
suffers from reflux and the local pressure increase inside the brain may cause
severe side effects for the patient. The organic electronic-ionic ion pump is
an attractive alternative to this method due to its dry delivery, which means
that no solvent is transported along with the drug.
A problem with the ion pump in drug delivery applications is that the
amount of ions delivered due to an applied potential is severely hampered
by the formation of the electrical double layer, which terminates any ionic
drift current within seconds. The aim of this thesis was to investigate a
novel membrane type and whether electromigration of ions, due to an applied
potential, is significantly larger than diffusion.
Multistep amperometry was used to compare the steady state current
of the membranes, which was assumed to be a mix of electronic and ionic
current. Ion transport experiments was conducted to compare diffusion and
electromigration of two different ions: methylene blue and Na+ . Electromigration was found not to be significantly larger than diffusion with this
experimental setup.

Introduction

Organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIEC) are electrical semiconductors that have the added benefit of being able to transport ions. They
are usually polymers with weak intermolecular interactions and highly disordered morphology which makes their actual structure difficult to probe. This
class of materials started out as a candidate for new electrode materials but
has since branched out into organic electrochemical transistors [1], actuators
[2], light-emitting electrochemical cells [3] and ion pumps [4].
Since the human body uses ions for internal communication and actuation, being able to control ion flow with the help of an electric current is
showing great potential for medical applications. For example action potentials travel through neurons with the help of biological ion pumps that move
Na+ and K+ through membrane walls. This is the basic signaling mechanism of the nervous system. Mimicking nature’s ion pumps with man-made
devices is problematic since both electronic and ionic transport have to be
controlled simultaneously. The coupling between these two forms of transport, how they influence each other, varies depending on the material used
and its specific transport mechanisms.
The aim of this work is to develop an OMIEC membrane for an ion pump,
with the goal of achieving significant electromigration of ions. Electromigration is used as a term for all ionic transport that happens due to the presence
of an applied potential: electrophoresis, redox reactions and non-faradaic currents. The ion pump would be used to deliver charged drug molecules into
brain tumours. The charged drug molecule would be transported from a
source reservoir, through the membrane, into a target reservoir. This is the
basic setup of an ion pump. The main obstacle to overcome for this application is the electric double layer that forms and screens the electric field,
preventing an ionic drift current. This impedes the ability of the ion pump to
deliver therapeutic amounts of drug to the target in a controlled manner. A
membrane made from the right ratio of electronically and ionically conducting materials is proposed to be able to transport a significant amount of ions
due to electromigration, while the electrical double layer is fully formed.

Background
Organic Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductors

OMIECs can be divided into several different categories. Does it intrinsically
contain ionic charge or not? Does the transport of charge occur homogeneously or heterogeneously throughout the material? A non-uniform charge
distribution is important for many interesting qualities of the OMIECs and
this can occur either by the presence of a polymer with repeating charged
units and accompanying balancing charges, or by the presence of a polar polymer. The charge transport might be homogeneous, where both electronic and
ionic transport occur in the same part of the material or the material has different intertwined phases of different composition where electronic transport
dominates in one phase and ionic transport in another, i.e. a heterogeneous
transport [5]. The most studied type of OMIEC is the intrinsically charged
heterogeneous variety which is also the one used in this work. The mechanisms behind charge transport in these types of materials are presented in
the following paragraphs.
Polymers, or plastics, usually perform as insulators, that is they do not
conduct electronic current. This was the general state of affairs until the
1970’s when the first π-conjugated conductive organic polymer was discovered [6]. This breakthrough was due to the π-conjugated polymer present in
the material. A π-conjugated system is characterised by aligned p-orbitals
on adjacent carbon atoms, the interaction of the delocalised electrons and
the resulting π-bond. An easy example of this kind of molecule would be a
carbon chain with alternating single and double bonds, see Figure 2.1. Single
bonds are usually made of σ-bonds and double bonds consists of a σ-bond
and a π-bond. Due to its delocalised nature, the π-bond is weaker than
the σ-bond. If multiple p-orbitals from neighboring atoms are aligned, the
delocalisation can extend over multiple atoms, see Figure 2.2. The electron
is delocalised over a certain length of the chain, which is referred to as the
conjugation length. The conjugation length may be the whole length of the
carbon chain, or due to defects or twists in the chain, the π-bond is disrupted
and the molecule could be split into two or more conjugated segments. The
electron can delocalise within a conjugated segment and the movement between segments are facilitated by hopping, which is a thermally activated
process and therefore limited to a likely range of distances and energy states.
In order for an electron to traverse effectively through a material composed of

[7].
both conductive and non-conductive pathways, there must be a high enough
concentration of hopping sites to ensure that at least one unbroken pathway
exists. The concentration needed for this to be the case is referred to as the
percolation threshold.
Since the initial interest of the scientific community was the electronic
transport properties of organic materials, mechanisms for ion transport are
not as well understood [8]. If there is an uneven distribution of charge in
a material on the nanoscale, either due to the polarity of the backbone or
repeating charged units, ions may temporarily bind to these sites and hop
between them. In dry OMIECs, ion transport is due to this kind of ion hopping accompanied by movement and stretching of the mesh of the material
[9]. If the OMIEC comes into contact with water, the material swells. This
introduces water channels in the material which allows for easier ion hopping
between fixed charges [10]. The ion can also diffuse together with an ion of
opposite charge through the water channel. Together the ions does not have
a net charge and is therefore unaffected by the fixed charges [11], see Figure
2.3.

Benjamin Granroth

Figure 2.3: The positive red ions are attracted to the fixed negative blue
charges in the material. Ion transport occurs due to hopping between fixed
charges or free transport in the channel if a counterbalancing ion, portrayed
in green, renders the ion pair charge neutral and is therefore unaffected by
the fixed charges. Picture modified from reference [11].
The coupling between electronic and ionic transport has a large impact on
charge transport; usually the microstructure that improves electronic transport diminishes ionic transport and vice versa. For example, swelling an
OMIEC with water will increase ion transport due to more water channels
but it will also decrease electronic transport due to the increased average
hopping distance. The expansion due to the swelling might also break the
contact between the conjugated polymers which removes the possibility of
hopping entirely.

2.2

OMIECs in drug delivery applications

Because of their mixed conducting properties, OMIECs are considered well
suited for controlling ion flow with the help of an electric field. This property
has made OMIECs useful for different drug delivery applications. Actuation
of OMIEC materials have been achieved by applying a voltage that transports ions and accompanying water molecules from one side to the other.
Alternating this bending motion by applying an alternating voltage has been
used in a micropump structure to push drug solution [12].
A redox-mediated drug release mechanism has also been explored. Charged
drug molecules are infused into the OMIEC, which binds them to the fixed
charges in the material. If the drug molecules are, for example, positively
4

Benjamin Granroth
charged, injecting a hole current into the material will screen the fixed charges
and allow the drug molecules to diffuse into the target at the desired time
[13].
The application investigated in this work is the organic electronic ion
pump (OEIP). The simplest form of an ion pump is two liquid-filled reservoirs separated by a semi-permeable membrane, which is sandwiched between
two electrodes. Ions are transported from the source reservoir, through the
membrane and into the target reservoir by an applied potential. No solvent
is transported, only the ions and their hydration layers move through the
membrane. This so-called dry transport makes the OEIP unique. Other
benefits of the ion pump are high precision spatial delivery, exact control of
dosage and easily resupplied devices [14].

2.3

Organic electronic ion pump applications

The first implantable OEIP used for therapeutic purposes in a living, awake,
and freely moving animal was reported in 2015 by Jonsson et al. [15]. They
demonstrated delivery of the inhibitory neurotransmitter Gamma-Aminobutyric
Acid (GABA) in order to treat neuropathic pain in rats. They then applied
OEIPs to the treatment of epilepsy. Epilepsy refers to symptoms caused by
uncontrolled bursts of electrical activity in the brain. By combining an OEIP
delivering GABA with an electrode that sensed when bursts of activity occured, Jonsson et al. were able to quench an induced epileptic seizure in a
brain slice model. The device was the size of a single cell and could provide
highly localised sensing and drug delivery capabilities [16].
Another epilepsy treating ion pump has been developed by Proctor et
al. They developed a syringe-like neural probe with a microfluidic channel,
capable of pumping GABA through an OMIEC membrane when a sensing
electrode registered a seizure [17].
OEIPs have also been used to study plant physiology. Bernacka-Wojcik
et al. reported using an OEIP to deliver the hormone abscisic acid (ABA)
into plant leaves. This hormone regulates the stress response of the plant
and by examining leaf pores closing, they could reveal previously unreported
kinetics of ABA-induced signal propagation in leaves [18].
A novel application of OEIPs is cancer tumour treatment. Cancer is
caused by uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells and is the second most
common cause of death globally [19]. In England and Wales, only 19% of
brain cancer patients survive for five years or more [20]. Due to the sen5

Benjamin Granroth
sitive environment around a brain tumour, surgery is not always possible.
Furthermore, the clinical effect of surgery is still controversial and the most
common type of brain cancer cannot be treated with surgery alone [21]. For
this reason, different forms of drug administration have been investigated.
Flooding the whole body with cytotoxic drugs, as is done in systemic
chemotherapy, is an ineffective way of treating brain tumours because of
the blood-brain barrier. This semi-permeable border inhibits the diffusion
of foreign molecules, including cancer drugs, into the brain from the blood
stream. This method suffers from high off-site toxicity since a therapeutic
concentration of drug in the brain is impossible without severe repercussions
in the rest of the body [22].
In an effort to circumvent the blood-brain barrier, convection enhanced
delivery has been developed. A catheter is guided through a hole in the skull,
directly to the tumour site and a drug solution is injected by applying a low
pressure. This minimises off-target toxicity and is a reliable way to achieve a
therapeutic concentration of drug in the brain tumour [23]. Issues with this
method involve reflux of the solution through the insertion channel, and the
local pressure increase in the brain due to the extra amount of fluid in the
tumour area [24]. The latter may cause symptoms that vary from nausea
and dizziness to memory loss and seizures [25].

2.4

The aim of this thesis

The aim of this thesis is to develop a membrane that could exhibit continuous
ion transport due to electromigration when put in an ion pump setup. By integrating the membrane in a catheter, connecting it to a microfluidic system
and inserting it into the skull, as was done for epilepsy treatment by Proctor et al. [17], the blood-brain barrier can be circumvented. Furthermore,
the dry drug transport of the OEIP circumvents the side effects associated
with convection enhanced delivery. Due to the formation of the electrical
double layer, ion migration due to an electric field within the membrane in a
OEIP exponentially decays over time and usually becomes negligible within
a few seconds. This makes it difficult to achieve a therapeutic concentration of charged drug molecules. Developing an OEIP capable of continuously
transporting a significant amount of ions via electromigration is a step towards solving this problem. Such a device will be investigated in this work
by creating a novel OMIEC membrane and applying it within an ion pump
configuration.

3.1

Theory
Charge transport in OEIPs

If two connected liquid-filled reservoirs have different ion concentrations,
there will be a net flux of ions between them. This is due to diffusion.
Every particle with a temperature above 0 K has some motion associated
with it, which is random in direction due to frequent collisions with other
particles. It is this random thermal motion that gives rise to diffusion, which
causes particles to move from areas of high concentration to areas of low
concentration. How random motion produces uniformity is illustrated in the
example in Figure 3.1. This phenomenon is relevant for the ion pump, since
we have two reservoirs with different ion concentrations. As long as there
is a concentration difference there will be a net flux of molecules from the
reservoir of high concentration. This will have to be accounted for in the
design of the experiments.
Another important mechanism in OEIPs is particle drift due to an external electric field, and the termination of this current due to the formation
of the electrical double layer. Electrons and ions will both move under the
influence of an electric field which is supplied by the charged electrodes. For
example, a positively charged electrode will attract both electrons and negatively charged ions. Unlike electrons, the ions cannot enter the electrodes
and will surround them instead. The electrodes adsorb the ions closest to the
surface, which creates two layers of opposite charge, one within the electrode
and one on the outside. This so-called electrical double layer screens the electric field and diminishes the drift current. The non-adsorbed ions floating
around the electrode are referred to as the diffuse layer. These ions also take
part in screening the field but are more free in their movement. When the
charge of the ions adsorbed to the electrode and the ions in the diffuse layer
equal the charge on the electrode, the electric field is fully screened and the
current is terminated.
For the application investigated in this thesis, the applied potential is limited by unwanted electrochemical reactions of which the easiest to identify
is water splitting. If the electric field due to the applied potential is strong
enough to separate hydrogen from oxygen in water molecules, hydrogen gas
and oxygen gas are produced. Water splitting and other unwanted electrochemical reactions degrade the experimental setup and prevent reliable and
reproducible transport experiments. In optimal conditions for water split7

ting, a potential of 1.23 V is theoretically enough for gas bubbles to form
[27].

3.2

The ion pump

In 2007, an ion pump was presented by Isaksson et al. [4] that was based
on PEDOT:PSS electrodes. A simplified version of the ion pump will be
presented. The microfabricated ion pump consists of two PEDOT:PSS electrodes that are separated by a channel of overoxidised PEDOT:PSS. Overoxidised PEDOT:PSS is an electronically insulating material that conducts ions.
Electrolyte solutions are deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS electrodes, see
Figure 3.2. The source electrode is covered with a source electrolyte containing the ion to be transported, M+ , and the target electrode is covered
with a target electrolyte containing another kind of positive ion, C+ . The
M+ concentration in the source electrolyte is large, which causes the ions to
diffuse into the source electrode and bind to the PSS polymer. By biasing
the ion pump as shown in Figure 3.2, the following reaction occurs:
0
−
+
−−
PEDOT+ PSS− + M+ + e− ↽
−⇀
− PEDOT + PSS M .

For the left hand reaction, PEDOT is oxidised in the source electrode
9

Benjamin Granroth
resulting in a free electron and the release of the M+ ion from the PSS – .
The M+ ion migrates across the overoxidised channel and into the target
electrode, either by diffusion or by electromigration. In the target electrode
on the right hand side the PEDOT is reduced, allowing M+ to enter the
electrode and bind to a PSS – unit. The M+ ions move from the target
electrode to the target electrolyte by ion exchange with the C+ ions.
The ion pump used in this thesis consists of two reservoirs surrounding
two gold mesh electrodes that sandwiches a membrane, see Figure 3.3. With
an applied potential, the electrical double layer will screen the electric field
within the membrane. We hypothesize that with no applied potential, a
diffusion current will be present across the membrane, and with an applied
potential, both a diffusion and a significant electromigration current will be
present.
The hypothesis is motivated by unpublished data by Dr. Christopher
Proctor. By varying the amount of PSS in PEDOT:PSS membranes, it was
discovered that membranes with a low amount of PSS exhibited a constant
current over time, similar to electronic conductors, while a high amount of
PSS showed an exponentially decaying current, which is the hallmark of an
ionic conductor where the electrical double layer screens the electric field.
Furthermore, an intermediary amount of PSS produced a membrane with a
peculiar transient. The current initially decays exponentially but reaches a
constant non-zero value, see Figure 3.4. This current shows properties of both
electronic and ionic conduction and it is assumed that part of the steady-state
current is composed of a continuous ionic current. This mixed conducting
regime was achieved by adjusting the ratio of electronically and ionically
conducting materials in the membrane. This work will aim to achieve a
similar regime with a different combination of materials, namely the mixed
conductor PEDOT:PSS and the ion conductor PEGDA.

Materials and Methods
Membrane materials

Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonate, abbreviated as PEDOT:PSS, is a commonly used OMIEC that intrinsically contains
ionic charge and transports ions and holes in different phases of the material. By doping the conjugated polymer PEDOT with the polyelectrolyte
PSS, a water soluble material with a relatively high conductivity is created.
The positively charged holes on the PEDOT chain that are responsible for
electronic transport are balanced by the negatively charged subunits of PSS.
Ion transport is thought to occur mainly in PSS rich phases of the mate12

Benjamin Granroth
rial, where the ions hop between the subunits of PSS. The morphology of
PEDOT:PSS is well known and is presented in Figure 4.1.
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is an organic hydrophilic polymer, which when
synthesized into polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), can be crosslinked
into a hydrogel. A hydrogel is a network of hydrophilic polymers and is
usually ionically, but not electronically, conducting. The acrylate group at
each side of the PEGDA molecule contains a double bond which can be
broken and used to crosslink multiple PEGDA molecules together. This
is achieved by introducing a photoinitiator (PI), which is a molecule that
produces free radicals when exposed to UV light. A free radical is a molecule
with an unpaired electron and is therefore highly reactive. When a free
radical encounters a PEGDA molecule, it removes an electron from the weak
π-bond in the acrylate unit and forms a bond of its own, attaching itself to the
PEGDA molecule. This combined molecule has an unpaired electron left over
from the broken π-bond, which makes it a free radical as well. Therefore, it
can break a π-bond on another PEGDA molecule, continuing the crosslinking
process, see Figure 4.2. Since PEG is hydrophilic and acrylate is hydrophobic,
the acrylate groups from different molecules cluster together when dispersed
in an aqueous solution. When the polymerisation is initiated, crosslinking
centers form, which are connected by a backbone of PEG molecules, see
Figure 4.3. The crosslinking terminates when the PEGDA chain comes into
contact with another free radical produced by a PI molecule [29].
The crosslinked PEGDA molecules forms a hydrogel, that is a mesh of
hydrophilic polymers. The size of the ions that can pass through the hydrogel
is determined by the size of the gaps in the mesh, the mesh size, which
depends on the molecular weight of the PEGDA and the amount of UV
exposure to the material [30]. As the name suggests, polyethylene glycol
consists of ethylene glycol molecules. A larger molecular weight indicates
that one PEGDA molecule contains more ethylene glycol molecules, which
means that the crosslinking centers will have longer strands of PEG backbone
between them, resulting in a larger mesh size. The amount of UV exposure
determines how many free radicals are created, which affects how much of
the PEGDA that crosslinks. The right amount of UV exposure is worth
investigating. Too much will decrease the mesh size since a high crosslinking
density will produce a tightly woven network of polymers, while too little
exposure will yield a weak and unstable hydrogel.

Making the membrane

The membrane making procedure began by putting the PEDOT:PSS solution Clevios™ PH 1000, which contains 1.15 wt% of the polymer, in an
ultrasonic bath and filtering it through an 0.45 µm filter. This will minimize
any aggregation of the PEDOT:PSS. PEGDA was added and the solution
was sonicated in water with a temperature of 40° to ensure that the PEGDA
dissolves. If other materials were incorporated into the membrane, they were
added during the previous step. The photoinitiator was added and the solution was mixed. With the finished solution at hand, 2-3 droplets were put
between two glass slides separated by approximately 0.3 mm, see Figure 4.4,
and the glass sandwich was put into a UV oven. After the desired amount of
exposure, the glass sandwich was extracted and submerged in DI for 15-30
minutes to allow the membrane to hydrate, which makes it easier to pry the
glass slides from each other without damaging the membrane. The membrane was then stored in DI water for at least 24 hours to allow it to fully
swell before experiments were conducted.
Another crosslinking mechanism was briefly investigated. (3-glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (GOPS) is a common crosslinker for PEDOT:PSS
as it binds the PSS units from different polymers to each other. However,
it also binds PSS to glass [31] which could make removing the membrane
from the glass substrate difficult. Since the GOPS crosslinking mechanism is
activated by heat, the glass slide substrate with membrane solution was put

Experimental setup
Cell setup

The cell used for membrane characterisation and ion transport experiments
consists of two acrylic containers, two gold mesh electrodes and a membrane.
A piece of the polymer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), made with the SYLGARD 184 silicone elastomer, was added to each container to create a soft
and elastic surface that prevents leakage and lessens the pressure on the
membrane. The thickness of the piece was 2 mm. Assembly of the cell is
shown in Figure 4.5.
4.3.2

Ion transport experiments

Ion transport experiments were carried out by filling the source reservoir with
a solution containing the ion to be transported, and filling the target reservoir
with de-ionized (DI) water. To ensure that the diffusion rate does not change
during the experiments, the liquid-filled cell was left for 2 hours to achieve
diffusion equilibrium. Subsequently, the target was refilled with clean DI
water and the diffusion experiment was conducted. The ions were allowed to
diffuse into the target for the experimental duration, after which the target
solution was collected and the reservoir was refilled for the electromigration
experiment. A potential of +0.8 V was applied across the electrodes, using

the target electrode as the reference, for the same duration and the target
was collected. Note that diffusion is also present while a potential is applied,
but for the sake of brevity, experiments involving an applied potential will be
referred to as an electromigration experiment. The two target samples were
compared in order to measure the electromigration of ions. Two different ions
were transported: methylene blue and Na+ . The source reservoir in these
experiments consisted of DI water with a concentration of either 10 mM
methyleneblue or 100 mM Nacl.

Characterisation
Evaluating membrane compositions

Which materials, and what molecular weight of those materials, produced
a membrane composition capable of transporting cancer drugs? This question was answered by investigating whether an analogue to a known cancer
drug passed through the membrane. Methylene blue is a positively charged
organic dye with a molar mass of 319.85 g/mol, which is comparable to the
commonly used cancer drug cisplatin with a molar mass of 300.01 g/mol.
Cisplatin in itself is neutral, but when in contact with water, H2 O molecules
replace one of the Cl atoms in a process termed aquation. This can transform the cisplatin molecule [Pt(NH3 )2 Cl2 ] into various charged compounds,
for example [Pt(NH3 )2 Cl(OH2 )]+ , which has a molar mass of 279.58 g/mol
[32]. The methylene blue molecule is composed of three benzene molecules
and is significantly larger than any aquated cisplatin molecule, see Figure
4.6. If methylene blue passes through the membrane, then so should the
aquated form of cisplatin. The membranes ability to pass methylene blue
was examined ocularly by filling the source in the cell with methylene blue
solution and observing whether any dye passed through the membrane and
into the target, which was filled with DI water. Once a membrane composition that successfully transported methylene blue was found, the amount of
UV exposure was chosen to allow for as much methylene blue transport as
possible.
Furthermore, the membranes had to be robust and homogeneous. Robust
enough to withstand being sandwiched between the gold electrodes in the cell,
and homogeneous enough to ensure that any coupling between electronic and
ionic transport that might be responsible for continuous ion transport was
present in the entire membrane.

Multistep amperometry

Once suitable membrane materials were found, the optimal ratio of the materials involved was still to be decided. The steady-state current through the
membranes with different ratios was measured using a Palmsens4 potentiostat, and used to compare their performance. This was determined by putting
the membranes in the cell with a 100 mM NaCl solution in both reservoirs
and conducting multistep amperometry. Amperometry measures the current
through a sample due to a specified applied potential, and multistep amperometry allows multiple different potentials to be applied in succession.
One multistep amperometry cycle consisted of applying 0.8 V for 30 seconds
followed by −0.8 V for 30 seconds. As can be seen from Figure 4.7 a), the
current response from the membrane changes with successive cycles. Note
that the behaviour of the transients seems to saturate within 20 cycles. The
20 positive current transients from Figure 4.7 a) are plotted overlapping each
other in Figure 4.7 b). By zooming in around the 30s mark, as is done in
Figure 4.7 c), it is seen that 20 cycles are indeed enough for the behaviour
of the current transients to saturate. Even though the transients are still
declining over time, the steady-state current after 30s of applied voltage was
deemed stable enough to use for comparing membranes. The average of the
last four data points of the positive transient from the last cycle is taken
as the value of the steady-state current through the membrane, which for
the example in 4.7 results in (0.144 µA+0.138 µA+0.145 µA+0.137 µA)/4=
0.141(4) µA. The margin of error is also affected by the inexact nature of the
cell assembly process. Every time the cell is assembled, the overlap of the
electrodes and the distance between them is slightly different, which affects
the strength of the electric field across the membrane. The error due to this
variation, 0.015 µA, was estimated by comparing steady-state current values
19

Benjamin Granroth
before and after reassembling the cell. This is the most significant error. The
multistep amperometry described above was conducted three times on every
membrane to ensure reproducibility.
4.4.3

Absorption

The target solutions produced by the methylene blue transport experiments
were characterised using a AvaSpec-ULS2048CL-EVO (CMOS) spectrometer. The absorbance peak of methylene blue at 300 nm was measured for in
order to compare the ion concentration of the samples. Note that the linear
relationship between ion concentration and absorbance breaks down at high
ion concentrations. The spectrometer measures transmittance, T, which can
be converted into absorbance, A, by the relation
T = 10−A .
Furthermore, the relationship between ion concentration and absorbance
is described in a version of Beer-Lambert’s law:
A = ϵlc,
where ϵ is the absorptivity, l is the optical path length and c is the concentration of the species [33]. It is generally advised to keep the absorbance
below a value of one to ensure this linear relationship.
4.4.4

Conductivity measurement

The ion concentration of the target solutions in the Na+ transport experiments was quantified using a Mettler-Toledo Inlab 731 conductivity probe,
which runs an alternating current through the solution and measures the
ionic conductivity.

Results and Discussion
Membrane material composition

The search for a membrane composition that produced robust, homogeneous
membranes that could pass methylene blue began with a membrane consisting of a PEDOT:PSS solution, low molecular weight PEGDA, and the photoinitiator (PI) 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone. PEGDA, with a molecular weight (MW) of 250 MW, was found not to mix with the PEDOT:PSS at
all while the 575 MW PEGDA did. A homogeneous and robust membrane
was successfully produced, however, methylene blue did not pass through it.
Too small mesh size was deemed to be the problem and hence different ways
of increasing the mesh size was investigated.
First up was reducing the crosslinking density by introducing sodium
acrylate. The idea was that replacing some of the PEGDA, which has an
acrylate group at both ends, with sodium acrylate, which has an acrylate
group only at one end, would decrease the crosslinking density. Less available crosslinking points should increase the mesh size and allow for a larger
selection of ions to pass through. A 1 M solution of sodium acrylate had
been shown by Dr. Christopher Proctor to blend well with PEGDA, but
unfortunately the addition of PEDOT:PSS did not produce a homogeneous
solution or a robust membrane.
Instead of reducing the crosslinking density, the project proceeded with
adding larger molecules, PEG 1500 MW, to the mix in order to introduce
larger pores in the membrane. When properly mixed, the solution produced
robust membranes, but no methylene blue was able to pass through them.
GOPS was used as the crosslinking mechanism with a PEDOT:PSS and
PEG 1500 MW solution, which did produce homogeneous robust membranes,
but no methylene blue passed through.
A membrane that successfully transported methylene blue was made
by using the larger PEGDA 2000 MW. Dissolving PEGDA 2000 MW in
only PEDOT:PSS did not allow dye to pass, but introducing DI water produced homogeneous, robust membranes that showed successful methylene
blue transport. The ratios of these materials were free to experiment with
in order to optimize the membrane. For the sake of simplicity, the amount
of PEGDA 2000 MW was kept fixed to 0.05 g per 500 µL total solution and
the ratio of the liquids, PEDOT:PSS and DI, was varied in the recipe. The
PI amount was kept at 2 wt%. For example, the first membrane that was
22

Benjamin Granroth
used in an actual ion transport experiment was made from a recipe with
0.05 g of PEGDA 2000 MW, 12 µL PI, 100 µL PEDOT:PSS and 400 µL DI.
A short-hand notation for the recipe will be used, expressed as amount of
PEDOT:PSS per 500 µL solution. For the recipe above, this would take the
form 100 P:PSS/500.
Varying the amount of UV exposure was investigated by subjecting a 100
P:PSS/500 solution to an exposure of either 9.6 J/cm2 or 48 J/cm2 . Less
exposure should produce a membrane with a larger mesh size, and therefore higher ion transport capabilities. However, methylene blue transport
experiments conducted with the different exposures showed that the membrane with a higher exposure transported more dye (with absorbance values
of 0.86 for diffusion and 1.06 for electromigration) than the membrane with
less exposure (0.57 for diffusion and 0.53 for electromigration). Diminishing
the UV exposure provided no benefit and therefore the exposure of 48 J/cm2
was kept as the standard for all membranes.

5.2

Multistep amperometry

Multistep amperometry was performed on the membrane composition containing PEGDA 2000 MW, with recipes varying from 0 P:PSS/500 to 450
P:PSS/500 and the results are presented in Figure 5.1. This result characterises the membranes and indicates that adding PEDOT:PSS significantly
changes the steady-state current through the membrane. The steady-state
current is seen to increase with the addition of PEDOT:PSS up until a maximum at 400 P:PSS/500. There was reason to believe that a higher steadystate current correlated with a larger electromigration of ions, which will be
investigated in the next section.
Note the error bar for the 450 P:PSS/500 membrane in Figure 5.1. For
this recipe, successive multistep amperometry measurements did not provide
a reproducible steady-state current value until the fifth round, with a total
of 100 cycles. With this high amount of PEDOT:PSS, the membrane swelled
to such a degree that it became unstable and prone to breaking while in the
cell, and the error bars illustrates the resulting unreliable performance of the
membrane.
To investigate whether there is an correlation between steady-state current and electromigration of ions, methylene blue transport experiments were
conducted.

Methylene blue experiment

Data from the ion transport experiments with methylene blue in the source
are presented in Figure 5.2. The diffusion and electromigration experiments
that are to be compared are referred to as an experimental set and are placed
adjacently in the graph. Note that a higher absorbance indicates a higher
concentration of ions.
The 0 P:PSS/500 membrane contains no PEDOT:PSS and hence no electronically conducting material. If mixed conduction is necessary for significant electromigration, this membrane should not exhibit any difference
between diffusion and electromigration experiments. This is indeed the case.
The addition of PEDOT:PSS, resulting in a 100 P:PSS/500 membrane, produced promising results. A significant difference can be seen between diffusion and electromigration in the three sets of experiments that were conducted. Note that only one set keeps the absorbance below a value of one,
since this restriction was not known at the time. The resulting nonlinearity
between absorbance and concentration might explain why the difference between diffusion and electromigration seems to diminish with each successive
set of experiments. Lastly, the 200 P:PSS/500 membrane also shows a difference between diffusion and electromigration, but with an overall decrease
in methylene blue transport capabilities. It seems that adding PEDOT:PSS
diminishes the methylene blue transport capabilities of the membrane.
24

Benjamin Granroth

Figure 5.2: Ion transport experiments with methylene blue in the source and
DI water in the target. Three different membranes were tested. The duration
of the experiments are indicated underneath the membrane recipe.
Note that the 100 P:PSS/500 membrane shows an increase in dye transport with each successive set of experiments. For example, the absorbance
of electromigration varies from 1.0 to 1.75 between sets. The membrane was
stored in DI water between sets of experiments, which were conducted on
different days due to their long duration. This could allow the membrane
to swell with water over time, increasing its ion transport capabilities. An
attempt to prevent this was made by storing the membranes for 24 hours
in DI water before the first set of experiments, but apparently it was not
enough.
From one set of experiments, we can get an on/off ratio for our setup by
taking the ratio of the absorbance from the electromigration experiment and
the absorbance from the diffusion experiment. The on/off ratio can be used
as a measure of how much ions were transported due to the applied potential.
Unfortunately due to the spectrometer becoming unavailable, only the few
experiments presented in Figure 5.2 were available to be investigated. The
on/off ratio for the 100 P:PSS/500 membrane was calculated as the average
of the on/off ratios from the three sets of experiments. Plotting the on/off
ratio and the steady-state current as a function of membrane ratio gives
us Figure 5.3, which indicates a positive correlation between steady-state

current and on/off ratio. With the assumption that the highest steady-state
current would result in the largest on/off ratio, 400 P:PSS/500 was chosen as
the most promising membrane ratio for exhibiting electromigration of ions
due to an applied potential.

5.4

Sodium experiment

Na+ ion transport experiments conducted through a 400 P:PSS/500 membrane are presented in Figure 5.4. The 100 mM NaCl solution used in the
source had a conductivity of ca. 10 000 µS/cm, while the DI water in the target had a conductivity of 0.03 µS/cm. Unlike the experiments with methylene
blue, electromigration experiments were conducted before the diffusion experiments. The reason will be discussed later.
From the figure, experiments with a 20 minute duration transport slightly
more ions during electromigration experiments. This difference could be due
to an initial ion transport that quickly ceases after the electrical double layer
forms, or it could be due to a very small continuous electromigration of ions
that could be enhanced by further optimizing the membrane. If the difference
is due to continuous electromigration, the difference should increase with a
longer duration. Unfortunately, this is not what is observed. The one hour

underneath.
long experiments shows a similar difference between diffusion and electromigration. All sets of experiments shows an on/off ratio of approximately
one: 1.04 ± 0.02 for the 20m experiments and 1.012 ± 0.006 for the one hour
experiments. Since a slight difference is present for all sets of experiments, it
is likely due to the small amount of ions transported by the applied potential
before the electrical double layer forms. Note that the one hour long experiments shows a conductivity ca. three times that of the 20m experiments,
indicating a linear relationship between duration and ion transport.
Initially, the Na+ experiments were conducted in the same order as for
methylene blue, diffusion followed by electromigration. However, this produced inconsistent results: sometimes there was no difference between diffusion and electromigration, and sometimes diffusion actually transported
more ions than electromigration. Performing multiple sets of experiments
back to back showed that performing an electromigration experiment before
the diffusion experiment eliminated this irregular phenomena. The order of
the experiments should not affect the experimental outcome since continuous ion transport due to electromigration is assumed to only depend if there
is an applied potential or not. Hence, the order was changed for the Na+
experiments.

Conclusions and future outlook

An organic mixed ionic-electronic conducting membrane was developed by
mixing PEDOT:PSS and PEGDA 2000 MW, which passed a molecular analog to a known cancer drug. The membranes were characterised with multistep amperometry and ion transport experiments. A small, and perhaps
significant, on/off ratio was found when transporting methylene blue, but
this was not reproducible with Na+ ions. The size difference between the
two ions could explain this difference in behaviour. The data is inconclusive
as to whether the hypothesis is correct an more experiments are needed to
investigate whether a continuous electromigration of ions due to an applied
potential exists in these kinds of membranes.
With the knowledge gained from the unfruitful Na+ transport experiments, the promising methylene blue transport experiments could be redone
to investigate their reproducibility and fill in the missing on/off ratios and
ensure that the 400 P:PSS/500 membrane actually was the optimal choice.
Performing the electromigration experiment before the diffusion experiment
and keeping the absorbance below a value of one could provide more reliable
data.
Future experiments should also take into account memory resistance,
which refers to the ability of mixed conducting materials to change their
resistance if they have recently experienced a potential. [34]. This means
that the conductivity in the membranes presented in this thesis could change
depending on if diffusion or electromigration experiments were conducted
first, which would explain why the experimental order mattered in the Na+
experiments and why it took 20 cycles for the multistep amperometry measurements to reach an equilibrium.
No continuous ion transport due to electromigration was found and the
complexity of OMIECs makes it difficult to formulate a theory of the mechanism that would be responsible for such transport, if any exists. More
in-depth knowledge of the chemistry of these types of materials is needed in
order make progress and uncover the potential of OMIECs.

Svensk sammanfattning: Bland-ledande material för kontinuerlig läkemedelstranport
Bakgrund

Organiska blandledare (Eng. Organic mixed ionic-electronic conductor) är
böjbara material med förmågan att transportera både joner och elektroner.
Elektrontransport sker via tunnling mellan konjugerade polymerkedjor medan jontransport sker via jonhoppning mellan fixerade laddningar i materialet [5] eller fri transport i vattenfyllda kanaler [10]. Eftersom mekanismer i
människokroppen styrs med joner finns det ett stort intresse inom läkemedelsindustrin för att kontrollera jontransport med hjälp av elektrisk ström,
vilket är precis det som en organisk blandledare kan tillhandahålla.
En möjlig tillämpning finns inom cancerbekämpning, speciellt för hjärntumörer. Behandlingen av hjärntumörer försvåras på grund av blod-hjärnbarriären som förhindrar de flesta molekyler, inkluderat läkemedel, att överföras från blodomloppet till hjärnan [22]. Konvektionsförbättrad transport
(Eng. Convection enhanced delivery) har utvecklats för att förbigå denna
barriär. Detta uppnås genom att med tryck transportera läkemedelslösning
direkt in i tumören genom en kateter insatt genom skallen. Nackdelar med
denna metod är att lösningen kan flöda ut genom skallhålet istället för att
fylla tumören, och ifall tumören fylls så kan tryckskillnaden som uppstår i
hjärnan på grund av tumörsvällningen ha allvarliga bieffekter för patienten
[24]. En jonpump baserad på ett organiskt blandledande material är en lovande lösning på problemet eftersom den transporterar endast joner och ingen
vätska.
En jonpump är i dess enklaste form ett halvporöst membran omgivet av
två reservoarer fyllda med vätska. Den ena innehållande jonerna som ska
transporteras, källreservoaren, och den andra innehållande endast vatten,
målreservoaren. Genom att applicera en potential med hjälp av elektroder
kan man transportera jonerna från källan genom membranet till målet. Idealt
transporteras endast jonerna och dess vattenskikt på grund av halvporositeten [14]. Detta gör att en tillämpning inom läkemedelstransport inte skulle
orsaka en tryckökning vid målområdet, och skulle därför undgå bieffekterna
förknippade med konvektionsförbättrad transport.
Att få en stor mängd laddat läkemedel genom en jonpump förhindras
av bildningen av det elektriska dubbellagret. Allt eftersom joner transpor29

teras genom membranet kommer laddningen hos elektroderna som orsakar
elfältet att avskärmas. Elfältet försvinner när jonlagret runt elektroden balanserar elektrodladdningen fullständigt och den aktiva jontransporten avstannar. Målet med detta arbete är att erhålla ett blandledande membran i
en jonpumps konfiguration som uppvisar kontinuerlig jontransport på grund
av elektromigration av joner. Elektromigration används här som ett samlingsbegrepp för alla jontransportmekanismer som händer när en potential
appliceras.

7.2

Teori

Materialen som används i detta arbete är blandledaren PEDOT:PSS och jonledaren PEGDA, som även fungerar som stomme för membranet. Hypotesen
för detta arbete är att en signifikant kontinuerlig elektromigration av joner,
på grund av en applicerad spänning, sker genom en jonpump baserad på
detta membran. Jonpumpsuppställningen illustreras i Figur 7.1. Berättigandet för denna kommer från opublicerade data från Dr. Christopher Proctor.
Genom att ha undersökt olika förhållanden mellan PEDOT och PSS i ett
PEDOT:PSS-membran hävdar han sig ha hittat en blandledande jämvikts30

transport (röd).
ström. En förklaring följer. Ifall membranet leder elektroner väldigt bra kommer strömmen, som funktion av tid, hållas konstant. Ifall membranet leder
joner väldigt bra kommer strömmen minska exponentiellt p.g.a. det elektriska dubbellagret. En optimal blandning av dessa två ledningstyper har visat
en ström som i början avtar exponentiellt men som planar ut till en jämviktsström efter en stund, se Figur 7.2. Denna jämviktsström antas bestå av
både elektroner och joner, vilket skulle indikera en kontinuerlig jontransport.
Målet är alltså att uppnå samma fenomen men istället för att ändra förhållandet mellan PEDOT och PSS ändras förhållandet mellan PEDOT:PSS och
PEGDA.

7.3.1

Material och metoder
Membranet

Membranet som användes bestod av PEGDA med en molekylvikt på 2000,
blandat med PEDOT:PSS och en fotoinitator. Fotoinitiatorns uppgift är att
sammanbinda PEGDA-molekylerna för att bilda ett vattenfast membran.
Mängden PEGDA hölls konstant som 0,05 g per 500 µL lösning. Likaså hölls
fotoinitiatorn som 2 viktprocent. Lösningen bestod av flytande PEDOT:PSS
31

Benjamin Granroth

Figur 7.3: Membranlösning mellan två glasplattor, separerade med 3 mm.
med en koncentration på 1,15 viktprocent samt avjoniserat vatten. Proportionen mellan PEDOT:PSS och det avjoniserade vattnet ändrades för att
optimera membranet. Således ändrades förhållandet mellan PEDOT:PSS
och PEGDA medan mängden lösning hölls konstant. Exempelvis var det
första membranet som testades gjort enligt ett recept med 0,05 g PEGDA,
12 µL fotoinitator, 100 µL PEDOT:PSS och 400 µL avjoniserat vatten. För
att hänvisa till olika membran kommer enheten mängd PEDOT:PSS-lösning
per 500 µL lösning användas, förkortat som P:PSS/500. Exempelvis är den
förkortade versionen av benämningen på det ovanstående membranet 100
P:PSS/500. För att skapa membranet placeras ett par droppar av lösningen
mellan två separerade glasplattor, se Figur 7.3, och läggs in i en UV-ugn och
utsätts för 48 J/cm2 . Därefter lagras membranet i avjoniserat vatten.
7.3.2

Experimentell uppställning och karakterisering

För att karakterisera membranet utvecklades en experimentell cell som tillät
membranet att komma i kontakt med elektroderna. Detta tillåter en elektronisk ström att passera genom membranet samtidigt som jontransport sker,
vilket ansågs vara en nödvändighet för kontinuerlig transport. Cellen beskrivs
i Figur 7.4.
För att undersöka jämviktsströmmen genom membran med olika proportioner av PEDOT:PSS och PEGDA användes flerstegsamperometri, vilket
innebär att en spänning på +0,8 V och -0,8 V turvis applicerades över membranet i 30 sekunders intervaller. Detta upprepades i 20 cykler för att nå

jämvikt, varefter jämviktsströmmen i den sista cykeln noterades och användes för att jämföra membranen, se Figur 7.5. Osäkerheten uppskattades genom att mäta ett membran, plocka isär och plocka ihop celluppställningen,
och mäta igen. Skillnaden mellan dessa två mätningar, 0,015 µA, togs som
ett mått på felet som introduceras av att de två elektrodernas överlapp och
avstånd ändrar mellan ihopsättningar av cellen.
Det första jontransportexperimentet gjordes genom att sätta den positiva
molekylen metylenblått i källreservoaren och avjoniserat vatten i målreservoaren. Metylenblått användes eftersom den har en liknande storlek som
cancermedicinen cisplatin. Transporten genom membranet genom diffusion
jämfördes med transporten genom membranet under en spänning på +0,8
V. Det senare experimentet refereras till som ett elektromigrationsexperiment. Mängden metylenblått som transporterats kvantifierades med hjälp av
spektroskopi.
Jonen ändrades sedan till Na+ och transport experiment gjordes på samma sätt som ovan, men mängden joner man transporterat mättes genom att
mäta konduktiviteten i målreservoaren.

Resultat

Resultatet av flerstegsamperometrin på membran varierande från 0 P:PSS/500
till 500 P:PSS/500 visas i Figur 7.6. Det kan ses att 400 P:PSS/500 visar
högst jämviktsström. För att undersöka ifall jämviktsström korrelerar med
elektromigration av joner genom membranet, utfördes transport experiment
med metylenblått.
Jämförelse mellan diffusion och elektromigration av metylenblått för olika
membran presenteras i Figur 7.7. Från denna figur ses ingen skillnad mellan
diffusion och elektromigration för ett membran utan PEDOT:PSS i sig, dvs. 0
P:PSS/500-membranet. 100 P:PSS/500-membranet visar en skillnad mellan
diffusion och elektromigration, vilket är väldigt lovande speciellt eftersom resultatet upprepades tre gånger. Ett 200 P:PSS/500-membran testades också,
vilket visade avsevärt mindre transport av metylenblått. En skillnad mellan
diffusion och elektromigration kan dock ses.
Genom att dividera absorbansen från elektromigration och diffusion experimenten får man ett på/av förhållande (Eng. on/off ratio) som indikerar
hur mycket jontransport som skett på grund av den applicerade potentialen.
Genom att plotta detta förhållande i samma graf som jämviktsströmmen från
flerstegsamperometrin, se Figur 7.8, ses att jämviktsströmmen verkar ha en
positiv korrelation med elektromigrationen. Därför valdes 400 P:PSS/500membranet som det mest lovande membranet för att uppvisa elektromigra35

tion av joner. I nästa experimentserie ändrades jonen som transporterades till
Na+ , eftersom spektrometern som användes för metylenblått experimenten
blev otillgänglig.
Data från Na+ transport experiment med ett 400 P:PSS/500-membran visas i Figur 7.9. Märk att elektromigration utfördes före diffusion denna gång.
En liten skillnad ses mellan diffusion och elektromigration, men skillnaden
växer inte med en ökning av längden på experimenten, vilket indikerar att
det inte sker kontinuerlig jontransport på grund av elektromigration genom
membranet.

Diskussion och sammanfattning

Ett membran baserat på PEDOT:PSS och PEGDA producerades och visades
kunna passera metylenblått, en analog till cancermedicinen cisplatin. Variationer av detta membran karakteriserades med flerstegsamperometri och
jontransport experiment. Det är möjligt att metylenblått experimenten uppvisar tecken på kontinuerlig elektromigration av joner, men Na+ experimenten var inte lika lovande. Storleksskillnaden mellan dessa joner kanske är en
del av förklaringen till varför de beter sig olika. Det är oklart ifall hypotesen
stämmer. Mera experiment behövs för att säkerställa ifall det existerar en signifikant kontinuerlig elektromigration av joner genom denna typ av membran

på grund av en applicerad potential.
Metylenblått experimenten visade lovande resultat och skulle med fördel kunna göras om. Kunskapen som erhölls under Na+ experimenten skulle
kunna inkorporeras för att få mer tillförlitlig data: utför elektromigrationsexperimentet före diffusionsexperimentet och håll absorbansen under värdet
ett. Att undersöka på/av förhållanden för alla sorters membran skulle även
göra nytta genom att ge en mera omfattande bild av situationen, och säkerställa ifall 400 P:PSS/500-membranet faktiskt var det optimala valet.
En annan sak att ta i beaktande i framtida experiment är att blandledande material uppvisar en föränderlig resistans som ändras beroende på ifall
en ström nyligen gått igenom membranet eller inte [34]. Detta skulle kunna
förklara varför ordningen av diffusion och elektromigration hade en inverkan
på experimenten, samt varför det tog 20 cyklar för multistep amperometrin
att nå jämvikt.
En teoretisk modell för kontinuerlig jontransport med hjälp av elektromigration existerar ej och skulle vara nyttig för att framskrida med experimenten. Mera djupgående information om bland-ledare och deras mekanismer
behövs för detta, och skulle vara ovärderligt för att kunna utnyttja dessa
material till fullo.
