Deciphering the molecular

May 2020
Tight Junctions (TJs) are intercellular adhesion complexes that contain an elaborate
network of both transmembrane and cytosolic proteins, regulating epithelium integrity.
In this thesis, I studied the interactome of a transmembrane protein tricellu lin in Madin
Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells. It was the first protein found at
specialized tricellular junctions (TCJ), intersection at the apical vertices of three or more
epithelial cells, implicated to regulate the mechanical stress and help to maintain the
epithelial monolayer mechano-homeostasis. We examined tricellulin localization at the
TCJs and established a list of interaction partners of this protein via proximity dependent
biotin ligation (BioID) approach. BioID-analysis identified both known and novel TCJ
components: angulin, MAGI3, afadin and occludin. Through immunofluorescence
localization studies, these candidates were identified at apical junction complexes, co localizing with the well-defined TJ marker protein occludin. Subsequently, CRISPRCas9 knockout (KO) cell lines of these interactors were studied for their potential effects
on the actin cytoskeleton and TJ morphology. In cells lacking either angulin, MAGI3 or
tricellulin, the actin cytoskeleton morphology was altered, and TJ morphology appeared
tortuous. Moreover, absence of afadin drastically affected the actin cytoskeleton and TJ
morphology, resulting in physical openings within the TJs. The effect of afadin depletion
was further studied through examining the localizat ion pattern of TJ transmembrane
proteins. The results provided evidence that afadin is essential for maintaining tissue
integrity and barrier function at the epithelial TJ. Previous knockdown studies have
suggested angulin’s importance for recruiting tricellulin to the TCJ. In support to these
earlier studies, we utilized our KO cultures to confirm that accumulation of tricellulin at
TCJ was compromised upon absence of angulin. However, depletion of tricellulin did not
drastically affect the localization of angulin, reflecting an upstream role of angulin for
tricellulin localization. Future investigations using these KO cell lines will further
elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation, mechanosensation and
maintenance of the TCJs.

1. INTRODUCTION
Epithelial cells maintain organ homeostasis in mult icellular organisms and
protect the body through compartmentalization. The epithelial monolayer forms
a protective barrier surrounding organs. The function of these tissue barriers is
not limited to separating tissues to distinct compartments. They also protect the
external and internal surfaces of a living organism against the constant exposure
to pathogens, and other potentially harmful external agents.
Epithelial cells across all tissues share several common features. They are
highly polarized throughout their apico-basal axis (also planar polarization, as
shown in Figure 1). The apical domain is exposed to either the external
environment or lumen (internal cavity of the organ). Lateral interface establishes
interaction with the neighboring cells and basal surface establishes contact with
the basal lamina. This underlying extracellular matrix (ECM) layer consists of a
complex network of cross-linked proteins, such as laminins, collagens and
fibronectin, as well as carbohydrates, and polysaccharide chains [1], [2].
Epithelial cells contain distinct tissue-specific cellular junctions along their
plasma membrane to enable them to function as a barrier against external,
potentially harmful, milieu [3]. Unlike the mesenchymal cells that are migratory
and form adhesions predominantly to the surrounding ECM, the epithelial
monolayer constitute from cells tightly connected to one another through
intercellular junctions (shown in Figure 1) such as adherens junctions (AJs), gap
junctions and tight junctions (TJs) [4]. These intercellular junctions constitute
extracellular cell-cell adhesions, tethered at the plasma membrane of two
neighboring cells, that connect via various adaptor proteins to the intracellular
cytoskeletal components to modulate tissue integrity, barrier function and
morphogenesis [5].

Figure 1: The highly polarized epithelial cells constitute multiple intercellular junctions
throughout their apico-basal axis. The apical most tight junctions (TJ, shown in green), play an
essential role in sealing the gaps between epithelial cells and create a selectively permeable barrier.
Adherens junctions (shown in blue) located right below the TJs, link the actin cytoskeletons of the
adjacent epithelial cells. Similarly, the desmosomes (shown in dark red) connect neighboring cells
via intermediate filaments, contributing in maintaining the mechanical integrity. Gap Junctions
(shown in red), bridge the cytoplasm of adjacent cells for exchange of small ions and mediate
communication between the neighboring cells. The focal adhesions interact with the actin and
intermediate filaments to facilitate adhesion between the epithelial monolayer and the underlying
basal lamina.

The loss of epithelial barrier can result in tumor progression, inflammation,
or bacterial invasion. Pathogen induced alteration of the intercellular junctions,
mainly the apical TJs, can also contribute to disease progression and tissue
damage [6]. Cancers of epithelial origin are known to go through a characteristic
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). During embryonic development
and physiological response to injury or wound healing the monolayer undergoes
this fundamental process of EMT. Most adult organs arise from a series of this
fundamental process, as well as form the reversed EMT process namely
mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) [7]. This transition mainly targets
the intercellular junctional complexes, causing loss of cell polarity,
communication between neighboring cells, rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton
and problems in monolayer barrier integrity. All characteristic functions of the
epithelial monolayer are lost and they are transformed into migratory fibroblast
7

mesenchymal cells [7], [8].
The hallmark for tumor progression and acquisition of mesenchymal traits in
epithelial cells is noted by loss or disruption of TJs. Some key TJ proteins that
are down-regulated in tumor cells are occludin, claudins and Zonula occludens
(ZO-1 and ZO-2) [3], [9]. An important transmembrane protein of epithelial AJ,
Epithelial (E)-cadherin, is involved in the regulatory mechanisms crucial to drive
physiological morphogenetic events such as EMT. Loss of E-cadherin is also
associated with epithelial tumors in both mouse models and human tissues [10].
Considering the physiological and pathological importance of intercellular
junctions, I further discuss their functions in maintaining epithelial homeostasis
in the following chapters.

1.1.Adherens junctions
Due to the typical columnar shape of epithelial cells, the separation between
apical TJs and AJs is very distinct, whereas in endothelial cells, that are inherently
flat, the spatial separation of AJs and TJs is more challenging [11]. AJs are located
right below the TJ, composed of a set of core components that are accompanied
by different adaptor proteins. In polarized epithelium, transmembrane protein Ecadherin triggers the formation of the AJ complex. E-cadherin is a single-pass
transmembrane glycoprotein (shown in green in Figure 2) that mediates tissue
integrity via formation of homophilic, calcium-dependent intercellular adhesions
between neighboring cells [5]. Whereas the extracellular parts of E-cadherins in
adjacent cells trans-interact to form physical linkage, the intracellular domain
(cytoplasmic tail) of E-cadherin mediates interaction to the intracelluar protein
complex. Components of this cytoplasmic core complex are β-catenin (β-Cat),
α-catenin (α-Cat) and the p120-catenin [12], [13].
Interaction of these cytoplasmic proteins with E-cadherin regulates establishment
cell-cell junctions and their association with the actomyosin cytoskeleton. The
interaction between E−cadherin between p120−catenin primarily regulates the
turnover of the cadherin, by maintaining the protein at the cell surface [14]. It
has been shown that the complex of β-Cat and α-Cat along with E-cadherin
connects to the underlying actin cytoskeleton. This link is known to be mediated
by β-Cat via its association with α-Cat, an F-actin binding protein. The
cytoplasmic domain of E−cadherin interacts with β-Cat to form a cadherincatenin complex, which further binds to α-Cat [15], [16]. The binding of this
8

tension transducer protein, α-Cat links the cadherin-catenin complex to the actin
cytoskeleton and recruits several other cytoplasmic proteins such as vinculin and
−actinin [17], [18]. Vinculin is also an F-actin binding protein that binds to αCat due to actomyosin-dependent forces. The localization of both Vinculin and
α-Cat, in its stretched conformation, can be seen at tricellular contacts due to the
tension generated by the constriction of actomyosin bundles [19], [20]. The
elevated force experienced at the junctions is first sensed by α-Cat, which
responds to the force by changing its conformation to further induce binding of
vinculin [21]. Vinculin consequently promotes an increase in filamentous actin
(F-actin) in AJ to strengthen and reinforce AJs [22]. α-Cat is also known to
interact with several other actin-binding, planar polarity and apico-basal proteins
such as formins, ZO-1, and afadin. These junctional proteins play a central role
in epithelial cell-cell adhesion, by driving junction assembly, as well as by
contributing to epithelial monolayer maintenance [13].
In mature junctions, the cadherin–catenin complex is known to interact with
nectins, which are calcium-independent transmembrane adhesion proteins [23].
During junction formation, both nectins and E-cadherin cooperatively organize
the AJs. It has been also been indicated that nectins are capable of driving the
formation of adhesion junctions even without E-cadherin [24]–[26]. Nectins also
mediate interactions with several cytoplasmic proteins such as polarity complex
protein partitioning-defective 3 (Par3), and afadin [27], [28]. The interaction
between nectin and afadin is essential for junction formation. This interaction
enables the association of nectins with E-cadherin and also connects nectins to
the actin cytoskeleton. Through interaction with afadin, the nectin-based
junctions can form linkage with the nascent E-cadherin-based AJ complexes [29],
[30] and this is enabled through indirect association of afadin with α-Cat.
Afadin has several functional domains that enable its interactions with other
proteins [31], [32]. It has two isoforms: l-afadin and s-afadin. S-afadin is
abundantly expressed in neural tissues, whereas I-afadin is expressed in epithelial
cells [33]. This F-actin binding protein is mostly associated with AJs, where it
forms junctional complexes with nectin and ponsin [5], [33]. Ponsin is an lafadin–binding protein that also binds to vinculin to form a link between the
nectin–afadin and the cadherin–catenin complexes [34]. In polarized epithelial
cells, afadin associates with several signaling proteins like Rap1 [35], Rac1 and
9

Cdc42,

which are essential for the formation and maintenance of cell-cell

junctions [36], [37]. In Drosophila embryo, the homologue of afadin (canoe) and
Rap1 were shown to be crucial for establishment of apical–basal polarity of the
cells [38]. During apical constriction of mesodermal cells, canoe is known to
regulate the linkage of the actin cytoskeleton to the AJs [39]. Loss of the protein
inhibits cadherin-based cell junction formation in both AJ and TJ. In polarized
epithelial cells, afadin has been speculated to interact with both AJ ad TJ proteins
[40].
In epithelial cells, nectins play an important role in junction formation and are
known to organize E-cadherin in nascent adhesion junction complexes [41]. They
do this by interacting with the cytoplasmic complex, afadin-ponsin-vinculin, via
their conserved a cytoplasmic tail constitutes a PDZ-binding motifs [42]. The
role of afadin in epithelial junctions, other than as an adaptor protein to nectins,
still remains elusive to a large extent.

1.2. Tight junctions
TJs localize closest to the apical surface along the epithelial junctions. In the
early 1960s, Farquhar and Palade described TJs as a continuous belt-like ring
structure that circumvents the cell bringing the membranes of adjacent cells into
close apposition [43]. TJs regulate the movement small molecules, such as water
and ions, across the paracellular space based on their charge and size. Thus, they
form a selective semi-permeable epithelial barrier by preventing intramembrane
diffusion of proteins [44]. They also participate in maintaining apico-basal
polarity of cells [45]. Other than their role in structural integrity and barrier
properties of epithelial cells, they serve as a site for maintaining cell polarity,
signal transduction pathways that control cellular functions like proliferation,
differentiation, and migration. [46][47]. Integral membrane proteins of the TJs
are classified into four major families:
a) Claudin family proteins
b) Transmembrane-associated marvel protein (TAMP) family members
c) PDZ domain containing proteins
d) Single-span transmembrane proteins

10

The four different families work in unison either directly or indirectly via
several mediators, to regulate other TJ components [47]. Furthermore, several
regulatory proteins also co-localize with TJs [48].
1.2.1. Claudin family proteins
Claudin family proteins have been identified as vital components of TJ
complex, as they regulate the selective permeability of epithelial barrier [49],
[50], [51]. Claudins are tetra-span transmembrane proteins, which also recruit
occludin to the TJs [52]. They also contain a PDZ-binding motif that enables
their interaction with ZO family proteins. The homotypic adhesive
interactions between claudin molecules of neighboring epithelial cells is
marked as a characteristic structure of the TJs. The physiological function of
claudin has been mainly studied in regulation of permeability of the
paracellular seal [53], [54].
1.2.2. TJ associated MARVEL proteins
The TJ proteins sharing the MAL and related proteins for vesicle
trafficking and membrane link (MARVEL) domain. are classified under the
TAMP family, namely occludin, tricellulin and MarvelD3 [55]. Occludin, a
tetra spanning membrane

protein, was the first molecular component

identified at TJs, and it is expressed in all epithelial and endothelial cells [56],
[57]. The C-terminus of the protein has been shown to interact with ZO-1
[58]. This interaction appears to play a role in downstream, Ras homolog
family member A (RhoA)-mediated actin reorganization. A study using RNA
interference (RNAi) for occludin depletion has further reported impaired cell
extrusion linked to defective RhoA activation [59], indicating a link between
occludin and contractile cytoskeletal structures in epithelia.
1.2.3. PDZ-domain containing proteins of the tight junctions
Important class of TJ protein are the peripheral membrane proteins
harboring the PDZ-domain, which serves as an anchor to link these
membrane-associated proteins either directly or indirectly to the actin
cytoskeleton. PDZ-domain also functions as s scaffold for interaction and
cluster formation with other proteins at the plasma membrane [60], [61], [62].
Members of this family include the ZO 1-3, Membrane-associated guanylate
kinase inverted (MAGI) 1-3, as well as polarity proteins Par3 and Par6.
Except for Par proteins, these proteins further contain the membrane11

associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein domain, a Src homology 3
(SH3) domain, and a guanylate kinase (GUK) domain [63].

The PDZ

domains of ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3 enable these proteins to form homotypic
clusters [64], [61]. Additionally both ZO-2 and ZO-3 have been documented
to cluster with ZO-1 [65]. They can anchor the TJ strands with the
cytoskeleton, via directly binding to the TJ transmembrane proteins claudins
and occludin, as well as bind to the cytoskeletal components, forming a
regulatory platform between the physical junctions and the actin cytoskeleton
[48]. ZO-1 depletion has been linked to both increased and decreased
junctional actomyosin [66]. Emphasizing on the role of this scaffolding
protein, studies have reported that the knockdown (KD) of the protein in
epithelial cells results in delay in barrier formation [67], [68]. Also, in vivo
experiments of ZO-1 deficient mice are embryonic lethal, indicating its
importance in the development of epithelial organs and tissues [40].
1.2.4. Single-span transmembrane porteins
The single-span transmembrane proteins include the immunoglobulin
superfamily proteins such as junction adhesion molecules (JAMs), and
angulin family of proteins. JAM proteins are known to contribute to cell
adhesion and signaling. Through the PDZ binding motif of JAM-A it has been
reported to interact with afadin and ZO-1 [31]. It has been implicated in the
establishment of cell polarity via its interaction with polarity complex [9].

1.3. Tricellular junctions
The central function of TJs is to seal the intercellular space between cells,
enabling only selective permeability. Parallel to the TJ, specialized tricellular
junctions (TCJs) can be observed at the vertices of three or more cells [69].
At the site of this specialized ‘appendix’ of the tight junction, TJ strands of
neighboring cells turn and extend basally, attaching laterally to one another
to form a central tube [70]. Electron microcopy studies have suggested the
central tube of ∼10-nm to form a narrow passage, crisscrossed by
extracellular domains of the TJ strands [71]. Given the structure of the central
sealing element at the TCJ, these central tubes have been associated to the
leak pathway for maintaining the paracellular permeability of the epithelium,
regulated by the contractility of the actomyosin cytoskeleton [69], [72]. These
12

specialized junctions have been implicated as critical regulators of
maintaining the mechanohomeostasis of epithelial tissues and barrier integrit y
of the monolayer [73]. In vertebrate epithelial cells, tricellulin and angulin are
known to concentrate at the central sealing element of TCJs [70], [74]. Thus,
to understand the functional role of these specialized junctions it is critical to
unravel the significance of their molecular components.
1.3.1. Tricellulin
Tricellulin (also known as marvelD2),

like occludin is a four pass

transmembrane protein (shown in Figure 2), which belongs to the TJassociated MARVEL domain containing protein (TAMP) family [50]. It was
the first TCJ protein to be discovered through screening of downregulated
proteins in cells undergoing EMT

[70]. Tricellulin concentrates at the TCJ,

being widely expressed in most epithelial tissues such as kidney, small
intestine, stomach and lung, as well as at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [70],
[75].
In vitro KD studies of tricellulin in epithelial cells resulted in a decrease
in trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TER) and an increase in paracellular
permeability with disrupted occludin localization along TJs [70]. The
continuity of TJ network was significantly weakened upon the KD of the
protein. Ohkuni et al. also studied the expression of the protein localized in
human nasal epithelial cells. They speculate that tricellulin might faciliate the
function of the nasal epithelium in preventing entry of pathogens [76].
Another sensory organ, the inner ear cochlea, comprises an organ of Corti,
which harbors specialized epithelial mechanosensory hair cells that convert
acoustic vibration signals into nerve action potentials, relaying it to auditory
neurons. Loss of tricellulin resulted in deafness in mice and humans that has
been implicated to the degeneration of cochlear epithelial hair cells due to
dislocation of the protein from tricellular contacts [77], [78]. Interestingly, the
mutations generated for the mouse tricellulin, mimicking the human DFNB49
mutation, caused familial non-syndromic deafness [79], [80]. The disruption
of the TJ strands which connects to the central sealing element at the
tricellular contacts, on the removal of the protein indicates its essential role in
regulating the proper formation of the TJ structure and, in turn, development
of epithelial tissues. The research focusing on tricellulin so far, focused on
barrier forming function to control epithelial permeability, but there is
13

evidence pointing towards the potential role of tricellulin in regulating also
the mechanistic features of the cell-cell contacts in the epithelial cells.
1.3.2. Angulin-family proteins
Members of the angulin family are single-pass transmembrane protein that
localize at TJs. Three different angulin isoforms, with tissue specific
expression and partial redundancy, are expressed: Lipolysis-stimulated
lipoprotein receptor (LSR), immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain-containing
receptor-1 (ILDR1) and ILDR2. [74], [81]. The involvement of LSR in
maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and formation of tricellular contacts
has been studied via RNAi-mediated protein suppression, resulting in
decreased TER and increased macromolecular passage [82]. LSR is known to
enrich at tricellular contacts, expressed in the brain endothelium and at TJs of
central nervous system blood vessels [83]. The LSR knockout (KO) mouse
embryos displayed a leaky BBB resulting in embryonic lethality.
Interestingly, the loss of LSR results in altered BBB, but the embryos do not
exhibit alterations on TJ ultrastructure or in the expression of other TJ proteins
[83]. Unlike tricellulin, angulin family proteins localize throughout TJs, but
are enriched at tricellular contacts in epithelial cells [82]. Moreover, as LSR
KD was reported to impair tricellulin localization, the elaborate interaction
between these two proteins is likely to play an important role in the
establishment of the TCJs [74]. Consistently, the loss of expression of both
angulin and tricellulin in the organ of Corti resulted in a similar phenotype
[74], [45]. The loss of both proteins individually has been associated with
mouse and human deafness [84], [78].

Figure 2: Structural and signaling components of the epithelial cell-cell junction. In blue are
the transmembrane (occludin\tricellulin\angulin) proteins of the tight junction (TJ) and in green
are the transmembrane (nectin\cadherin) proteins of the adherens junction (AJ) that interact with
cytoplasmic proteins. AJs are composed of nectin- and cadherin-based adhesions that form transinteractions through their extracellular motifs and make connections with the actin cytoskeleton
through adaptor proteins like afadin and α-/β-catenin via their cytoplasmic tails, respectively. The
apical proteins presented here have been previously reported to reside in a close vicinity of the TJ
complexes. The zonula occludens (ZO) proteins (yellow), illustrated at the apical position of the
TJ, are central scaffolding factors that associate with TJ proteins through multiple interactions.
All these interactions within the TJs are expected to play a vital role in regulating the barrier
function and maintain homeostasis of epithelial tissues. They also contribute to maintenance of
cell polarity and function as signaling platforms via signaling proteins and transcriptional
regulators. The crosstalk between these complexes and the actomyosin cytoskeleton is essential
for maintenance of tissue integrity, mechano-sensing and mechano-transduction.

1.4. Contractile actomyosin filaments of the adherens and tight
junctions
Epithelial junctions exhibit tremendous plasticity, because epithelial cells are
exposed to great wear-and-tear and, thus, are continuously self-renewing. In
mammalian tissues like intestine, stomach, and skin the epithelia undergo
constant replenishment [85]. The cells also adopt to an alternate cellular fate in
response to extrinsic or intrinsic factors, like the intestinal cells that undergo
constant extrusion at the leading end of the villi [86]. The intestinal epithelium is
15

an excellent genetic model of epithelial plasticity as it undergoes transdifferentiation. An extensive characterization of stem cells and differentiated cell
populations can be noted in this epithelial organ.
The epithelial monolayer also responds to various mechanical forces during
different morphogenetic processes such as cell extrusion, intercalation, apical
constriction and collective cell migration. [87]. Mechanical forces exerted in a
monolayer are transmitted to cellular junctions that undergo dynamic remodelling. These forces experienced by the cells are responded via a variety of
feedback mechanisms. The process is referred to as mechanotransduction, when
cells convert mechanical stimulus into biochemical activity [88].
Epithelial cell-cell junctions are largely either organized into protrusive
networks that generate pushing forces via actin polymerization or contractile
networks that generate a pulling forces via non-muscle myosin II and F-actin [89].
Both protrusive and contractile actin cytoskeletal networks support these dynamic
processes that drive the assembly and maintenance of the intercellular junctions
[90], [91], [92]. Contractile actomyosin bundles, containing bundled F-actin
decorated with periodical arrays of non-muscle myosin II, connect to AJs along
plasma membrane [93], [94]. These contractile filaments respond to the mechanical
signals provided by the external or internal milieu affecting the tension sensed by
the AJ between neighboring epithelial cells [95]. Force transduction occurs through
the E-cadherin-catenin-actomyosin linkage. In fact, formation of stable E−cadherin
puncta in early AJ biogenesis is dependent on their interaction with junctional actin
filaments [96]. The E-cadherin-catenin complex provides a very dynamic link
between the signaling molecules of the AJ and the actin cytoskeleton [97]. The
cytoplasmic tail of the cadherin molecule binds to β-Cat, this complex recruits αCat, which is an F-actin binding protein. During development,

polarized

epithelial cells prevalently undergo apical contractions that are based on the
integrated AJs to the contractile thin filaments running along the junctions [98].
These contractile actin stress fibers connect to the underlying ECM and their
contractility is mediated by the myosin II activity. This multi-protein complex is
implicated as a mechano-transduction machinery, which is involved in AJ
remodeling [99]. Thus, playing a key role in mechano-sensing mechanisms,
junctional remodeling and polarization.

16

Besides AJs, TJs have also been implicated to regulate actin cytoskeleton
dynamics [72]. TJs comprise of proteins that act as both effectors and targets of
several signaling pathways, which play a vital role in the mechanosensing.
Several TJ proteins interact with the actin cytoskeleton either directly or via
additional cytoskeletal proteins such as ZO and MAGI [63]. Both ZO-1 and ZO2 have been studied as cytoplasmic scaffolds that regulate the interaction between
TJ membrane proteins to actin filaments [66]. The PDZ domain of ZO-1 mediates
its interaction with myosin via shroom2 protein [100]. Interestingly, several TJ
proteins like occludin or Tuba are known to interact with the regulators of Rho
family GTPases pathways [101]–[103].
The members of the Rho GTPase family are known to regulate the contractile
stress fibers. Indeed, several members of the Rho-GTPase family, such as Cdc42,
Rac1 and RhoA, co-localize with TJ proteins. [104], [105]. Heavily studied in
mesenchymal migrating cells, these proteins are implicated in cell adhesion,
migration and front-rear polarity. Especially RhoA drives tension-mediated
feedback between the myosin network and the junction by controlling the
formation of contractile actin stress fibers and focal adhesions [106], [107]. It is
known to stimulate actomyosin contraction through Rho−associated coiled−coil
kinase (ROCK) -dependent phosphorylation of the myosin light chain (MLC)
[108], [94].
The cell-cell junction, comprising both AJ and TJ protein complexes, provides
adhesive contacts by connecting to the actin cytoskeletons of the neighboring
epithelial cells. Thus, holding the epithelial monolayer intact and allowing the
tissue to withstand mechanical stress from adjacent cells and external environment
[28]. Epithelial cells tend to change their position, size and shape in the monolayer
depending on the biochemical and mechanical cues from the adjacent or external
forces. These cellular changes and mechanical stress are detected by various
protein components [109]. Further, the interplay between the junctions plays an
important role in providing junction stability in the monolayer during cellular
rearrangements either by transcriptional regulation, phosphorylation of the key
components, or by cytoskeletal dynamics [27], [110], [111]. Proper epithelial
morphogenesis and homeostasis eventually leads to tissue or organ development
as a result of coordinated cell dynamics.

17

1.5. Tension builds up at the tricellular junctions
Several studies have emphasized the importance of TCJs beyond maintaining
epithelial barrier integrity. TCJs have been nominated as tension hot spots in the
epithelial monolayer via mathematical modeling of the epithelial contractilit y
[112]. Tricellular contact points of the epithelial cells have been assessed as
vertices, supporting the tension emitted by the actomyosin bundles along cellular
junctions [73]. Disruption of TCJs has also been shown to affect the morphology
of the bicellular junctions (BCJs) [113], [112]. The changes in the tensile forces
experienced by both adherens and tight junctions have been implicated to change
the molecular composition of the TCJ [114]. It is known that several vital
signaling factors like RhoA, vinculin and Cdc42 that regulate the mechanical
properties of the cell are known to co-localize with TJ proteins [104], [105].
Tricellulin has been proposed to recruit Tuba, which can activate Cdc42 that
mediates junctional F-actin assembly and stability [115]. Tuba is further known
to regulate cytoskeletal organization and cellular processes like proliferation,
motility and polarity [115]. The RNAi-mediated depletion of ZO proteins results
in increased contractility and BCJ tension, implicated by sarcomere-like patterns
of junctional actomyosin [116]. The above study also observed increased altered
spacing between F-actin bundles at tricellular contacts. In another scenario, the
accumulation of vinculin and its binding partner α-Cat were reported to enrich at
the tricellular contacts upon elevated junctional tension [111].
An in vivo study that sheds light on the involvement of these specialized
junctions in dynamic remodeling of epithelial cells during organ development
was conducted by Higashi et al. In the Xenopus gastrula-stage epithelium,
subsequent of cytokinesis each new daughter cell was observed to make a new
tricellular contact with adjacent cells [111]. It was also observed that both angulin
and tricellulin were recruited to the mature tricellular contacts. Therefore, TCJs
emerge as spatial sites to sense and integrate biochemical and mechanical inputs
to guide epithelial tissue dynamics [117], [93]. Since the TCJs have been
speculated to play such a vital role for epithelial barrier function and
mechanohomeostasis, it is essential to understand the molecular composition of
these TJ vertices to decipher their contribution to mechanobiology of the
epithelial cell-cell junctions.

2. OBJECTIVES
To elucidate the molecular composition of the tricellular junctions, we
performed BioID proximity ligation assay in order to find novel interaction
partners of tricellulin. We focused on tricellulin, because in contrast to angulin, it
predominantly localizes at the TCJ. Furthermore, we used the BioID interactome
to pinpoint the localization (in x, y, z planes) of the selected tricellulin interactors
in epithelial cells. Lastly, we utilized the generated CRISPR-Cas9 KO cell lines
to examine the roles of the selected proteins, as well as tricellulin itself, in
formation of TJs as well as TCJs, and in establishing connection with the actin
cytoskeleton.

3.1. Cell culture
Wildtype (WT )Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells (female)
were maintained at 37°C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2, in Minimum
Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS;
Gibco, cat#10500-064); 10 U/ml penicillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 20 mM
L-glutamine (PSG; Gibco, cat#10378-016), referred to as complete media. For the
BioID experiment, Tricellulin-BioID2-HA-Flp-In T-Rex MDCK and eGFPBioID2-HA-CAAX-Flp-In T-Rex MDCK epithelial cells were used. These had

CRISPR-Cas9 KO cell lines for tricellulin, angulin, tuba, occludin, MAGI3 and
afadin were generated by A. Manninen lab (Oulu Universit y), which were
fluorescence activated cell (FAC)-sorted using BD FACSAria™ II Cell Sorter to
obtain clonal KO populations. Lifeact-TagGFP2 expressing MDCK epithelial
cells (generated by J. Lehtimäki, Lappalainen lab) were maintained with complete
MEM plus 450ug/ml G418 (Merck, cat#G418-RO)

3.2. BioID
BioID is a proximity-based biotinylation method, which characterizes proteinprotein interactions inside cells [118]. The method utilizes a mutated biotin
protein ligase (BirA*) fused with a bait to biotinylate potential interactors of the
bait-protein. Biotinylation is induced by supplementing the media with biotin that
reacts with proximal amine groups of the near-neighbors of the bait-protein
catalyzed by the BirA*. Thus, the proteins in the vicinity of the bait-protein are
labeled with the biotin moiety. These biotinylated proteins can purify using
streptavidin affinity capture and identified by mass spectrometry. BioID2 works
according to the same principle with certain improved modifications. Due to the
smaller size of BirA*, it localizes more efficiently to the fusion protein’s cellular
location and requires comparatively less biotin to activate biotinylation [119].
This method ensures mapping of proteins that localize to the TCJ, despite their
20

indirect or direct interaction with bait-protein tricellulin. Since biotinylated
polypeptides are not required to maintain interaction with the bait throughout the
purification process, this approach allows tricellulin to be functional in its native
cellular environment while probing for potential interactors, transient or strong.

Figure 3: Flow chart illustrating the BioID protein identification method. (1) A fusion of the
bait-protein with BirA* is stably expressed in WT MDCK cells where it promiscuously
biotinylates proteins in close vicinity. (2) The orange stars represent the biotin added in order to
induce biotinylation of the near- neighbors of the protein of interest. (3) The cell contents were
released by sonication for (4) streptavidin-sepharose affinity capture. (5) Lastly, the data generated
is analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify proteins that were proximity-biotinylated by the
fusion proteins.

3.3. BioID Roux Cell Lysis
For this experiment, we used the tetracycline-inducible Tricellulin-BioID2HA and eGFP-BioID2-HA-CAAX expressing MDCK cells (BirA* fused to the
tricellulin or eGFP). Cells were grown without biotin for 24 hours and for another
24 h in the presence of 50 µM biotin. The protocol followed for this BioID
experiment was adapted from Roux et al. [118]. These cell lines were expanded
on at least ten 15 cm dishes for each sample using Tet and biotin induction media
[complete MEM media with 50 µM biotin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#B4639), 5µg/ml
tetracycline (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#T7660-25G) and 2 mM sodium butyrate (SigmaAldrich, cat#B5887-250MG)]. To proceed with lysis, the induction media was
aspirated, and cells washed with sterile PBS on ice. Complete removal of media
was ensured before adding 8 ml of cold lysis buffer [50 mM Hepes pH 8.0, 5 mM
21

EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF with 1 % DDM, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, 1.5
mM Na3VO4, 1 mM DTT (Dithiothreitol), protease inhibitor cocktail (SigmaAldrich, cat# P8340), benzonase nuclease (1:1000 dilution)]. The cells were
harvested by gently scraping the plate and transferring the cells into 15 ml
eppendorf tube, also kept on ice. Two biological replicates were done for
tricellulin and four for enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The samples
were then sonicated on ice for 1 min 30 sec (3 x 10 % cycle, power 50 %). After
sonication, 2 ul benzonase nuclease was added. The samples were centrifuged at
4500 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C and the supernatants were transferred into new
tubes. Centrifugation at 16000 g for 10 min at 4°C was followed to clarify the
resultant supernatant used for subsequent affinity purification.
A pre-prepared 400 ul IBA bead slurry (Life sciences, cat#2-1201-010) was
used for each sample. The IBA beads were first washed twice with wash buffer 1
(WB1: 50 mM Hepes pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF with 1
% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM), 1 mM PMSF, 1.5 mM Na3VO4 , 1 mM DTT,
Sigma Protease inhibitor cocktail ) and the superficial buffer was removed,
without disturbing the beads at the bottom. The resultant supernatant obtained
after sonication was mixed with the pre-prepared IBA beads and kept on a rotator
for two hours at 4°C. Further, the beads were collected after centrifugation at
4000g for two mins at 4°C. The supernatant containing the `unbound sample´ was
removed. Next, 1 ml of WB1 was poured onto the beads loaded into a column and
resuspended. This step was repeated three times. The washes were continued with
wash buffer 2 (50 mM Hepes pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF)
four times. Finally, 300 μl of elution buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA,
150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 0.5 mM Biotin (Pierce biotin, cat#29129) was added
onto the column and incubated for 5 mins before collecting the flow through into
a new microcentrifuge tube. The eluates were stored at -80°C for further mass
spectrometry analysis done by Markku Varjosalo Lab (University of Helsinki).
The samples were collected at various steps and run on western blot (WB) to
confirm successful purification (data not shown).

3.4. Immunofluorescence Staining
For immunofluorescence (IF) stainings, MDCK cells were grown on laminin
coated, high precision glass coverslips. For the sub-confluent samples, cells were
fixed with 4% PFA 20 mins at RT at around 70 % confluency and 24 hours past
the 100 % confluency for the confluent samples. After this, the cells were
subjected to fixation by PFA. To proceed with IF staining, the cells were
permeabilized using 0.5% Triton-X in 1X PBS for 10 mins at RT. The coverslips
were subjected to blocking, with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)-PBST (1X
PBS- 0.02% Tween) at RT for 60 minutes. Finally, to proceed with antibody
stainings, the coverslips were incubated for 1 hour or more with the cell
monolayer in direct contact with primary antibody (Table 1) diluted in 5% BSAPBST away from light exposure. The cell monolayer was washed four times by
1ml of 1X PBST before subjecting it to the secondary antibody (Table 2). The
coverslips were incubated without exposure to light for one hour or more in direct
contact with 30 μl of secondary antibody (Table 2) and Alexa Fluor 488, 568 and
647 conjugated to phalloidin (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat#A12379, cat#A12380,
cat#A22287; 1:50). The coverslips were then washed in with 1X PBST for four
times, before placing them with the cell monolayer side down on 8 μl of ProLong
Glass Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat#P36980) on a glass slide.
For localization studies airyscan confocal microscopy was employed. The WT
MDCK cells were imaged using the LSM 880 (ZEISS) with a 40× 1.4 numerical
aperture objective. Images were acquired at 1,024 × 1,024 resolution, with 0.4µm spacing along the z-axis. Image acquisition and init ial processing was done
using the airyscan detector and Zeiss ZEN2 software. For KO MDCK and LifeactTagGFP2 expressing co-culture studies, the samples were imaged using Leica
DM5000B upright fluorescence wide field microscope with 40x oil objective.
Images were processed using ImageJ and imaris softwares.

3.5. Protein quantification
The protein concentrations of lysed cell samples were measured by Bradford
assay. BSA (Sigma, cat#SLCC9674) standards and samples (40 μl respectively)
in triplicate were diluted in 1:5 to Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad, cat#500-0006) 200
μl per well. Solutions were incubated at RT for 5 mins. The absorbances for both
the standards and the samples were monitored at 595 nm in a spectrophotometer
with the buffer and dye solution acting as a blank. The absorbance values for the
standards were plotted using the Microsoft Excel program. A linear regression fit
was applied to generate a standard curve to determine the protein concentrations
of the samples.

3.6. SDS –PAGE and Western Blotting
Identical amounts of protein samples, measured with Bradford assay, were
diluted 1:1 with 4X laemmli sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol
(BME). The diluted samples were then placed in boiling water (100°C) for 10
minutes. After a short spin at 11,000 rpm using a centrifuge, the samples were
loaded onto 4%–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad, cat#4561096) and run
at 120V for 25 minutes in cold SDS buffer. The relative protein sizes were
24

determined using PageRuler Plus Prestained Protein Ladder (Thermo Scientific,
cat#26619).
Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane with Trans-Blot Turbo
transfer system (Bio-Rad) using Mini TGX gel transfer protocol. The
polyacrylamide gels were placed with nitrocellulose membrane which was
already submerged in transfer buffer and whatman paper. The membranes were
then removed from the apparatus and incubated in ponceau red solution for 2
minutes to visualize successful transfer. The stain was removed with several
MilliQ washes and the membrane was blocked in 5% milk-PBS with 0.05%
Tween 20 (PBST) for one hour at RT on a shaker. After removing the blocking
solution, the membrane was washed with 1X TBS with 0.1% Tween20 (TBST)
twice for 3 minutes each time. Primary (Table 1) and secondary antibodies (Table
3) were diluted into fresh blocking buffer for overnight at 4°C and one hour at
room temperature, respectively. Membranes were next incubated in blocking
solution containing horse radish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody for 1
hour, and washed three times for 5 min in PBST. Lastly, the membranes were
developed using

Western Lightning ECL Pro

substrate (PerkinElmer,

cat#NEL120001EA) for protein detection. The blots were normalized to GAPDH
(glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Abcam, cat#ab29330) protein
levels and processed using ImageJ.

3.7. Sequencing
To perform Sanger sequencing of our CRISPR/Cas9-KO cell lines, we
isolated genomic DNA from the cells using Genomic DNA Mini Kit
(ThermoFisher Scientific, cat#K182000). The genomic DNA (100ng/μl) and 10
μM of each primer (Table 4) (Eurofins Genomic, Ebersberg, Germany) was used
for the PCR reaction. PCR amplification of template DNA was carried out using
KAPA HiFi (ReadyMix x 2, KAPA Biosystems, cat#KK2601). Reaction mixture
contained 12.5 µL ReadyMix x2, 1 µL forward and reverse primers, 1 µL genomic
25

DNA, and adjusted to a final volume of 25 µL using Milli Q water. Reaction
conditions were 95°C for 5 mins, then 98°C for 20 sec, 60°C for 15 sec followed
by 10 sec of 25 cycles at 72°C and 5 min of final DNA extension.
To the final PCR product, 1 µL of FastDigest DpnI (ThermoFisher Scientific,
cat#FD1704) was added. After an hour incubation at 37°C, 3 µL of the sample
was loaded onto the agarose gel and 20 µL of the PCR product was purified using
NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up (Macherey-Nagel, cat#740609.250). The
purified product was eluted in 20 μL of RNase-free water and concentration was
measured using a nanodrop machine. A total volume of 15 μL (5 ng/μL) of the
purified PCR sample was sent for Sanger sequencing to Eurofins Genomic,
Germany.

4. RESULTS
4.1. Identification of novel interaction partners of tricellulin
The first goal of this project was to identify interactors of tricellulin, a
signature protein of the TCJ. To attain this we used WT MDCK epithelial cells,
which display apico-basal polarity with prominent junctional complexes [120],
[121].
BioID, based on biotin ligase proximity labelling, enables the detection of
proteins in close vicinity to the bait (here, tricellulin) fused to the BirA biotin
ligase. We utilized a more efficient version of biotin ligase, BioID2, to enhance
the detection sensit ivity of potential, more transient interactors [118]. Peptide
counts of biotinylated proteins were detected and analyzed by mass spectrometry
to generate a list of ‘near-neighbors’ of tricellulin.
Comparison of the obtained tricellulin interactome with the plasma membrane
tethered BioID2-eGFP-CAAX probe (control) allowed the elimination of nonspecific interactions from the BioID data. eGFP was chosen as a control due to its
inert, non-toxic nature [122]. Further, a probabilistic algorithm, Significance
Analysis of Interactome (SAINT) was used to filter-out the unspecific interactors.
SAINT compares quantitative data of bait scores to that of control to assign
probabilities of true and false interactions [123]. For tricellulin BioID, we
analyzed two biological replicates, each further divided into two technical
replicates. For the eGFP (control), we had a total four biological replicates, each
similarly split into two technical replicates. The results from the BioID analysis
are shown in Table 5.
Since SAINT utilizes label-free quantitative data, a number of biological
replicates for both cases improved the robustness of the SAINT analysis [123].
Using a stringent (≥0.75) threshold we were able to significantly lower the risk of
false positive interactions. Based on the data obtained from BioID, the proteins
that were selected for further experiments (Table 5, bolded) were afadin (AFDN),
tuba (DNMBP), MAGI3, angulin (LSR) and occludin (OCLN). Albeit the SAINT
analysis did not identify angulin as a significant interaction partner for tricellulin
over the membrane-tethered eGFP, we selected it for further analysis due to
previously reported interaction between the two proteins [74], [82].
27

Table 5. SAINT-filtered BioID interactome for tricellulin. Interaction partners within the ≥0.75
a threshold of SAINT score was included in the list. The table contains from left to right, identified
interactor protein name, respective average spectral counts for tricellulin and membrane boundeGFP (control), and the SAINT score values of the interactors in respect to control. In bold are
highlighted the selected candidate, namely afadin (AFDN), MAGI3, tuba (DNMBP), angulin
(LSR), occludin (OCLN) and tricellulin (MARVELD2) itself. Values between 1-0.75 are
considered above the critical threshold for true interaction partners. For tricellulin two biological
replicates and for eGFP four biological replicates were collected, and each were further split into
two technical replicates prior mass spectrometry analysis.

4.2. Cellular localization of the BioID candidate proteins in
wildtype MDCK cells
In order to elucidate the cellular localization of selected potential interaction
partners of tricellulin, IF staining was performed on both sub-confluent and
confluent cultures of WT MDCK cells to reflect the potential localization
differences in nascent and mature cell-cell junctions, respectively. The distinction
between proteins apico-basal localization was enabled via accompanying occludin
staining, which is known to localizes to TJs and TCJs [70], [56]. Cells stained for
occludin and other selected proteins from the BioID analysis, were imaged with
Airyscan confocal microscopy to examine their localization in both XY and XZ
planes (Figures 4-7). The cellular localization of Tuba could not be mapped due
to unspecificity of the antibody in IF.

IF stainings demonstrated that endogenous tricellulin exclusively localizes at
the TCJs (Figure 4). In both confluent and sub-confluent cells, tricellulin
displayed prominent localization to the tricellular contacts, where three occludinpositive TJ strands converged (Figure 4A and 4B). The merged images and
orthogonal projections reflect upon the precise localization of tricellulin (in white)
at tricellular contacts in both nascent and mature cell junctions. In comparison,
angulin localizes densely at the nascent TCJ contacts of sub-confluent cells wit h
occludin (Figure 5A-B). Interestingly, unlike tricellulin, angulin does not
exclusively localize at the TCJs but is also dispersed around the TJs of both subconfluent and confluent cells. From the merged images and orthogonal
projections, we can observe that angulin extends basolaterally and does not colocalize with occludin along the bicellular contacts (x-z and y-z scans). MAGI3
antibody staining in both confluent and sub-confluent cells shows prominent
localization throughout the TJs with occludin (Figure 6A and 6B). Additionally,
the magnification of the merged MAGI3 and occludin channels indicate that
MAGI3 predominantly resides at tricellular contact points in both confluent and
sub-confluent cases. For afadin, IF analysis revealed its presence at TCJs of both
confluent and sub-confluent WT MDCK cells (Figure 7A-B). From the merged
images, afadin was observed to localize along the apico-basal axis of the cell-cell
contacts. However, unlike in confluent cells, afadin seems to be more
concentrated at the tricellular contacts in the sub-confluent cells. In both cases
(Figures 7A and B), the orthogonal projections of the merged images reflect the
co-localization between afadin and the occludin peculiarly at the TCJ but not
along the bicellular contacts. Interestingly, as reported earlier, we also did observe
afadin partially localizing to the nucleus (merged images, marked with yellow
arrows) [124].
Taken together, through the IF analysis of the whole apico-basal axis of the
MDCK cells, we were first able to validate the intimate co-localization between
the occludin and tricellulin at tricellular contacts. This demonstrates that
tricellulin co-localizes with occludin at the apical junctional complex. This
allowed us to further implement occludin localization as a probe for other selected
potential interactors. It was observed that each of the selected proteins from the
BioID list co-localized to occludin at the tricellular contacts. In case of afadin, the
localization did not directly overlap with occludin along the TJ, but increased colocalization was noted at TCJs.

4.3. Validation of CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts of tricellulin and its
interaction partners
Having validated the localization of the selected proteins from the BioID
screen, CRISPR-Cas9 KOs were generated using two different guide RNA targets
for MDCK cells. The protein levels in the original KO cultures, detected by IF
and WB analysis, indicated a heterogeneous population of WT and KO cells (data
not shown). In order to obtain pure KO cultures for tricellulin, angulin, afadin,
MAGI3, occludin and tuba, the original clones were FACS sorted as single clones
and expanded for additional WB analysis. Comparisons of relative protein levels
in KO cells against WT MDCK (control) are presented in Figure 8.

Figure 8. Validation of clonal CRISPR-Cas9 KO cell populations for tricellulin and its
selected BioID interactors. WB analysis of endogenous tricellulin, afadin, tuba, angulin, occludin
and MAGI3 protein levels from WT (control) and KO clones, respectively. Note, that no clonal
KO was obtained for tuba. GAPDH was probed for equal sample loading. A single KO clone
(corresponding to the red boxes) with no detectable protein, was selected for each protein for
further analyses.

The clear KOs were selected based on the absence of expression of the
respective proteins. For Tuba, we could not generate a clonal KO, thus no further
analysis was conducted for the protein. The WB validation was followed by IF
staining that further showed no detectable signal of the selected proteins in the
obtained KO clones (data not shown). Sanger sequencing for angulin, occludin,
tricellulin, afadin and MAGI3, was additionally performed to confirm that the
CRISPR-Cas9 mediated alterations for the respective genes (data not shown).

4.4. Effects of the absence of tricellulin and its interaction partners
on the junctional actin cytoskeleton and TJ integrity
It has been previously implicated that the interaction of TJ proteins with
actomyosin cytoskeleton is essential for maintaining mechano-sensation of
epithelial monolayer [61]. Moreover, TCJs have been suggested to experience the
highest tension generated by the junctional actomyosin network [112]. To
examine how depletion of tricellulin, angulin, MAGI3, occludin or afadin would
affect junctional F-actin structures and TJ morphology, we plated the obtained
KO cell lines in co-cultures with Lifeact-TagGFP2-expressing MDCK (control)
cells. Lifeact is a small pept ide, which binds to F-actin, enabling us to use this cell
line as a control in our studies where we co-cultured wildtype and KO cells [125].
We employed staining of ZO-1, an essential scaffolding protein, to study the
morphology of TJs. Several TJ proteins have been studied to interact with ZO-1,
which mediates their interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. The protein has also
been associated in regulating TJ assembly in epithelial cells [67], [126], [127]. To
ensure that the morphology of our control cells expressing the Lifeact-probe
corresponds to the WT cells, we first examined it in a co-culture with the WT
MDCK cells (Figure 9A). Identical F-actin and ZO1 staining pattern was observed
in both types of cells.
Next, we analyzed the morphology of the knockout cells in comparison to the
Lifeact-TagGFP2 expressing WT MDCK cells (Figure 9B). Tricellulin depletion
resulted in altered distribution of junctional F-actin, being significantly weaker in
the cell-cell contacts of the KO cells. Moreover, zig-zag organization of ZO-1
staining towards tricellular contacts was observed (Figure 9b´´, red arrows). On
the contrary, loss of angulin did not result in a pronounced effect on junctional Factin or on TJ morphology (Figure 9C).

38

Interestingly, MAGI3 KO cells displayed a similar, albeit a slightly milder,
phenotype as the tricellulin KO cells. Junctional F-actin seemed diffused (Figure
10a´) and ZO-1 staining displayed tortuous TJs (Figure 10a´´). For occludin
depletion, we did not discern any clear phenotype with the markers used here. Factin organization along cell-cell junctions appeared normal (Figure 10b´) and
ZO-1 staining also displayed similar morphology to that of the control. (Figure
10b´´). The most striking phenotype was seen after afadin depletion (Figure 10C).
The loss of afadin expression resulted in abnormal junctional cytoskeleton; the
phenotype was also seen to affect the control cells in close vicinity (Fig 10 c’).
Further, the loss of afadin protein resulted in openings in the TJs, typically close
to TCJs (Fig c’’, red arrows).

39

4.5. Absence of afadin results in displacement of TCJ proteins and
the TJ marker occludin
After observing ZO-1 positive TJ ruptures at the tricellular contacts (Figure
10C´´), we decided to further examine the functional relevance of afadin in the TJ
integrity. LifeAct-TagGFP2 expressing MDCK cells were co-cultured with afadin
KO cells. Tricellulin and its selected interactors were stained in the co-cultures of
afadin KO and Lifeact-TagGFP2 expressing MDCK cells. (Figure 11). Unlike in
the control cells (Figure 11A), loss of afadin resulted in loss of tricellulin from
tricellular contacts. Interestingly, tricellulin expression levels also appear
upregulated in the KO cells (Figure 11b´). Moreover, angulin and occludin were
also largely absent from the cell-cell contacts in the afadin KO cells (Figure 11 CD). Thus, albeit the ZO-1 still localizes to the TJs (Figure 10C´´), several other TJ
components appear to be lost after afadin depletion.

MDCK cells and (B-D) afadin KO cells, detected by anti-tricellulin (b´), anti-angulin (c´) and antioccludin (d´) antibodies, respectively. Single channels are shown as inverted lookup tables (LUTs;
greyscale). The green border indicates the junction between the KO and control MDCK cells.
Scale bars 10 µm.

4.6. Functional interdependence of two TCJ proteins, tricellulin and
angulin
Previous studies have identified both angulin and tricellulin as TCJ
components [70]. These studies utilized protein KD strategy to suggest the
importance of angulin for the correct localization of tricellulin [74], [82]. We
wanted to validate this interdependence between tricellulin and angulin using the
CRISPR-Cas9 generated, complete knockout MDCK cells. Using either
tricellulin or angulin KO cells in co-culture with Lifeact-TagGFP2 cells, we
visualized their endogenous localization when one of the proteins is absent
(Figure 12). IF analysis revealed that, in respect to controls (Figure 12A, C), the
accumulation of endogenous tricellulin at tricellular contacts was lost in the
angulin KO cells, where is instead localized throughout the TJs without any
marked enrichment at TCJ (Figure 12B). Interestingly, KO of tricellulin did not
display a similar effect on angulin. There was no difference in angulin
localization, but its protein levels at the TJs appeared slightly elevated (Figure
12D’). Conclusively, the localization of tricellulin at tricellular contacts indeed
appears to be facilitated by angulin.

microscopy images of Lifeact-TagGFP2 expressing MDCK cells (green) co-cultured with (A,C)

(a´,b´) and anti-angulin (c´,d´) antibodies, respectively. Single channels are shown as inverted
lookup tables (LUTs; greyscale). The green border indicates the junction between the KO and
control MDCK cells. Scale bars 10 µm.

5. DISCUSSION
Our study was designed to take advantage of the precise localization of
tricellulin at the TCJ and decipher novel protein components associated with
tricellular contacts. Besides the two known TCJ proteins tricellulin and angulin,
molecular components of these higher order mechanosensitive connections have
remained largely unknown. Here I discuss several novel components associated
with tricellulin, identified via BioID2 [118]. This method has been previously
employed to map interactors of protein complexes, such as focal adhesions [128]
and the components of the nuclear pore complex [129]. BioID eliminates the
requirement to maintain the bait-prey link throughout the subsequent lysispurification, thus enabling identification of more transient interactions [118].
Using a flexible linker between the bait and the BirA motif enables extension of
the labelling range of the proximity proteins by BioID2. Thus, increasing the
efficacy of BioID2 compared to BioID, by overcoming this limitation of intrinsic
biotinylation range of BirA [119]. Since BioID ensures mapping of all proximitybased candidates, this might also result in increased false positive hits. The usage
of an inert control protein in BioID is thus essential to attain a list of unbiased
interactors. In our study, the control used to filter out the false positives from the
interactome list was plasma membrane-associated eGFP. This protein is
considered not to significantly react with any specific set of mammalian proteins
[122]. The eGFP in our case was fused to a small CAAX motif, tethering it to the
plasma membrane where it biotinylated proteins in its close proximity. This
ensured elimination of false negatives that may not be strongly concentrated at the
tricellular contacts.
In addition to the transmembrane proteins: tricellulin, angulin and occludin,
several other cytoplasmic proteins such as adaptor, signaling and scaffolding
proteins were observed in the interactome BioID list. These cytoplasmic proteins
may link the transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton [5]. Several PDZcontaining proteins that were filtered as true interactors of tricellulin were afadin,
MAGI3, Par3 and Par6. PDZ domain proteins are known to regulate several key
cellular processes such as cell polarity, proliferation and integrity of cellular
junctions [130]. Par protein complexes are involved in regulating the apico-basal
and planar polarity in epithelial cells. Par3 is an essential cell-polarity protein that
42

is known to localize at the TJ and regulate its formation in epithelial cells [131].
This cell polarity protein interacts with afadin and nectin, in order to regulate the
formation of TJs [131]. The mechanism for cooperative interaction of Par 3 and
afadin or their individual functional relevance at TCJs remains unknown. Here I
will focus on angulin, tricellulin, occludin, MAGI3, tuba and afadin (Figure 13).

Figure 13: The TCJ components characterized in the TJ complex, as interactors of
tricellulin. The TCJ proteins characterized via BioID and cellular localization studies are the
transmembrane proteins (marked with a red dotted box) tricellulin, occludin and angulin (in blue).
The cytoplasmic adaptor protein afadin (in purple) and scaffolding protein MAGI3 (in yellow)
might interact with the junctional actin. The functional relevance of these proteins was emphasized
via their co-localization with the filamentous actin and TJ protein, ZO-1.

Angulin
Angulin was not scored as a true interactor based on our SAINT analysis
(Table 5), even though the average spectral count of tricellulin-BioID2 bait was
higher than of the control. The selection of angulin as a component of TCJ was
made based on existing literature [74], [84]. From our localization studies, angulin
was seen to be localized throughout the TJs, as well as extend basolaterally in the
cells. This indicates that angulin would be prevalent in close proximity with a
membrane-bound eGFP which also resides at the membrane interfaces of the cellcell contacts. Thus, the stringent probabilistic tool did not identify angulin as a
true interaction partner of tricellulin.
Angulin was observed to predominately co-localize with occludin at the
tricellular contacts (Figure 5A and B). The sub-confluent magnified images reflect
upon the enriched localization of angulin at TCJs (Figure 5B), which aligns with
the previous literature [82], [83]. Angulin is also dispersed apico-basally along
43

the bicellular contacts below the occludin staining (Figure 5, merged images).
This shows that angulin is not strictly localized to TCJs and can be seen to localize
throughout TJs. The localization of angulin in tricellular as well as bicellular
contacts might be linked to its role in the peculiar localization of tricellulin in
epithelial cells. Earlier studies speculated that angulin might play a role in the
establishment of primitive tricellular TJ contact point and facilitate the
recruitment of tricellulin. Several in vivo and in vitro studies have pointed out that
tricellulin does not localize at tricellular contacts in angulin-deficient mice and
cells

[74], [79], [82]. We, thus, investigated this previously reported [82]

upstream role of angulin in recruiting tricellulin to TCJs by using, for the first time
to our knowledge, CRISPR-Cas9 KO cell lines of these proteins. Our findings
indicate that the removal of angulin indeed resulted in displaced localization of
tricellulin from the TCJs (Figure 12B), whereas the loss of tricellulin did not
significantly affect the localization pattern of angulin in epithelial cells. Angulin
faithfully localizes at TJs in the tricellulin KO cells, although some pronounced
expression could be seen in bicellular contacts. These findings support the
hypothesis that angulin functions as an upstream regulator of tricellulin in the
formation of TCJs. It has also been suggested that the interaction between
conserved regions in the cytoplasmic tails of angulin and tricellulin is essential
for the correct localization of tricellulin in epithelial cells [74], [82].
Even though RNAi-mediated angulin suppression has speculated the
involvement of this protein in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and
formation of tricellular contacts [82]. The study comments on the functionality of
the protein on the basis of discontinuous expression of occludin and reduced TER
in angulin KD cells. However in our study, unlike tricellulin, the complete KO of
angulin did not reflect a strong phenotype. The angulin KO cells did not exhibit
any significant effect on either F-actin organization or TJ morphology (Figure
9C). An in vivo study also reported that despite the alteration in the permeabilit y
of the BBB, the loss of angulin does not display any effect on the TJ ultrastructure
[83]. The above study reported leaky BBB leading to embryonic lethality.
Moreover, another study reporting embryonic lethality in angulin-deficient mice
hypothesized the function of the protein related to lipid uptake in liver, lung and
kidney [132]. These findings, along with our results, indicate that angulin does
not directly influence the morphology or the actomyosin cytoskeleton at TJs.

44

Hence, it might function indirectly to maintain the homeostasis of the epithelial
organs and may not be the main driving component of TCJ.
Tricellulin
In our study, the depletion of tricellulin from epithelial cells resulted in both
diffused F-actin and altered morphology of TJs. Previous studies have reported
that tricellulin, via recruiting the Tuba–Cdc42 complex, might play a role in
linking actomyosin bundles to tricellular contacts [115]. An earlier study has
shown disrupted localization of tricellulin in double negative ZO-1 and-2
epithelial cells [133]. Several other studies have reported both increased and
decreased junctional actomyosin, which also demonstrated a delay in barrier
formation due to deletion of ZO-1 proteins [61], [67], [68]. In our results, the
altered morphology of TJ at the tricellular contacts (Figure 9b´´) due to loss of
tricellulin, might indicate a direct interaction of the protein with the scaffolding
protein ZO-1. A study by Riazuddin et al. reflects upon the role of tricellulin in
the dysfunction of cochlea causing deafness. They also speculate the cause to be
the inability of the truncated protein to bind to cytosolic scaffold formed by ZO
proteins [78]. Conclusively, our results support the involvement of tricellulin in
regulating the actomyosin tension via other TJ cytosolic adaptor proteins such as
the central scaffolding protein, ZO-1 (Figure 9b´´) and the Tuba–Cdc42 complex
[115].

Occludin
The last transmembrane TJ protein from the BioID list, occludin, was used as
TJ marker protein in our study. Occludin localizes throughout TJs, being slight ly
enriched at the tricellular contacts.

An in vitro study using epithelial cells

concluded that the expression of occludin is not essential for the normal assembly
of TJs [59]. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have concluded that loss of occludin
does not alter the functionality of TJs significantly [134], [135]. The lack of
phenotype via ZO-1 staining on the knockout of occludin (Figure 10b´´) might
suggest no direct interaction between them. A previous study on the function of
ZO-1 in TJ assembly reports that the interaction between occludin and ZO-1 is
vital neither for the localization of the protein nor for junction assembly [67]. The
unaltered organization of F-actin due to loss of occludin was quite intriguing
45

(Figure 10b´) since this protein has been implicated in regulation of actin
reorganization via the Rho-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements. It has been
speculated that cells depleted of occludin are unable to activate small GTPase
RhoA and subsequent Rho-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements, which are
necessary for apical extrusion [59], [136]. The lack of occludin has also been
reported to displace the localization of tricellulin in epithelial cells [137] and
display a similar phenotype as tricellulin depletion by resulting in degeneration of
the organ of Corti and causing deafness in mice [138]. An earlier study not only
reported a displaced localization of tricellulin, but also increased levels of the
protein in bicellular contacts. Thus, they speculate that tricellulin as a MARVEL
domain protein might compensate for function of occludin in epithelial cells
[137]. Thus, it is possible that loss of occludin did not alter the F-actin
organization in our study due to the compensatory mechanism by the expressio n
of tricellulin, as has also been speculated earlier.
MAGI3
MAGI-1, MAGI-2, and MAGI-3 are peripherally associated cytoplasmic
proteins, active in TJs. These MAGUK family of proteins are mainly found in the
assembly of multiple protein complexes on the inner surface of the plasma
membrane at regions of the cell-cell contact points (TJs) in epithelial cells and
synaptic junctions in neurons [139]. Our localization studies displayed
localization of MAGI3 throughout TJs (Figure 6). MAGI, just like the ZO
proteins, is known to function as a scaffold between transmembrane proteins and
the actin cytoskeleton [140]. It has been speculated that MAGI might play a role
in stabilizing cell-cell junctions. Interestingly, MAGI3 has been implicated to
regulate Rac1, Cdc42 [141] and RhoA [142]. The junctional actin in MAGI3 KO
cells was not properly localized along cell borders (Figure 10a´). Thus, this might
indicate reduced contractility in MAGI3 KO epithelial cells. Moreover, our data
indicate that the KO of MAGI3 appears to display a very similar phenotype to that
of tricellulin. A study on pancreatic duct epithelial cells suggested that c-Jun Nterminal kinase (JNK) pathway regulates tricellular tight junctions, as well as
expression of tricellulin [143] and another study implicated the involvement of
MAGI3 in regulating the JNK signaling via a GTPase, Rac [144]. This might
implicate a direct or indirect interplay between the two proteins at the tricellular
contacts. MAGI3 has also been previously shown to localize with ZO-1 at TJs
46

[141]. Interestingly, we documented that the loss of MAGI3 resulted in tortuous
ZO-1 pattern (Figure 10a´´), indicating potential interaction between ZO-1 and
MAGI3 as MAGUK family proteins containing PDZ domains [145].
Tuba
Another protein that was identified as an interactor of tricellulin from the
BioID list was Tuba. Tuba appears to regulate junctional stability via Cdc42
activation. Previously it has been reported that tricellulin, via recruiting the Tuba–
Cdc42 complex, might play a role in linking actomyosin bundles to tricellular
contacts [115]. Besides activating Cdc42, Tuba also interacts with ZO-1 for
maintaining junctional assembly and stability [146]. Tuba was listed as an
interactor of tricellulin and its functional relevance at TCJs was quite intriguing.
The localization of this protein could not be visualized due to unspecificity of the
antibody in IF. Further, we were unable to generate Tuba KO MDCK cells. In
order to overcome the antibody specificity issue, we could use an alternative
approach of endogenously integrating an epitope tag (such as Myc or GFP) to the
protein. In fact, a study has previously employed this approach for yeast Tuba to
study Rho-controlled pathways [147].
Afadin
Another interesting identified interactor of tricellulin was the characteristic
AJ protein, afadin. It was also concentrated at TCJs, albeit it did not significantly
co-localize with occludin along bicellular contacts (Figure 7). Afadin’s role as an
AJ component has been studied much more than its potential role in TJs [148] .
Afadin has been known to be involved in maintaining the junctional organization
and establishment of apico-basal polarity via polarity complexes (Par3) [131] and
in regulating junctional actin modeling at the AJ through nectins [5].
From our results, the TCJ-targeted localization of afadin was enhanced in subconfluent cells (Figure 7B), indicating its probable role in regulating the
contractility of the actomyosin cytoskeleton at nascent tricellular contacts. The
localization of afadin at TCJs in both mature and nascent junction was intriguing.
This is because previously it has been suggested that the role of afadin is disrupted
after TJ formation [126]. The double KD of ZO-1/ZO-2 proteins have exhibited
increased junctional tension by recruiting afadin at TJs [116]. This observation
was also made in Drosophila with the homologue of afadin, Canoe [39], [149].
47

Our results indicate the role of afadin at tricellular contacts, as the loss of protein
resulted in a drastic change in the morphology of cell-cell junctions, manifested
by hole-like openings of ZO-1 positive TJs close to the tricellular contact sites
(Figure 10c´´). Since the KD of ZO-1 alone has been reported not to alter the
expression of afadin in cells [126], this indicates the importance of afadin in
regulating the TJs via its localization at tricellular contacts. More strikingly, the
loss of afadin resulted in aberrant organization of the junctional cytoskeleton and
affected also the control cells in close vicinity (Figure 10c´). Previously, elevated
contractility has been reported to cause increased recruitment of afadin and
altered spacing of F-actin bundles at tricellular contacts [116]. The bicellular
actomyosin arrays are considered to be as separate contractile units that anchor
unto the highest apical force experiencing tricellular contacts. The peculiar
localization of afadin at these specialized junctions might facilitate the regulation
of contractile units in TJs via mechano-sensing. The role of afadin at tricellular
contacts might be of importance for regulating the functions of tricellular as well
as bicellular components at the TJs via its interaction with either ZO-1 or the actin
cytoskeleton.
Furthermore, afadin depletion displaced tricellulin from the TCJs and the
localization of angulin and occludin from the TJs. (Figure 11). As previously
stated in many studies, the interaction between afadin and ZO-1 might be essential
to regulate epithelial TJ assembly [126], [116], [133]. Afadin may also control
the localization of these proteins indirectly, by regulating the organization or
assembly of intercellular junctions. The holes at the tricellular contacts might be
due to compromised role of afadin in strengthening the actin filaments at these
tension hotspots.

Thus, the partial loss of angulin/occludin localization and

complete loss of tricellulin combined with the holes at tricellular contacts, might
be due to the role of afadin result in regulating the actomyosin contractility at
these tension hotspots.

48

6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVE
Conclusively, the proteins selected from the BioID list as interaction partners
of tricellulin indeed localize at the tricellular contacts. These proteins have already
been identified as AJ or TJ components. The validation of these proteins as TCJ
proteins shifts the focus in understanding how they respond to the mechanical
forces during cell extrusion, intercalation, apical constriction, collective cell
migration and morphogenesis. These TCJ proteins might be involved in the
dynamic remodeling of the intercellular junction and, thus, in maintenance of
epithelial barrier integrity via a variety of feedback mechanisms.

The most

interesting result of this study was the effect of afadin on the TJs and its
transmembrane proteins. Our speculation that the protein might be involved in
regulating the actomyosin contractility at these tension hotspots is intriguing. It
was also surprising not to see any effect on the F-actin due to loss of occludin,
which is known to control the actin cytoskeleton via Rho pathway. The lack of
knowledge regarding MAGI3 and similarity of its knockout phenotype to the one
of tricellulin was also a keen observation.
In the future, it would be interesting to study the phenotype of cells where both
occludin and tricellulin are simultaneously depleted (e.g. via RNAi-mediated KD
of tricellulin in occludin KO cells), because these two MARVEL domain proteins
have been speculated to have overlapping functions [137]. Also, it might be useful
to study all KO cell lines generated here under elevated tension, using a stretching
apparatus that exerts even stress on the epithelial monolayer, because myosin IIdependent contractions are known to regulate epithelial monolayers in response
to various external mechanical stimuli [150]. To better understand the role of
junctional actomyosin bundles and their connection with the TCJ, non-muscle
myosin II could be visualized in our cells lacking these novel TCJ proteins, using
both fixed-cell as well as live-cell imaging assays. Together, such studies might
help to understand the precise roles of these proteins in TCJs, as well as the impact
of junctional tension of both AJ and TJ protein dynamics.
