Title of the thesis:
Fluorescence imaging of Drosophila melanogaster tracheal system:
investigating the morphology of LUBEL mutant flies

Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification that is a key regulator in many
pathways in the cell. Mutant LUBEL (lubelMi), linear ubiquitin E3 ligase, flies are
unable to form methionine 1 (M1) linked ubiquitin chains in Drosophila and die
in hypoxic conditions, whereas wild-type Cantons flies survive. The Drosophila
respiratory system is examined to determine if the flies are asphyxiating due to
morphological changes in the tracheal epithelial tissue. To image morphological
changes in the epithelial tissue, I used chitin-specific and tubulin-specific silicone
rhodamine (SiR) probes and Calcofluor White staining in combination with Zeiss
LSM 880 with AiryScan microscopy techniques to evaluate the respiratory system
in CantonS in basal conditions, and, thus, develop a criterion for comparison with
lubelMi flies. I then used STED microscopy to image taenidia within the tracheoles
and measure tracheole diameter in CantonS and lubelMi flies. A novel phenotypic
abnormality was seen in LUBEL mutant flies, lubelMi and lubelRNAi flies, in
comparison to the control group. lubelMi and lubelRNAi flies have discontinuous,
abnormal tubulin projecting from the trachea and tracheoles and measurably
thicker dorsal trunks in comparison to the control group. This abnormal tubulin
phenotype and increased dorsal trunk diameter could be caused by a LUBELinfluenced developmental error during organogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster
larvae.

1. LITERATURE OVERVIEW
1.1 Microscopy
The first microscopes date back to the 13th century, starting as a single lens magnifying
glass and later developing into more sophisticated devices, such as the compound
microscope. The word microscope derives from Ancient Greek words mikrós, meaning
“small”, and skopéō meaning, “to look at” (Bardell, 2004). The growing field of
microscopy has allowed scientists to view objects otherwise unseen by the human eye,
such as cells, viruses, and other small structures, such as the Drosophila melanogaster
respiratory system.

1.2 Fluorescence
Fluorescence is a form of luminescence that is caused by the excitation of an electron.
The electron excitation subsequently causes the emission of a photon which produces
light. An electron can be excited physically through the absorption of light, mechanically
by forces such as friction, or through chemical reactions. In regard to microscopy, the
electrons of a fluorophore are excited to the singlet state (S1 and S2) by the absorption of
light within a specific wavelength and as the electron returns to the ground state (S0), a
photon is emitted within a specific wavelength (Figure 1) (Lakowicz, 2006).

Figure 1. Photon excitation from ground state level to excited state level due to the absorption
of electromagnetic waves within the photon’s excitation spectrum. As the photon vibrates
and releases energy, it steps down from the S2 excited state level to the S1 excited state level
and light is emitted from the photon as it returns to the ground state level.
The average lifetime of a fluorophore (time between excitation and proton emission) is
5

Benoit, Sabrina

around 10 ns. Luminescence can also have longer lifetimes; this is known as
phosphorescence. During phosphorescence, the proton emission occurs as an electron
slowly returns to ground state from the triplet state (T1) generating lifetimes of
milliseconds to seconds (Figure 2) (Fister et al., 1997).

Figure 2. Phosphorescence occurs when a photon undergoes spin-orbit coupling
which sends it into the triplet state. There is a time delay when returning to the
ground state level from the triplet state, causing phosphorescence light emission.

The unique properties of aromatic fluorophores in combination with larger
macromolecules such as lipids, enzymes, or proteins, constitute fluorochromes that are
capable of undergoing electron transitions in biological systems (Herman et al., 2015).
Fluorochromes are excited by light within a specific wavelength range and the emission
occurs within an increasing wavelength range, this is called the Stokes’ shift (Figure 3).
Stokes’ shift is defined as the difference between the maximum excitation wavelength
and the maximum emission wavelength (Fister et al., 1997).

6

Benoit, Sabrina

Figure 3. Stokes’ shift is characterized by the wavelength difference between the
absorption and emission spectrums of a photon. When a photon is returning to the
ground state level after excitation there is a vibrational loss of energy. This loss of
energy causes a shift in the wavelength of the emission light because light of longer
wavelengths has lower energy levels.
After an electron is excited to the singlet state due to the absorption of a photon, the
electron must relax to the ground state through the emission of a photon and vibrational
relaxation, which causes a loss of energy. Decreasing energy causes an increase in the
photon’s wavelength, thus a change in visible light color (Thermofisher Scientific, 2017).
E.g. A fluorochrome excited by light within 450-550 nm (green) will emit light between
550-650 nm (yellow/orange) (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Fluorophores can be excited by electromagnetic waves ranging from
ultraviolet waves (UV) to infrared waves (IR). As electromagnetic waves increase in
wavelength, they decrease in energy. Visible light exists between the wavelengths
380-750 nm, and fluorophores used in microscopy emit light within the visible light
spectrum.
The Stokes’ shift is crucial for the use of fluorochromes in microscopy. Fluorochromes
can be conjugated with certain macromolecules that allow them to attach to specific
biological structures with strong specificity. By using specific light sources, excitation
and emission filters, and specialized detectors, one can excite the fluorochrome and detect
the emitted photons to visualize the location, function, or structure of the target of interest
(Herman et al., 2015).

1.2.1 Silicon Rhodamine Fluorophores
There is a specific family of fluorophores known as rhodamines. Within this family is a
newly developed derivative: an organic fluorophore known as silicone rhodamine (SiR).
During the development of the SiR probes, the intended use was for live-cell imaging;
therefore, they were originally developed to target the two primary components of the
cytoskeleton: tubulin and actin. The SiR probes were conjugated to the microtubule and
F-actin ligands docetaxel and desbromo-demethyl-jasplakinolide (Lukinavičius et al.,
2014). SiR is an ideal fluorophore because it is bright, highly fluorogenic and photostable.
SiR excitation and emission wavelengths are in the far-red spectral range (650-670 nm)
where little autofluorescence and phototoxicity occurs. These longer wavelength values
and lower energy levels of the far-red light allow for more gentle and deeper penetration
into the samples (Lukinavičius et al., 2013). SiR staining does not require any transfection
or washing steps, which is ideal for staining small, delicate structures. When moving
delicate tissue samples from one solution to another, the surface tension of the liquid
solution breaks and damages the tissue, regardless of how carefully the tissue is
transferred (Pitsch and Köster, 2015).
SiR derivates exist in equilibrium between the fluorescent ON state and nonfluorescent
OFF state. SiR is conjugated to a ligand that specifically binds to a target of interest (e.g.
tubulin). For example, the ligand binds to the polar target surface of tubulin, hydrophobic
aggregation occurs, causing a conformational change of the conjugated SiR probe. The
probe exists in a closed, spirolactone form until it binds to the polar protein surface and
changes to an open, zwitterion form that is excitable by far-red light (Pitsch and Köster,
2015).
Spirochrome, the producer of SiR fluorophores, have since developed many different
versions of SiR labelling, such as SiR- DNA labelling, SiR F-actin labelling, and SiRCOOH staining. When SiR-COOH was colocalized with Calcofluor white staining in
Drosophila melanogaster larvae, a bright staining signal was seen, indicating that SiRCOOH can be used to stain chitin-composed taenidia in the respiratory system
(Lukinavičius et al., 2013). Calcofluor white is an easy-to-use, well-validated
fluorescence dye that specifically binds to chitin and cellulose. Calcofluor white, like SiR,
can be used without any transfection or washing steps, making it an ideal companion to
SiR when staining the respiratory system in Drosophila (Lukinavičius et al., 2018).

1.3 Fluorescence microscopy
Microscopy in combination with specialized chemical compounds, known as
fluorophores, allows one to view specifically illuminated structures within a microscopic
organism. This is known as fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence microscopy is used
to visualize target structures by detecting the fluorescence emitted by a fluorophoretagged sample. Some example of fluorescence microscopes include laser scanning
confocal microscopes, spinning disk microscopes, two-photon microscopes, and superresolution microscopes (Sanderson et al., 2014).

Figure 5. Schematic diagram of a fluorescence microscope. A basic fluorescence
microscope has five primary components: light source, excitation filter, dichroic
mirror, emission filter, and detector.

Basic setup of a fluorescence microscope (depicted in Fig. 5):
1. Light source: A light source must be used to illuminate the sample and excite the
fluorochromes. A variety of light sources can be used for fluorescence
microscopes, similarly to a basic compound microscope. Some examples of
commonly used light sources include mercury lamps, xenon lamps, argon lasers,
light-emitting diode (LED).
2. Excitation filter: In order to ensure that we are visualizing the target of interest,
only light within the specific excitation range should be projected onto the sample;
this also reduces the amount of light and phototoxic energy that the fluorochrome
is being exposed to. Excitation filters allow only light within a specific excitation

9

Benoit, Sabrina

wavelength range to pass through it and all other wavelengths of light are blocked
out.
3. Dichroic mirror: Dichroic mirrors, or dichromatic beam splitters, control the
movement and reflection of light within the microscope. Using specialized glass
coating and interference filters, only light within the excitation spectra is reflected
onto the objective, while only light within the emission spectra is allowed to pass
through the dichroic mirror towards the detector.
4. Emission filter: Before the emitted light from the sample enters the detector, it
must first pass through an emission filter. Similar to the excitation filter, the
emission filter only allows light within a specific emission wavelength range to
pass through it and all other wavelengths of light are blocked out.
5. Detector: After passing through the emission filter, the light is directed into the
eyepiece for viewing by the operator or into the detector. Monochromatic cameras
with high sensitivity and low noise are the most commonly used form of detector.
The two main types of camera detectors are CCD (Charge Coupled Detectors) and
sCMOS (scientific Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors) (Mandracchia
et al., 2020).
1.3.1 Confocal Microscopy
Confocal microscopy is a fluorescence microscopy technique that uses a pinhole to block
out-of-focus light from reaching the detector, thus improving image resolution and
contrast. When light passes through a pinhole, an airy disk forms. An airy disk is the name
of the bright, central region of the diffraction pattern that is produced when light passes
through a small circular aperture, such as a pinhole (Airy, 1835). There are two main
types of confocal microscopy that utilize this pinhole technique: laser scanning confocal
microscope and spinning disk confocal microscope.
Laser scanning confocal microscopy is fundamentally similar to a basic widefield
fluorescence microscope. A light source (laser) with a specific wavelength within the
excitation spectra of a fluorophore is used to illuminate the sample. The light source
reflects off of a dichroic mirror and, in a widefield fluorescence microscope, the light
source would directly illuminate the sample. However, in laser scanning confocal
microscopy, the laser strikes motorized mirrors that then scan the laser across the sample
(Prasad et al., 2007). Spinning disk confocal microscopy utilizes the same pinhole
principle as laser confocal microscopy, but in spinning disk microscopy, the microscope
10

Benoit, Sabrina

is able to detect multiple points simultaneously by using a spinning disk with multiple
pinholes versus a narrow scanning laser and one pinhole. After the absorption of the
scanned light and excitation of the fluorochrome, emission light passes through the
dichroic mirror and is focused through the pinhole, and this focused light is then detected
by the detector. As the microscope scans the sample with the excitation laser, the sample
is being interpreted bit by bit, pixel by pixel. After the emission photons are detected by
the detector (usually a photomultiplier tube), computer software uses the pixels to create
the overall image (Prasad et al., 2007).

Figure 6. The basic setup of a confocal scanning light microscope has six primary
components: detector, pinhole, light source (laser beam), beamsplitter, objective
lens, and specimen stage. The light source is scanned across the sample using a
system of motorized mirrors (beamsplitter) and the emission light passes through a
pinhole to reduce outside noise before reaching the detector.
Photomultiplier tubes is an extremely photosensitive device that releases an electron in
response to the absorption of a photo. As a photon passes through the photocathode, an
electron is then released. This electron is then multiplied as it is traveling across the tube
and strikes the dynode chain. Once the electrons have traveled across the tube and
multiplied the signal, an anode collects the multiplied electrons and generates a detectable
current. Photomultiplier tubes are an essential component of a laser scanning confocal
microscope because the microscope only scans one pixel of the sample at a time;
therefore, a very sensitive detector is required to generate an image (Abramowitz and
Davidson, 1999).
11

Benoit, Sabrina

Figure 7. Photomultiplier tubes (PMT) release an electron from the photocathode
upon contact with a photon. The electron travels across the dynode chain, causing a
release of additional electrons, which amplifies the signal given from one single
photon. This signal amplification makes PMTs a preferred form of photon detection
due to its sensitivity.

Confocal microscopy techniques have greatly improved the field of fluorescence
microscopy by its ability to reduce out of focus light and create 3D images using optical
sectioning. Not only does this reduce the amount of damaging light that the sample is
exposed to, but also creates images with reduced background noise due to the use of a
pinhole to only collect focused light. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy
is a super-resolution, fluorescence microscopy technique that uses an additional depletion
laser to reduce fluorescence emission surrounding the focal point within a sample (Gines
and Davidson. 2018). Before the development of super-resolution microscopes, the
resolution of a microscope was defined by the Abbe diffraction limit for a microscope:
𝑑=

𝜆
𝜆
=
2𝑛 sin 𝜃 2𝑁𝐴

The diffraction limit of a microscope is dependent upon the traveling light wavelength
(𝜆) and the numerical aperture (NA) of the microscope’s objective. This defines the
resolution limit:

the distance at which the microscope can completely distinguish

between two separate points within a sample (~200 nm). STED microscopy was
developed in order to overcome this resolution limitation of previous confocal
microscopes. When a single point is excited within a sample, an Airy disk forms within
the diffraction pattern of the emission light. The volume of excitation light is larger than
12

Benoit, Sabrina

the size of the actual point, which restricts the microscope’s ability to distinguish two
closely located points from one another. STED microscopy uses a donut-shaped depletion
laser to shrink the excitation area surrounding the focal point through the deactivation of
fluorophores in the outer regions of the Airy disk, allowing images to be resolved beyond
200 nm (Figure 8) (Gines and Davidson. 2018).

Figure 8. Effect of a STED depletion laser on an excitation beam. Excitation
beam exciting a focus point (left), donut-shaped depletion laser (middle), and
the remaining fluorescence emission once the two lasers are merged (right).

In a traditional fluorescence microscope, a fluorophore is excited by a light source within
its excitation wavelength range by the absorption of a photon. This absorption causes an
electron of the fluorophore to jump from ground state to singlet state. After excitation,
the electron relaxes to the ground state and releases its energy as a photon with a specific
emission wavelength. In STED, this process is interrupted before the electron can relax
and release a photon. The excited electron is hit with a high intensity depletion laser,
which forces it to relax to the ground energy level, thus inactivating the fluorophore
(Figure 9) (Gines and Davidson. 2018).

Figure 9. Jablonski diagram representation of an electron’s stimulated emission. In
comparison to traditional confocal microscopy fluorescence emission, stimulated
emission of a photon causes a decrease in energy and increase in wavelength (redshift).
13

Benoit, Sabrina

In a STED microscope setup, the light source is composed of two synchronized pulsed
lasers (excitation and depletion lasers). The depletion laser passes through a phase plate,
which causes the laser’s donut-like shape. Both lasers pass through dichroic mirrors,
similarly to confocal microscopy, that allows excitation light to be reflected onto the
sample, and emission light to pass through the dichroic mirror and enter the detector
(photo-multiplier tube). Unlike confocal microscopy, STED microscopes have fixed laser
paths and a scanning sample stage versus a scanning laser (Figure 10) (Gines and
Davidson, 2018).

Figure 10. STED microscope setup and resulting effective fluorescence emission. A
STED microscope uses two lasers of different wavelengths (excitation and depletion
lasers) to reduce the excess fluorescence surrounding the point-spread function. This
allows for increase resolution far beyond widefield microscopy.
STED super-resolution microscopy is a revolutionary microscopy technique, which is
also very complex and challenging. When imaging beyond the diffraction limit, external
forces such as vibration and spherical aberration have a larger impact. Biological samples
are more easily photobleached by the intense quenching beam. Super-resolution imaging
of such small structures also creates more noise in acquired images (Ulbirch, 2016).

1.4 Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism
Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as the fruit fly, is a very wellunderstood model organism, easy and inexpensive to culture, and has a short life
cycle. Drosophila are less genetically complex in comparison to humans,
14

Benoit, Sabrina

containing only four chromosomes, and have fewer ethical impediments when used
in biomedical research. Fruit flies are genetically orthologous to humans: 75% of
human disease-causing genes have a recognizable match in the fruit fly, making it
a good model organism for studying various diseases (Jennings, 2011).

1.4.1 Drosophila as model organism for studying the respiratory system
The mammalian respiratory organs, also known as lungs, are composed of a branched,
tubular network that provides oxygen to different structures in the organism, but the
underlying processes that control the development of this respiratory system are not well
understood. The structures composing mammalian lungs are very complex, and, thus far,
it has not been possible to completely map the genetic and cellular mechanisms that
control their development (Ghabrial et al., 2003).
The Drosophila respiratory organ, otherwise known as the trachea, is also a tubular
network that branches throughout the organism and provides oxygen to different
structures in the Drosophila but has much simpler structure and genetics (Fig. 11).
Drosophila have been proven as a reliable model system for studying various mechanisms
underlying the process that dictates respiratory development, called tubular
organogenesis. Tubular organogenesis in Drosophila is controlled by more than two
hundred genes that compose several highly conserved signaling pathways. These
signaling pathways orchestrate tasks within the Drosophila, such as cell specification,
migration, and branch architecture (Loganathan et al., 2016).
Asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are two of the most common
inflammatory diseases of the mammalian airways, and over time, the prevalence of these
diseases has continuously increased in western countries. These diseases have a very
strong genetic component that has been identified in various inheritable asthmasusceptibility genes. Drosophila is an organism that shares a comparable organ
composition and an equivalency to the mammalian lung, as well as an orthologous genetic
model for studying the genes that lead to airway inflammatory diseases (Roeder et al,
2011).

15

Benoit, Sabrina

Drosophila has proven to be advantageous as a model organism when compared to other
commonly used model organisms, such as a transgenic mouse. Transgenic mice pose two
problems: genetic redundancy and developmental plasticity. In the past, Drosophila have
not been considered a useful model organism for studying airway inflammation due to
their lack of an adaptive immune system. However, it has been discovered that many
asthma-related genes are linked to innate immune responses and epithelial cell
maintenance. Most asthma-related genes are expressed in the respiratory epithelium and
are regulated upon infection in Drosophila (Roeder et al., 2008).

Figure 11. Schematic diagram of the parallels between human and Drosophila
respiratory systems. Humans and flies both have an intricate branching system
that allows oxygen and nutrients to be delivered to various organs and tissues
within the organisms.

1.4.2 Development and anatomy of the Drosophila respiratory system
The Drosophila melanogaster respiratory system is composed of more than 10,000
interconnected tubes called trachea and terminal tracheoles that are made of a central
lumen surrounded by an epithelial monolayer. The gas enters through spiracular openings
on the Drosophila exoskeleton and travels through a sequential branching system of tubes
until it reaches a tissue or organ. This sequential branching system follows a classification
scheme: primary branch (also called the dorsal trunk), secondary branch, tertiary branch,
etc. Primary and secondary branches are called trachea and all further branching is
referred to as terminal branching or tracheoles. Structurally, the respiratory system has
bilateral symmetry throughout the organism and a continual segmental organization
16

Benoit, Sabrina

(Ghabrial et al., 2003). The trachea consists of a tracheal wall that contains a simple
epithelial layer that includes the outermost, basement membrane of the wall. This
epithelial layer functions as a barrier between the lumen and the sterile insides of the fly.
Moving inward, the intima is composed of tubulin and chitin that forms ring-like
structures called taenidia. Taenidia provide flexible integrity and structure to the trachea
(Harrison, 2009) (Figure 12) (Ghabrial et al., 2003)(Weaver and Krasnow, 2008).

Figure 12. Schematic illustration of a Drosophila melanogaster
trachea. The trachea is composed of taenidia that provides structure
and an outer protective epithelial layer.
1.4.3 Tubulin and chitin provide structure to the Drosophila melanogaster taenidia
Tubulin is an abundant cytoplasmic, highly conserved protein that is found in all
eukaryotes and exists as heterodimers of alpha and beta subunits. The alpha and beta
tubulins form a dimer that is the building block of the microtubule. Tubulin polymerizes
to form intracellular cylindrical filaments called microtubules (MTs). Microtubules are
essential for several cellular processes, such as cell division and polarity, as well as
intracellular transport, and must be well regulated due to its dynamic influence over free
tubulin heterodimers (Baffet et al., add year). Tubulin is a structural protein that is a
primary component of trachea. Tubulin function is regulated by the MT structure. MTs
are fundamental components of the spindle in cell division, the axoneme in cilia and
flagella, mediators of cell shape, and dynein/kinesin-based cell trafficking. All eukaryotes
contain at least one major alpha (α1) and beta (β1) tubulin. In addition, Drosophila
17

Benoit, Sabrina

melanogaster express minor, tissue-specific isoforms of tubulin in the motile spermtail
axoneme (β2), pre-adult tissues (β3, β4, and α2), and the ovary (α4) (Nielsen et al., 2010).
Chitin is a structural polysaccharide made up of chains of modified glucose that is found
in the cuticles of the exoskeleton of Drosophila. Chitin is also a primary component of
the ring-like structures, called taenidia, that make up the tracheal system and the
peritrophic matrices lining the epithelial tissue of the gut (Merzendorfer and Zimoch,
2003). During larvae development, the luminal accumulation of chitin provides the force
for tube expansion (Hayashi and Kondo, 2018).

1.3 The NF-kB signaling pathway in fruit flies
The NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa B) pathway regulates the Drosophila immune
system in response to infection, and incorrect regulation of this pathway is
associated with increased inflammation and cellular proliferation (Taraborrelli and
Walczak, 2015). NF-kB immune responses in Drosophila are regulated by two
major pathways: the Toll pathway and the Imd pathway. The Toll pathway is
activated upon infection by Gram positive bacteria and fungus causing the
activation of NF-kB transcription factors Dorsal and DIF (Dorsal-related
immunity factor). The Imd pathway is activated upon infection by Gram negative
bacteria causing the cleavage of Relish, an NF-kB transcription factor (TF) (Hetru
and Hoffmann, 2009). Ultimately, the NF-kB pathway transcription factor is
released from inhibition and translocates into the nucleus from the cytoplasm,
where it activates transcription of a plethora of genes, the main one being antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) (Figure 13). The NF-kB pathway is regulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and ubiquitination is one example of a PTM
(Hetru and Hoffmann, 2009).

Figure 13. NF-kB Imd pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. The Imd receptor
is activated upon infection by Gram negative bacteria causing the cleavage of
the transcription factor, Relish. Relish is released from inhibition and
translocates into the nucleus from the cytoplasm, where it activates
transcription of anti-microbial peptides (AMPs). LUBEL catalyzes the
formation of linear M1-linked ubiquitin chains on the K63 ligase, which
ubiquitinates Kenny, (Drosophila IkB kinase g), the regulator of the Imd
pathway. LUBEL is required for the formation of M1-ub chains. Modified
image from Anna Aalto.

1.3.1

Ubiquitination regulates the NF-kB pathway.

Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification that covalently binds ubiquitin
moieties to target proteins and has been shown to regulate many biological
processes. The ubiquitin protein is a highly conserved and dynamic protein which
binds covalently to a lysine residue on the substrate. An isopeptide bond is formed
between ubiquitin and the substrate in an enzymatic cascade involving three
proteins: E1, E2 and E3. E1 is the ubiquitin-activating enzyme. E2 is the ubiquitinconjugating enzyme. E3 is the ubiquitin-protein ligase. Ubiquitin itself contains seven
lysine residues and an N-terminal methionine where ubiquitin moieties can bind
via isopeptide linkages forming polyubiquitin chains. Depending on the
lysine/methionine used for linkage, different types of ubiquitin chains are formed
with different chain topologies (Swatek and Komander, 2016). The various chain
conformations are recognized by UBD (ubiquitin D) containing proteins. For
example, the proteasome lid recognizes K48-linked chains; therefore, K48 chains
19

Benoit, Sabrina

are associated with protein degradation. The ubiquitination is a reversible
modification. The ubiquitin chains can be removed by deubiquitinates (DUBs)
such as CYLD, which removes methionine 1-ubiquitin chains from Kenny in the
Imd pathway, thus reversing the ubiquitination (Aalto et al.,2019).

1.3.2

M1-linked ubiquitination in Drosophila melanogaster

LUBEL is an E3 ligase that specifically catalyzes the formation of M1
(methionine 1)-linked linear ubiquitin chains in Drosophila. LUBEL is
orthologous to mammalian HOIP (HOIL-1-interacting protein) (Figure 14). HOIP
is a part of the M1- linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which is
important for NF-kB pathway regulation and subsequently, inflammatory
signaling in humans (Spit et al., 2019). Similarly, linear ubiquitin chains are
important for the activation of regulatory pathways in Drosophila, such as the NF-

kB pathway. (Aalto et al., 2019). It has been shown that LUBEL catalyzes the
formation of M1-linked ubiquitin chains, which targets Kenny (Drosophila IkB
kinase g), the regulator of the Imd pathway. Ubiquitination of Kenny is necessary
for the activation of Relish, which then translocates into the nucleus and can
activate AMP (antimicrobial peptide) gene expression, which elicits an
inflammatory response in the fly (Aalto et al., 2019)

LUBEL mutant is formed when a transposable minos element is
inserted into the gene, there is a loss of function in LUBEL due to
the inactivation of the RBR catalytic domain.

1.6 HIF pathway in Drosophila
The HIF (Hypoxia Inducible Factor) pathway is a hypoxia-induced signaling pathway
that stabilizes the Drosophila HIF-a Sima protein and translocates it into the nucleus for
targeted gene expression in low oxygen conditions. In normoxic conditions, Sima is
constantly being produced, but as long as there is oxygen in the system, it is hydroxylated
by oxygen-sensing PHDs (prolyl-hydroxylases) on the oxygen-dependent degradation
domain (ODD) of the HIF-a Sima. Hydroxylated Sima is recognized by the K48ubiquitin E3-ligase complex and targeted for proteasomal degradation (Figure 15). It has
been defined in previous literature that NF-kB plays a role in cellular response to hypoxia,
but the exact molecular mechanics are unknown (D’Ignazio and Rocha, 2016).

Figure 15. HIF signaling pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. In normoxic
conditions, Sima is constantly being produced, but as long as there is oxygen in the
system, it is hydroxylated by oxygen-sensing PHDs (prolyl-hydroxylases) on the
oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) of the HIF-a Sima. Hydroxylated
Sima is recognized by the K48- ubiquitin E3-ligase complex and targeted for
proteasomal degradation. Where there is a lack of oxygen, the pathway is sent into
hypoxia and the HIF-alpha sima conjugates to HIF-beta tango and transcribes LDH
(lactate dehydrogenase).

1.6.1 M1-linked ubiquitination in hypoxia
The role of ubiquitination and especially the role of K48-linked ubiquitination has
been extensively studied in the hypoxia response signaling, however the role of
M1-linked linear ubiquitination has not been previously studied in Drosophila.
Preliminary results from our lab show that M1-linked ubiquitin chain formation is
21

Benoit, Sabrina

induced upon hypoxia, When further analyzing the role of M1-linked
ubiquitination in hypoxic conditions, with the help of LUBEL mutant flies, it was
discovered that LUBEL mutant flies are unable to form M1- linked ubiquitin
chains and die in hypoxic conditions, whereas wild-type Cantons flies survive
(Figure 16) (unpublished).
.

comparison to wild-type CantonS flies (left). M1-linked ub chains

flies.

2. AIMS AND HYPOTHESIS
According to previous scientific literature and preliminary lab results, I present
the following hypotheses and aims to understand the role of LUBEL in the
Drosophila respiratory system:

2.1

Hypothesis 1: The tracheal epithelial tissue is malformed in

LUBEL mutant flies lines.
It has been shown that the overexpression of the RBR-catalytic domain in gut
tissue of lubelMi flies causes hyperproliferation, and a lack of LUBEL causes a
lack of response to infection. Both the trachea and gut are composed of simple
epithelial tissue (Aalto et al., 2019). We hypothesize that the mutant flies have a
similar response in the tracheal epithelial tissue, which causes malformed
morphology and asphyxiation.
Aim 1: Investigate Drosophila tracheal epithelial tissue in wild type and LUBEL
mutant flies. To investigate hypothesis 1, I aim to characterize wild-type fly
tracheal morphology (diameter, thickness, taenidia appearance) and establish a
trachea dissection and staining protocol for third instar larvae. Lastly, compare
tracheal morphology in Cantons and l LUBEL mutant larvae.

2.2

Hypothesis 2: The hypoxia response signaling pathway is not

functional in lubelMi flies.
We hypothesize that LUBEL is interfering with Sima signaling; therefore, the
mutant flies experience a disruption in the hypoxia-induced signaling in the
absence of LUBEL. This interruption in hypoxia-induced signaling will
compromise the hypoxia response in the flies, making them sensitive to lowoxygen conditions.

23

Benoit, Sabrina

Aim 2: Investigate HIF-signaling in Cantons and lubelMi flies
To study HIF signaling error, I will conduct live larvae imaging of GFP-ODD
flies, where the ODD domain of HIF1-alpha is conjugated to the green fluorescent
protein (GFP). Under normal oxygen conditions the ODD domain of fly HIF1-a
Sima is targeted for proteasomal degradation, however upon hypoxia, the ODD is
stabilized. In this way HIF signaling activity can be monitored with the help of
the conjugated GFP. The GFP-ODD flies crossed with LUBEL mutant flies can
be used to monitor the role of M1-linked ubiquitination in activation of the HIF
signaling pathway. Also, the GFP-ODD flies can be used in normoxic and hypoxic
condition and compare tracheal branching in Cantons and lubelMi larvae.
With these two projects aims I will further elucidate on the question why LUBEL
mutant flies succumb in low-oxygen conditions. In this thesis, I will only present
results from aim 1. The GFP expression and fluorescent signal of the GFP-ODD
flies could not be detected in flies even after innumerous optimization steps.

Drosophila dissections and fluorescent staining
Third instar larvae are dissected in order to optimize tracheal imaging. The larvae
are placed in -20 °C for approximately 30 minutes before dissection in order to
immobilize them. Then the larvae are carefully opened with micro scissors, pinned
on gel dissection plates, and all internal structures are removed, leaving behind
only the tracheal system and the exoskeleton (Figure 17) (dissection protocol
according to Feng Chen bio-protocol “Preparation and Immunofluorescence
Staining of the Trachea in Drosophila larvae and pupae).

25

Benoit, Sabrina

Figure 17. Dissected lubelMi third instar larvae featuring only
the respiratory system and exoskeleton.

After dissections, the larvae are placed in PBS in a 24-well plate (pre-coated with 1 %
BSA-PBS to reduce stickiness of well plastics). Then the larvae are stained with a
specified fluorophore according to the structure of interest (Table 1). For full optimized
staining protocol see Appendix 1, in short:
Once the larvae are dissected and prepared for staining, remove the PBS from each well
and add 250 µL of staining solution: 1 µM SiR-Tubulin/SiR-COOH, 1 µM Verapamil,
and 1 µM Calcofluor White in 1xPBS. Incubate the larvae for 1.5 hour in the dark at room
temperature. Before mounting samples on microscope slide quickly rinse of staining
solution with PBS. When mounting the samples, place two spacers (double-sided tape)
on the microscope slide and apply 5 µL of Moviol mounting media in between the spacers.
Then position the larvae with the trachea facing upwards on the microscope slide. On a
clean cover glass, place ~4 µL of Moviol and place the cover glass over the sample.

Imaging acquisition using Zeiss LSM880:
Imaging using desired magnification at the microscope (40x is useful for identifying
ROI). In the Zeiss interface, image using the “Smart Setup” for Cy5, Calcofluor white,
and FITC channels. Choose the option for “best signal” and use separate tracks for
highest signal intensity. Acquire the images using optimal frame size unless otherwise
justified, acquisition speed 6-8 and averaging in line mode. Adjust the laser power to 25%, gain to ~800, and offset from zero to -10 or higher. Always set pinhole to 1 airy
unit unless otherwise justified.

Image processing in Fiji:
Acquired images were processed using ImageJ. The images were acquired as Z-stacks
and the Z-stacks were compiled into a single image using the Z-projection feature in Fiji.
The maximum intensity or average intensity projection was used depending on image
saturation levels. Linear adjustments were made as needed to brightness and contrast
(adjust maximum and minimum values to highlight target features in your images). When
taking dorsal trunk measures, use the drawing tool to draw a straight line from one end of
the dorsal trunk to the other. Record the measurement of the line as dorsal trunk width in
microns.

Benoit, Sabrina

Tracheal diameter measurements and statistical analyses
Three different measurements were taken from brightfield images of the dorsal trunks of
dissected third instar larvae. From all four fly lines the average dorsal trunk width was
calculated. Results from the measurements were analyzed by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA), with Tukey’s multiple comparison posttest for 95% confidence
interval. In figures, ns stands for p > 0.05, * for p < 0.05, ** for p < 0.01, *** for p <
0.001 and **** for p < 0.0001. Error bars in figures specify SEM from the indicated
number of independent experiments. The measurements were done in three experimental
repeats using at least three flies per repeat.

4. RESULTS
4.1 Optimization of staining protocol for visualizing trachea in wild-type fly
line.
4.1.1 Optimization of SiR-tubulin and SiR-COOH staining protocols in Drosophila.
Newly developed silicone rhodamine (SiR) organic fluorophores have been shown to be
a highly permeable and photostable staining technique for imaging Drosophila
microtubules and tracheoles in dissected tissues (Lukinavičius et al., 2018). In order to
utilize this organic fluorophore for imaging the airways in Drosophila third instar larvae,
a novel staining protocol was developed and optimized for the purpose of my research
using two specific SiR fluorophores: SiR-tubulin and SiR-COOH (Fig. 18). Upon initial
staining attempts using 1 µM SiR-tubulin and 1 µM SiR-COOH, SiR-tubulin staining in
dissected CantonS larvae showed specific staining with low background noise when
imaged using Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope (Fig. 18A). SiR-COOH, which targets
chitin structures within the taenidia of the airways, stained with less specificity and
unevenly throughout the sample (Fig. 18B).
After a series of trial and error and various optimizations to the novel staining and
dissection protocol, there was an improvement in the SiR-tubulin staining specificity and
intensity when the samples were incubated for a longer period of time (~1.5 hour) in a
smaller volume of staining solution (250 µL) (Fig. 18C). SiR-COOH staining did not
show such improvement in the specificity or intensity after these optimizations were
applied to the protocol. The structure of the dissected Drosophila trachea can be clearly
seen, but there is still an abundance of unspecific background staining (Fig. 18D). Due to
this, SiR-COOH staining techniques were no longer used for the remainder of the project
because the lack of specificity in the staining did not suit the needs of the project.

4.1.2. Calcofluor white staining in Drosophila highlights chitin structures.
Calcofluor White stain by Sigma-Aldrich is a reputible, non-specific fluorophore that
binds to cellucose and chitin in cell walls. It successfully and specifically stains the chitincomposed taenidia in the dorsal trunk of Drosophila, as well as the exoskeleton. Due to
the ease and consistency of this staining technique, Calcofluor white staining was used in
place of SiR-COOH staining to visualize the ring-like taenidia in the Drosophila airways
(Fig. 19).

4.2 Loss of LUBEL causes malformed epithelial morphology in Drosophila
trachea.

In order to investigate any change in morphology of the respiratory system in
Drosphophila third instar larvae upon removal of LUBEL, a baseline morphology was
established for wild-type Drosophila. Wild-type CantonS larvae were stained with 1 µM
SiR-tubulin and imaged using Zeiss LSM880. The airways of wild-type Drosophila
larvae have periodic, ring-like taenidia that have a uniform pattern across the entire length
of the dorsal trunk surface in basal conditions (Fig. 20A). Upon removal of LUBEL, there
is a change in the morphology of the dorsal trunk surface. Mutant lubelRNAi and lubelMi
larvae were stained with 1 µM SiR-tubulin and imaged using Zeiss LSM880 (Fig. 20BC). The taenidia of the dorsal trunk in the mutant fly lines have abnormal finger-like
structures that project from the surface of the respiratory tube. This is a morphological
feature that was only seen in fly lines that lacked LUBEL.

4.3 STED imaging of the malformed epithelial morphology in small-order
tracheal branching in Drosophila.

After seeing the presence of this abnormal epithelial morphology on the surface of the
dorsal trunk in mutant fly lines, I used SiR-tubulin and STED imaging to investiage the
smaller-order branches in wild-type and LUBEL mutant fly lines to determine if this
abnormal phenotype existed only on the dorsal trunk of the larvae or on the smaller
structures as well. In order to establish a baseline morphology for smaller-order branching
S

in wild-type Drosophila, Canton larvae were stained with 1 µM SiR-tubulin and imaged
using the Abberior STED 775 Quad scanning microscope. As seen on the surface of the
dorsal trunk, smaller, fifth-order tracheoles in wild-type larvae also exhibited periodic,
ring-like taenidia with a uniform pattern (Fig. 21A).
Upon removal of LUBEL, there is abnormal epithelial morphology of the tracheole
surface in smaller respiratory structures. Mutant lubelMi larvae were stained with 1 µM
SiR-tubulin and imaged using the Abberior STED 775 Quad scanning microscope (Fig.
21B). The taenidia of the smaller, fourth-order tracheoles in the mutant fly line have
abnormal finger-like structures that project from the surface of the respiratory tube, as
seen on the larger dorsal trunk. These abnormal projections are not continuous on the
entirety of the respiratory tube (Fig. 21C-D). This is a morphological feature that was
only seen in fly lines that lacked and could be seen in various order of branching.

4.4 Quantitative analysis of dorsal trunk thickness in Drosophila third
instar larvae.
After several experimental repeats, I also noticed that the dorsal trunks in LUBEL mutant
fly lines appeared wider than the wild-type fly line, in addition to the abnormal epithelial
morphology in LUBEL mutant larvae. To test this observation, I measured the average
dorsal trunk width in four different fly lines: CantonS (control 1), DaGal (control 2),
lubelMi (LUBEL mutant 1), lubelRNAi (LUBEL mutant 2). Three different measurements
were taken from brightfield images of the dorsal trunks of dissected third instar larvae, as
shown in Fig 4A, from all four fly lines and the average dorsal trunk width was calculated.
This was done in three experimental repeats using at least three flies per repeat. In both
mutant fly lines (lubelMi and lubelRNAi), there was a significant increase in average dorsal
trunk width in comparison to both control groups (Fig. 22B-C).
Additionally, Tukey’s multiple comparison test shows that there is no significant
difference in the average dorsal trunk width between the two control groups, further
verifying DaGal as a suitable control group. Also, there is no significant difference
between the two mutant groups, which suggests that the increased average dorsal trunk
width in LUBEL mutant fly lines is independent of the method used to silence LUBEL in
the fly (Fig. 22C). The increase in average dorsal trunk width in the two mutant fly lines
in comparison to the control fly lines shows that there is a quantifiable change in the
morphology in the absence of LUBEL.

5. DISCUSSION
5.1 Staining of the taenidia in Drosophila melanogaster larvae
In order to analyze the morphology of the respiratory system in Drosophila melanogaster
larvae, I targeted two primary, structural components of the tracheal system: tubulin and
chitin. Throughout the course of this project, SiR-tubulin has proven to be an effective
and useful staining method for examining the respiratory system of Drosophila larvae
(Figure 1 results). When paired with the Zeiss LSM880 scanning confocal microscope,
one is able to obtain clear, detailed images of the larvae dorsal trunk and smaller
tracheoles. SiR-COOH, which stains specifically for chitin, a structural component of
larval taenidia, over-saturated the samples which made distinguishing finer structures in
the tracheoles very difficult. Due to time restraints surrounding the project, I did not spend
additional time further optimizing the SiR-COOH staining, but instead used Calcofluor
White, which has been proven in other literature to be an easy and simple chitin-specific
staining.
The unspecific background staining using SiR-COOH could be caused by the high
amounts of chitin in Drosophila exoskeleton (Zimoch et al, 2005). When dissecting the
samples, all other internal structures were removed from the larvae excluding the dorsal
trunks and tracheole network that is connected to the exoskeleton (reference image of
dissected larvae). The high saturation levels seen in SiR-COOH stained samples were not
seen in Calcofluor white stained samples. Although both dyes are chitin specific,
Calcofluor white is activated by UV excitation light, which has a shorter wavelength in
comparison to IR light that activates SiR probes. This shorter wavelength restricts the
imaging depth of the sample, which could contribute to the lower signal intensity of
Calcofluor white stained samples. With further optimizations steps, such as testing
different staining concentrations, incubation times, and washing techniques, SiR-COOH
could be a potentially useful staining technique for imaging Drosophila melanogaster
taenidia, with special consideration of STED imaging. STED imaging requires far-red
excited probes.
When considering future experiments in the lab, it would be desirable to image the tubulin
in LUBEL-mutant flies using other types of tubulin and chitin staining techniques.
Immunostaining using a primary and secondary antibody is a very well-established and
traditional staining method and could be good to validate the results from the SiR staining.

5.2 LUBEL-mutant larvae express novel, phenotypic abnormalities in
the respiratory system.
5.2.1

lubelRNAi and lubelMi have abnormal tubulin structures on the dorsal trunk and
tracheoles.

Larvae that lack LUBEL (lubelRNAi and lubelMi) express a phenotype I have described as
“abnormal, finger-like tubulin projections” from the surface of the dorsal trunk as well as
smaller tracheoles. This is a phenotype that I did not expect to see, but after several
experimental repeats using lubelMi and CantonS larvae, I observed finger-like projections
from the surface of the dorsal trunk in random lubelMi larvae, but I did not see this
phenotype in wild-type CantonS larvae. To investigate whether or not these finger-like
structures were due to malformed tubulin or chitin, I stained the samples using SiRtubulin and Calcofluor white and looked at these probes under different channels. The
abnormal phenotype could be seen under the Cy5 red channel that excited SiR probes,
but not under the UV channel that excites Calcofluor white probes; therefore, this is an
indication that the abnormal phenotype is tubulin specific.
To determine whether or not this phenotype was due to a lack of LUBEL or just a special
phenotype in lubelMi flies, a second mutant was added to the experimental setup. lubelRNAi,
which is a LUBEL-mutant fly line that does not express LUBEL due to RNA interference,
versus a lack of LUBEL by removing the RBR catalytic domain as in lubelMi flies. This
abnormal tubulin phenotype was seen in both lubelRNAi and lubelMi fly lines, validating
that it is due to a lack of LUBEL. Additionally, to verify that the abnormal tubulin
structure was not merely a phenotype that was lacking in CantonS flies, a second control
group was added, DaGal fly line. DaGal, daughterless-GAL4 driver fly line, did not
express the abnormal tubulin phenotype, which further validates that the abnormal tubulin
phenotype is only in flies with mutated LUBEL.
For future experiments, additional LUBEL mutant fly lines could be imaged using SiRtubulin as well as other methods of tubulin staining to further validate that it is due to a
lack of LUBEL. Also, to further study the role of LUBEL, the RBR-catalytic domain in
the LUBEL mutant fly lines can be overexpressed. If this causes a rescue of the
phenotype, this indicates that LUBEL influences the abnormal tubulin phenotype.
38

Benoit, Sabrina

Being that LUBEL has been shown to regulate the IMD pathway, other components of
the Imd pathway could be affected. Tubulin staining flies that are mutants for different
constituents of the Imd pathway, such as DIAP2, Dredd, and Kenny, could provide further
information on if/where the tubulin abnormality is occurring in this cellular pathway.
One possible explanation for the abnormal tubulin phenotype in LUBEL-mutated flies is
through a common linkage: CYLD. CYLD is a deubiquitynating enzyme (DUB) that
regulates the NF-kB pathway by removing M1-ub chains from Kenny in the Imd pathway
(Aalto et al., 2019). Additionally, CYLD is composed of three cytoskeleton-associated
protein glycine-rich (CAP-Gly) domains. These CAP-Gly domains have been shown to
regulate microtubule (MT) dynamic and function, and more importantly, CYLD enhances
tubulin polymerization into MTs by lowering the required concentration for MT assembly
(Gao et al, 2008). In LUBEL-mutant flies, there is a decrease in M1-ub chain formation
(Aalto et al, 2019). One hypothesis: This decrease in M1-ub chain formation could reduce
the need of DUBs, such as CYLD, to regulate M1-ub chains. This could cause an excess
concentration of free CYLD, which could influence MT dynamics, such as tubulin
polymerization. More specifically, an increase in unbound CYLD causing an increase in
tubulin polymerization, which could account for the abnormal phenotype that is seen in
LUBEL-mutant flies.

5.2.2

lubelMi and lubelRNAi flies have thicker dorsal trunks in comparison to the control
groups.

In addition to the abnormal tubulin structures, lubelMi and lubelRNAi flies also have a
significantly thicker dorsal trunks in comparison to the control groups. These
measurements were acquired by collecting three width measurements from each larval
dorsal trunk and then the average dorsal width was calculated. Using the drawing tool in
Fiji, a line was drawing across the dorsal trunk and the length of the line was recorded.
This method was used due to its simplicity and time restraint of the project, but this
measurement does not indicate if the increased dorsal trunk thickness is due to dilation of
the tracheal airway, or due to increased diameter of the epithelium, which would in theory
constrict the tracheal airway. Increased respiratory constriction could contribute to the
fatality of lubelMi flies in hypoxic conditions causing asphyxiation.
39

Benoit, Sabrina

For future experiments, the dorsal trunk should be imaged along the Y-axis in order to
obtain an image of the trachea from the side, as if one is looking through a telescope. By
acquiring this image, one could use the same method to measure the dorsal trunk width,
but also measure the width of the airway to determine if there is respiratory constriction
in LUBEL-mutant fly lines.

6. CONCLUSION
These findings are biologically significant to humans because Drosophila melanogaster
are genetically orthologous to mammals, and flies have been shown to be a useful model
for studying the mechanism behind airway inflammation in mammals (Roeder et all,
2011). This novel phenotype could provide insight to the mechanisms behind airway
inflammation in various diseases such as asthma and COPD. This abnormal tubulin
phenotype has never been seen before in our lab, and to our current understanding, has
not been shown in any previous literature. This posed an enormous challenge with moving
forward in the project after the discovery of this phenotype. I developed and optimized
an entirely new dissection, staining, and imaging protocol in order to investigate this
abnormal phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster larvae.

of the BIMA program, especially my teacher tutor, Diana Toivola. A special thanks to
Elena Tcarenkova for assistance with STED imaging.
And lastly, I would like to dedicate this thesis to my mom, Reneé Benoit, who encouraged
me to study in this program and pursue this master’s degree. Without her endless support
and love and encouragement, none of this would have been possible. She inspired me and
gave me the courage to continue onwards even when things felt impossible.
In loving memory of Reneé Odette Benoit

SiR-Tubulin & Calcofluor White Staining Protocol
By Sabrina Benoit
GOAL OF THIS PROTOCOL: DUAL-CHANNEL IMAGING OF DISSECTED
THIRD INSTAR LARVAE TO INVESTIGATE TRACEAL MORPHOLOGY BY
STAINING FOR TUBULIN AND CHITIN
SiR-Tubulin à Abs/Em: 652/674 nm (compatible with Cy5)
Calcofluor White à Abs/Em: 380/475 nm (compatible with DAPI)

PART 1: Preparation and Dissections
•

Collect third instar larvae, place in -20°C for ~30 min.

•

Prepare wells with 500 µL cold 1% BSA-PBS (remove BSA), add 500 µL cold
1xPBS to each well. Place wells and falcon of cold PBS in box of ice.

•

Dissect larvae in cold PBS and place in prepared wells. When nearing
completion of dissections, remove SiR-T, Verapamil, and CW from -20°C
(located in grey box with yellow tape) and defrost in dark @ room temp.

An example experiment setup. Make sure to record the time it takes to dissect each
group and randomize dissection order.

PART 2: Staining and Incubation
•

Remove PBS from well, add 250 µL staining solution:

o

1 µM SiR-Tubulin, 1 µM Verapamil, and 1 µM Calcofluor White in
1xPBS

(e.g. 1 µL SiR-T and 1 µL Verapamil in 1000 µL 1xPBS). Spin down
fluorophores before use.
** Verapamil can be increased up to 3 µM if SiR-T signal is weak.
**Remove PBS from well and immediately add solution to prevent drying

•

Incubate ~1.5 hr in dark @ room temp. Wrap the wells in foil and place in a
drawer. Remove Moviol from -20°C and defrost at room temp.

PART 3: Washing and Mounting (MOST IMPORTANT
PART!!)
•

After incubation, prepare a new “washing well” for each “incubation well”
following the preparation protocol (500 µL BSA-PBS rinse and 500 µL PBS).

o

E.g. Looking at the earlier model, 4 groups x 2 fly lines (control and
mutant) = 8 washing wells

•

Gather supplies: double-sided tape, Moviol, 70% ethanol, cotton swabs, lens
paper, microscope slides (75x25 mm), #1.5 cover glass.

•

Mount samples under dissection microscope, clean the stage of the microscope
with ethanol and paper towel. Spray ethanol on cotton swab and clean both sides
of microscope slide and cover glass, dry with lens paper. Tape can be used to
remove lingering dust particles.

•

Place 2 spacers (double-sided tape) on the microscope slide, spread 5 µL Moviol
on the slide. Be careful not to create any bubbles.

•

Remove 1 larvae from the staining solution, gently place the larvae in the
washing well, wait ~10 sec, gently remove the larvae, and position the larvae
with trachea facing upwards on the microscope slide. Repeat this step for all the
larvae in your group (3-4 larvae can fit on one microscope slide).

o

It is important to work quickly during this step as the larvae will begin to
dry out on the microscope slide.
47

Benoit, Sabrina

•

On the clean cover glass, place three drops (~4 µL/drop) of Moviol in a row.
Using the forceps, align your Moviol over the larvae and gently place the cover
glass over the sample.

o
•

15-20 µL of Moviol per slide depending on the number of larvae

Seal the edges of the cover glass with clear nail polish. Allow the slides to dry
for ~15 min in dark @ room temp on flat surface before imaging or storing in
dark @ +4°C.

An example mounting setup. Make sure to write experiment # and group # on slide.
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW YOUR LARVAE!

LSM 880 Imaging Guidelines and Image Processing
Tips
PART 1: Preparation and Setup
•

Startup system and power on lasers according to BTK user manual

•

Switch to 40x mag, add drop of water to objective

•

Use “Smart Setup”
o Cy5 (red): SiR-staining- IR channel
o Calcofluor White (blue)- UV Channel
o FITC (green)-autofluorescence for QC

•

Choose “Best Signal” à separate tracks, we want highest signal intensity
o Our probes are durable, so speed is less significant

PART 2: Locate ROI and Configure Lasers
•

Place microscope slide with cover glass down on the objective. Raise objective
until water drop makes contact with the slide.

•

Using the eyepiece and transmitted light (TL illumination), continue to raise the
eyepiece to locate sample and find focal plane
o Start from anterior or posterior end and scan the sample until you find a
representative area (ROI)

•

Check fluorescence intensity using red filter and eyepiece (RL illumination)

•

Using the camera, configure one laser at a time
o Use T-PMT + Cy5 Brightfield to find area with strong signal

PART 3: Acquisition Settings
•

Use optimal frame size, unless otherwise justified

•

Acquisition speed: 6-8, 9 for Z-Stack

•

Averaging: at least 2, Mode: line

•

Adjust laser power (2-5%), Gain (~800), and Offset (0 à -10 or more)

o

ALWAYS SET PINHOLE TO 1 AIRY UNIT UNLESS OTHERWISE
JUSTIFIED

o

Automated “Set Exposure” works well with Cy5
49

Benoit, Sabrina

o

NEVER USE AUTOFOCUS! CHECK PINHOLE SIZE AFTER
AUTO EXPOSURE!

PART 4: Z-Stack Scanning
•

Use live scan to find start and end position

•

Use optimal slice size (obeys Nyquist Sampling Theorem - waveform is
sampled over twice as fast as its highest frequency component)

o

E.g. 1.3 µm section size (found near pinhole) à 0.65 µm sampling slice
size

o
•

Smallest scanning section = sample section

KEEP SAME SCANNING PARAMETERS FOR ALL SAMPLES!

o

Start and end position must be determined for each ROI

PART 5: Image Processing using Fiji
•

After saving images from the computer (save as original CZI) open the files in
Fiji software. Download software for free from https://fiji.sc/

•

Image – Stack – Make Z-Project…

o

Choose all slides unless you have very bright exoskeleton towards top or
bottom of the stack.

o

Use Max. Intensity or Avg. Intensity

§
•

Avg. Intensity is good for images with blurry background

Brightness + Contrast (B&C). Shortcut SHIFT+C.

o

Adjust Maximum and Minimum

o NEVER ADJUST BRIGHTNESS OR CONTRAST! THIS CHANGES
THE ORIGINAL PIXEL VALUE OF YOUR IMAGE.
•

Analyze – Tools – Scale Bar…
o Check your unit (microns or pixels, choose microns)
o Lower right positioning, choose appropriate value (e.g. 10, 50 or 100
microns depending on objective used)

•

If you want to add color to the image, apply LUT (Lookup Table). Save
processed image as TIFF file
