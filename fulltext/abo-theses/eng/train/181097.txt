Abstract
Aim: The study analyses the ongoing water conflict between the three Nile Basin
Riparian countries Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance
dam (GERD).
Method: Three conflict analysis tools have been applied to conduct the conflict
analysis, the conflict wheel, INMEDIO’s conflict perspective analysis (CPA), and
Glasl’s conflict escalation model.
Results: Lack of trust and transparency between the three conflicted countries is one
of the main reasons that led to the escalation of the conflict and turned it from a
possible win-win situation into a lose-win situation. Other stakeholder states, such as
China, Turkey, and Gulf countries could play a positive mediation role in the conflict
since they enjoy close ties with the upstream country Ethiopia. The GERD is not only
relevant in economic and development terms, as it has the potential to change the
geopolitics of the Middle East and North Africa.
Conclusions: The GERD could be a great opportunity for cooperation and
development instead of escalated conflict and potential war between the three riparian
countries if they manage to agree on a cooperative framework that can benefit each
country and do no harm to the other countries’ interests.
Key Words: Water conflict, Nile River, the GERD, hydro diplomacy, Nile Basin

1. Introduction
1.1 Aim of the Study
This study aims at analysing the current water conflict between the three Nile Basin riparian
countries Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over the construction and operation of the Grand
Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) using number of conflict analysis tools, such as the
conflict wheel, INMEDIO’s conflict perspective analysis (CPA), and Glasl’s conflict
escalation model. The analysis provides a deep insight at this transboundary conflict and
generates a number of potential solutions that would allow each country to reach a mutual and
satisfied ground which serves its interests without infringing upon the neighbouring countries’
stakes.
Disputes over the Nile River water have existed for decades. Since the late 1990s, with
the assistance of the international world powers, several agreements have been signed between
the Nile Basin countries to ensure each country’s share of water and to protect their water
security. However, tension escalated when Ethiopia announced in March 2011 its intention to
build a large dam on the Blue Nile River around 40 kilometers east of Sudan. The dam was
known as the Millennium Dam at that time, and has been later referred to as Grand Ethiopian
Renaissance Dam (GERD) (Kimenyi & Mbaku, 2015).
The dam construction announcement came without any prior notice or negotiations
between the major riparian countries, Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan. Thus, the Egyptian
government responded aggressively with verbal attacks on Ethiopia over its great concerns of
reducing Egypt’s water share since Ethiopia is an upper stream country that can potentially
control the amount of water flowing to the downstream countries (Sudan and Egypt). Due to
the fact that more than 90% of Egypt’s supply of fresh water depends on the Nile River, the
GERD is perceived by Egypt as a threat to the country’s agricultural and economic
development.
The following sections will discuss water conflicts in general to contextualize and
understand this particular conflict within broader patterns and then will consider the history of
the water agreements that have been made within the Nile Basin countries, along with the Nile
water initiatives that have been signed to date to assist in water management cooperation
between these countries. These provide some insights on how water conflicts have been
managed (or mismanaged) in the past.

1.2 Global Water Conflicts
Fresh water is a vital and indispensable element to all aspects of human life. It is one of the
paramount resources for all environmental and collective activities, such as, food, energy
generation, waste processing and development in all possible ways. In addition, water access
is an immense national security issue to many countries (Gleick, 1993). Therefore, not only is
the increasing water scarcity aggravated by climate change regarded as a colossal threat to
billions of disadvantaged countries, it is also becoming a source of conflict. However, water is
not the only principal variable of water conflicts in international politics. The asymmetric
power relations, the unequal distribution of water resources and the unhindered construction of
dams have accounted for major conflicts that have occurred to date. Hydro-hegemony has
played a predominant role in shaping the cooperation framework between countries sharing the
same water resources, in which the main political question is which country receives what share
of the water, why and how (Zeitoun & Warner, 2006).
Research about the causal relationship between water and conflicts has been done
through three main epistemological stages. The first stage was between the 1970s and the early
1980s in which the main focus was on the environmental consequences of wars. Scholars
considered that there was a strong nexus between the availableness of the natural substances,
such as soil, water and security. They discussed that high consumption of resources incites a
dilapidation of the water resources; causing scarcity of water which leads to violence and the
possibility of wars (Galtung, 1982; Westing, 1980).
The second stage started from mid- 1980s and continued to the beginning of the 1990s.
In this phase, the focus changed to studying conflicts related to water in the broadest sense and
it was highlighted that environmental changes can lead to conflicts and wars (Zeitoun &
Warner, 2006).
In the third phase, starting in the mid-1990s, researchers focussed on the effect of water
scarcity on human security and tried to examine a number of factors to strengthen their
assumption. One finding highlighted how ecological deterioration does not necessarily have to
result in conflict, but cooperation can also happen in some cases. Although this hypothesis
contradicts the popular causal relationship between water and conflicts, it also offers a broader
image of certain cases that managed to follow cooperation strategies of sharing transboundary
water such as, the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) between the Nile River riparian countries (Stetter
et al., 2011).

It is an unarguable fact that not all water disputes lead to wars or violent conflicts. Most
of them are managed through agreements, discussions, negotiations, and resolutions. However,
history also presents cases of disputes and conflicts over shared water resources where water
has been used as a tool of war. Many rivers, seas, and lakes are shared by more than two
countries. Geography has conditioned geopolitical conflicts over transboundary waters, such
as, the Nile River, the Euphrates, and the Jordan Rivers in the Middle East region; the Ganges,
the Indus and Brahmaputra Rivers in Southern Asia; and the Rio Grande, Parana and Colorado
Rivers in the United States.
In some regions, (e.g. the Middle East, Central and Southern Asia), water is an
extremely scare resource that is fundamental for development and is becoming a deeply
strategic matter that threatens the national security of these countries. According to the World
Resources Institute (WRI), 12 out of the 17 countries that are most water-pressured in the world
are based in the MENA region (World Resources Institute, 2019). Therefore, the possibility of
water-related violent conflicts is growing and the likelihood of changes in the international
water treaties also exists (Gleick, 1993).

1.3 History and Geopolitics of the Nile River
The Nile River is a significant feature of the Northeast Africa region and it is one of the longest
rivers in the world with a length of 6670 kilometres (4132 miles) with an approximate flow
ratio 2810 m3 s−1, 89 billion m3 per year (Said, 2014). The Nile flows from the south towards
the north through 11 countries in Eastern Africa; Burundi, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic
of Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan, and Egypt (Swain,
2011).
The Nile River has two principal tributaries; the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The two
rivers meet north of Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, forming the river’s major stream that flows
north to Egypt before it drains into the Mediterranean Sea. The White Nile begins in Burundi
and flows through Victoria Lake in Tanzania, then moves across the Sudd floods of Sudan,
whereas the Blue Nile originates at Lake Tana in Ethiopia. More than 80% of the Nile’s stream
flow is provided by the Ethiopian highlands in the rainy seasons through the Blue Nile (Swain,
2011).
The history of water rights at the Nile River can be understood through three main
periods of Egyptian history; the pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial periods (Abtew &
Dessu, 2018).

1.3.1 Pre-colonial Period
The Egyptian civilization would have never existed without the Nile River. Amidst the Sahara
Desert and the extremely dry weather in north Africa, the Nile was flowing supporting life to
flourish when ancient Egyptians discovered the flooding period of the Nile which is six months
annually. When the Nile water dwindles, it leaves a brown layer of sediment full of nutrients
that enabled growing different kind of crops; such as, cotton, beans and wheat, and later on
papyrus and flax. Ancient inhabitants then started to dig canals linked to the Nile and irrigate
the fields in order to have access to fresh water for the whole year. Since then, agriculture has
started and paved the way for the civilization along the Nile valley. For millennia, Egyptians
developed their agriculture techniques and produced items such as wheat beer or cotton clothes
(Mark, 2017).
Concerns over control of the Nile water date back to over 700 years ago, sometimes for
reasons much more different from water and agriculture. In 1321 A.D, the Ethiopian emperor
Amda Seyon threatened Egypt that he would divert the Nile route if Sultan Al Nasir did not
release the Christians he had arrested (Abtew & Dessu, 2018), evidencing the early geopolitical
role of the Nile.

1.3.2 Colonial Period
Egypt was under the British occupation from 1882 to 1956, while the colonial period in Sudan
expanded over the 1889-1956 period. During these periods, the attention towards the Nile water
value and its security had been recognized and the British made efforts to secure large shares
of Nile water for both Egypt and Sudan to keep the flow for cotton irrigation; the most
significant crop that Egypt was known for. The British government signed a treaty with the
Ethiopian emperor Menelik II in 1902 which emphasized that Ethiopia would not do any
construction work on the Blue Nile or Lake Tana that could obstruct the Nile flow to both
Egypt and Sudan without the consent of the British colonial government. However, later on
Ethiopia denounced the treaty arguing its disagreement on the change in the colonial
circumstances and its ending (Abtew & Dessu, 2018).
In 1929, the British colony made a water agreement that favoured Egypt’s share and
control of the Nile water, in addition to providing Egypt with veto powers regarding any project
to be built on the Blue Nile that might threaten the Nile water flow (Abtew & Dessu, 2018).

1.3.3 Post-colonial Period
After the Second World War, Britain started to lose its hegemony worldwide and in 1956 it
pulled out from Egypt and Sudan marking the end of the British colonization. The presence of
Britain in East Africa was no longer significant and by 1960, most of the colonized Nile riparian
countries gained their full independence. Under the leadership of colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser,
the chief of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), who was elected president in June
1956, Egypt decided to build the Aswan High Dam (AHD) within the Egyptian borders and 17
km south of Aswan city (Samaan, 2017).
The dam was expected to benefit Egypt with numerous advantages, such as producing
hydroelectric power, averting possible damages due to floods, increasing constant irrigation
along the Delta and Nile valley, and reducing the amount of water being released into the
Mediterranean Sea. In addition to developing agriculture and creating more job opportunities
to the increasing population. The dam construction initially started in 1959 and was completed
and made fully operational in 1971 with the financial assistance of the Soviet Union after the
United States refused to finance it (Samaan, 2017).
Aside from the dam benefits, it also had a number of social, environmental and political
impacts. Hindering the Nile flow reduced the fertility of the land around the Nile valley, while
blocking the sediments contributed to erosion and water contamination in the Delta.
Furthermore, filling the reservoir caused the displacement of more than 100,000 Nubians from
Aswan. The construction of the AHD faced disagreement from the other upstream riparian
countries and pushed Egypt into the Cold War game (Samaan, 2017). In the meantime, Sudan
proposed plans to construct the Roseires dam on the Blue Nile in 1954 and after several
attempts to reach mutual agreement with Egypt on managing the Nile water, the World Bank
financially assisted Sudan to complete the Roseires dam building in 1966. (Kitissou, 2004).
Another significant event during the post-colonial period was the formation of the Nile
Basin Initiative (NBI) in 1999 which was signed by all the Nile riparian countries except Eretria.
The aim of this initiative was to form a cooperative platform between the Nile Basin countries
in order to achieve an equitable and fair utilization of the water resources (Abtew & Dessu,
2018).

1.4 The Nile River Basin
Challenges of managing water resources increase when water is shared through transboundary
rivers. The best example of this case is the Nile Basin countries and their sharing of the Nile
River water (Yihdego, Rieu-Clarke & Cascao, 2017). The eleven riparian countries sharing the
Nile River are called the Nile Basin countries and have a population of over 430 million
inhabitants. This population is expected to double within the upcoming two to three decades
(International Crisis Group Report, 2019). The rapid population growth means that around one
billion people will be relying exclusively on the Nile water which is already facing scarcity due
to climate change and the building of dams, including the GERD.
Many of the Nile Basin countries are among those with lower income in the world.
Their economies mainly depend on agriculture which is complicated due to the unpredictable
rainfalls and dry seasons. The agricultural sphere represents 75% of the Nile Basin countries’
consumption. Thus, in all the basin countries irrigation is pivotal in securing food supply and
meeting the demands of the increasing population. However, the water situation is affected by
different factors depending on each country’s political and geological circumstances (Swain,
2011). Comparing to the major rivers in the world, the Nile accounts for moderately little
amount of water; (e.g, it only accounts for 5% of the River of Congo). Considering the growing
populations, the foreseeable problems induced by climate change and the present geopolitical
conflicts to gain control over the Nile’s water, the Nile River is a potential candidate for
generating escalated water conflicts (and even a water war that would prove catastrophic to the
whole region). However, the Nile also has the potential to articulate a broader peace system to
build “water peace”.

1.5 Hydro-Politics of the Nile basin
The strong nexus between water and its influence on politics has been witnessed since water
scarcity became a threatening issue to the security of many countries especially in the Middle
East, North Africa and South Asia where people suffer from insufficient supply to their needs.
Although, transboundary rivers cover up to 60% of the African continent, one third of the
population suffers from water scarcity. Considering the ongoing civil wars, rapid population
growth, drought and famine in some parts of Africa, it is expected that by 2025, more than half
of the African countries will undergo severe water shortages. In addition, failures for sharing
and managing water can potentially create interstate conflicts (Kitissou, 2004).
6

Hagar Elbarbary

The expected average of population growth in northeast Africa is 3.2 % in Ethiopia,
0.8% in Sudan, and 3.5% in Egypt. This means Ethiopia’s population will nearly grow to 212
million by 2050, and Sudan’s population will rise to reach 66 million, while the population
number of Egypt will increase to over 160 million by 2025. According to this rapid growth rate,
the total expected number of the Nile Basin population is 859 million by the year of 2025,
which is problematic in terms of the water scarcity situation that Nile Basin countries will go
through in near future (Tafesse, 2001).
Comparing to the other ten riparian countries, the situation of Egypt needs peculiar
attention since 98% of the country is desert and the expeditiously increasing population is
condensed in only 2% of the land around the Nile valley. Furthermore, being considered a
regional power, Egypt has favoured attempting control over the Nile water rather than pursuing
cooperation with neighbouring countries. Consequently, the history of Egypt’s utilization of
Nile water has been a compilation of distress, commination, and intimidation (Kitissou, 2004).
This can be understood from the statement of former Egyptian president Anwar El
Sadat in 1979, after ratifying the peace treaty with Israel when he said: “The only matter that
could take Egypt to war again is water”. Later in 1988, the Egyptian minister of foreign affairs,
Boutros Boutros Ghali stated “The next war in our region will be over the water of the Nile,
not politics” (Kitissou, 2004). These statements explain how the Nile water is regarded as a
matter of national security to Egypt and any threat to its share could dwell the country into a
turmoil.

1.6 History of Nile Water Agreements
1.6.1 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1929
Egypt and Sudan were under British colonization from 1882 to 1937, and from 1899 to 1956
respectively. However, Britain has always tried to protect Egypt’s share of water for political
and strategic reasons. In 1929, the British government signed the first treaty regarding sharing
the Nile’s water with the Nile Basin neighbours. The treaty was in favour of Egypt since it was
given the right to use 48 km3 of water annually, whereas Sudan was given the right to use only
4 km3 per year. In addition, the treaty stipulated that no construction of dams or any irrigation
development projects should be structured in any of the upper stream countries, along with
granting Egypt the right to veto any of those projects that could affect its interests. The AngloEgyptian treaty did not consider any of the Nile Basin neighbour-countries and ignored their
water needs. The unfair distribution and the Egyptian water hegemony sparked the anger of the
7

Hagar Elbarbary

riparian countries- especially Sudan- leading to severe disagreements. Most of the Nile Basin
countries announced that they were not adherent to this treaty. Consequently, a new water
agreement was reached in 1959 (Swain, 2011).
1.6.2 1959 Agreement between Egypt and Sudan
In a bid to reach a common ground for water sharing and to improve the deteriorated
relationship between the two countries, Egypt and Sudan decided to sign a bilateral agreement
stipulated at increasing water allocation for both countries. The 1959 agreement set out to grant
Egypt 75% of the Nile’s water (55.5 billion m3), while Sudan’s share was increased to 25%
(18.5 billion m3), the remaining 10 billion m3 was left for evaporation possibilities (Richard C,
2004). The agreement managed to promote the political relationship between the downstream
countries Egypt and Sudan. As a result, Sudan approved the establishment of Aswan High Dam
on the Nile by Egypt, and Egypt agreed on Sudan’s construction of Roseires Dam over the
Blue Nile. Egypt received financial and political support from the USSR and the construction
of the dam was officially completed in 1971 (C. Tucker, 2010). However, the 1959 agreement
only satisfied the needs of Egypt and Sudan, ignoring the upper stream countries’ needs just as
the 1929 Anglo-Egyptian treaty did. Since the mid-1950s, Ethiopia started to seriously consider
constructing a dam on Lake Tana to exploit the Nile water to its benefit (Brookings, 2015).

1.6.3 Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) and Escalated Conflicts
The exclusive utilization of the Nile’s water by Egypt and Sudan, along with the unequitable
allocation of water resources among the other riparian countries pushed the upper stream
neighbouring countries to call for a new fair agreement for managing the Nile water without
ignoring any country’s needs.
After several failed trials since 1960, the riparian countries managed to sign the Nile
Basin Initiative (NBI) in 1999. The Basin states started to cooperate in order to develop
institutions that could manage allocating the Nile water equally. They reached an agreement
called The Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) in which a set of principles and
obligations are outlined to enhance the cooperative and long-term development of managing
the Nile’s water resources (Brookings, 2015). The CFA treaty has evolved through the years
and established the Nile River Basin Commission (NRBC), an institution to deal with the legalbased management of the water ("Cooperative Framework Agreement", 2020).
The NBI tried for the first time in Nile Basin history to unify the riparian countries and
to ease the tensions among them. The initiative also gained a significant international support
8

Hagar Elbarbary

and funding from the World Bank and other funding agencies. In 2001, the World Bank formed
an International Consortium for Cooperation on the Nile (ICCON), enabling donors to support
the initiative through various investment programs. Later, in 2003, due to the demand of the
Nile Basin ministers, the Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF) was launched.
In spite of the wide popularity that the NBI gained through the years, member states
were not satisfied with the actual framework of the benefit of sharing the Nile water among
them. Each country expected a considerable investment in the Nile basin for its development
projects. However, very little effort has been made by the NBI to resolve the dispute between
the three riparian countries of Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan over their control of the Nile water.
These three countries are those that rely most heavily on the Nile compared to the other
eight riparian countries. Ethiopia is the major supplier, while Egypt and Sudan are highly
consuming countries. The climate of the two downstream riparian countries is always dry,
hence over 90% of Egypt is desert and the availability of rainfall is extremely rare. Therefore,
the main source for agriculture, and fresh water is the Nile River, whereas, the upper stream
countries rely not only on the Nile water, but also on the rainwater in their water consumption.
Among the eleven riparian countries, Egypt and Ethiopia have the largest population; as of
2020, Egypt’s population reached over 102 million people, whereas Ethiopia’s population
exceeded 114 million inhabitants (Africa news, 2020).

2. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD)
2.1 Historical Background
Ethiopia has long opposed Egypt’s hegemony of Nile water which was stated in the AngloEgyptian Treaty during the British colonial period and which was the major motivation for
Ethiopia to take an individual step towards constructing the GERD. In 1958, Ethiopia’s
government sent a statement to the government of Egypt addressing their vision on sharing the
Nile water. It stated: “Ethiopia may be prepared to share this tremendous God-given wealth of
hers with friendly neighbour nations, but it is Ethiopia’s sacred duty to develop the resources
it possesses in the interest of its own rapidly expanding population and economy” (Arsano,
2012).
Since 1958, plans for constructing a dam on the Blue Nile have started. The United
States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) conducted several geographical surveys between the
period of 1956 to 1964 until it offered four potential dam sites in 1964, Mabil, Karadobi,

9

Hagar Elbarbary

Boarder and Mendia (Saeed, 2018). However, Ethiopia could not proceed with the project due
to its then ongoing civil war, along with the war with Somalia and Eritrea. After nearly half
century, planning for the dam resumed owing to the political and economic stability under the
regime of the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and its Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi (Abtew & Dessu, 2018).
The EPRDF seized power in 1991 with a determination to create a national consent by
enabling the people to share a vision for a prosperous future while respecting domestic affairs
and establishing a democratic structure (EPRDF, 2005). Thus, the dam project symbolises a
major switch from ‘‘politics of deviation’’ accompanied by ethnic-based federalism, since
Ethiopia is divided into nine regional states, to ensuring the ‘‘unity in differences’’. The dam
is intended to unify Ethiopia’s more than 80 different ethnic groups and unite them (Abdelhady
et al., 2015).
After considering the four proposed construction sites from the USBR, Prime Minister
Zenawi’s government appointed French and Dutch companies to update the USBR studies in
1998. The government proceeded with the dam’s planning and designing covertly and the
construction was shown as a national milestone to represent the government success
economically and politically, along with uniting the different society members through
patriotism (Abtew & Dessu, 2018).
Zenawi’s government named the dam at the beginning ‘Project X’ to keep its secrecy,
then the name changed to “The Millennium Hydro-electric Nile Dam” (Meles Zenawi
Memorial, 2013). Ethiopia publicly announced the dam project on the 12th of March, 2011 and
made the contract with Salini Costruttori, the Italian construction company which started
constructing the dam in April 2011 for ETB 80 bn ($ 4,7bn) under the supervision by the
Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO) which owns and operates the dam (Saeed,
2018). On the15th of April, 2011, the Council of Ministers in Ethiopia changed the name of the
dam to be the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) (ENA, 2011).

2.2 Zenawi Speech to encourage Ethiopians to fund the GERD
For Ethiopians, the dam is a symbol of national pride and therefore millions of Ethiopians
contributed in funding the GERD by investing their own savings in its construction, buying
bonds that Ethiopian government issued for Ethiopians inside the country and for the Ethiopian
community abroad. Patriotic songs and advertisements were used to mobilize the raising of

10

Hagar Elbarbary

funding. In addition, the Development Bank of Ethiopia started to offer loans with minimal
interest to encourage businessmen and individuals to invest in the dam (Abtew & Dessu, 2018).
This reaction of the Ethiopian people came after the speech of Prime Minister Zenawi
at the time of the official commencement ceremony of the GERD on 2nd April, 2011 (Meles
Zenawi Memorial, 2013) (Samaan, 2017)
Zenawi Said:
“Honourable peoples of Ethiopia! We have gathered here today at the largest of our rivers to witness the launch
of this great project. It is rightly called the Millennium Dam. It is the largest dam we could build at any point
along the Nile, or indeed any other river. More importantly the project takes the pride of place, representing an
incomparable addition to our national plan for expanding power production. It will not only raise our own power
generating capacity and meet our domestic needs. It will also allow us to export to neighbouring countries ... “

At the time of his speech, Zenawi was fully aware that constructing such a large dam
for the first time on the Blue Nile would not be achieved without risks and challenges.
Therefore, it was necessary for the dam to be established and portrayed as the largest national
hydroelectric power project in Ethiopia’s history that would not only mitigate the electricity
shortages and blackouts but would also shift the country’s economy by exporting energy to
neighbouring countries. Thus, such a project would certainly be a source of pride for all
Ethiopians (Samaan, 2017).
Zenawi was certain that relying on national funds was the only possible way at that time
to construct the dam, instead of waiting for the international donors to finance it after having
Egypt and Sudan’s consent. Thus, he managed to persuade Ethiopians of the necessity to make
difficult choices and to sacrifice, if necessary, for the sake of their country’s future (Samaan,
2017):
“Indeed, the current disposition is to make attempts to undercut Ethiopia’s efforts to secure funding to cover the
cost of the project. We have, in fact, been forced to rely on our own savings alone to cover the expense. The
estimated cost will be 3.3 billion Euros, or 78 billion Birr. As we will be financing several other projects in our
plan, the expense will be an additional and heavy burden on us. All our efforts to lighten this have been
unsuccessful, leaving us with only two options. Either to abandon the project or do whatever we must to raise the
required funds. I have no doubt which of these difficult choices the Ethiopian people will make. No matter how
poor we are, in the Ethiopian traditions of resolve, the Ethiopian people will pay any sacrifice. I have no doubt
they will, with one voice, say: ‘Build the Dam!’ “... (Samaan,

11

2017).

2.3 The GERD Location
The GERD is considered to be the first significant dam on the Blue Nile, which originates at
Lake Tana in the north-western highlands of Ethiopia and travels for nearly 1,450 km to join
the White Nile in Sudan. The Blue Nile contributes up to 80% of its water to the Nile River
during the raining season and it is the major supplier of the Nile water ("The Grand Ethiopian
Renaissance Dam (GERD) Hydroelectric Project", 2020). The Grand Renaissance Dam is
being established on the Blue Nile at the Benishangul-Gumuz region, approximately 40km east
of Sudan, upstream of the Ethiopian-Sudanese border and 500km north-west of the Ethiopian
capital Addis Ababa (Fig.1) (Abtew & Dessu, 2018).
The structure of the GERD combines a main gravity dam built with roller compacted
concrete (RCC) which is 1.8km long and 175m high, as well as, a saddle dam structured from
concrete faced rock fill (CFRD) which is 5km long and 60m high, with three spillways between
both the main and the saddle dam (International Hydropower Association, 2020). The reservoir
of the GERD will cover around 1874 km2 with an active and total storage volume up to 74
billion m3. The GERD is expected to generate more than 6000 megawatts annually becoming
the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa (Samaan, 2017).

Fig.1 The location of the GERD on the Blue Nile and the Ethiopian-Sudanese border (Samaan, 2017).

For the GERD’s construction site, Ethiopia chose the Border dam, which is one of the
four proposed sites by the USBR studies and considered in all the designing plans back then.
However, the size and the generation capacity of the new dam is significantly larger than the
13

Hagar Elbarbary

previously proposed ones (Samaan, 2017). Considering Ethiopia’s announcement that the only
purpose behind constructing the GERD is generating hydroelectric power for domestic use and
for exporting to Sudan and Egypt, Ethiopia reasoned its selection of the site to be in the nearest
point to Sudan so that it can diminish the possible loss in power transportation as well as
reducing grid costs. In addition, by selecting this site, Ethiopia presented its good will to
cooperate with the downstream riparian countries in operating the Nile water since the GERD
location is exceedingly distant from any possible irrigation lands (Abtew & Dessu, 2018). On
the other hand, constructing the dam on the Ethiopian-Sudanese border and exactly where it
has been built is regarded as a hindrance and protection at the same time for the GERD since
any possible attack on the dam after being filled would cause immense floods over Sudan,
Egypt’s partner against building the dam. Thus, Egypt or Sudan would think twice before
initiating any military action against the dam in case of tension escalation between the three
countries (Whittington et al., 2014).

2.4 Technical Background
As mentioned earlier the GERD consists of four parts.
2.4.1 Main Gravity Dam
The main gravity dam is 1.8km long and 175m high built from roller-compacted concrete
(RCC) on the main channel of the Blue Nile. The roller compacted concrete has a number of
advantages over the normal concrete hence it does not require much time to be cooled and
formed, along with its reasonable cost. The main gravity dam is built between two hilltops on
the river and it has three segments; two power stations, one on the right bank of the river and
the other on the left bank, and the central block in the middle which contains two supplementary
spillways, one gated and the other ungated (Figs: 2 and 2.1) (Abtew & Dessu, 2018). The two
gates’ purpose is discharging the amount of 2450 m3/s of water in case of any flood arising
(Water Technology, 2021).
2.4.2 The Saddle Dam
The second dam is 5km long and 60m high concrete faced rock fill (CFRD) supporting saddle
dam. It is a crucial part to keep up the necessary water surface rise and profundity at the general
level of the dam site. The saddle dam height is about 600m above mean sea level (amsl); thus,
it raises the natural features of the land from 600m amsl to approximately 646m amsl keeping

14

Hagar Elbarbary

the water level of the reservoir as designed. Due to the topography of the GERD site, the saddle
dam needed to be 5km long in order to cover the existing gap between the two hills (Abtew &
Dessu, 2018).
2.4.3 The Three Spillways
The third part of the GERD are the three spillways located between the main and the saddle
dam. The objective of the spillways is to discharge flood water up to 38,500 m3/s into the Blue
River before the water fluids into the neighbouring country Sudan in case of extreme and
sudden floods (International Hydropower Association, 2020).
2.4.4 The Reservoir
The reservoir is the fourth part of the GERD covering approximately 1874 km2 with an active
and total storage volume up to 74 billion m3 (74 Billion Cubic Meters) (Fig:2.1) (International
Hydropower Association, 2020). The GERD is expected to generate more than 6000 megawatts
annually to become the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa (Samaan, 2017). The
duration in which Ethiopia is planning to fill the reservoir is considered one of the main issues
that downstream countries are concerned about since the quicker Ethiopia fills the GERD, the
less water flow will run to the downstream countries. Thus, Egypt urged Ethiopia to fill the
reservoir within 12 years, however Ethiopia is estimating 5-6 years for the GERD to be filled
(Heubl, 2020).

3. Impacts of the GERD Project
Although the GERD will likely have immense economic, social and political impact in
Ethiopia’s development and some neighbouring countries, it will also have detrimental
consequences on both Ethiopia and the downstream riparian countries. The GERD construction
will change the Blue Nile River flow, along with its associated ecosystems (Abtew & Dessu,
2018).

3.1 Impacts of Constructing the GERD on Ethiopia
3.1.1 People Displacement
The major impact of constructing the GERD reservoir is the resettlement of the people living
in the area where the reservoir is built. Despite being a source of pride and patriotism for the
majority of Ethiopians, some reports argue that many people have been greatly affected by the
construction of the GERD. The affected local communities have not been informed about nor
16

Hagar Elbarbary

agreed on the project and they have been ignored by the government (International Rivers,
2012).
Around 20,000 to 122,000 people have been resettled according to different capacities
of the reservoir volumes (Negm & Abdel-Fattah, 2019). Some of the relocated Ethiopians are
indigenous people living in Gumuz and Berta. They originally suffer from inequality and low
living standard comparing to other Ethiopians. The Gumuz and Berta communities mainly
relied on hunting, fishing, farming, and other forest activities for their living. Although,
according to the Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), displaced people have
been offered adequate resources to relocate such as money, houses, and job opportunities, it is
still hard for them to restart their lives again in a place far from their lands and forests.
Transitions from agriculture-based activities to labour market can also be challenging given
the lack of adequate education in the area (Chen & Swain, 2014). The GERD-related displaces
can further instigate ethnic conflicts within Ethiopia (Legesse, 2014).

3.1.2 Biodiversity Impacts on the GERD Location Area
Constructing the GERD will change the nature and the characteristics of the Blue Nile River
water. For instance, water temperature, levels of solvated Oxygen, and salinity. Consequently,
it will change the existing ecosystems of the reservoir area and the surrounding territory into
an aquatic one. This means that all the forests will be destroyed, while birds, animals, insects
will be forced to migrate to other areas. In addition, large numbers of fish species will be
affected since the GERD will obstruct their migration through the river and even when they try
to swim upstream, they will get bewildered due to the slow flow and the warm water. Some
other fish are expected to die when passing directly through the hydroelectric turbines of the
dam (Handiso, 2018).
On the other hand, when the reservoir is filled-up, forests and plants located upstream
will be destroyed. Consequently, they will no longer be functioning as carbon sinks since the
decomposed plants will release dissolved methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The amount of
carbon emissions related to the reservoir volumes have been estimated as ranging from one to
eight million tons of carbon dioxide (Handiso, 2018).

17

Hagar Elbarbary

3.2 Impacts of the GERD Construction on the Neighbouring Downstream
Countries
Comparing to other Nile Basin riparian countries which have alternatives for obtaining water
resources, both Egypt and Sudan are highly dependent on the Nile River water. For instance,
more than 90% of Egypt’s fresh water supply comes from the Nile, in which more than 86%
originates from the Ethiopian highlands and the Blue Nile River. Thus, the diversion of water
flow in the upstream and being controlled by Ethiopia through the GERD is a threatening issue
for Egypt (Swain, 2011).

3.2.1 Water Share Reduction
Egypt’s concerns over constructing the GERD can be explained in the following points. First,
the major issues are the duration of filling the reservoir and the operation of the GERD in times
of drought. The proposed duration of filling the reservoir is from 5-7 years. However, Ethiopia
insists on their capability of filling it in only three years, so that it can benefit from generating
electricity as soon as possible. In case of filling the reservoir in 3 years and due to stocking the
Blue River water for filling the reservoir, Egypt is expected to lose around 10-15 billion m3 of
its annual share, which is 55.5 billion m3 according to the 1959 agreement between Egypt and
Sudan (Handiso, 2018).
The decreased amount of water supply will directly affect the agriculture sector in
Egypt and all its related activities from food production to employing large numbers of people
since agriculture alone consumes 80% of the Nile’s fresh water. It is expected that agriculture
lands will be diminished by 29.47% in Upper Egypt and by 23.03% in the Nile Delta (ElNashar & Elyamany, 2018). Thus, the longer Ethiopia will take to fill the reservoir, the less
amount of water will be decreased from Egypt’s annual share (Donia & Negm, 2018). In
addition, experts expect around 12 billion m3 to be wasted annually due to evaporation and
water descending from altitude to run the turbines, which will have a direct effect on the quality
and quantity of the Nile water by accelerating its salinity (Noureddine, 2018).

3.2.2 Decrease in Power generated from Aswan High Dam (AHD)
The second crucial issue is the impact of the GERD construction on Aswan High Dam and its
Nasser Lake. Nasser lake is regarded as one of the largest dam’s reservoir in the world with a
total length around 500km, the lake extends with 350km in southern Egypt and 150km in
southern Sudan, where it is called Nubia Lake. The lake capacity is 160 × 109 m3 and it has
18

Hagar Elbarbary

been used for water storage for irrigation and agriculture purposes, in addition to power
generation since the construction of the High Dam in 1960 (Donia & Negm, 2018).
When Ethiopia starts filling the GERD reservoir, Egypt is expected to rely on the stored
water at Nasser Lake to compensate the reduced share, thus, the water level in Nasser Lake
will be diminished resulting in a severe reduction in the power produced at the High dam. The
reduction is predicted to range from 20% to 30% if the reservoir is being filled during drought
periods.
The Aswan High Dam is designed to operate with Egypt’s annual share of water which
is 55.5 billion m3. The minimum rate of power altitude is 31.9 billion m3 and the elevation rate
averages from 121 to 167 billion m3. This amount is basically reserved for any emergency or
flooding operating management. Therefore, the risk of water and power generation reduction
depends on three main aspects:


The initial water storage level in Nasser lake,



The environmental conditions when the GERD reservoir is being filled,



The agreed amount of water that will be released to downstream countries

(Donia & Negm, 2018).

3.2.3 Elevated Salinization in Egypt’s Agricultural Lands
The GERD construction resulted in withdrawing large amounts of upstream sediments and
nutrients, which caused the increase of salinization of agricultural lands downstream. Given
the fact that the Nile water is being recycled numerous times before being discharged into the
Mediterranean Sea, this recycling process makes the water even saltier. Consequently, Upper
Egypt agriculture lands will be reduced by 29.47%, whereas the Delta farmlands will be
decreased by 23.03% and around 8 million farmers are expected to lose their incomes.
Salt-concentrated irrigation water has a detrimental effect on the soil fertility and the
quality of the produced crops. Therefore, farmers tend to use artificial fertilizers to enhance
crop quality. On the other hand, the excessive use of fertilizers affects crops and leads to
accumulation of heavy metals, nitrate and phosphate, with the potential of bioaccumulation
and bio magnification throughout the food chain and in human populations (Donia & Negm,
2018).

3.2.4 Sea Water Intrusion Exacerbation
Constructing the GERD will not only cause the ground water depletion, but it will also cause
an increase of the sea water stream into the coastal aquifers in the Northern Nile Delta area. As
19

Hagar Elbarbary

a result, the vulnerability of the North Delta will be accentuated causing agricultural
degradation, land subsidence, and other geotechnical problems. Areas around 2,677 and 4,675
km2 will suffer from seawater intrusion after the depletion of groundwater, by 2 and 5 meters
under sea level, respectively (Donia & Negm, 2018).
3.2.5 Environmental Decay
The imbalance of the ecosystem is one of the adverse impacts of constructing the GERD.
Environmental despoliation, water contamination, agricultural lands desertification and fish
farms pollution are all some of the predicted consequences of the GERD.
On the other hand, climate change is a significant factor that will have uncertain effects
on the Nile Basin. For instance, in case of dry weather and high temperatures due to global
warming, the rates of evaporation will increase and will consequently reduce the water flow to
the downstream countries. Contrastingly, in case of wet weather, the elevated condensation
from evaporation will result in increase in the downfall causing abundance in the water flow
from the highlands to the downstream, and the GERD will protect both Egypt and Sudan from
any possible damage due to water flooding. However, the severity of the floods might change
due to climate change (Donia & Negm, 2018).
In case of the GERD failure, all the water restored in the reservoir will flood into Sudan
and Egypt, which means, the Aswan High Dam and other dams in Sudan will collapse causing
major fatalities and damage in both countries (Donia & Negm, 2018).

3.2.6 Potential Dam Failure and Impacts on Sudan
Sudan has long enjoyed a satisfactory share of Nile water, around 18.5 billion m3 annual share
according to the 1959 Nile water agreement between Egypt and Sudan. In 2010, Sudan froze
its membership in the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) due to disagreements with the upstream
riparian countries over Nile River water management. In 2011, when Ethiopia announced the
GERD construction, Sudan was witnessing a political turmoil in connection to South Sudan
independence.
Sudan’s initial response towards the GERD construction announcement was
disapproving the project and Khartoum expressed its concerns over the safety of its own dams
and the water flow coming from the Blue Nile. However, a year later in 2012, Sudan
government was convinced by Sudanese water experts and some officials of the Ethiopian
government that the GERD will benefit Sudan and therefore, Sudan joined the NBI again in
November 2012 (International Crisis Group Report, 2019).
20

Hagar Elbarbary

After completion, the GERD should regulate the water flow to Sudan and clear the
sediments from its farmlands which opens the gate for agricultural development by harvesting
and irrigating new agricultural lands. Sudan could potentially benefit from foreign investments
from a number of countries. For instance, Saudi Arabia has a long history of investing in the
Sudanese farmlands, and Port Sudan is regarded as one of its main food suppliers since it is
only 400 km from Jeddah. On the other hand, UAE, Qatar and other Gulf countries have
purchased thousands of acres of cultivable Sudanese lands to secure their long-term food
security (International Crisis Group Report, 2019).
However, Sudan still needs to develop and improve its infrastructure in order to acquire
the expected benefits of the GERD. The private business in Sudan is still poor, so the question
is whether the foreign investors would be able to invest in the infrastructure as well or not.
President Omar Al Bashir has long favoured securing the military sector more than the
economic one which resulted in the economic inflation, in addition to fuelling the citizens rage
(International Crisis Group Report, 2019).
Even though the GERD will offer a number of potential benefits to Sudan, such as
maintaining the electricity supply and enjoying a steady Nile water flow throughout the year,
in addition to managing the flood water that causes significant damage to Sudan and its people,
the country is still concerned since the failure of the GERD would have a disastrous
consequence on its capital Khartoum, and its main dams the Roseires, Merowe, and Sennar
(Negm & Abdel-Fattah, 2019).
Dam failure is not a new phenomenon. It has continued to occur in spite of new
construction methodologies. For instance, the collapse of the Malpasset Dam on the Reyran
River in southern France in 1959 which killed more than 400 people and caused damage
approximated to US $68 million. In 1970, several dams collapsed as well, such as the flooding
of Buffalo Creek Dam in West Virginia in 1972, the Teton Dam on the Teton River in Idaho,
the United States which failed in 1976, the Laurel Run Dam and Sandy Run Dam which yielded
in 1977 in Pennsylvania and the Lawn Lake Dam collapse in Colorado in 1982.
In 1998, Europe witnessed a catastrophic ecological disaster when the Aznalcóllar mine
tailings dam near Seville, Spain failed causing around 5100 acres of land to be flooded with
heavy metals and acidic water due to the high amount of arsenic, zinc, thallium and cadmium.
Among other ecological consequences, the disaster resulted in more over than 30,000 kg of
dead fish and the fading of the aquatic nature on the Guadiamar River (Negm & Abdel-Fattah,
2019). More recently, the critical failure of mine tailings dams in Brazil brought the 2019
disaster in Brumadinho, where 250 people were killed and 12 million cubic metres of tailings
21

Hagar Elbarbary

polluted 300 km of rivers, and the 2015 Mariana disaster that killed 19 people and polluted 650
km of rivers reaching the Atlantic Ocean.
Consequently, in case of any unpredictable circumstances, the GERD might suffer a
critical failure and the generation of the flood wave might cause disastrous fatalities in Sudan,
particularly if there were not any prepared emergency plans for evacuation in advance.
The GERD dimensions are prodigious and the dam site is at high risk due to the
instability of the soil upstream since it is located on one of the most earth-shaking places in the
world. More than 15,000 strong earthquakes have been documented around the GERD site and
over 16 earthquakes with 6.5 magnitude had a cataclysmic damage on Ethiopia in the 20th
century. In addition to the destruction that might affect the five dams and the adjacent cities in
the downstream countries. Out of the five dams, three dams belong to Sudan which are Roseires,
Merowe, and Sennar, while the other two dams are inside Egypt; the Aswan High Dam and the
Aswan Reservoir. Therefore, an analysis for the dam failure possibilities should be carried out
and all the scenarios investigated in order to mitigate any damage that might happen, as well
as to appease Egypt and Sudan’s concerns (Negm & Abdel-Fattah, 2019).
A cooperation between Kyoto, Hokkaido, Mizuho universities with the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) and the Foundation of the River Disaster Prevention Research
Institute in Japan resulted in developing a software called the International River Interface
Cooperative (IRIC) which will be used in the simulation of the dam failure and the expected
consequences on the downstream countries (Negm & Abdel-Fattah, 2019).

3.3 International Reactions
After Ethiopia’s sudden announcement of the GERD construction, Egypt considered it as a
violation to the 1929 treaty and immediately requested Ethiopia to halt the construction until it
provided a detailed study on the impacts of the dam on the downstream countries, whereas
Sudan with a flexible position hoped for gaining benefits from the mega dam, yet it showed
considerable concerns over the safety of its own dams and people.
Ethiopia, on the other hand, turned down Egypt’s request and continued the
construction of the GERD. In June 2011, the three countries started their tripartite negotiation
to form a trilateral technical committee for negotiating the Nile water management and later in
2015, they recommended the “Declaration of Principles” to resolve the dam issue. The
document stipulated that the three countries should cooperate according to mutual
understanding and good intentions to manage the shared water and to take further steps in order
22

Hagar Elbarbary

to hinder any fundamental harm (International Crisis Group Report, 2019). The three-country
talks and meetings over managing and operating the GERD have been continued till present
without any significant positive outcome.
The United States adopted a mediator role responding to the Egyptian president Sisi’s
request and President Trump intervened to host number of talks after inviting officials from the
three countries. Ethiopia considers that the United States is taking the Egyptian and Sudanese
side, and thus Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed skipped several rounds of the organized talks under
the US mediation attempt (International Crisis Group Report, 2019).
Other countries have supported Ethiopia in constructing the GERD and they even
contributed in funding it to reap its benefits in the near future. These include China, which
funded more than 30% of the project (The Economist, 2011), Italy, the World Bank, the
European Investment Bank and Israel which has great interest in Ethiopia. The mutual relation
between Israel and Ethiopia has strengthened when Israel provided the technical and military
assistance to Ethiopia in its war against Eretria in 1998-2000, in addition to its support after
the Cold War (Abd al-Hay, 2020).
Along with providing Ethiopia with the necessary funding, Israel has its own
construction and agriculture companies that are assisting the building of the GERD.
Furthermore, after the tension mounted between Egypt and Ethiopia over the GERD, Israeli
missile and radar companies developed a defence system for Ethiopia by installing a SpyderMR anti-aircraft system around the GERD that can fire upon any warplane from a distance
range from 5-50km (Abd al-Hay, 2020).

4. Methodology
In order to gain a deeper insight into the ongoing water conflict between the three riparian Nile
Basin countries, this research has been conducted by applying the tools of conflict analysis.
Following the definition of the US Institute for Peace, conflict analysis is “a structured inquiry
into the causes and potential direction of a conflict” that “seeks to identify opportunities for
managing or resolving disputes without recourse to violent action” (Levinger, 2013).
Conflict analysis can be used in examining different types of conflicts, the open conflict
(conflict which is noticeable and entrenched), surface conflict (conflict which is prominent but
depthless), and latent conflict (conflict that is subsurface but likely to arise) (Fisher et al., 2000).
In addition, conflict analysis plays an important role in providing a thorough and
comprehensive assessment for the conflict key issues and its update for policymakers, peace23

Hagar Elbarbary

building organizations, as well as scholars. It is a crucial element in mitigating the negative
consequences and improving the positive ones when working in conflict-prevalent areas
(OECD, 2008).
Conflict analysis can be carried out for different purposes. It can be done as a
preparation for cooperating with conflict parties or stakeholders and this requires an
understanding of the diverse parties’ perspectives, demands and the root of all the issues. The
analysis can also be used as an intervention tool for a conflict resolution. In this case, it has to
be parallelly performed with the conflict sensitive approach since it deals with sensitive matters,
such as, power, interests, and possessorship. The sensitive approach allows the parties to
understand their own conflicts while respecting other parties’ feelings, issues and ownership.
Transparency about the goal of the analysis process is an important factor of the sensitive
approach. However, in some cases, it is essential to guarantee the safety of the communities
during the analysis process. For example, asking compelling questions to people in public
might expose them to danger or unsecure places, so in this case seeking transparency should
be restricted by ensuring safety to the sensitive elements of the analysis process (Walovitch,
2015).
For the purpose of this research, a number of conflict analysis instruments have been
applied. These include the “conflict wheel”, “INMEDIO’s conflict perspective analysis (CPA)”,
and “Glasl’s conflict escalation model”. These tools allow for the understanding of all the
conflict actors, dynamics, causation, structures and issues, focussing on certain aspects of the
conflict and explaining how it emerged and how it escalated over time. The tools also lead to
a future action plan that could resolve the dispute if all the countries’ cooperation is guaranteed.

4.1 The Conflict Wheel
The conflict wheel provides a thorough overview of the conflict before analysing each aspect
and it aims at organizing the other conflict analysis tools. The wheel represents both the
completeness and the movement since all the diverse aspects come together again after being
analysed in order for the conflict wheel to keep rotating (Mason & Rychard, 2005).
The six dimensions of the conflict wheel are as follows:

4.1.1 The Conflict Actors/ Parties
The parties of the conflict are being determined upon their level of intervention. Directly
involved actors are called “conflict parties”, while actors trying to mediate or convert the
conflict path are called “third parties”. Stakeholders are another significant actor who have
interest in the conflict or its final outcome and they can vary from local people, organizations,
24

Hagar Elbarbary

foreign countries, etc. stakeholders are usually not directly involved in the conflict (Mason &
Rychard, 2005).

4.1.2 The Conflict Issues
The conflict issues are the issues that have primarily caused the conflict and it could also be
the consequences of some actions of one or more conflict parties.

4.1.3 The Conflict Dynamics
The dynamics of the conflict have been explained in Galtung model of conflict analysis as the
combination of the three elements (Attitude, Behaviour and Contradiction) and it can also
represent the severity of the interaction that leads to the acceleration level of the conflict.

Fig. 3. Galtung´s model of conflict analysis (Webel & Galtung, 2010)

4.1.4 The Conflict Structures
The conflict contexts or structures refer to the structural violence that is being caused indirectly.
The conflict issues affect one or more of the parties’ economic and political state, resulting in
poverty in these communities, which eventually leads to violence.
4.1.5 Causation
Conflicts are usually multi-causal and a result of interaction between different factors. The
causation part helps in differentiating between the diverse causes and the possible influence
elements.

4.1.6 Strategies/ Options
This point discusses all the feasible ways and tactics that could be used by the third parties to
resolve the conflict or de-escalate it.

25

Hagar Elbarbary

4.2 INMEDIO’s Conflict Perspective Analysis (CPA)
The second method applied for analysing the conflict is the INMEDIO’s conflict perspective
analysis tool. The CPA tool explains the diverse attitudes and points of views of the actors, so
that the common issues as well as the differences are clear. The CPA helps in preparing for the
mediation between the conflicted parties by understanding each party’s perspective and trying
to reach to a mutual ground where compromises could be sought. It also helps in separating
facts from assumptions and enables parties to stand in each other position to understand their
fears and needs. This way each party’s perspective would be broadened (Mason & Rychard,
2005).
The CPA can be presented by explaining:
-

Conflict actors

-

Facts

-

Interests

-

Motivations

-

Available options (Mason & Rychard, 2005).

4.3 Glasl’s Conflict Escalation Model
The third applied method of analysing the conflict is Glasl’s conflict escalation model. It
provides an analysis of the escalation stages of the conflict where the tension and intensity have
been increased. Glasl’s model explains the escalation in three levels through nine descending
stages where the parties get drawn into the dynamics of the conflict.
The first level includes hardening, debates and actions not words. The second stage
includes coalitions, loss of face, and strategies of threat. The third and final descending stage
represents the real collapse in three stages, limited destruction, total annihilation, and together
into the abyss.
Sometimes parties get stuck in one phase for a long time before falling abruptly into
another stage. When the escalation level elevates, the mediating party needs to be more potent
and forceful. In this case, the nature of intervention itself changes from conflict management
that is based on mutual trust between the parties to a forceful one when the parties refuse to sit
on the negotiation table and reject the intervention (Mason & Rychard, 2005).

5. Analysis of the GERD conflict
5.1 The Actors
The primary conflict actors are the government of Ethiopia and the downstream countries of
Egypt and Sudan, while the stakeholders vary from national to international levels. On the
national level comes the Ethiopian people who are going to benefit directly from the GERD
construction through its power generation which will not only meet the people’s electricity
demands, but it will transform Ethiopia into the biggest African power hub in the region. In
addition, it will enhance the economic development by increasing job opportunities. On the
international level, the upper stream neighbouring Nile riparian countries such as, Brundi,
Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Eritrea,
as well as the countries that contributed in financing the GERD, e.g.: China, Israel, Saudi
Arabia, United Arab of Emirates and Turkey are supposed to reap their assistance and
investments in the mega dam once it starts operating.
Third parties are different entities that have mediated upon the request of one or more
of the conflict parties to bring both parties to the negotiation table. In this conflict, the United
States has played the mediator role upon the request of the Egyptian president Abdel Fattah
Elsisi to president Trump during the United Nations General Assembly in New York in
September 2019 (Widakuswara, 2019).
On the other hand, Sudan has officially requested the mediation of the United Nations,
the African Union and the European Union to help both Sudan and Egypt to reach legal and
binding agreement with Ethiopia on filling and operating the massive dam (Mohiedeen, 2021).
Negotiations over the dam have started in 2011, approximately a decade now after
Ethiopia’s announcement of the dam construction with the facilitation of the World Bank and
the U.S treasury department, however, the talks failed and reached a deadlock since the three
countries did not manage to reach a mutual agreement.
Talks’ failure resulted from the obscurity of the Ethiopian side in reliving the
downstream countries’ concerns, in addition to Ethiopia’s insistence on filling the dam’s
reservoir in less than three years which is against both Egypt and Sudan’s request.

5.2 The Conflict Issues
The GERD is prone to a number of concerns that created the tension and conflict between
Ethiopia and the downstream countries. The first issue is endangering the water security and
the ecosystem of the downstream nations, specifically Egypt. The duration of filling the
27

Hagar Elbarbary

reservoir determines the amount of water supply that will be cut from both Egypt and Sudan’s
share. As mentioned earlier, Egypt is expected to lose around 10-15 billion m3 of its annual
water share, consequently the agriculture sector will be hugely affected and the water levels in
Aswan High Dam will be declined causing possible problems in producing the hydropower.
In case of drought seasons, water flow will automatically be reduced resulting in less
water contribution to the downstream countries, which is another concern. Thus, managing the
water during filling the reservoir and when the dam becomes operational is the main issue of
conflict that has not been resolved despite the ongoing negotiations between the three countries
since 2011.
As for Sudan, the biggest concern is the safety of their own dams located 15 km
approximate to the GERD, in addition to the severe damage that might happen to the capital
Khartoum and the Sudanese people in case of the GERD failure under any circumstances. The
Sudanese people are the ones who would pay a heavy price in case of the dam failure.

5.3 The Conflict Dynamics
Negotiations between the three conflict parties started immediately right after Ethiopia’s
proclamation of building the GERD in 2011. The tripartite talks took place regularly without
any noticeable agreement until the three countries signed the ‘Declaration of Principles’ on 23rd
March 2015 in Khartoum, Sudan. The declaration of principles is not considered as a final
agreement, yet it is a general framework which consists of 10 principles that need technical
stipulation to put guidelines for cooperation when the dam starts operating (Eltaweel, 2020).
The outlined 10 principles are principles of cooperation; development, regional
integration and sustainability; not causing considerable damage; fair and appropriate water use;
managing water during the first reservoir filling and the dam operation; building mutual trust;
exchanging information and circulating data; dam’s safety; unity and sovereignty of the state;
and the last principle is the peaceful resolution of the disputes between the three countries
(Ahramonline, 2015).
A series of fraught discussions have continued to take place even after signing the
declaration of principles, however, the conflict escalated when Ethiopia unilaterally started the
first filling of the reservoir in July 2020 with 4.9 billion m3 during its heavy rainy season which
starts in June and lasts till September. In the first filling the water reached the highest low point
of the GERD wall and that allowed Ethiopia to test the dam turbines. On the other hand, during
the dry seasons the retained water is expected to subside allowing the remainder part of the
dam wall to be built up (BBC, 2020).
28

Hagar Elbarbary

As part of the consequences of the first filling, Sudan recorded a critical drop in its
water level coming from the Blue Nile when the Sudanese minister of Irrigation announced the
water level reduction following the first filling in July 2020 (El Gundy, 2020). At the same
time, Egypt criticized Ethiopia’s unilateral decision of the filling without any prior agreement
with the downstream countries. In addition to the water reduction resulted from the dam filling,
Egypt is suffering from dry canals of irrigation due to climate change and lack of maintenance.
According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, temperatures in most
parts of Egypt are predicted to rise with an average from 1.8 to 3.6 degrees Celsius over the
upcoming years, demanding extra amount of water to cultivate crops and to compensate the
increased evaporation in both the Nile and its canals (Bearak & Raghavan, 2020).
Although the three countries have not yet reached to a binding agreement to secure their
interests and water share, Ethiopia’s minister of Water, Irrigation and Energy Seleshi Bekele
announced on March 17th, 2021 that his country will carry out the second phase of impounding
the reservoir with 13.5 billion m3 this time since 79 percent of the GERD construction is
complete (Kandil, 2021). As a result, Egypt sent a rejection letter to the United Nations stating
that the negotiations held for 8 months under the supervision of the African Union proved its
ineffectiveness and Ethiopia’s insistence on the second filling would fuel the conflict and
worsen the current situation by bringing more damage to the downstream countries (Egypt
today, 2021).
The latest tripartite round of the negotiations in Kinshasa, Congo had also failed
pushing the Egyptian president Adel Fatah El Sisi to repeat his threatening statements that all
options are open to protect Egypt’s water. The Egyptian political analyst in the Ahram Strategic
Centre Hany Raslan pointed out that the military option is possible since the relationship
between both Egypt and Sudan is witnessing an unprecedented rapprochement and the two
countries performed joint air exercises including battle activities, along with commando
batches (Salama, 2021).
In an attempt to mitigate the amounted tension and the international pressure, Ethiopia
offered to exchange data about the GERD before the second phase of filling starts in July,
however both Egypt and Sudan renounced the offer demanding signing a legally binding
agreement before sharing the data. In addition, the Sudanese chief of negotiations, Mustafa Al
Zubair, requested the African Union to change the mechanism of the negotiations and he
restated Sudan’s demand of forming a quartet committee of the African Union, the European
Union, The United Nations and the United States to take an effective mediation role in the ongoing conflict (Abdel Rahim & Abdel Moneim, 2021).

5.4 The Conflict Structure
Besides the regional and international dynamics, internal conflict between the Ethiopian
government and the autonomous ruling government in northern Ethiopia, Tigray People’s
Liberation Front (TPLF) has escalated since September 2020 to become a civil war resulting
in thousands of deaths, massive destruction, 2 million people displaced, 60 thousand refugees
fleeing into Sudan and around 80 percent of the region’s six million inhabitants being cut out
from the humanitarian assistance. The TPLF ruled Ethiopia from 1974 until 2018 when Prime
Minister Abiy Ahmed got elected. TPLF has approximately 250 thousand fighters and they
have participated in the war against Eritrea that ended in 2000 by signing a peace agreement
between Ethiopia and Eretria (Mikhail, 2020)
Apart from the Tigray crisis, another internal dispute is happening in Metekkel area of
the state of Benishangul- Gumuz in western Ethiopia. One of the reasons of the attacks on
Metekkel zone is the neighbouring Amhara state interest to occupy/ administer the region and
to exploit the benefits of the cultivatable lands and ground minerals. In the meantime, Egypt
and Sudan’s interests are intersected in this conflict since the GERD is located in Guba, which
is one of six districts of Metekkel. Guba is the nearest district to Sudan and since the
downstream countries are deeply concerned with the GERD operation that might reduce their
water share, Sudan started to claim their ownership of Guba district declaring that it was gifted
from a former Sudanese leader Abdullahi in 1897 to the emperor of Ethiopia. Consequently,
Ethiopia is accusing Sudan and its alley Egypt of financing the armed Gumuz militia to
endanger the remainder construction of the GERD and filling its reservoir (The conversation,
2021).
Another direct structural violence to the GERD is expected to take place in Egypt when
the GERD operates and Egypt water share sharply declines, the agriculture sector will
drastically get affected leaving thousands of unemployed farmers and threatening the national
food security. This will result into poverty that could potentially turn into violence.

5.5 Causation
By building and operating the GERD, Ethiopia will have a full control of the Nile River water
flow changing the geopolitics of the region and reducing the water levels flowing to the
downstream countries Egypt and Sudan. This caused deep concerns and threatened the national
security in the two countries particularly since the decade-long tripartite negotiations over a
binding agreement that can secure each country’s interests have failed and reached a deadlock.
30

Hagar Elbarbary

Ethiopia’s ignorance to Egypt and Sudan’s demand of the slow filling of the dam’s
reservoir and the absence of transparency in sharing all the related data of the GERD’s safety
and the reservoir filling scenarios are main factors of fuelling the conflict and pushing the
downstream countries to opt for military options in order to save their water share.

5.6 Strategies
Focusing on each country’s national interests instead of cooperating to share the transboundary
Nile River water has prevented the disputed countries from reaching a mutual agreement
despite all the tactics that have been used by the third parties in an attempt to resolve the conflict.
The third parties have been adopting the preventive diplomacy in their intervention
since the conflict was still nonviolent. They tend to call the conflict parties for series of
negotiations to discuss the mutual interests, however, negotiations turned into bargain due to
each country’s dominance of its national interests.
The second used tactic was the mediation; mediation can help in changing the behaviour
and approach of the conflict parties. The African Union and the United States along with the
World Bank have played the mediator role and they tried to build a cooperation framework to
alter the perceptions of the conflict parties from their focus on their interests to an African
solidarity and cooperation.
Mediation requires the engagement of all parties and actors to reach a mutual solution
and understanding, which was not achievable in most of the times.
The third feasible strategy is the inquiry and conciliation and both of them are based on
fact-gathering and research. In the case of the GERD dispute, the difficulty lies in the lack of
trust between the upper and downstream countries which prevented them from agreeing on the
technical issues and the reports of the GERD operation impacts on both Egypt and Sudan.
Therefore, the conciliation strategy can be applied in a later phase when all the parties start to
acknowledge the importance of the mutual vision and solidarity (Faißt, 2019).

5.7 Perspectives
The CPA tool focuses on explaining each party’s different perspective in a way that could
facilitate the mediation process between them.
In the GERD case what entrenches the conflict is the insistence of each country on the
righteousness of their perspectives. For instance, Ethiopia sees that constructing the dam and
utilizing the Nile water to their benefits is one of their rights that they were not able to enjoy
for a long time due to the British colonial water treaties. Ethiopia guarantees that it would not
cause any harm to the downstream countries and the GERD is just for the country’s
development and energy production. However, the downstream countries (Sudan and Egypt)
are fearful and concerned that their water share might reduce and that Ethiopia will control the
water as long as the three countries are not compelled to a binding agreement on the dam filling
and operation.

Table 1: The three Conflict Parties’ Different Perspectives and Interests through the CPA.
Actors

Ethiopia
. Ethiopia has planned for the
GERD construction since
1960, and it finally announced
the establishment
commencement in 2011

Sudan
. After the sudden announcement,
Sudan favoured the decision
realizing the mutual benefits that it
could gain from the dam, however,
after the overthrow of president
Omar Al Bashir, Sudan aligned
with Egypt in opposing Ethiopia
and seeking a binding agreement
on the dam’s filling and operation.

Egypt
. Egypt received the
announcement while
witnessing a political turmoil
after the 2011 revolution.
Initially it opposed the dam
idea completely, then it
started to engage with
Ethiopia and Sudan in the
negotiation process.

. Nile Water share and the amount
of pure water reduced due to the
sudden filling of the reservoir

Facts

. Taking unilateral decision in
the first filling of the dam’s
reservoir in July 2020 without
prior
agreement
nor
notification to downstream
countries
. Negotiations have been going
on since a decade without any
significant progress towards
the binding agreement.

. Ethiopia’s motivation to
build the GERD is generating
electricity and exporting it to
neighbouring countries to be
the biggest African power hub.
Interests,
Motivation

. In addition, the GERD is
enhancing Prime Minister
Abiy Ahmed’s image as he is
achieving political and
economic development to
Ethiopia (Salama, 2020)
. Ethiopia offered in March
2021 to share the data
regarding the second filling
with the downstream countries,
however both Sudan and Egypt
rejected the offer since it is not
within a binding agreement

Options

. Ethiopia’s foreign minister
declared in a statement on
twitter that the second filling
of the reservoir will be carried
out as scheduled in July 2021
(Gebre & Magdy, 2021)

. Sudan demanded the mediation
and intervention of the African
Union and the European Union to
supervise the tripartite talks

. Even though Sudan is concerned
with its water share and its own
dams’ safety, the GERD would
benefit Sudan in ways such as,
having access to stable water flow
to irrigate their agricultural fields
and to a cheaper electricity

. Egypt did not get affected in
its water share coming from
the Blue Nile in the first
filling of the reservoir
. Egypt on the other hand,
demanded the United States
mediation and in September
2020, the United States
stopped their financial aid to
Ethiopia over the GERD
conflict (BBC, 2020)
. Egypt considers the
existential danger from the
GERD filling and operation
since Egypt is highly
dependent on the Nile water
and any shortage in its water
share would have a serious
impact on the agriculture
sector as well as the
economic one as mentioned
earlier in the impacts section

. Realizing the benefits from the
GERD,
Sudan
is
seeking
negotiations with Ethiopia to
ensure all conflict parties’ rights
without any possible harm
. Both Sudan and Egypt submitted a proposal for resuming the
negotiation and forming a quartet committee consists of the
African Union chair, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the
European Union, the United Nations and the United States, in
order to facilitate the negotiations deadlock, however, Ethiopia
rejected their proposal (Egypt today, 2021)

. After several attempts to resume the negotiations peacefully,
Egyptian president Abdel Fatah El Sisi declared that all options
are open to protect Egypt’s water and both countries carried out a
joint military exercise on April 5th at Merowe military base in
northern Sudan in a step seen to be a preparation for military
intervention if needed (Sabry, 2021)

5.8 Conflict Stages
To understand how the dispute emerged and how it escalated, Glasl’s model explains the
conflict stages through three levels, each level includes three phases.

5.8.1 Level 1: Win-Win
Stage 1: Hardening: when each party’s position solidifies, yet they still believe that the conflict
can still be resolved through negotiations. In the case of the GERD conflict this stage can be
explained after Egypt and Sudan announced their opposition to the GERD construction in 2011,
nevertheless, they agreed to go for the tripartite talks to seek a solution for their dispute.
Stage 2: Debate, polemics: in this stage parties tend to mistrust each other and start to
doubt the other party’s sincerity in finding a mutual resolution. Arguments and debates tend to
escalate into verbal confrontations and the frustration pushes both parties to prove that their
position is the only right position. Parties start to lose hope that debates can lead them to any
fruitful results. In the GERD case this state can be seen after several rounds of the tripartite
negotiation which ended without any significant progress. Both the Egyptian and the Sudanese
sides at that time started to attack Ethiopia verbally when the Egyptian minister of Water
Resources and Irrigation Mohamed Abdel Ati accused Ethiopia with the negotiations’ failure
due to its inexorability and stubbornness. Ethiopia did not accept to guarantee the downstream
countries that filling the reservoir will only depend on the rains. In addition, it does not accept
signing a binding agreement about the mechanism and the operation of the GERD (ABU ZAID,
2021). All this contributed in the escalation of the situation to stage number three.
Stage 3: Actions not words: in this stage parties are convinced that talking is not helpful
anymore, so one party or another starts to take a unilateral action without discussing it with the
others. This is clearly seen when Ethiopia started the first filling of the reservoir in July 2020
despite all the disagreements from both Egypt and Sudan. As a response, the Egyptian ministry
of Irrigation and Land Reclamation issued an objection statement pointing out that “Such act
reflects negative indicators showing that Ethiopia has no desire to achieve a fair agreement
that aligns with the 2015 Declaration of Principles” (Monzer, 2020). Additionally, Sudan was
highly affected with the first filling when the Khartoum State Water Corporation announced
that number of its Nile stations went out of order due to the rapid Nile water decline.
Furthermore, the pure drinking water quantity has reduced as well (Mohyeldeen, 2020).

34

Hagar Elbarbary

5.8.2 Level 2: Lose-Win
Stage 4: Images, Coalitions: the power imbalance becomes prevalent in this stage and there is
only one winner, therefore the other parties start to seek support and make alliance with other
entities. In the GERD case, Egypt and Sudan have been seeking the support of the United States,
the European Union, and the African Union since the negotiations reached a deadlock.
Recently, Egyptian minister of Foreign Affairs Sameh Shoukry conducted a tour to some of
the African countries; South Africa, Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya,
Senegal, and Tunisia to deliver letters from President Abdel Fattah El Sisi to the leaders of
these countries explaining Egypt’s and Sudan’s position from the conflict and gaining these
countries support and alliance against Ethiopia (ABU ZAID, 2021).
Stage 5: Loss of face: In this stage parties completely lose their trust to each other and
they start the direct attack. This considers as a major step in the escalation level. It can be seen
when Ethiopia accused Egypt and Sudan in instigating the ongoing internal violence and civil
war in Ethiopia. On Dec. 29th, 2020, the spokesman of the Ethiopian ministry of affairs stated
in a press conference, “Egypt has turned Ethiopia into a ‘danger zone’ to escape its own
internal problems, as there are tens of thousands of Islamists inside prisons in Egypt … It is
using such matters to avoid internal Egyptian issues and focus its attention on the GERD”
(Magdy, 2021).
In response to Ethiopia, Egypt summoned the Ethiopian envoy to Egypt to clarify Mufti
statement and in the meantime the spokesman of the Egyptian ministry of Foreign Affairs
Ahmed Hafez strongly denounced the Mufti statement as “a blatant transgression and outright
unacceptable, in addition to a flagrant infringement of the commitments enshrined in the
Constitutive Act of the African Union” (Magdy, 2021).
Stage 6: Strategies of threats: In this stage the conflict parties start to threaten the other
party showing them that they have the power to prove these threats. After the failure of the last
round of the negotiations in April 2021 that took place in Kinshasa, Congo, the Egyptian
president Abdel Fatah El Sisi declared in a press conference, “I am telling our brothers in
Ethiopia, let’s not reach the point where you touch a drop of Egypt’s water, because all options
are open”. He continued, “We have witnessed the cost of any confrontation” (Alhadi, 2021).
In addition, the Sudanese Irrigation minister Yasser Abbas also warned Ethiopia saying,
“Sudan stands ready to harden its stance in the dispute and lobby afresh at the highest
international levels. For Sudan, all options are possible, including going to the UN Security
Council and hardening policy if Ethiopia began the second filling of the reservoir without
35

Hagar Elbarbary

agreement” (Alhadi, 2021). Furthermore, Egypt and Sudan have carried out joint military
exercises later in March in a step that is seen as a preparation for a possible war against Ethiopia
(Kalabalik, 2021).
Threats are not only limited to the governmental level, Egyptians are contributing on
social media platforms with the hashtag “#Nile4All” and posts like “I am proudly ready to
volunteer to join the Egyptian army to destroy Ethiopia and its dam” (Mersel, 2020).

5.8.3 Level 3: Lose-Lose
Till now the conflict over the GERD has not entered level three of lose-lose situation, however,
the escalating trend could potentially lead to resort to armed violence driving the conflict into
a lose-lose situation. Potential targets could include an initial disabling air-strike against the
dam infrastructure, impeding power production or the filling up of the dam.
Stage 7: Limited destruction: in this stage parties are less secured due to the threats in
the previous stage and they think that the other party will carry out their threats. A slight
possibility for another round of negotiations cannot be expected. The ultimatum option is still
open as a last resort. A limited disabling air-strike against the GERD dam would be a likely
option.
Stage 8: Total annihilation: the main purpose of this stage is destructing the other party
completely by targeting the key powerful people and decision makers like leaders and political
representatives. This way they would demolish their legitimacy and the system would fall apart.
To achieve this, Egypt and Sudan could also fuel internal conflicts within Ethiopia by arming
certain groups or supporting nonviolent uprisings against the government.
Stage 9: Together into the abyss is the last stage of conflict escalation. The desire to
annihilate the counterpart is extremely strong to the extent that self-defence or the survival
instinct is ignored as long as the other party will get destroyed.

6. Results
Following findings can be pointed out after the previous analysis of the conflict:
-

Although the main actors of the conflict are the three countries, Ethiopia, Sudan and
Egypt, many stakeholders’ countries are getting benefits from the GERD project, such
as China, Israel, Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and
Qatar. In addition to Turkey. Such countries have close ties particularly with Ethiopia
since they are investing millions of dollars in the GERD and they should take a positive
role in mediating between the conflict parties instead of waiting to reap the benefit of
their investments (International Crisis Group Report, 2019).

-

Lack of transparency and trust between the conflict parties turned the negotiations
which started in 2011 from win-win situation and a real possibility for cooperation into
a lose-win situation, as it is shown in the Glasl’s model of escalation. In the lose-win
situation Ethiopia continues to act unilaterally without consideration of Sudan and
Egypt’s demands and concerns.

-

If the situation remains the same without any progress in the negotiation, the conflict
has the potential to descend to level three which is a lose-lose situation where military
options could be considered from the downstream countries against Ethiopia and in this
case the three countries would fail in real abyss and would pay a steep humanitarian
and ecological price.

-

The failure of the tripartite negotiations is not considered as a failure for Ethiopia, since
the country is determined to resume the second filling of the reservoir scheduled in July
2021. Ethiopia has been postponing signing any binding agreements with the
downstream countries and this was one of the main reasons that ignited the conflict.

-

Considering the stakeholders of the GERD project and the countries which contributed
in funding the dam, it is possible to think that the GERD is not merely for Ethiopia’s
economic development. The large dam is going to change the geopolitics of the Middle
East and North Africa since Egypt has been a regional power in the region. Till now,
the Nile River flow to Sudan and Egypt has not been controlled by any of the riparian
countries, however, by building the GERD, Ethiopia would be able to control the flow
of the Nile in which Egypt mainly depends on its water for all aspects of life.

-

The downstream countries are dealing with the GERD as a fact now. Their attitude
turned from opposing the idea and trying to politically sabotage the dam to seeking
ways of compromising and agreeing to a cooperative strategy for managing the Nile
37

Hagar Elbarbary

water. Therefore, with a responsible attitude from Ethiopia in clearly explaining to what
extent the filling of the dam would impact the downstream countries, the three countries
could avoid potential escalated armed conflict in the region.

7. Conclusion and Recommendations
Water scarcity and the exacerbating climate change, along with the unhindered construction of
dams on the transboundary rivers are main factors of the water disputes all over the world.
Some disputes have been managed through cooperative strategies, and others reached a
deadlock where the possibility of armed conflicts is possible such as the Grand Ethiopian
Renaissance Dam case.
The gap between Ethiopia’s persistence in rejecting the downstream countries’
demands and the dire request of Egypt and Sudan for a binding agreement to ensure the absence
of significant harm to their water share and dams’ safety is still wide (International Crisis Group
Report, 2019). If Ethiopia continues to reject the downstream proposals for detailed studies of
the GERD impacts and ways to compromise the reservoir filling period in order to mitigate the
dangers, downstream countries could resort to the armed conflict option which would cause
severe damage to the three countries.
The GERD could be a great opportunity for cooperation between the eleven riparian
countries, not just the three conflicted parties if the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) that has been
formed in 1999 created a framework for equitable water share to benefit from the Blue Nile
and the Nile River water. Egypt withdrew from the NBI after the tension started with Ethiopia
over its announcement of the GERD construction in 2011. The reason for Egypt’s withdrawal
was Ethiopia’s mobilization of the upstream countries to have a new cooperation framework
without the consensus of both Sudan and Egypt. When the downstream countries disagreed to
the new suggested framework and demanded a veto right for any possible projects on the Nile
River, the upstream countries led by Ethiopia rejected the demand and Egypt suspended its
participation. Therefore, for the NBI to start working again in favour of all the riparian
countries, Egypt has to compromise and to join the initiative again in order to reach a mutual
agreement (International Crisis Group Report, 2019).

38

Hagar Elbarbary

The following recommendations could be taken into consideration for a possible resolution to
the current conflict.
External parties such as the World Bank could play a more effective role in resolving the GERD
conflict by applying the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa (CIWA) program. The
program has been implemented for 10 years and it proved its effectiveness in navigating
disputes over transboundary rivers specifically in Africa and helping the involved countries’
governments to share an equitable water rights through a collaborative environment (AR2020
- CIWA program, 2021).
A successful applicable example of the cooperative management of the transboundary
rivers is the Senegal River. The Senegal River is the third longest river in Africa with 1800
kilometres running across Mali, Guinea, Senegal, and Mauritania. Water access in this region
is crucial since the region is afflicted by drought, dense population and poverty and the
dependency on the river water is critical.
The Senegal River Basin Development Authority put into effect a framework to adjust the fair
sharing of the ownership of the infrastructure among the riparian countries (Kenny, 2021). The
Senegal River Basin Development Authority was formed in 1972 after several years of tough
drought and managed to implement a framework that allows all the River Basin countries to
have a shared ownership of the infrastructure including dams that are built on the Senegal River.
The World Bank later in 1980 assisted the Senegal River Basin Development Authority
by integrating the CIWA program in order to help the authority in implementing a sustainable
management for the water reducing the poverty in the region (KOMARA, 2014). However, in
order for such an example to be applied to the GERD conflict, both parties (Ethiopia and the
downstream countries) have to make compromises.
For Ethiopia it has to agree on slowing down the filling process of the reservoir and
submitting a transparent data of the impacts and safety levels of the dam. On the other hand,
Sudan and Egypt have to realize that if a new cooperative framework is to be carried out, it
would be completely different than the colonial era treaty which allowed Egypt and Sudan to
freely enjoy the Nile water share.
Another recommendation could be using solar and wind power in the dry seasons which
generate great concerns to the downstream countries. The GERD’s reservoir is designed to be
filled during the rainy seasons and it would be empty in the dry seasons, releasing the
accumulated water in a stable flow through the year and thus generating power all over the
year. This mechanism would greatly affect the natural flow of the river water since Ethiopia
will be controlling the flow. Consequently, averting the natural flow of the river, not only
39

Hagar Elbarbary

would affect the ecological system, but also will have large impact on the water amount
reserved in the Egyptian Aswan High Dam (AHD) and its power generation. Amid Ethiopia’s
refusal to ensure the mitigations of filling the reservoir, both Sudan and Egypt’s concerns
increase. However, an applicable solution in this case is utilising solar and wind power as
alternative sources.
During the dry seasons, both the sun and the wind are strong in Ethiopia, Sudan and other
riparian countries. Thus, it could be possible to generate solar and wind electricity during the
dry seasons when producing hydropower from the GERD is less than its expected average in
the rainy seasons. In this case, the solar and wind power could be implemented on a common
region between Ethiopia and Sudan. It could also be supervised by the Eastern African Power
Pool which established in 2005 to develop the clean energy systems in the East Africa region.
Furthermore, an electricity-based agreement between the three conflicted countries could
be reached and it could achieve a win-win situation for all the parties. The idea of generating
solar and wind power would compensate generating power from the GERD in the dry seasons,
which would allow both Sudan and Egypt to receive more or normal water flow during these
dry seasons. This way, Ethiopia would produce energy the whole year and would achieve its
dream of being the largest African power hub. On the other hand, Sudan and Egypt’s concerns
about water flow reduction in case of drought would be relived. In addition, Egypt would not
need to adjust the Aswan High Dam operation (Sterl, 2021).

7.1 Limitations of the Study
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict analysis was limited to applying the conflict
analysis tools. However, a direct data collection approach such as interviewing stakeholders
and governmental officials in the upstream country Ethiopia, along with farmers and officials
from the ministry of Irrigation in both Sudan and Egypt would have made the analysis more
fruitful and thorough. The interviews would have reflected the real concerns of the people in
the affected downstream countries.
