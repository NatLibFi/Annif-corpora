Abstract
The purpose of this research is to establish the influence of Finnish customers’ privacy
concerns on their online purchase intentions and behaviour. It seeks to establish how
Finland-based online retailers’ customer interaction management, exposure management,
and information management affect customers’ online purchase intentions and behaviour.
This is on the back of an increase in the importance of online retailing as a strategy for
businesses. Drawing from Perceived Risk Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action and Theory
of Planned Behaviour, the study’s conceptual framework presents the relationship between
customer sense of privacy and online shopping intention and behaviour as associated with
online shoppers’ privacy concerns relating to Interaction Management, Information
Management and Exposure. Customers were expected to participate in online shopping when
they feel that their privacy is being respected and the possibility of negative consequences is
low. Using a questionnaire with a combination of closed questions requiring Likert scalebased responses and open questions, a cross-sectional survey was administered over the
internet. Data was collected from a convenience sample of 60 online shoppers. Correlation
analysis was conducted to determine strength of association between demographic factors
and online behaviour; and between aspects of online intentions and behaviour, and
perceptions of risks associated with interaction management, exposure management, and
information management.
The findings showed no statistically significant association between demographic factors
and online shopping intentions and behaviour. While security issues featured under
interaction management and exposure management, they do not feature among the top three
factors identified by respondents as influencing their intention not to buy or their decision to
buy online. The findings suggest that although respondents may be aware of risks associated
with online shopping, these do not influence their buying intentions and decisions. The study
established that security and privacy factors do not have significant influence on the
behaviour of Finland online shoppers. The findings are not a major departure from what has
been reported by other studies. They however highlight areas whose improvement would
reduce concerns of online shoppers. Recommendations are made on how Finland’s online
shopping service providers could improve customer experience of interaction, exposure, and
information management to decrease their perceptions of risk exposure and positively
influence their online shopping behaviour. The study’s findings will therefore contribute
towards guiding Finland’s online shopping providers on implementing privacy sensitive
online marketing strategies. The study has limitations relating to the period of data
collection, its sample size and its predominantly quantitative nature. It is recommended that
these limitations be addressed by future studies through conducting longitudinal surveys and
collect data from bigger samples to validate what was observed in this exploratory
investigation.

Chapter 1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Online shopping is electronic shopping which allows people to buy products through accessing
supplier websites over the internet. Online shopping developed on the back of the advent of,
first the internet, then of interactive websites and finally of the ability to securely transmit data
and to pay online. Initially, online shopping was largely limited to the sale of generic products
but, over time, it has spread to almost any product and has seen a growth in a number of online
shoppers with the actual statistics changing rapidly. That notwithstanding, online shoppers
have been categorised based on their motivations. Zinkan (2011) identified four categories as
those who shopped online because i) they want convenience; ii) they are searching for variety;
iii) they are balanced buyers that weigh their options, and iv) store-oriented shoppers following
a specific brand. Because online businesses are operated without limits in terms of time and
location and thus enabling consumers to access different “shops” at a click, they are able to
address the needs of all the categories of online shoppers. In spite of this, there are some
advantages and disadvantages associated with online shopping.
1.2

Advantages of Online Shopping

A number of advantages of online shopping have been highlighted (Aziz & Wahid, 2018).
Major advantages of online shopping can be summarised as convenience, information
availability, price comparability and benefiting from reviews of earlier purchasers.
Convenience is arguably the most frequently cited advantage of online shopping because
transactions can be conducted any time and from anywhere. The ability of suppliers to deliver
purchased items, making it possible for them to be picked from the nearest outlet and to handle
return of undesired merchandise strengthened the element of convenience (Hsiao, MingHsiung, 2009).
Online shopping has eliminated traditional consumer shopper inconveniences of traditional
shopping such as battling crowds, standing in long checkout lines, and fighting for parking
spaces at busy malls. Through the online process, the customers learn about product variation
and classification from any location. Through online shopping, comprehensive product
information is more readily accessible which enables a customer to make a more informed
purchase decision. Another advantage is that information about the user-friendliness or other
positive or negative features of a product can be accessed from reviews posted by earlier
purchasers. Prices of similar or related products can also be accessed by the click of a button
which makes price comparisons more efficient than having to physically move from shop to
shop to compare product features and prices (Chung, 2017; Jiang, 2017).
1.3

Disadvantages of online shopping

Despite the advantages, there are a number of disadvantages associated with online shopping.
The whole process is based on trust that the paid for product will be delivered, that it will meet
the specifications, that the return policy will be respected, and that the personal data provided
at the point of purchase will not be abused, among other aspects. Lack of trust has been cited
as an area of concern among online shoppers (Farhana, Khan, & Noor, 2017). The preeminence of trust emanates from risks associated with online shopping (George et al., 2015;
Bhatti, Saad, & Gbadebo, 2018). The risks include fraud, privacy and security breach. For
example, Jordan, Leskovar and Marič (2018) studied the impact of the fear of identity theft and

Silve Akter
perceived risk on online purchase intentions and found fear of financial loss and reputational
damage to be positively related to perceived risk of engaging in online shopping. Also focusing
on risks of online shopping, Samadi and Yaghoob-Nemadi (2009) found shoppers to perceive
more purchasing risk when purchasing online than when purchasing in-store. Aziz and Wahid
(2018) found online shoppers to be reluctant to give out their credit card details due to privacy
and security concerns.
Concerns over privacy have been covered by a number of studies (Acquisti, Taylor, &
Wagman, 2016; Acquisti et al., 2017). Privacy has been interpreted as “the protection of
someone’s personal space and their right to be left alone … the control over and safeguarding
of personal information.” (Acquisti, Taylor, & Wagman, 2016, p.443 citing Warren &
Brandeis, 1890 and Westin, 1967 respectively). Personal data provided by customers during
online shopping is private and the intention is not for it to be used by the retailer to derive
additional benefits, such as pushing advertisements of other products to the purchaser or
sharing the information with third parties.
1.4

Area of research- Privacy in online shopping in Finland

Finland has witnessed a surge in the number of online shops and shoppers Expat Finland
(2019). This is largely due to the convenience of being able to search for and access services
and products without having to visit the stores in person; product and service quality;
competitive pricing; and security (Agyapong, 2018). Finnish customers have, however,
recently become more conscious about privacy measures regarding online shopping (Privacy
Shield, 2019). Concerns have been raised over privacy issues among online shoppers.
Agyapong (2018) found that most Finnish customers were reluctant to make purchases online
for fear of their personal information being abused. The perception is not unfounded. Acquisti,
Taylor and Wagman (2016) argue that consumers have a basis for being concerned because of
the prevalence of unauthorized commercial use of their private information. Clear
understanding of the customers’ online shopping behaviour, including their reservations, helps
the marketing companies to make predictions about customer online shopping practices
and demand.
1.5

Overall aim and research questions

This study examines how the privacy concerns of customers have been protected by business
organisations providing online shopping services in Finland. The purpose of the research is to
establish the influence of Finnish customers’ privacy concerns on their online purchase
intentions and behaviour. Through a better understanding of the web shopper’s online purchase
intention, web retailers may be able to increase their customer base. Although purchasing
online has been associated with a number of benefits, as already alluded to, it still remains a
small part of internet usage partly because of the risks associated with it. Analysts expect
online purchases to increase dramatically when consumers feel convinced and secure about
their purchases and protection of their privacy (Expat Finland, 2019). While there are a number
of risks associated with online shopping, recognising and providing for consumer privacy has
become a critical imperative for business organisations and for online websites. The study,
therefore, seeks to answer the question:
How does interaction management, exposure management and information management affect
Finnish customers’ online purchase intentions and behaviour?

Rationale of the Research Topic

Online shopping is a growing part of the internet presenting a number of growth opportunities
for businesses and benefits for shoppers. In 2016, it was estimated that 58.3% of internet users
at a global level had purchased something online, with this projected to grow by 63% by 2019
and to 65% by 2021 (Clement, 2020). Projected figures are likely to change as a result of the
outbreak of Covid-19. Recent studies have indicated an increase in online shopping (Donthu
& Gustafsson, 2020; Seetharaman, 2020). In Finland, Eriksson and Stenius (2020) noted a shift
towards online grocery shopping. In 2019, online shopping was estimated to account for just
over 13% of global retail sales with a projected growth to 17.5% (Chow, 2019). This clearly
shows a sustained growth trajectory. A 2018 EU survey indicated that in the 12 months before
the survey, 70% of internet users had purchased something for private use online. In Finland,
the figure was just under 70% for 2013 and 70% for 2018. Among reasons for not buying
online, 25% of the survey participants cited apprehension over privacy or security of paying
online (Eurostat, 2019). While doing online shopping, the e-commerce site or the respective
business organisation obtains information about individual customers. Finnish customers have
recently become more conscious about privacy measures regarding online shopping (Privacy
Shield, 2019). While a clear understanding of the customer’s online shopping behaviour helps
the marketing and management authority to make predictions about the online shopping
practices and future demand, there have been concerns regarding violation of customers’
privacy. Tsai et al. (2011) found that when an online retailer’s privacy policy is more salient
and accessible, shoppers are more willing to pay premium prices for purchasing from the
website that protects their privacy. Such a website is perceived as reducing the shoppers’
exposure to the risk of violation of their privacy. Addressing customer privacy concerns
therefore benefits both the online retailer and the shopper.
Given that online retailing is increasingly becoming an important strategy for businesses,
findings of this study will contribute towards guiding implementation of privacy sensitive
online marketing strategies. While there are many security risks associated with online
shopping, this study limits itself to risks related to customer privacy. Further, the study limits
itself to customer experiences of their shopping from Finland-based online retailers.
This thesis is in six sections. The next five sections are: a review of relevant literature on online
privacy issues related to online shoppers in general and those specific to Finland; methodology
and methods used to select participants, and to collect and analyse data; analysis of research
findings, discussion of the findings in the context of other studies; study’s contribution and
recommendations, and study limitations ans areas for further research. The structure is
summarised in Figure 0.1.

2 Theoretical Framework
With a high level of broadband penetration, Finland has a strong and growing eCommerce
ecosystem, with 84% of the population shopping online (privacyshield.gov). Although many
Finns view shopping online as convenient, cheaper and giving them access to a broader range
of products and services, there are growing concerns over issues of privacy, security, and trust
as relates to the exploitation of customer data (Agyapong, 2018). The concerns are not
unfounded as there have been incidents of customer information being leaked, stolen, sold or
amended by online shopping platforms for their own benefit (Portilla, 2018; Liu, et al., 2008;
Carlos Roca, et al., 2009). Increased sophistication in ways of collecting, storing, mining and
trading of consumer data has raised concerns over online privacy (Bandara, Fernando, & Akter,
2020). Finland is no exception in this regard, as customer privacy is a major concern in the
modern era and it affects customers’ behaviour during online purchases. This chapter reviews
relevant literature on customer privacy in general, legislation affecting customer privacy in
Finland, measures of customer privacy, customer online shopping intentions and behaviour,
and theories explaining the association between customer privacy and online shopping
intentions and behaviour. It focuses on customer privacy awareness and concerns and their
association with customer online shopping intentions and behaviour. The chapter concludes
by presenting a conceptual and theoretical framework for understanding the association
between privacy and customer online purchase intentions and behaviour.

2.1

Customer Privacy

In online shopping, customer privacy concerns have been identified as the prime risk factor
because, in order to give customers a personal experience, online shopping platforms need to
collect private data of the customers, such as their date of birth, income, children, spouses,
names, addresses, favourite colours, favourite places, favourite foods, personal preferences,
and so on (Ko et al., 2014; Javadi et al., 2012). Privacy is, however, a multi-disciplinary
concept which makes it also have multiple definitions. Concepts that have been viewed as an
integral part of privacy include secrecy, security, confidentiality, anonymity, autonomy and
liberty (Pelteret & Ophoff, 2016).
Tavani (2008) defines privacy from four perspectives: accessibility, decisional, psychological
and informational. Accessibility privacy is one’s freedom from physical intrusion. Decisional
privacy refers to one’s freedom to make choices without any interference. Psychological
privacy refers to freedom from interference with one’s personal identity and thoughts.
Informational privacy refers to being in control of one’s personal information and to limit
access to the same. Tavani’s (2008) informational perspective of privacy is more appropriate
for the current study, as it focuses on personal information and its use. From the same
perspective Stone, Gueutal, Gardner, and McClure (1983, p.460) define information privacy
as “the ability of the individual to control personally (vis-a-vis other individuals, groups,
organisations, etc.) information about one's self.” Westin (1967, p. 7 cited in Pelteret & Ophoff,
2016) defines it as the claim that individuals, groups or institutions have to decide for
themselves “when, how and to what extent information about them is conveyed to others.”
Eastlick et al. (2006) define privacy as “the capacity of an individual to control, manage, and
selectively reveal personal information.”
According to Acquisti (2004), in an information society the self is in fact expressed, defined,
and affected through information and information technology. The information world,
however, presents challenges relating to information privacy, the main one being that the same
technology that facilitates easy sharing of personal information is also responsible for its abuse
as “once information is captured electronically for whatever purpose, it is greased and ready to
go for any purpose” (Moor, 1997, p. 28). To that end, technology that facilitates sharing of
personal information can be a menace as once shared one loses control of the information in
terms of the speed at which it is shared and the length of its retention period (Tavani, 2008).
Another challenge is that the boundaries between private and public information are blurred
since although people desire information privacy, they are not averse to sharing personal
information as part of accessing services (Pelteret & Ophoff, 2016). Information is shared on
the assumption that the service provider will keep it private.

2.1.1

Privacy perceptions, risks and concerns

Consumers will share information based on their perceptions of the possibility of the
information being made public. Privacy perceptions refer to the consumer’s willingness to
share information over the internet as part of the process of a service or concluding a purchase
(Belanger, Hiller & Smith, 2002). The perceptions are therefore linked to deemed privacy risks
in a given situation.
Privacy risk refers to the possibility of customer data falling in the hands of the wrong people
and being used to the detriment of the customer. It arises when personal information is collected

Silve Akter
without the owner’s consent and using collected information for purposes other than what the
provider of the information had intended (Brüseke, 2016). Online service providers collect
personal data on customers for various uses, including tracking their shopping habits, although
in some situations the collected data is inappropriately used. Incidents where customer
information was leaked, sold, stolen, or altered by the online shopping platforms for their own
benefits and profits illustrates privacy risks associated with online shopping (Liu, et al., 2008;
Carlos Roca, et al., 2009). Where privacy risks are perceived as high, customers have concerns
relating to issues such as secondary use of information, identity theft, data breaches and
security.
Secondary use of information relates to a situation where information given by a customer for
one purpose is later used for another purpose whether with or without the knowledge and/or
consent of the information provider. Organisations collect a large amount of consumer data
which they then subject to different forms of analysis to generate patterns used for decision
making; hence the concept of ‘big data’ (Pelteret & Ophoff, 2016). Although big data is used
positively in a number of instances, it has also been used in a manner that violates individual
privacy. Websites track user behaviour in the process collecting data used to, among other
things, profile users for purposes of targeted marketing (Xu, Luo, Carroll & Rosson, 2011),
price discrimination and price-based targeting (Han-nak, Soeller, Lazer, Mislove, & Wilson,
2014). This has raised controversy over who owns data derived from processing an individual’s
data from different sources and, therefore, has a right to prescribe or determine its uses
(Rubinstein, 2013) and customers’ privacy concerns over the use of their data. This
notwithstanding, perceived benefits from secondary use of information have been found to
outweigh privacy concerns (Pelteret & Ophoff, 2016). Where this is the situation, customers
whose perception is that the secondary use of their data is to their advantage can be expected
to have online shopping intentions and to engage in online shopping. The situation can be
expected to be different for customers who suspect that there could be identity theft or data and
security breaches.
Identity theft refers to deliberately using another’s identity for purposes of achieving personal
gain without his consent, such as using a victim’s details in dealings with banks, for example
opening new accounts or transacting on an existing account; combining someone’s stolen
information with fictional information to create a false identity; and accessing medical services.
Another use of stolen identity is in the commission of crimes where the victim’s details are
given to law enforcers at a crime scene (Pelteret & Ophoff, 2016).
Data breach occurs when an individual’s personal data are made accessible to third parties
without prior authorisation of the data owner. Stolen data can be used for the same purposes as
those under identity theft. The data can also be sold to spammers. Widely publicised data
breaches include those experienced by Sony and Ashley Madison. Data breaches can strain
the relationship between a customer and an organisation. It can be expected that where the
likelihood of such a breach is perceived to be high, a customer may be reluctant to engage in
online transactions with the affected organisation (Chakraborty, Lee, Bagchi-Sen, Upadhyaya,
& Rao, 2016).
Security in the context of online shopping refers to the customers’ subjective opinion that their
personal or financial information will not be stolen (that is, it will remain private) by outside
parties during the transaction. Security risk, therefore, refers to possible loss of money if one’s
credit card or bank details are hacked. When conducting online shopping customers provide
details such as home address, e-mail address, telephone number, and credit or debit card details
and these can be stolen by hackers, thus exposing the customers to the risk of losing money

Silve Akter
from their bank account (Robinson & Surya, 2019; Kumar, 2016; Ling & Yazdanifard, 2014).
Consumers, therefore, have concerns regarding disclosure of their personal information
through transacting with online vendors (Aziz &Wahid, 2018).
Ensuring a customer’s privacy is critical for online transactions, as it signifies the integrity of
the transaction and affects customer choices in terms of engaging or not engaging in online
shopping. Aggarwal and Rahul (2018 citing Liu et al., 2008) argue that the security of privacy
signifies transaction integrity and, accordingly, affects transaction choices. In a related study,
AL-Shukri (2019) found that protecting customer personal information and providing secured
payment options were important aspects of web security and privacy protection. It further
found that as individuals spends more money online and increase their knowledge and
experience, they become more concerned about securing their personal and financial
information. The study, however, did not reveal the extent to which the study respondents take
action to secure their personal and financial information.
According to Aggarwal and Rahul (2018), transaction security variables include a shopping
site’s ability to protect customers’ credit card or any other bank details, personal buying
information, contact details such as email address and to protect against having their details
used illegally. Further, they include having a trustworthy website that makes the customers feel
safe in transacting with it. The first four variables can be viewed as variables of the construct
privacy. The last two variables can be viewed as resulting from the first four relating to privacy.
Although Aggaewal and Rahul (2018) include trust as a dimension of security, for purposes of
the current study this has been found unsuitable as trust as a construct has several other
dimensions that are not necessarily linked to privacy and security.
It can be expected that when customers feel that a service or product provider protects their
privacy, they develop a sense of security, and become more likely to have online shopping
intentions or to engage in online shopping.
2.1.2

Institutions and Privacy Concerns

According to privacy-related literature, information privacy can be protected through
individual self-protection, self-regulation within an industry and through government
legislation (Xu, Teo, Tan & Agarwal, 2012). In the case of individual self-protection, the self
is the agent of control but deriving its ability to control from opportunities presented, such as
the opportunity to accept or reject some proposed actions on a website. Control through selfregulation or government depends on these exerting pressure, in the case of government,
through legislation, to restrain abuse of personal information. Xu, Dinev, Smith and Hart
(2011) explored the connection between individuals’ privacy perceptions and institutional
privacy assurances. They concluded that an individual’s awareness of institutional privacy
assurances, such as privacy policies and Industry self-regulation contribute to reduction of
individual privacy concerns. To that end, privacy concerns are influenced by institutional
factors such as existence of organisational privacy policies and engaging in self-regulatory
initiatives.
Although institutions’ protection of customer personal information and providing secured
payment options are important aspects of web security and privacy protection, it is not clear
whether online shoppers take necessary care, on their end, to secure their financial and personal
information (AL-Shukri, 2019). This goes to the subject of customer awareness not only of
privacy issues but of mechanisms available that are meant to reduce their risk exposure to

Silve Akter
detrimental effects of privacy issues. Lim (2003 cited in Brüseke, 2016) found that although
online vendors provide privacy terms and conditions meant to alert customers of how their data
will be used, only 10% of customers read the terms and conditions. Explanations for this
phenomenon hinge on the user friendliness of the privacy policies usually presented as small
print consent forms. Nejad, Graux and Collarana (2019) suggest that users ignore the consent
forms because of their length and complexity. Where users do not ignore them, they accept
conditions given without reading so that they may be consenting to policies that are not aligned
to legal provisions. Institutional provisions meant to make customers aware of privacy issues
do not seem to be used by most customers.
2.1.3

Customer Privacy Awareness

Privacy awareness refers to one’s alertness to the possibility of one’s private data being made
publicly available or accessible to non-approved third parties. Studies have shown that
although consumers are aware of privacy risks and of mechanisms in place to protect them,
they nevertheless engage in online behaviours that leave them exposed to risks related to
privacy (Baruh et al., 2017; Kokolakis, 2017). Consumer behaviour that is contrary to their
privacy attitudes and concerns is widely termed the privacy paradox (Bandara et al., 2020;
Dienlin & Trepte, 2015). According to Bandara et al. (2020), it is insufficient to assume that
because a consumer is aware of privacy risks and the necessary precautions to take, the
consumer would necessarily act in a rational manner to avoid risks. They instead suggest that
the strength of the privacy concerns – privacy behaviour relationship must be understood from
a context that goes beyond economic and rational thinking to include factors such as the
psychological distance of privacy, state of privacy empowerment, and perceived social
contracts of privacy. Although Bandara et al. (2020) present a compelling model for
understanding consumer privacy-related actions, for purposes of this study it is expected that
consumer awareness leads to informed planned behaviour and reasoned action. In the case of
online shopping in Finland, consumer privacy concerns will be expected to be found linked to
individual awareness of the risks associated with business’s non-adherence to industry best
practices and government legislation relating to data protection and security.
2.2

Finland Legislation in Relation to Online Shopping

Finland is part of the European Union and is therefore contingent upon its General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) that went into effect on May 25, 2018. Before this, it was
subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR)
entered into in May 2016. GDPR is applicable to any service and organisation in Europe that
collects or processes personal data. At its core is giving internet users the right to regain control
over their personal data (Urban et al. 2018).
2.2.1

General data Protection Regulation

GDPR requirements relevant to this study are those relating to transparency, data protection
and consent.
With regard to transparency, Article 12 of the GDPR makes it mandatory for anyone who
processes personal data to inform the individual owner of the data (the data subject) about the
fact and to present the said information in “a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily
accessible form, using clear and plain language.” This can be in the form of a privacy policy.
Because Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are classified as personal data within the EU, every
website and its underlying web server which processes the addresses is mandated to provide

Silve Akter
the privacy policy information. IP addresses are binary values used to drive the movement of
data over the Internet (APNIC, 2020). The information that needs to be provided includes
contact details, purposes and legal basis for the processing, and the data owner’s rights
concerning access, amendment and removal of their data. Every website is therefore supposed
to have a privacy policy in keeping with the transparency requirements.
2.2.2

Data Protection

Data protection is supposed to be by design and by default. According to Article 25,
organisations that process personal data are required to have in place adequate technical and
organisational mechanisms for effectively implementing data protection principles with due
consideration of best practices ensuring that personal data is automatically not accessible. The
onus is on the processing organisation to make user data inaccessible without their intervention.
In the case of consent, Article 6 requires that the processing of personal data is only lawful
under any one of the following situations: when processing serves the legitimate interests
either the controller or a third party; involves compliance a legal requirement; and when the
owner of the data has granted informed consent. According to the GDPR, when collecting
information online that can be used for individual identification this has to be done with the
consent of the individual concerned. This affects the use of many forms of cookies and hence
users within EU were notified to submit approvals for data collection. Cookies are packets of
data or information received by a computer which it sends back without alteration (Norton,
2020). When someone visits a website, that website sends the cookie to the person’s computer
which then stores it in a file located in the web browser (ibid.). The cookie enables the website
to track a person’ activity and visits.
In terms of implementation of the regulations, Degeling’s et al. (2018) periodic survey of top
500 sites established that by 25 May 2018, about 15.7% of websites had reorganised privacy
policies. The investigation by Urban et al. (2018) of cookie synchronisation found that GDPR
cookie consents are inadequate to foil personal data leakages. Hu and Sastry (2019) examined
GDPR using real users’ browsing histories over a period focusing on third party cookies. They
found that to a large extent the relationship between website operators and users is still tilted
in favour of website operators, suggesting that in practical terms GDPR does not deliver the
intended level of protection. That notwithstanding, Degeling et al. (2018) posit that the
regulations have made the web more transparent, although there is still absence of both
functional and usable mechanisms to enable users to agree or refuse processing of their
personal data on the Internet.
2.2.3

Previous related work on Finland

Given the legal rights of customers in Finland as enshrined in GDPR and in the Finland Data
Protection Act, the researcher is not aware of any recent study seeking to establish how
customer privacy affects the online purchase intentions and behaviours of Finnish consumers.
The extent to which customers are aware of legislation relating to their privacy and them
playing their role by exploiting the provisions provided for in the legislation and in industry
practices can be expected to give them an increased sense of security, feeling safe, leading to
them developing online purchase intentions and engaging in online purchasing behaviour.
Bandara et al. (2020) however, note that although online consumers often express discontent
and concern over their privacy, they rarely take adequate precautions and continue disclosing
personal information, a practice that has been labelled as the privacy paradox. This suggests

Silve Akter
that the relationship between awareness of institutional and legal provisions relating to privacy
and a consumer’s online shopping intentions and behaviour may not be that simplistic.
In a study focusing on Finland, Sirkkunen (2015) analysed Finnish internet user attitudes
towards online privacy with the intention of establishing what Finns think about safeguarding
their privacy online. The analysis focused on people’s general conceptions of privacy and its
significance in society and the conventions and practices people use in addressing online
related privacy issues. The findings indicated that people try to preserve their privacy through
use of different passwords, erasing search histories, turning down invitations to accept cookies
and keeping away from services they feel have insufficient safeguards.

2.3

Online Purchase Intention and Behavior

Purchase intention refers to a purchasers’ objective or plan to make a purchase regardless of
whether or not they need to buy the item (Kian, Loong, & Fong, 2018; Ooi, 2014). The
intention is backed by the purchaser having the capacity to purchase. Purchase intention is
therefore a salient predictor of proceeding with a purchasing transaction (He et al., 2008 cited
in Lim et al., 2016). Studies have shown that purchase intention does not always translate into
action (Kim & Jones, 2009; Roca et al., 2009 cited in Lim et al., 2016).
Behaviour is the visible response to a given target in a given situation. Unlike intention,
behaviour can be seen. Online purchasing or shopping behaviour therefore refers to the actions
of purchasers as they go about making online purchases. Studies have highlighted a number of
explanations for the way consumers behave online (Pandey & Parmar, 2019a; Pandey &
Parmar, 2019b; Nawi, Mamun, Hamsani, & Muhayiddin, 2019; Fortes & Rita, 2016; Karimi,
Papamichail & Holland, 2015). Some factors that have been found to affect consumer online
behaviour include individual socio-economic characteristics, previous online shopping
experience, knowledge of using internet and computer, website design, situational factors,
facilitating conditions and payment options (Pandey & Parmar, 2019b).
2.3.1

Individual socio-economic factors

Age, gender, income and education level have been associated with online shopping behaviour.
Studies have associated learning computer skills with age, with younger people portrayed as
more likely to acquire the skills and therefore to be more comfortable with using the internet
and to engage in online shopping (Zhang, 2009 cited in Hernández, Jiménez, & Martín, 2011).
Others have portrayed older consumers as lacking computer skills, being resistant to change
and lacking experience in use of information technology (Trocchia & Janda, 2000 cited in
Hernández et al., 2011) and therefore less likely to participate in online shopping. Nawi et al.
(2019) found that in Malaysia, the age of shoppers had a significant effect on online shopper
behaviour. In a study focused on China, Gong, Stump and Maddox (2013) identified age among
significant predictors of online shopping intention. Other studies have however refuted this
view based on that with the progression of time, what used to be young online shoppers during
the early stages of online shopping are now in their 40s (Hernández et al., 2011). Age – online
shopping behaviour relationship studies have therefore presented mixed results.
Some studies have associated engaging in online shopping with gender. The view is based a
perception that compared to women, mean are more pragmatic while welcome are anxious
when faced by new activities and tend to be influenced by their immediate environment (Sun
& Zhang, 2006 cited in Hernández et al., 2011). Other studies have however found no
statistically significant difference in internet use between men and women (Zhang, 2005; Shin,
2009 cited in Hernández et al., 2011) that could be extended to participating in online shopping.

Silve Akter
Level of income has been associated with differences in online purchase behaviour (Gong et
al., 2013). Having higher levels of income has been linked to perceiving lower levels of risk in
participating in online shopping (Hernández, Jiménez, & Martín, 2011). Mishra (2016) found
individual level of income to influence purchase behaviour for some income levels, and also
for some products and not for others. Mishra (2015) found that shopping for necessary products
was not affected by levels of income.
Studies have associated level of education with online shopping behaviour. The influence of
education on online shopping behaviour however, seems to vary. Although level of education
has been identified among predictors of online shopping in China, (Gong et al., 2013), in a
Nigeria focused study Mbah, Odike and Akpan (2019) found no relationship between the two.
Focusing on Germany, Burkolter and Kluge (2011) found highley educated participants to
engage more in online shopping.
Findings on the influence of socio-economic factors on online shopping behaviour seem mixed
and region specific. In a Saudi Arabia based study, Ansari (2018) found customers’ sociocultural factors to have a significant influence on online shopping behaviour. In a Spain based
study, Hernández, et al. (2011) concluded that socio-economic factors did not explain the
behaviour of online shoppers.
2.3.2

Online shopping experience

Online shopping experience refers to the amount of time an individual has been involved in
online shopping. Studies have shown mixed results of the influence of online shopping
experience on online shopping behaviour. According to Soopramanien (2011), consumer’s
intention to shop online is positively influenced by their experience with online shopping as it
reduces their scepticism and perceptions of related risks. Other studies have found online
shopping experience not to reduce customers’ perceived risks associated with the activity
(Mortimer, Fazal e Hasan, Andrews, & Martin, 2016). Brosdahl and Almousa (2013) suggest
that situational factors, specifically cultural differences could explain differing results on the
influence of online shopping experience on shoppers’ perceptions of risks in online shopping.
That may indicate that amount of online shopping experience does not necessarily result in
lower perceptions of risk.
2.3.2.1 Facilitating conditions
Facilitating conditions for online shopping intentions and behaviour among customers include
payment methods and website features and security. Payment options have been found among
factors that influence online shopping intention and behaviour (Guo, Ling, & Liu, 2012).
Payment methods affect consumer perceptions of financial risks while conducting online
shopping. Previous studies have highlighted fear of payment related risks as an influencing
factor on online shopping intentions and behaviour (Abrar, Naveed, & Ramay, 2017).
Assurance of security and confidentiality influence online shoppers’ choice of payment
methods and their online shopping behaviour (Tounekti, Ruiz-Martínez, & Gómez, 2019).
Other studies have found that although financial risk has a negative impact on online shopping
behaviours, the impact is not significant (Wai, Dastane, Johari, & Ismail, 2019). Despite
perceived risks of online payment methods, statistics seem to indicate that the risk perceptions
do not stop online shoppers from using them. According to a 2017 survey, the most preferred
method of payment during online shopping is the credit card (42%) followed by electronic
payment through Paypal where available (39%) (Clement, 2020). A 2018 survey in Finland

Silve Akter
found that the most preferred method of paying for online shopping is online banking (38%),
with cards being the second preferred (25%) (Statista, 2020).
Website features include content quality, transactions quality, design quality, and customers’
perceived security (Alipoor & Moradkhani, 2017). Website functionality has been found to
have a positive impact on customer satisfaction (Tandon, Kiran, & Sah, 2017) and a positive
influence on online shopping behaviour (Alipoor & Moradkhani, 2017). Website functionality
includes handling of confidential customer information and ensuring its privacy.
Fortes and Rita (2016) identified privacy risks as a factor in customer online purchasing
behaviour. Privacy concerns arise from a website’s handling of its interaction with shoppers,
and how information submitted is managed and protected against exposure to third parties.
Although the association of online purchase intention and behaviour with individual socioeconomic factors, experience shopping online and facilitating conditions varies across different
studies, concern over privacy risks relating to personal information is a common feature.
2.4

Customer intention, exposure and information management

Privacy risks arising from a website’s handling of shoppers’ personal information obtained
during interaction in the purchasing process influence consumer online shopping intentions
and behaviour. Privacy risks faced by online shoppers relate to their ability to manage the
interaction process, the information they share with a website (Hong & Thong, 2013) and the
extent of exposure of the shared information to third parties (Terlizzi et al., 2019).
2.4.1

Interaction Management

Interaction management refers to “the ability of an individual to manage the collection and
subsequent use of his or her personal information by websites” (Terlizzi et al., 2019, p.3).
Interaction occurs when a customer connects with an online service provider responding to
questions requiring various information on the customer. Interaction management addresses a
customer’s concerns regarding the extent to which he or she remains in control of the personal
information collected during the interaction and whether at the point of interaction he or she
has a say on how it is used (Malhotra et al., 2004). Through the online provider’s interaction
management, the customer formulates a perception of whether or not his or her personal
information is secure enough to preserve his privacy. Smith et al. (1996) and Hong and Thong
(2013) measure interactional management through customer concerns regarding the amount of
their personal information requested and collected by websites, and concerns on the
information being used for other purposes without their consent.
2.4.2

Exposure Management

Exposure management refers to an individual’s consciousness about existing controls that
mitigate the risks of personal data loss” (Terlizzi et al., 2019, p.11). It concerns the customer’s
level of perceived control over how his or her data may be used and awareness of privacy issues
relating to the data. Customer control of personal information refers to his or her right to
autonomously control decisions on collection of personal information and its use. When
control is reduced or lost, there is invasion of privacy and control is lost. Awareness comes
from a website having a clear online privacy policy that makes the customer both aware and
knowledgeable regarding how it will use his or her information and that discloses how the data
is collected, processed, and utilised (Hong & Thong, 2013).

Silve Akter

2.4.3

Information Management

Information management refers to “an individual’s perception of how websites handle personal
data” (Terlizzi et al., 2019, p.11). It is concerned with how customer information will be
managed in terms of correction of errors and guarding against improper use of provided
information. Where errors are concerned, information management relates to commercial
websites ensuring that stored personal information is error free, that where this is not the case
there are procedures for correcting errors, and that time and effort are put into ensuring
information accuracy (Hong & Thong, 2013). In the case of improper use or access, this refers
to commercial websites containing personal information being protected from unapproved
access, more time and effort being devoted to ensuring that there is no unapproved access to
personal information and ensuring requisite steps are taken to ensure that no unauthorized
people access personal information stored in their computer systems (Hong & Thong, 2013).
2.5

Theory and Models

Customer perceptions of privacy can be measured from their purchase intentions some of
which translate to purchase behaviour. Previous research links customer awareness of privacy
and security issues to customers’ online shopping intentions and behaviour. Relevant theories
that have been used to explain online shopping intentions and behaviour are: Perceived Risk
Theory (PRT); Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA); and its associated Theory of Planned
Behaviour (TPB).
2.5.1

Perceived Risk theory

Perceived Risk Theory (PRT) is to the effect that the likelihood of risks in the buying process
determine a consumer’s decision to buy or not to buy a product (Yu, Lee & Damhorst, 2012).
PRT has been used to explain people’s responses to risk in different contexts, including in use
of information technology and participating in online shopping (Forsythe & Shi, 2003). In the
context of online shopping, perceived risk is a consumer's belief about possible negative
consequences of participating in an online transaction (Kim, Ferrin, & Rao, 2008). When risk
is perceived to be low or non-existent, there is a sense of being safe. Perceived risk can be
considered low in situations where customer concerns relating to online shopping are addressed
to a point that gives the customer a sense of security that makes them feel safe in engaging in
online shopping. This would be through a service provider’s adherence to relevant general data
protection regulations and/or legislation as relates to customer information management,
exposure management and interaction management. With specific reference to online shoppers
in Finland, it has been noted that they want to feel secure and well treated, a situation that
creates loyalty in the long term (Expat Finland, 2019; Chiu et al. 2009).
2.5.2

Theory of Reasoned Action

The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) that was developed by Fishbein and Ajzen (1975)
explains the relationship between attitudes and behaviours in actions people take where they
can exercise control. It is to the effect that “a person’s behaviour is determined by their
intention to perform the behaviour and that this intention is, in turn, a function of their attitude
toward the subjective norms and the behavior” (Silvermann et al., 2016, p.163). Attitude refers
to the evaluation and strength of one’s behavioural beliefs. Subjective norms refer to what one
thinks others would want or expect them to do (normative beliefs) and the level of importance

Silve Akter
the individual attaches to doing what is expected by others (motivation to comply). TRA
recognises that there are situations where the influence of attitude on behaviour gets limited.
In the case of online shopping, the influence of attitude can be limited by lack of money –
meaning the individual has limited control of his or her ability to proceed with a purchase and
therefore stops at the stage of intention. Theory of Reasoned Action is summarised in Figure
2.1.

behavior. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.
2.5.3

Theory of Planned Behavior

The process of identifying and explaining changes in human behaviour is a major concern of
this study. Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) is an extension of TRA (Ajzen, 1991; Ajzen,
1989; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) and like the latter it is to the effect that human intentions are
what controls human behaviour. According to TPB, six constructs represent an individual’s
control over his behaviour namely: attitudes, behavioural intention, subjective norms, social
norms, perceived power and perceived behavioural control. Perceived behavioural control is
what distinguishes TPB from TRA as it seeks to account for those behaviours that are not
entirely under the individual’s control. According to TPB a person is assumed to perform
specific behaviour only if he has control over the behaviour (Ajzen, 1991). Figure 2.2 presents
a summary of Theory of Planned Behaviour.

Silve Akter
Figure 2.2 Theory

of Planned Behaviour

Source:Theory of Planned Behavior Diagram( https://people.umass.edu/aizen/tpb.diag.html)
According to the three theories (Perceived Risk, Reasoned Action and Planned Behaviour), the
act of online shopping is a reasoned action based on analysis of one’s risk exposure, planned
behaviour of how to go about participating without compromising one’s security and therefore
having a feeling of being safe. This view, however, overlooks the privacy paradox claim to the
effect that despite having awareness, consumers online tend to act in a manner that undermines
their privacy (Barth & de Jong, 2017; Kokolakis, 2017).
2.6

Conceptual and Theoretical Framework

When a customer feels that his privacy is being respected, he perceives possible negative
consequences (risk) of participating in online shopping as low, a situation that makes him
develop a sense of security (Yu, Lee & Damhorst, 2012). Based on feeling secure or having
reached what they consider as an optimum level of security, they develop online purchasing
intentions, which are a reasoned action (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975). The same customers
eventually proceed to participate in online purchasing which is a planned behaviour that is
grounded in reasoned action (Ajzen, 1991; Ajzen, 1989; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975). It can
therefore be expected that a potential or actual online shopper considers privacy concerns
relating to interaction management (Smith et al. 1996; Hong & Thong, 2013; Terlizzi et al.,
2019), exposure management (Terlizzi et al., 2019) and information management (Smith et al.
1996; Hong & Thong, 2013) as critical to their developing the intention to shop online. Where
customers feel a website protects their privacy, they can be expected to be more willing to
provide requested additional information and conditions under which they agree to participate
(interaction management). Further, where customers have a high level of awareness of privacy
issues and perceive themselves as having control over how their data may be used, they can be
expected to change their passwords on a regular basis. In instances where customers feel that
their financial personal data is not secure because of an online providers information
management practices, they can be expected to be less willing to purchase online.

Silve Akter
Based on customer perceptions of an online service or product supplier’s ability to address
privacy concerns relating to interaction management, exposure management and information
management, the customer engages in any one of the following:
i) Develop online shopping intentions which result in them shopping online at some
future date; or
ii)Proceeding to shop online.
The conceptual framework of the process is as summarised in Figure 2.3.

In view of the reviewed literature and the conceptual framework in Figure 2.3, the study seeks
to answer the research question: How does interaction management, exposure management
and information management affect customer online purchase intentions and behaviour?
2.7

Conclusion

This chapter reviewed relevant literature on customer privacy in general, customer privacy
concerns specifically secondary use of information; identity theft; data breaches and security.
Institutional privacy assurances, customer privacy awareness, and general regulations on
customer service specific to the EU and Finland were highlighted. Customer online purchase
intention and behaviour were discussed in the context of their being influenced by their
(customers’) perceptions of privacy risks specifically those associated with interaction
management, exposure management and information management. Customer intention and
behaviour were identified as possible proxy measures of customer sense of privacy. Perceived
Risk Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action and Theory of Planned Behaviour were presented as
relevant models that can explain the relationship between customer sense of privacy and online
shopping intention and behaviour. The chapter concluded by presenting a conceptual
framework for understanding the association between customer sense of privacy and customer

Silve Akter
online purchase intentions and behaviour. The next chapter presents the study’s methodology
and methods.

3 Chapter 3. Research Methodology and Methods
This chapter presents the research methodology and methods used to establish how interaction
management, exposure management and information management affect Finnish customers’
online purchase intentions and behaviour as part of addressing the study’s purpose as stated in
Section 1.4. Guided by Saunders’ “onion” framework (Figure 3.1), the main components of
the chapter cover the study’s positivist philosophy (philosophies); use of quantitative methods
(approaches); use of a survey design (strategies); inclusion of qualitative elements in the
questionnaire (choices); use of cross sectional survey (time horizon) and the techniques and
procedures used for sampling, data collection and analysis.

3.1

Research Philosophy and Approach

A research philosophy is based on beliefs and assumptions that inform the researcher’s actions
(Creswell, 2013). Common research philosophies are positivism, interpretivism and
pragmatism. Positivism as a research philosophy is based on an assumption that there is an
objective reality that the researcher can understand while remaining removed from it so that
the inquiry process is not tainted by the researcher’s values (Bryman, 2016). Interpretivism
assumes that phenomena have multiple meanings as they are individual constructions of
people’s understanding of their world (Creswell, 2013) so that research must be carried out in
a manner that accommodates individual differences (Bryman, 2016). According to
pragmatism, it is the research question that determines the appropriate approach to be adopted
so that it can combine both positivism and interpretivism. This study’s research question
necessitated the adoption of pragmatism as it was guided by the assumption that while online
shoppers’ attitude to risk can be inferred from their online shopping behaviour. Although such
behaviour can be captured using a positivist approach, there could be elements that cannot be

Silve Akter
revealed by a standardised format and therefore calling for qualitative answers. The study
therefore incorporated elements of interpretivism.
According to Saunders et al. (2009) studies can have an inductive (qualitative) or deductive
(quantitative) approach based on their research philosophy. An inductive approach is
associated with interpretivism and collection of qualitative data and is usually associated with
the generation of theory. A deductive approach is associated with positivism and involves
collection of quantitative data. Its purpose is to test hypotheses, cause and effect relationships,
establish or check for relationships or associations and make predictions. In this study,
quantitative research enabled the researcher to determine the status of online purchasing
behaviours and to establish the extent of relationships among purchase intentions and
decisions, perceptions of risk and demographic differences. This study is therefore both
descriptive and correlational as it sought to describe the relationship between online purchasing
behaviour and perceptions of privacy risk without necessarily seeking causal connections.

3.2 Measuring Privacy
The multiple conceptualisations along with definitions of privacy make it almost impossible to
measure it directly. Measuring privacy is further complicated by the fact that the relationships
are dependent more on perceptions than on any objective assessments. Measurement is
therefore achieved through proxy measures (Pelteret & Ophoff, 2016; Bélanger & Crossler,
2011; Smith, Dinev & Xu, 2011). Within the field of information systems, individual privacy
concerns of the information privacy practices of organisations is the widely used proxy
measure which has been evolving over the years in tandem with advances in technology
(Pelteret & Ophoff, 2016; Jia & Xu, 2015; Hong & Thong, 2013).
Widely used instruments are: concern for information privacy (Smith, Milberg & Burke, 1996
cited in Malhotra, Kim & Agarwal, 2004); Internet users’ information privacy concerns
(IUIPC) (Bélanger & Crossler, 2011); and Internet Privacy Concerns scale (CFIP) (Hong &
Thong, 2013). CFIP was developed and validated by Smith et al. (1996 cited in Stewart &
Segars, 2002). It has 15 items that represent four dimensions of concerns, namely, improper
access to personal information, unauthorized secondary use of personal information, errors in
personal information, and collection of personal information. Studies validating these
dimensions found consumers to be concerned about all of them as opposed to being concerned
about a single one (Stewart & Segars, 2002). Believing that concerns of online users and those
of offline users were not likely to differ, Malhotra, Kim and Agarwal (2004) presented a
theoretical framework that measures internet users’ information privacy concerns (IUIPC)
based on an adaptation of CFIP. The 10-item framework’s instrument measures three
dimensions, namely: collection, control, and awareness of privacy practices. Hong and Thong’s
(2013) Internet Privacy Concerns scale has two dimensions, namely: interaction management
and information management. Under interaction management are the sub-dimensions
collection and secondary usage, and under information management are the sub-dimensions
errors and improper access. The scale has been found to be applicable to different contexts, has
exhibited stability over time, is robust and is the most up-to-date privacy scale (Terlizzi,
Brandimarte & Sanchez, 2019). Focusing on the m-banking environment, Terlizzi et al. (2019)
extended the scale by adding a third dimension, exposure management with the sub-dimensions
control and awareness. This study measures privacy concerns using the dimensions interaction
management, exposure management and information management.

3.3 Research Strategies
Experiment and survey are two commonly used strategies for a deductive approach (Saunders
et al., 2009). This study uses a survey. A survey can be cross-sectional, focusing on a
phenomenon at a specific time or longitudinal focusing over a long period (Sanders et al. 2009).
A cross-sectional survey was chosen as an appropriate research strategy as it enabled the
researcher to focus on online shopping decisions at a specific point in time. Surveys are credited
for facilitating economic collection of large amounts of data from a large population using a
standardised questionnaire format which makes it possible to draw comparisons among
respondents. Further data from a survey lend itself to statistical analysis to indicate
associations among variables being studied.
Data collection can be mono method, mixed methods, or multi-methods (Saunders et al., 2009).
Multi-methods were used in the study as the questionnaire (Appendix 1) had both closed
questions requiring Likert scale-based responses and open questions requiring qualitative
responses. Likert scales assume that the intensity of an experience lies between two extremes
so that a participant’s response is situated on some point along a continuum (Rattray and Jones,
2007). The qualitative component was minor as it was limited to participants explaining
responses classified as “other” and providing any additional information that may have been
missed by the closed questions.
According to Saunders et al. (2009), the way a questionnaire is designed affects the quality of
data collected. The study’s questionnaire had six sections focusing on respondent background
information, interaction management, exposure management, information management, online
purchase intentions and on online purchase behaviour (Appendix 1). The last four questions
were qualitative. Qualitative questions were included to enable the researcher to determine
whether the “other” option could not be accommodated within the specified options.

3.4 Techniques and Procedures
This section presents techniques and procedures relate to sampling techniques, data collection
and analysis.

3.4.1 Sampling
The study population were online shoppers in Finland and the sampling frame were those
whose contact details were known to the researcher, the researcher’s friends and supervisors.
The researcher was targeting at least 50 valid responses from Finland. Further the researcher
wanted to achieve a sample representing different demographics in terms of gender, profession
and age, as these were perceived to have potential to influence online shopping behaviour and
attitude to risk. Sampling in survey research can be probability or non-probability based. In
probability sampling, every member in the sampling frame has a known and equal chance of
being selected (Saunders et al., 2009). Probability sampling was not feasible in the study as the
researcher could not determine the probability of every member of the sampling frame being
included in the study. A non-probability sampling method, convenience sampling, was
therefore used. In non-probability sampling, it is not possible to know the probability of a case
(participant) being selected. Convenience sampling is appropriate where individuals are left to
choose to participate in a survey as is the case with internet - based surveys (Fricker, 2008).
Potential respondents were identified through posting the questionnaire directly via emails by

Silve Akter
the researcher and the supervisors’, and through the researchers’ friends sharing it with their
friends, by posting it on the two supervisors’ Facebook pages. In that regard respondents were
selected conveniently focusing on “known” respondents.
3.4.2

Data collection

Data was collected using an online administered questionnaire survey. Other methods that could have
been used to collect the data are mail, telephone, the internet, personal interviews, or group administered
interviews (Fowler, 2009). Using an online survey was found most appropriate in view of time
constraints. Use of online surveys has been discussed extensively in literature (Sue & Ritter, 2012).
Email and Web based surveys are the two commonly used types of online surveys. Although the study’s
sample size was not large, an online based questionnaire survey was found appropriate as it enabled a
faster way of collecting data from respondents and enabled the researcher to maintain Covid-19 related
social distancing in the year 2020 .The data was collected in May and June 2020 Potential respondents
were invited to participate by way of directing them to an online URL link.

3.4.3

Data analysis and interpretation

Data was analysed statistically using MS Excel data analysis function as this was readily
available and had adequate features to facilitate the analysis. Extraction of descriptive statistics
was in line with the exploratory nature of the study. Correlation analysis was conducted to
determine strength of association between age, gender, and profession and online behaviour;
and between aspects of online behaviour and attitudes towards risks associated with online
shopping. Interpretation of the correlations were guided by Evans (1996) as illustrated in Table
3.1.

A t-test: Paired two sample for means in Excel was conducted to determine whether
relationships reflected by the correlations observed through Table 3.1 were significant.
Relationships with p < .05 were considered statistically significant.
The Qualitative component of the questionnaire was analysed through coding and extracting
emerging themes and comparing these to the quantitative findings to determine whether they
presented any departures from what was obtained from quantitative responses or presented new
information.

3.5 Validity and Reliability
In quantitative studies, quality is measured through validity and reliability. Validity refers to
the extent to which the study measures sufficiently what it intends to measure in terms of

Silve Akter
content, criterion, and construct (Heale & Twycross, 2015). Content validity is about the extent
to which the study questionnaire includes all the necessary aspects relating to the variable being
measured. In the current study, validity refers to the extent to which the questionnaire covers
all aspects relating to online shopping decision making. The study questionnaire adequately
covered all the aspects related to the variable being studied (Appendix 1). Criterion validity
refers to the extent to which a research instrument approximates other instruments measuring
similar variables. The current study’s use of Likert scale is consistent with other studies that
have used a similar scale to measure attitudes and perceptions.
Construct validity refers to whether inferences about test scores can be drawn related to the
concept being studied. This was ensured through instrument homogeneity through ensuring
that the questionnaire measured one construct (Heale & Twycross, 2015), which was online
purchase decision. Further, the development of thematic areas for questions was based on
concepts derived from reviewed literature.
Reliability refers to the internal stability of an instrument in terms of the extent to which it can
produce the same results when used repeatedly. Cronbach’s alpha is one of the methods used
to establish the internal consistency of a study instrument with an alpha score of .7 and above
considered acceptable (Korb, 2012; Nunnally, 1978). The study’s instrument for questions 2
to 12 (Appendix 1) had an alpha of .5 which can be considered low. However, in view of
Nunnally’s (1978) opinion that in studies that are exploratory a minimum alpha of .6 is
acceptable; the general controversy on acceptable Cronbach’s alpha levels (Lance et al., 2006);
and the questionnaire having other items whose internal consistency could not be measured
using Cronbach’s alpha; and the inclusion of qualitative questions, the researcher proceeded
with the instrument.

3.6 Ethical reflection
Ethics in research are concerned about the rights of study participants. In this study, the ethical
consideration concerning the participants’ privacy and other sensitive matters were thoroughly
well-noted. The participants were informed that the information they provided was going to be
used anonymously without any disclosure of their identities. Further, they were offered the
freedom not to answer any questions that made them feel uncomfortable. Participants were
also informed that participation was voluntary, and they could opt out of the study at any stage
of filling out the questionnaire. This is consistent with Lewis’ (2003) view that consent is not
absolute so that a participant must be able to opt out at any point in a study.

3.7 Chapter summary
This chapter presented the study’s adoption of pragmatism as a philosophical approach guided
by the research question that made it necessary for the researcher to use a predominantly
deductive and therefore quantitative approach but accommodating some qualitative aspects in
the questionnaire used in the internet - based survey method of data collection. The techniques
used to select study participants, administer the survey, analyse and interpret the data were
explained. Validity, reliability and ethical aspects of the study were discussed. The next chapter
presents the findings of the study.

4 Chapter 4. Analysis and Interpretation of Result
This chapter presents results derived from the data collection and analysis methods explained
in Chapter 3. The results are presented in eight sections under the headings: Demographic data,
General online purchase behaviour, Interaction management, Exposure management,
Information management, Online purchase intention, Online purchase behaviour and
concludes by presenting a summary of statistically significant associations found in the data.

4.1

Demographic data

All the participants (N= 60) in Finland. Age distribution of the study participants illustrates
that the age group of those less than 50 years account for 71% of the respondents (Figure 4.1),
while women account for 75% of the respondents (Figure 4.2).
Figure 4.1 Respondents distribution by age

Figure 4.2 Respondents distribution by gender

Respondents’ distribution by age and gender shows that in each age group, women constituted
at least 60% of respondents (Figure 4.3). The over representation of females in the sample may
mean that the findings largely reflect women’s perceptions.

Silve Akter
Figure 4.3 Respondents distribution by age and gender

Distribution of respondents by occupation shows that 55% of respondents are employed, 23%
are students and 8% are self-employed. The rest are retired, unemployed or classify themselves
as “other.” None of the respondents classified themselves as home parents (Figure 4.4).

Respondents’ distribution by occupation also show that females are over-represented in all
occupations except in the self-employed group (Figure 4.4). This may mean that occupation
linked perceptions will largely be reflecting those of females. In two cases, the unemployed,
retired and “other” all the respondents were female.

4.2 General online purchase behaviour
The general online purchase behaviour of the study participants was derived from asking about
the frequency of online purchasing, for how long an individual has been shopping online, their
average expenditure, products respondents prefer to buy online, and their preferred method of
payment.
Respondents’ frequency of online purchasing (Appendix 1, Question 5) shows that 57% make
purchases several times per year, 20% once a month, and 15% once a week. Only 5% make
purchases several times a week with none making purchases every day (Figure 4.5).
Figure 4.5 Frequency of online purchases

Silve Akter
An analysis of frequency of purchase by gender shows that although a higher percentage of
women than men make purchases every week (several times a week or once a week), a higher
percentage of men make purchases several times per year (Figure 4.6).
Figure 4.6 Frequency of purchase by gender

A weak positive association was found between gender and frequency of online purchasing
(r=.31). The association was however, not statistically significant (p>0.05). No association was
found between age and frequency of online purchasing) and between profession and online
purchasing (r<.3).
Responses to how long participants have been shopping online (Appendix 1, Question 6) show
that 83% have been shopping online for four years and above which places them in a position
to comment meaningfully on their experiences (Figure 4.7). No association was found between
age, gender, and profession and how long a respondent has been shopping online (r<.3).
Figure 4.7Period in years shopping online

In terms of the products that participants prefer to buy online (Appendix 1, Question 7), the top
three are holidays, garments and books, in that order. Preferences however vary based on

Silve Akter
gender. The top three items bought most by women are holidays, transport and books; for men,
the most bought items are garments, hobbies, and electronics (Figure 4.8). Other items that are
frequently bought online, captured under “Others” in Figure 4.8 are flowers, jewellery, and
photos.
Figure 4.8 Online purchases by gender

Respondents’ average monthly expenditure on online shopping (Appendix 1, Question 8) is as
illustrated in Figure 4.9. Just over 50% of the respondents spend an average of 0 – 50 Euros
per month on online purchases. Less than 10% spend over 200 Euros per month. A weak
negative association was found between gender and average monthly expenditure (r=-.34). The
association was not statistically significant (p=.17). Most female respondents (60%) spend on
lower value items (up to 50 Euros per month) compared to their male counterparts (33%). Most
male respondents (60%) spend over 100 Euros per month with 13% spending up to 1000 Euros
per month. None of the female respondents spend more than 500 Euros per month on online
shopping. However, no association was found between profession, age, and average monthly
expenditure.
Figure 4.9 Average online expenditure by gender

Silve Akter
Preferred methods of payment (Appendix 1, Question 9) are credit card (33%), debit card (18%) and
Klarna (refers to the online financial service provided by Swedish bank for payment solutions) (17%),
as shown in Figure 4.10. No association was found between preferred method of payment and gender,
age, or profession (r<.3). The considerably higher preference for credit cards may be a result of the
convenience as the process is both faster and not dependent on the purchasers having the funds in their
accoun. Moreover, it also allows the buyer to get the money back if the purchase is not delivered. This
preference is consistent with findings from similar studies (Clement, 2020).
Figure 4.10 Preferred method of payment

No association was found among frequency of online purchasing, how long one has been
purchasing online, average expenditure on online purchases, and preferred method of payment.

4.3 Interaction management
Interaction management was measured through having respondents indicate their level of
agreement with the relevant statements (Appendix 1, Question 10). The results are as
illustrated in Figure 4.11. Over 80% of the respondents do not feel comfortable to provide
personal information to a website while making purchases and further, and over 50% do not
feel comfortable giving their banking details. Over 70% of the respondents are aware that their
confidential information could be passed on to third parties and over 80% are bothered by this.

Silve Akter
Figure 4.11 Interaction management

A weak negative association (r=-.3) was found between age and feeling comfortable to provide
personal information to websites while making purchases. Those below 30 years had the
highest percentage (64%) of respondents neutral to the statement. Those 60 years and above
had the highest percentage of respondents (44%) strongly disagreeing with the statement
(Figure 4.12). The association was, however, not statistically significant (p=.27).
Figure 4.12 Age and feeling comfortable providing personal information during online shopping

Another weak negative association was found between age and providing banking details while
shopping online (r=-.36). Those below 30 years had the highest percentage (64%) of
respondents agreeing or being neutral to the statement that they are comfortable providing
banking details when shopping online (Figure 4.13). The association was however not
statistically significant (p=.07 respectively).

Silve Akter
Figure 4.13 Age and being comfortable providing banking details during online shopping

No association was found between age and being aware that personal information may be given
to third parties or being bothered about it. There was also no association between gender, and
between profession and all the other interaction management statements. The results therefore
show that there is no statistically significant association between the demographic factors of
the respondents and their interaction management during online shopping.
Interaction management was further analysed to determine whether it was associated with
frequency of purchase, and amounts spent per month on online shopping. No association was
found between frequency of purchase and interaction management (r<.3). Further, no
association was found between monthly expenditure on online shopping and interaction
management aspects (Appendix 1, Question 8 and Question 10) with the exception of a weak
positive relationship between monthly expenditure on online shopping and “I feel comfortable
providing my banking details while shopping online” (r=.36). Over 30% in each expenditure
bracket disagreed with the statement that they feel comfortable providing banking details while
shopping online. The relationship was statistically significant (p=.001) indicating that
respondents’ sense of security with releasing banking details may affect how much they spend
online.

4.4 Exposure management
Exposure management was measured through how the respondents evaluated aspects of online
shopping privacy issues, and their experiences with specific aspects of privacy (Appendix 1,
Question 11).
Respondent evaluation of exposure management was measured through having them indicating
how they personally evaluate the importance of reading privacy policies and having the ability
to change information they would have entered. Figure 4.14 shows that 60% of the respondents
indicate that it is either important or very important for them to read privacy policies when
making online purchases. A minority (12%) does not consider it important. No association was
found between age, gender, profession, and considering reading privacy policies as important
when making online purchases (r<.3).
Most respondents (72%) do not think it is important or very important for them to be able to
change information they would have put on a website. No association was found between age,

Silve Akter
gender, profession, and considering it important to be able to change information one would
have put on a website (r<.3).

Figure 4.14 Importance

of reading privacy policies and being able to change personal
information

No statistically significant association was found between considering it important to read
privacy policies and frequency of online purchase, and amount spent online. The same result
was observed with having the ability to change information previously entered on a website.
The results suggest that exposure management does not affect online purchasing behavior.

4.5 Information management
Information management was measured through respondents’ experiences with aspects of
privacy (Appendix 1, Question 12). Figure 4.15 shows that none of the respondents perceive
details of privacy policies provided as always understandable while most are perceiving them
as either sometimes (41 %) or rarely (28 %) understandable. No association was found between
age, gender, profession, and perceiving privacy policies provided as always understandable
(r<.3).

Silve Akter
Figure 4.15 Information

management experiences

Only 17% of the respondents either always or often read terms and conditions before agreeing
to proceed to complete their purchase (Figure 4.16). A weak positive association was found
between age and reading terms and conditions (r=.32). The association was not statistically
significant (p=.11). Reading terms and conditions before purchase was found to be less
prevalent among the 18 – 49 years age group suggesting that elderly shoppers pay more
attention to terms and conditions before concluding a purchase. No similar association was
found for gender or profession.
Figure 4.16 Reading

terms and conditions before completing a purchase

None of the respondents have always changed their decision to make a purchase as a result of
terms and conditions while 35% indicate that they have never done so. The rest rarely (28%)
or sometimes (35%) made that decision. No association was found between age, gender,
profession, and making the decision to purchase based on terms and conditions (r<.3).
A moderate positive association was found between reading terms and conditions before
agreeing to proceed to complete a purchase and changing one’s decision to make a purchase

Silve Akter
based on terms and conditions (r=.42). The association was statistically significant (p=.001).
This suggests that those who read terms and conditions are more likely to change their purchase
decision based on the terms and conditions.
Using different passwords for different websites either always or often is practiced by 70% of
the respondents, indicating a high awareness to risks associated with using the same password
on different websites. Only 10% never or rarely engage in this practice. High awareness of
password related risks cuts across all age groups, gender and professions, as no association was
found between age, gender, profession, and using different passwords for different websites
(r<.3).
Most respondents dislike receiving advertisements from online websites that they did not
purchase from as shown by 48% indicating that they never like it and 30% that they rarely like
it. No one always likes it and 2% often likes it. The perception cuts across demographic
differences as no association was found between age, gender, profession, and liking receiving
advertisements from online websites not purchased from previously (r<.3).
Awareness of cookies is prevalent as indicated by 65% of the participants always or often being
aware. Less than 10% are never or rarely aware. No association was found between age, gender,
profession, and being aware of cookies (r<.3) indicating that awareness is prevalent across
demographic differences.
Less than 20% of respondents are always or often able, while 56% are sometimes able to amend
information previously entered on a website. The rest are either never or rarely able. Age,
gender, and profession have no relationship with being able to amend information previously
entered on a website (r<3). Similarly, they have no relationship with having amended personal
information previously entered on a website (r<.3). Only 7% of the respondents indicated that
they have often and 42% that they have sometimes amended personal information previously
entered on a website.
A strong positive association was found between “I am able to amend information I would
have entered on a website” and “I have amended personal information captured on a website”
(r=.62). The association was, however, found not to be statistically significant (p>.05). A
moderate positive association was also found between “I have amended personal information
captured on a website” and “It is important for me to be able to change information I would
have put on a website” (r=.4). Also this relationship was found not to have any statistical
significance (p>.05). This suggests that ability to amend personal information, and awareness
of its importance do not necessarily lead to respondents taking that line of action.
No association was found between frequency of purchase and information management (r<.3);
and between amount spent on online shopping and exposure management (r<.3). This indicates
that the two are not affected by information management factors.

4.6 Online purchase intention
Respondent’s online purchase intentions were analysed based on three factors that influence
their decision not to buy after having considered buying, and three factors that have prevented
them from buying specific items they would have wanted to buy from online shops (Appendix
1, Question 13).

Silve Akter
As illustrated in Figure 4.17, the top three cited factors that influenced intention not to purchase
online are better prices (52%), speed of delivery (42%) and sense of security (38%). Mode of
payment, another security related factor, is in fourth position (37%).
Figure 4.17 Factors

influencing decision not to buy after having considered buying

The top three factors that have prevented respondents from buying online items they would
have wanted to buy (Appendix 1, Question 14) were identified as inability to assess product
quality (63%), delivery cost (58%), and high prices (40%). Security was placed in fourth
position (Figure 4.16).
Figure 4.18 Factors that

led to decision not to buy desired items

Security and mode of payment factors were found not to be the most influential on respondents’
intentions and decisions to buy online.

Silve Akter

4.7 Online purchase behavior
Online purchase behaviour (Appendix 1 Question 15) was assessed through respondents
identifying three factors that influenced their most recent purchase. Product variety (63%),
better prices (63%) and time saving (35%) were identified as having been most influential.
Once again, security factors (sense of security and mode of payment) featured on the lower end
of influencing factors (Figure 4.19).
Figure 4.19 Factors that

influenced the most recent online purchase

Other factors that influenced respondents’ most recent online purchases were non availability
of items in shops and the advent of Covid-19.

4.8 Summary of analysis
The findings indicate that although respondents may be aware of risks associated with online
shopping, this does not influence their online behaviour as indicated by the following:
i.

a moderate positive association between reading terms and conditions before
agreeing to proceed to complete a purchase and changing one’s decision to make a
purchase based on terms and conditions (r=.42).

ii.

a strong positive association between “I am able to amend information I would have
entered on a website” and “I have amended personal information captured on a
website” (r=.62).

iii.

a moderate positive association between “I have amended personal information
captured on a website” and “It is important for me to be able to change information
I would have put on a website” (r=.4).

Silve Akter
iv.

a weak positive relationship between monthly expenditure on online shopping and “I
feel comfortable providing my banking details while shopping online” (r=.36).

The above associations were found not to be statistically significant with the exception of the
following:
i.
relationship between reading terms and conditions before agreeing to proceed to
complete a purchase and changing one’s decision to make a purchase based on
terms and conditions (p=.001).
ii.

relationship between monthly expenditure on online shopping and “I feel
comfortable providing my banking details while shopping online” (p=.001).

Further, security and mode of payment do not feature among the three most influential factors
with the highest number of responses for respondents’ online purchase intentions and online
purchase behaviour. This suggests that security issues are subordinate to other factors in
respondents’ decision to make online purchases.
Focusing on demographic factors, no association was found between age, gender, and
profession (r<.3) for most of the measured aspects of online shopping with the following
exceptions:
i.
a weak positive association between gender and frequency of online purchasing
(r=.31).
ii.
a weak negative association between gender and average monthly expenditure
(r=-.34).
iii.
a weak negative association between age and feeling comfortable to provide
personal information to websites (r=-.3).
iv.
a weak negative association between age and providing banking details while
shopping online (r=-.36).
v.
a weak positive association between age and reading terms and conditions
(r=.32).
However, the above relationships were found to have no statistical significance (p>.05). The
results suggest that demographic factors may have no or minimum influence on respondents’
decisions relating to their online behaviour.

5 Chapter 5. Discussion
The purpose of this research was to explore Finnish customers’ privacy concerns while they
shop online with the aim of identifying areas where customer perceptions of privacy can be
addressed. The study, therefore, sought to establish the customer privacy risks encountered by
online shoppers in Finland and how these affected or influenced online buying behaviour. In
doing so, the study sought to answer the questions: How does interaction management,
exposure management and information management affect customer online purchase
intentions and behaviour? For the three aspects, the study also sought to establish whether
demographic differences influence customer online behaviour. According to the study’s
theoretical framework (Figure 2.3) customers participate in online shopping when they feel
that their privacy is being respected and the possibility of negative consequences is low. It was
therefore expected that online shoppers would consider factors related to interaction
management (Hong & Thong, 2013; Terlizzi et al., 2019), exposure management (Terlizzi et
al., 2019) and information management (Hong & Thong, 2013) critical to their online shopping
behaviour as indicated by frequency of online purchases and average monthly expenditure. The
findings generally showed no statistically significant associations between the stated indicators
of online behaviour with exposure and information management. A statistically significant
association was found with one of the interaction management items. Findings are discussed
under the headings: Effect of interaction management on customer online purchase intentions
and behaviour;Effect of exposure management on customer online purchase intentions and
behaviour; Effect of information management on customer online purchase intentions and
behaviour; Factors influencing intention not to buy and decision to buy; and Demographic
differences and online shopping.

5.1 Effect of Interaction Management on customer online purchase intention
and behavior
Interaction management was found to affect customer online purchase intentions and behaviour
in as far as customers are uncomfortable providing their personal information online as well as
worried that their information may be given to third parties without their consent (Figure 4.11,
page 32). That no statistically significant relationship was found between most interaction
management aspects and monthly expenditure online, and frequency of on online shopping
(Appendix ,1 Question 10) may indicate that the last two behaviours are not influenced by
respondent perceptions of interaction management. The statistically significant association
found between how much respondents spend online per month and feeling comfortable
providing banking details while shopping online (p=.001) may indicate that respondents’ sense
of security with releasing banking details may affect how much they spend online. This
confirms the Theory of Reasoned Action (Ajzen, 1991; Ajzen, 1989; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975)
as respondents’ spending online is linked to their feeling an optimum level of security. It further
confirms Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1991), as level of expenditure on online
shopping is a behaviour embarked on after considering banking related security factors and
making a conscious decision on the amount the respondent is willing to expose to risk through
participating in on online shopping.
The findings are consistent with other studies that have stated that online shoppers arrive at
conclusions on the security of their information through the amount of personal information
requested during their online interaction with a provider’s website (Hong & Thong, 2013;
Terlizzi et al., 2019). Further the findings resonate with AL-Shukri’s (2019) finding that

Silve Akter
providing secured payment options and protecting customer personal information are
important aspects of web security and privacy protection. In this instance, customer concerns
with use of their banking details for uses other than the purchase they are trying to make
influenced the amount they spent on online shopping. This confirms Aziz and Wahid ‘s (2018)
findings that online shoppers are reluctant to give out their banking details because of privacy
and security concerns. An improvement in the security of banking related personal information
can therefore be expected to result in an increase in the amount an individual spends on online
shopping. As is, most of the respondents (over 50%) expressed discomfort with providing their
banking details online. This may indicate a fear of possible financial loss resulting from
perceived lack of security of privacy, which, according to Aggarwal and Rahul (2018),
represents transaction integrity.

5.2 Effect of Exposure Management affects customer online purchase
intentions and behaviour
Reading privacy policies when making a purchase and being able to change information one
would have put on a website (Appendix 1, Question 11) were used to determine the effect of
exposure management on customer online purchase intentions and behaviour. No statistically
significant relationship was found between frequency of purchase and exposure management;
and between amount spent on online shopping and exposure management. This seems to
indicate that risks linked to exposure management do not influence frequency of purchase and
amount spent on online shopping. The lack of any significant relationship confirms the view
that even though online shops provide privacy terms and conditions relating to how customers’
data will be used, only a few read them (Brüseke, 2016). In literature, a possible explanation
for this is that privacy terms and conditions are written in non-user friendly language as if to
discourage users from reading them. Privacy policies today do not convey information in an
understandable way. According to Waldman (2018), the policies are created without the needs
of the users in mind

5.3 Effect of Information Management affects customer online purchase
intentions and behavior
The effect of information management (Appendix 1, Question 12) on customer online
intentions and behaviour seems minimal. No statistically significant association was found
between: considering it important to be able to change information one would have put on a
website and having amended personal information captured on a website; being able to amend
information one would have entered on a website and amending the personal information
captured on a website. This suggests that ability and awareness did not necessarily lead to
respondents taking necessary action to protect themselves. This seems to contradict the Theory
of Reasoned Action (Ajzen, 1991). Further, that no association was found between most
information management factors and frequency of purchase, and amount spent shopping online
suggests that the two are not affected by information management factors. The findings are
consistent with Bandara et al.’s (2020) view that in what represents a privacy paradox, online
customers engage in contradictory behaviour.
A statistically significant association was found between reading terms and conditions before
agreeing to proceed to complete a purchase, and changing one’s decision to make a purchase
based on terms and conditions (p=.001).This suggests that those who read terms and conditions
(a minority) are more likely to make more informed decisions, which confirms Aggarwal and

Silve Akter
Rahul’s (2018) argument that transaction choices are affected by security of privacy and
attendant transaction integrity. Further, the finding confirms Chakraborty et al.’s (2016)
observation that perceived likelihood of data breaches may lead to customer reluctance to
engage online with an organisation. That those who read the terms and conditions are a
minority confirms the observation by Nejad et al. (2019) who attribute the phenomenon to the
complexity of the statements.

5.4

Factors influencing intention not to buy and decision to buy

Although security issues featured under interaction management and exposure management,
they do not feature among the top three factors identified by respondents as influencing their
intention not to buy. Instead, they identified inability to assess product quality, delivery cost,
and high prices ahead of security (Figure 4.17, page 37).
Further, although security issues featured under interaction management and exposure
management, they are not among the top three factors identified by respondents as influencing
their decision to purchase online. Both sense of security and mode of payment featured lower
than product variety, better prices, and time saving (Figure 4.18,page-38). The findings
indicate that although respondents may be aware of risks associated with online shopping, these
do not seem to influence their decision to buy online. This suggests that although lack of trust
arising from risks associated with fraud, privacy and security have been highlighted in literature
as influencing online purchase decisions (Farhana et al., 2017; George et al., 2015), their
influence on Finnish online shoppers’ decision to purchase seems insignificant. This is
inconsistent with Agyapong (2018) who found that most Finnish customers were reluctant to
make purchases online for fear of their personal information being abused. In the current study,
although the respondents were aware of possible abuse of personal information, this did not
have any significant effect on frequency of online shopping and amounts spent on online
shopping.
Findings on factors influencing intention not to buy and those influencing decision to buy
confirm the findings of Gupta and Arora (2017), who observed that reasons for and reasons
against are main determinants of online shopping intentions and that these are not necessarily
the same. In this study, while on intention not to buy the top reasons were identified as product
quality, delivery cost, and high prices, for decision to buy they were identified as product
variety, better prices, and time saving. It is instructive that for both ‘intention not to buy’ and
‘decision to buy’ security and privacy issues did not feature as part of the top three reasons. It
would therefore seem that those factors outweigh privacy concerns in a manner consistent with
Pelteret and Ophoff’s (2016) observation that perceived benefits from online shopping have
been found to outweigh privacy concerns such as making data accessible to third parties. That
privacy and security factors were not among the top three factors confirms studies that have
shown that awareness of privacy risks does not stop consumers from engaging in online
behaviours that expose them to related risks (Baruh et al., 2017; Kokolakis, 2017). This
behaviour confirms Bandara et al.’s (2020) view that a consumer’s awareness of privacy risks
and the precautions they need to take do not imply that they act rationally to avoid risks. This
seems to refute the Theory of Reasoned Action (Ajzen, 1989).

5.5 Demographic differences and online shopping
Absence of a statistically significant association between the demographic factors of the
respondents and their interaction management, exposure management, and information
management during online shopping suggests that the observed practices cut across the
demographic differences. The study confirms Hernández et al.’s (2011) conclusion that
socioeconomic variables previously considered important are no longer valid explanations of
online shopping behaviour.
Although not statistically significant, associations were observed between age, gender, and
profession for the following: gender and frequency of shopping; age and being comfortable
providing personal information to websites, and providing banking details while shopping
online; age and the prevalence of reading terms and conditions; and age and proceeding with a
purchase despite known risks. The relationships confirm Bandara et al.’s (2020) privacy
paradox that despite being aware of privacy related risks and the precautionary actions they
should take, some engage in behaviours inconsistent with their privacy attitudes and concerns.
This may imply that while aware of the risks, younger respondents perceive these as not high
enough to warrant not participating in online shopping. The results confirm Perceived Risk
Theory (PRT) that an individual’s decision to buy online depends on what they perceive as the
likelihood of risks (Yu et al., 2012) or negative consequences (Kim et al., 2008).

5.6 Study contribution and recommendations
In exploring the privacy risks encountered by Finnish online customers, their concerns, and
how these affect or influence their online buying behaviour, the study established that security
and privacy factors do not seem to influence the behaviour of online shoppers in a statistically
significant way. This is not a major departure from what has been reported by other studies.
That notwithstanding, the findings highlight a number of related areas whose improvement
would reduce concerns of online shoppers. Given that online retailing is increasingly becoming
an important strategy for businesses, findings of this study will contribute towards guiding
implementation of privacy sensitive online marketing strategies. Specifically, the following
recommendations are made on each of the aspects:


Interaction management: Improve security of privacy through provision of secured
payment options where customers’ fear of possible identity theft and attendant
possible financial and reputational damage are eliminated or reduced.



Exposure management: Write privacy policies and terms and conditions in a nonintimidating language that can be understood by ordinary online customers and that
encourages participation.



Information management: Given the statistically significant association between
reading terms and conditions before agreeing to proceed to complete a purchase and
changing one’s decision to make a purchase, it may be necessary for online service
providers to coin their privacy policies and terms and conditions in a language and

Silve Akter
format that encourages more users to read them in order to increase their comfort
levels.


Factors influencing intention not to buy and decision to buy: Since factors that
influence ‘intention not to buy’ and those that influence ‘decision to buy’ are not
necessarily the same, providers may increase online purchasers through enhancing
‘decision to buy’ to a point where they outweigh those that influence ‘intention not
to buy.’

This section discussed the study’s findings and found most of them to be consistent with
existing literature on online shoppers’ perceptions of privacy risks and its influence on online
buying behaviour. The study’s contribution towards adoption of privacy sensitive online
marketing strategies was highlighted. Recommendations were made on how online service
providers in Finland can improve customer experience of interaction, exposure and information
management as part of decreasing their perceptions of risk exposure and positively influencing
their online shopping intentions and behaviour. The next section presents the study’s
limitations and opportunities for future research.

6 Chapter 6. Limitations and future research
The study’s findings, contribution and recommendations must be viewed in the context of its
limitations. The limitations indicate possible areas for future research to enhance understanding
of the relationship between perceptions of risk and online shopping intentions and behaviour
among Finnish online shoppers.

6.1

Study limitations

This study had the following limitations:
i. Data for the study was collected during the Covid-19 pandemic induced period, a
situation which may have militated against getting a larger sample size since other
possible respondents may have been preoccupied.
ii.

The study’s sample size was a limiting factor in terms of analysing relationships as in
some cases responses for an item could be lower than five observations for a variable.
Aggarwal and Ranganathan (2016) indicate that when a sample size is small a
relationship may seem present even if it does not exist.

iii. The largely quantitative nature of this study meant that it was not possible to get
meaningful qualitative explanations for the behaviour of Finnish online shoppers.
Given the study’s exploratory nature, a few interviews to seek further clarification of
emerging patterns would have strengthened the findings.

6.2

Opportunities for future research

In view of the study’s limitations, there are opportunities for future research in the following
areas:
i. There may be need for a longitudinal study collecting data from a bigger sample size
over a long period to check whether what has been observed in this exploratory
investigation is applicable to the rest of the Finnish online shopping community.
ii.

Covid-19 was identified as one of the factors that has made some respondents
participate in online purchasing. As the pandemic has changed the way people
purchase, it may be necessary to research on how it has affected Finnish shoppers’
perceptions of online shopping risks.
