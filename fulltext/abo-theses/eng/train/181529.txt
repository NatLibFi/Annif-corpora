Title: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market – An Assessment of Indicators’
performance in relation to the Stock Market during Covid-19
Supervisor: D.Sc. Markku Heikkilä
Abstract:
Market participants can use economic and financial indicators to predict and
follow changes in the stock market. However, Covid-19 has caused uncertainty in
the economy and financial markets since its spread. Additionally, the U.S.
economy entered a recession in February 2020, and the stock market crashed in
March 2020. During volatile times, reliable indicators are necessary for assisting
market participants’ decision-making. Therefore, it is important to assess the
indicators’ performance. Previous studies have provided information on indicators
that are of reliable use. However, the findings from previous studies vary,
depending on the characteristics of the economic situation.
The main aim of this study was to determine how indicators have been affected by
Covid-19 and how well they have performed in relation to the stock market.
Another aim was to assess if the indicators display information, that is, leading,
coincident, or lagging in relation to the stock market indices. Furthermore, similar
indicators were compared, and factors affecting the indicators during Covid-19
were described.
For the purpose of this study, nine indicators and two stock market indices were
included. The indicators were assigned into the categories: macroeconomic,
survey-based, and business cycle. Their performance was analyzed in relation to
the development of the U.S. stock market indices S&P 500 index and DJIA.
Monthly data with the time period of January 2019 to January 2020 were analyzed.
Statistical analyzes, such as correlation, correlation significances, crosscorrelation, simple linear regression, and multiple linear regression, were
performed to assess the indicators and their relationship with the stock indices.
The results showed that the stock market indices were leading the indicators.
Hence, the results imply that indicators could not be reliably used in forecasting
the development of the stock indices during the period from January 2019 to
January 2021. Furthermore, the indicators were also affected directly and
indirectly by regulations and lockdowns the U.S. government ordered to combat
Covid-19.

1 Introduction
The Covid-19 pandemic has caused economic instability in financial markets. The
pandemic is responsible for increasing uncertainty in stock market prices due to
changes in price volatility. The most noticeable repercussion that materialized at the
beginning of 2020 was the stock market crash in March (Mazur et al., 2021). The
sudden nature of the pandemic, as well as the regulations governments have
implemented to combat it, further exacerbated the uncertainty on the stock market.
The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) declared that the most recent
peak in the U.S. business cycle occurred in February 2020, meaning that the U.S.
economy entered a recession (NBER, n.d.). Research indicates that the stock market
and the state of the business cycle are connected (Perez-Quiros &Timmermann,
2007; Naes et al., 2011; Franz, 2010). In general, an expanding business cycle leads
to an increase in stock market prices. In contrast, a contracting business cycle leads
to a decrease in stock market prices. Additionally, stock market fluctuations can
anticipate the state of the business cycle (Franz, 2010). That is, a rise in stock market
prices can anticipate an expansion of the business cycle, and a fall in the stock
market prices can anticipate a contraction of the business cycle. In other words, the
stock market prices fluctuate and mimic the movement of the business cycle, and the
business cycle, in turn, can be anticipated by the fluctuations of the stock market.
The abovementioned fluctuations in the stock market are called bull (i.e., an increase
in prices) and bear (i.e., a decrease in prices) markets.
The state of the business cycle can be examined by observing different economic
indicators. When predicting business cycle turning points, organizations and
investors use leading economic indicators that show in advance how the business
cycle will turn. The use of economic indicators in relation to the business cycle is
usually focused on observing economic development from a macroeconomic
perspective, concentrating on a country’s gross domestic product (GDP) (Zarnowitz,
1991).
Participants in the stock market attempt to use all the available information in
anticipating the fluctuations of the stock market. As with examining the business
1

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

cycle, economic and financial indicators in relation to the stock market can be used.
The indicators provide information that shows past, current, and future fluctuations
of the stock market. The uncertainty that the Covid-19 pandemic has caused to the
stock market has further raised the importance of accurate indicators. Especially the
indicators’ predictive abilities and how they should be interpreted have come into
question.
Due to the unexpected nature of the Covid-19 pandemic and the ongoing uncertainty
it has led to, market participants in the stock market need to find alternative ways to
gain the correct information as to how to participate in the stock market. Indicators
have been used for the purpose of gaining insight into how the stock market
develops. In this thesis, macroeconomic indicators, survey-based indicators, and
business cycle indicators are grouped under the term indicators.

1.1 Background
Indicators are used to gain more information about the stock market and business
cycles in general. Hence, the reliability of the indicators and how they can be used
are important for market participants and decision-makers. Among the earliest
research in using indicators in an attempt to predict the business cycle is that done by
Mitchell and Burns (1946;1961). The authors argued that by observing indicators
that are constructed in different ways and measure different economic activity, one
would obtain a clearer and broader picture of the business cycle. This, in turn, could
help in forecasting recessions and increased economic activity. Further, individual
indicators have performed non-consistently during different recessions (Stock &
Watson, 2003). Stock and Watson (2003) observed how indicators performed during
the 2001 recession and concluded that the performance of the indicators was
different from previous recessions. For instance, consumer confidence and building
permits decreased, both before and during the 1990 recession, but they did not
decrease before the 2001 recession. Stock and Watson (2003) argued that the reasons
for this could be that the U.S. economy has made fundamental changes. Where
international trade has increased, financial markets have developed, and the increase
of technology in industries has made the underlying conditions different. Similar to

2

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

the 2001 recession, the decline in the stock market prices at the beginning of 2020
was a forecaster of the recession.
NBER, which announces the dates of the US business cycles’ turning points,
declared that the most recent peak occurred in February 2020 (NBER, n.d.). The
recession, with an onset in 2020, has continued into 2021, started with the stock
market crash in March 2020. The stock market crash was soon stabilized, but the
actions that different authorities put into place, mainly quarantines and regulations
for business activity to lessen the burden of the virus, led to outcomes that affected
employment and spending. The virus has further affected economic activity, most
notably in the tourism industry and later many other industries, through the downturn
in consumer activity (Congressional Budget Office Reports, 2020).
Schoenfield (2020) studied how the Covid-19 pandemic affected the financial
markets by examining the S&P 500 companies. He observed how individual firms
and industries were affected. According to him, the pandemic led to approximately
95% of the S&P 500 companies decreasing in value during the three first months of
2020, however, mainly during the crash of March. According to Schoenfield (2020),
the most affected firms were those in the following areas: energy, clothing,
restaurants and hotels, transportation, cars, machinery, and railroads. On a more
general note, Schoenfield (2020) observed that the pandemic influences the financial
markets, including changes in unemployment, the value of bonds, commodities, and
currencies. Concerning the S&P 500 companies, most decreased in value.
The effects of the stock market crash and the implications of how the pandemic
continues to affect the economy and economic development have not yet been fully
comprehended. This underlines the need for the present thesis.

1.2 Problem Discussion
Previous research shows mixed results in how different indicators have performed.
Varying results are dependent on indicators’ performance during different stages of
the business cycle. Additionally, the same can be observed when measuring
indicators’ performance in relation to stock market development. The attempt to gain

3

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

a broader and more consistent view of economic development led to the construction
of composite indicators (OECD, 2021). Composite indicators attempt to construct a
clearer picture of economic development by combining variables representing
different economic aspects. Nevertheless, the consensus is that using many indicators
measuring different aspects of economic development provides the most precise
picture. Hence, I decided to include numerous indicators in my study.
The stock market crash in March 2020 was a rapid external shock, affecting the
valuation of stock market prices and eventually leading to a fast but somewhat shortlived stock market crash. The stock market crash occurred during the beginning of
the recession, with heavy price fluctuations. Previous research has examined how
indicators have functioned before recessions and how they have perceived stock
market crashes, but the results concerning this are mixed (Stock & Watson, 2003).
How well indicators have measured economic development before and after stock
market crashes also depends on the studied indicators.
A more globalized economy might have contributed to the uncertainty in how well
the indicators measure economic and stock market development. Most of the
companies listed on significant stock market indices act in many different economies
and economic spheres. This is causing some parts of the companies’ economic
activities not to be perceived by indicators measuring only the U.S. economy. The
possibility of being affected by economic shocks outside the U.S. economic sphere
can influence the stock market price of the affected company listed on the U.S.
economic indices.
The indicators’ performance in relation to the stock market during Covid-19 may
have also been affected by factors related to government regulations made to combat
the pandemic. For instance, business regulations may have affected indicators’
performance in managing reliably to measure economic activity in relation to the
stock market. This could have further increased the uncertainty of the indicators’
performance during Covid-19.
The stock market in relation to indicators has usually been studied by concentrating
on either stock market returns or stock market prices. The prices and returns have
represented the stock market in these studies. Additionally, how the indicators can
explain and predict stock market development has considered how the indicators can
4

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

be used in relation to stock market prices or returns. This study will include previous
literature from both of the former and the latter viewpoints to gain a comprehensive
picture of the relationship between the indicators and the stock market.

1.3 Aims
The main aim of this study was to research how the selected indicators can explain
the variation of the stock market indices’ values and how they have been affected by
the Covid-19 pandemic. For this purpose, nine indicators and two stock market
indexes were included in the present study. Further, the second aim was to observe if
the indicators display information, that is, leading, coincident, or lagging in relation
to the stock market indices. The third aim of the study was to determine whether the
use of a single indicator or multiple indicators better explains the development of the
stock market indices. Further, observe how the indicators have performed compared
to other similar indicators. An additional aim was to ascertain how the indicators
could be used in forecasting the stock market indices. Lastly, how well and
accurately can the indicators measuring monthly data be used in achieving the aims
of the study. All the included indicators measure the development of the U.S.
economy.
Due to previous research has not come to a consensus on the relationship between
the stock market and the indicators, no hypotheses were constructed in the present
study. Instead, research aims were formed, which explain what the present study is
attempting to achieve.

1.4 Methodology
The author of this study wanted to know how the indicators have been affected by
the external shock that the Covid-19 pandemic caused the stock market. Therefore,
the indicators were tested as to whether they have been functioning properly and
giving a correct picture. In other words, the indicators’ reliability and measurements
were analyzed. Conducting these analyses is of practical value, as the findings could
be used by decision-makers and private participants in the stock market.
5

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

To be able to determine how the indicators had measured economic activity in
relation to the stock market both before and during the Covid-19 pandemic, data
from the years 2019-2021 were included. The data from the time period before the
onset of the pandemic were compared against the data gathered during the pandemic
to understand the differences in the indicators’ measurements.
The indicators have been assigned into three categories, determined by the economic
activity they measure and how they measure it. The categories are the following:
Survey-based indicators; that include the Purchasing Managers’ indices (PMI) and
the Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI), Macroeconomic indicators; that includes the
Industrial Production Index (IPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), and the Consumer
Price Index (CPI), and to the Business cycle, that includes the OECD Composite
Leading Indicator (CLI).
To examine whether the indicators have a positive relationship with the stock
indices, correlations and cross-correlations were performed. Further, correlations and
correlation significances among indicators were performed. Additionally, various
regression analyses were conducted to observe if there were linear relationships with
the indicators and stock indices. Firstly, simple linear regression analyses of the
stock market indices against each indicator were performed. Secondly, simple linear
regressions with lagged values for the indicators were conducted. Thirdly, multiple
regression analyses were performed with the indicators that showed the lowest
correlations and lowest correlation significance values. Finally, multiple regression
analyses with lagged values for the indicators were conducted.

1.5 Delimitations
This study focuses on how indicators can measure stock market development and on
the indicators‘ predictive abilities in relation to the stock market. For this reason,
nine indicators and two stock market indices were included. The two stock market
indices, the S&P 500 index and the DJIA, were chosen for the vast number of listed
companies on the indices. The S&P 500 index was included since the 500 largest
publicly traded companies are included in the index (Standard & Poors’ 500 index
factsheet, n.d.). The DJIA was included due to the listed companies are of the 30
6

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

largest in the U.S (Dow Jones Industrial Average factsheet, n.d.). The nine indicators
were chosen based on widespread use by market participants and an extensive
amount of previous research.
Previous research focuses primarily on how indicators have measured the
development of the U.S. economy and stock markets, but research that encompasses
other countries’ stock markets was also included in the current study. Many of these
countries have developed economies and stock markets that have similarities with the
U.S. stock market. Furthermore, the timeframe for the data in the study was from
January 2019 to January 2021.

1.6 Structure of the Study
The study is divided into six sections. The first section includes the introduction and
background to the topic, the description of the problem, the delimitations of the
study, and the aims of the study. The second section contains the theoretical
foundation of the study and literature on how the indicators have performed in earlier
studies. The third section contains the methodology of the present study. Different
analytical methods are explained, and how the analyses are conducted will be
discussed. The fourth section contains the results of the analysis. The results of the
study will be presented and concurrently shortly discussed. In the fifth section, the
results are further discussed and compared to the findings of previous literature. The
discussion is divided according to the categories of the indicators. Limitations of the
current research are also presented. In the sixth section, concluding remarks and
suggestions for future research are made.

2 Theories and Literature Review
The objective of this section is to present the theories of the topics relevant to this
study. That is the presentation of how and why the business cycle fluctuates, its
connection to the stock market, and theories related to what determines the
development and the returns of the stock market. Later, the indicators and results
from earlier studies will be presented.
The theories, directly and indirectly, relate to how the indicators function and how
they can be used in understanding the stock market. Some indicators, such as
business cycle indicators, are more directly based on theories related to how the
business cycle fluctuates. However, the fluctuations of the business cycle and the
fluctuations of the stock market share commonalities, creating the possibility of
using the indicators in relation to the stock market. Indicators, such as
macroeconomic indicators, are explained as factors affecting the stock market, being
a part of stock market pricing theories attempting to explain the variation of stock
market development and returns. The indicators, the methods they are constructed
and how they measure economic activity, and, in turn, how the economic activity
affects the stock market, are varying. Therefore, to understand the context of the
present study and the indicators, relevant theoretical concepts are presented.
The first part of this section can be described as an introduction, presenting the
theoretical foundation of how the stock market and business cycle functions and the
indicators’ use in relation to them. The latter part, in turn, can be described as a
literature review, in which the indicators included in the study are presented and
results how they have been researched in relation to the stock market are described.
This section begins with a short introduction to business cycles, followed by the
presentation of linkages between the stock market and business cycles. Furthermore,
the stock market and theories related to it are described to understand what factors
influence the development of the stock market. The section ends with the
presentation of the indicators included in the present study and how they have
performed in previous studies in relation to the stock market.

2.1 A Short Introduction to Business Cycles
Business cycles show the aggregate movement of economic activity. The economic
activity can be classified into different turning points, peaks, and troughs, which
show the highest and lowest points of the economy (Zarnowitz, 1991). A business
cycle is characterized by recessions and expansions, which occur between the peaks
and troughs. Hence, the expansions and recessions lead to each respective turning
point of the business cycle. Recessions are periods when economic activity declines
for a more extended period, whereas expansions are the contrary (Zarnowitz, 1991).
The movement of the business cycle is a difference between the actual GDP and the
potential GDP (Eklund, 2013). When the actual GDP is above the potential GDP, the
economy is in an expansion. When the actual GDP is below the potential GDP, the
economy is in a recession (Eklund, 2013). Reasons for recessions could be caused by
external disruptions and negative outlooks for the future, and the Covid-19 pandemic
has fulfilled both abovementioned claims.
Some indicators attempt to predict the fluctuations of the business cycle. These
indicators are more commonly referred to as business cycle indicators. A well-known
business cycle indicator is the OECD Composite Leading Indicator (CLI).

2.1.1 The Stock Market and the Business Cycle
Research has demonstrated a connection between the stock market and business
cycles. A part of the current study has concentrated on analyzing the connection
between the stock market and the turning points of the business cycle.
A general notion is that when the economic activity increases, the stock market
prices increase due to increased economic output. When economic activity decreases,
the stock market prices decrease. The linkages between the stock market and the
business cycle have been observed from different viewpoints, through volatility, by
Perez-Quiros and Timmermann (2007), Raunig and Scharler (2010), and Hamilton
(1996), to name a few. Researchers observing volatility as the source of the
connection between the stock market and business cycles deem that a higher level of
10

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

volatility leads to a higher level of uncertainty regarding the economic activity.
Higher levels of uncertainty, in turn, lower consumption and investing, which causes
the business cycle to turn, and the economy affected.
A second researched link between the stock market and the business cycle is stock
market liquidity. The decline of liquidity in the stock market decreases the number of
participants in the stock market. Additionally, stock market liquidity has shown to
decrease before the business cycle has started a turning point for recessions (Naes et
al., 2010).
The stock market has even been shown to be used to predict business cycles (Franz,
2010). The stock index, S&P 500 index, used in Franz’s (2010) study could be
applied in forecasting business cycle turning points. Estrella’s and Mishkin’s (1998)
findings are in line with Franz’s (2010) findings. They studied how financial
indicators can be used in the prediction of U.S. recessions. One of the variables that
they included in their study was stock market prices. The results from the study
conducted by Estrella and Mishkin (1998) indicated that the stock market prices can
function as a leading indicator in the prediction of recessions by one to three
quarters. The connections between the stock market and business cycles can illustrate
why they often fluctuate in tandem and why a stock market crash often precedes a
recession.

2.2 Stock Market Theories and Asset Pricing Models
Stock market theories attempt to state what determines the stock market prices and
returns. The efficient market hypothesis and random walk hypothesis, which explain
how the prices and returns can be determined through how the markets and the assets
themselves function, are presented. In addition, theories that explain what factors
affect the stock market returns through asset pricing theories, such as the capital asset
pricing model and multifactor model of the arbitrage pricing theory, are presented.

11

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

2.2.1 The Efficient Market Hypothesis
The efficient market hypothesis states that all the information of the financial assets,
including the stocks in the stock market, is reflected in the asset’s price. The efficient
market includes all the information of the assets, and this information is ready to be
used by market participants (Malkiel, 2003).
In an efficient market, the stock market contains all the information that influences
the stock price. Further, when the information is incorporated in the stock price, there
is no major difference in the stock’s actual and intrinsic value (Fama, 1995). This, in
turn, means that there are no undervalued stocks in the efficient market theory. All
the information is always available for all the market participants, and this
information is random, then the stock prices at a random time are only affected by
the information available at that time (Malkiel, 2003).
Malkiel (2003) states that the efficient market receives critique by not taking
behavioral and psychological aspects of the markets into consideration. For instance,
the behavior of some market participants is sometimes irrational, and other market
participants can benefit from this. Malkiel (2003) argues that this implies that stock
prices and returns partially predictable. The efficient market hypothesis can therefore
be said to explain the development of stock market prices partly.

2.2.2 The Random Walk Hypothesis
The random walk hypothesis states the opposite of the efficient market hypothesis,
which is that the price of a stock is random (Fama, 1995). The historical values that
the stock market has had in the past have no connection with today’s value and
cannot be used in the prediction of future stock market values (Fama, 1995). In the
hypothesis, the actual value for an asset is ‘randomly walking’ from the intrinsic
value.
Fama (1995) argues that the random walk hypothesis can explain the changes in the
intrinsic and actual values of an asset. Changes in the intrinsic value cause underand over-adjustment of the asset’s actual value, and it takes time for the changes of
12

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

the intrinsic value to be reflected in the actual value. In addition, there is a time lag
that is independent of interference for the actual values to adjust to intrinsic values
(Fama, 1995). The change in the actual values may occur before the change has
occurred in the intrinsic value or afterward, reflecting the random nature of how the
values change.
Fama (1995) argues that the random walk hypothesis may not be entirely correct but
that there is some truth to the hypothesis. The price movements of the asset may not
be fully independent or dependent on historical price movements. The degree to how
dependent future price movements are on historical price movements defines the
possibility to predict future stock market prices.

2.2.3 The Capital Asset Pricing Model
The relationship between the expected return and risk of a stock is described in the
capital asset pricing model (Perold, 2004). The expected return is influenced by the
time value of money (the risk-free rate) and the market premium (Perold, 2004). The
market premium is the return of the market subtracted by the risk-free rate. How
much a market participant is willing to take more risk is represented by a risk
measure (beta), which compares the stock returns to the market and market premium.
The model states that diversification of the assets in a portfolio lowers the risk of the
portfolio, but there is still a correlation between the risks associated with the assets
(Perold, 2004). This means that there still are some levels of risks in the portfolio that
cannot be eliminated from the portfolio, which is represented by the beta. Therefore,
diversification of the portfolio cannot eliminate all the risks (Perold, 2004). The
objective then becomes to choose the level of expected return and risk from the
portfolio. The formula for the CAPM is the following:
Es = Rf+βi (Em−Rf)

(2.1)

Where:
Es= expected return of an asset,
Rf = risk-free rate,

13

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

Βi= beta of the asset,
Em= expected return of the market portfolio,
(Em−Rf)= market risk premium
The model has many variations that consider different economic factors. There is a
variation of the CAPM that takes foreign-exchange risk into account (e.g.,
international CAPM) (Dumas, 1994). CAPM and its extensions can further consider
other variables affecting asset prices, such as the state of the business cycle. A model
where the beta changes according to the business fluctuations is called the
conditional CAPM (Dumas, 1994).
The CAPM and the behavior of stock markets have been attempted to explain by
using business cycle indicators (Dumas, 1994). More specifically, economic activity
and stock market return. Dumas (1994) tested different capital asset pricing models,
such as the international and conditional international CAPMs. He concluded that
specific nonfinancial business cycle indicators could help predict stock market
returns and explain the behavior of the stock market. Dumas (1994) used the
indicators to help in determining if the conditional CAPMs functioned adequately,
that is if the indicators could explain the behavior of the stock market through the
conditional CAPMs. The author concluded that the international conditional CAPM
did function, which proved the relationship between the business cycle indicators and
stock market returns.
Two popular variations of the CAPM are the production-based asset pricing model
and the consumption-based capital asset model. These models will be shortly
presented next.

2.2.3.1 Consumption-based Asset Pricing Model
The consumption-based asset pricing model differs from the CAPM by replacing the
market risk with a consumption risk that affects the expected return of assets (Chen,
2003). The risk is associated with how owning an asset increases or decreases the
uncertainty in consumption. When a market participant has invested in a risky asset,
the market participant’s consumption may negatively turn because the market
14

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

participant’s total wealth may be negatively affected by the risky asset (Chen, 2003).
The model has a consumption beta that measures a consumption growth risk (Chen,
2003). According to Cochrane (1991), in the consumption-based asset pricing model,
stock market returns and consumer decisions affecting the marginal rates of
substitution are connected by a utility function. The utility function is based on the
results of the consumers’ decisions for an intertemporal consumption demand
(Cochrane, 1991).

2.2.3.2 Production-based Asset Pricing Model
Production-based asset pricing models attempt to link asset returns to production
variables (Cochrane, 1991). In addition, there is a relationship between returns of the
stock market and production-based variables. This relationship can be studied
through the production-based asset pricing model. Cochrane (1991) states that
variables affecting production are linked to asset returns. In the production-based
asset pricing model, the decisions made by companies on their production and
investment affect the marginal rates of transformation, which are tied together with
asset returns by a production function (Cochrane, 1991). The production function is
based on the producer’s decisions for intertemporal investment demand (Cochrane,
1991).

2.2.4 Arbitrage Pricing Theory – Multifactor model
The multifactor model of the arbitrage pricing theory connects macroeconomic
variables with stock market returns (Priestley, 1996). In the model, stock returns are
influenced by economic variables, such as unanticipated changes in risk premiums,
changes in the expected level of industrial production, unanticipated inflation, and
unanticipated changes in the shape of the interest rates’ term structure (Ross, 1976).
In the multifactor model, the asset’s return is affected by the asset’s expected return
and different macroeconomic variables that can increase or decrease the risk of the
asset (Priestley, 1996). According to the model, asset prices are not always correctly

15

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

priced, leading to opportunities for arbitrage. In the model, one can include multiple
macroeconomic variables that affect the risk and return of different assets. Further,
macroeconomic variables bring systematic risk and risk premiums (Priestley, 1996).
Additionally, the market participants are expected to diversify their portfolios based
on risks. The expected return of an asset is a linear function of the risk of the asset
relative to factors, such as macroeconomic variables (Ross, 1976). Next, the formula
of the multifactor model is presented:

Ri = Af+ (Bi1*L1) + (Bi2*L2)+…+Bn*Ln

(2.2)

Where:
Af = risk-free rate of return of the asset,
Ln = risk premium for the factor,
Bn = sensitivity of the asset in relation to a specific factor,
Ri = expected return of the asset

2.3 Indicators
The indicators included in the present study are assigned into three categories:
survey-based, macroeconomic, and the business cycle. The indicators differ in the
underlying methods, how they are constructed, and by what they measure. The only
‘pure’ business cycle indicator in this study is the OECD CLI. The PMIs are partly
business cycle indicators due to them measuring contractions and expansions in
relation to economic sectors. However, they also measure expectations and overall
sentiment in these economic sectors. Additionally, they are constructed by surveys
and ‘soft’ data, which is why they are grouped in the survey-based category.
Composite indicators can be used for gaining an understanding of stock market
fluctuations. Additionally, depending on what variables they cover, they can be
argued to provide a more comprehensive picture of stock market fluctuations than
using single economic indicators. Furthermore, composite indicators can eliminate
irregularities that single indicators produce (Ficthner et al., 2007)). Composite

16

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

indicators can be constructed by many variables such as financial and economic
variables or by grouping together different questions, such as it is done by the PMIs.

2.3.1 Macroeconomic indicators
Macroeconomic indicators are used in discovering and determining the stock market
fluctuations, price changes, and stock market returns. Chen (2009) observed how
macroeconomic variables are used to predict the U.S. bear stock market in the S&P
500 stock market index. The best performing variables that the author used in the
prediction of bear markets were the variable yield curve spreads and the variable
inflation rates. Chen (2009) also argues that using macroeconomic variables in the
prediction of bear markets surpasses the performance of predicting stock returns with
macroeconomic variables.
Chen et al. (1986) studied different macroeconomic variables and how they affect
expected stock returns in asset pricing. The macroeconomic variables that affected
expected stock returns the most were industrial production, changes in the yield
curve, and risk premium. Furthermore, during volatile times unexpected inflation and
changes in expected inflation were significant in determining expected stock returns
(Chen et al., 1986). Furthermore, the variables had a more significant effect on the
expected returns than the New York Stock Exchange index.
Rapach et al. (2005) studied how macroeconomic variables can help in predicting
stock market returns in 12 different countries. They included macroeconomic
variables, such as the inflation rate, money stocks, interest rates, term spreads,
industrial production, and unemployment rate. Of all the included macroeconomic
variables, the predictive ability of interest rates performed best in all the observed
countries. However, the authors concluded that stock returns are difficult to predict
since speculation and other factors constitute most stock returns, and the predictable
part of stock returns is negligible.
The results of what variables affect the stock market the most are conflicting.
Frequently studied variables are, for instance, money supply, industrial production
and manufacturing, interest rates, unemployment, and inflation. The results from
17

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

previous studies vary depending on the researched country and how developed the
country’s economy is. Moreover, many macroeconomic variables affect each other,
and historical changes in the variables can be used in predicting the current values of
the variables (Serfling & Miljkovic, 2011).
Indicators that measure macroeconomic factors present information about the stock
market when lagged. Celebi and Hönig (2019) observed how lagged indicators in the
German economy present information on the DAX30 stock index development. The
study was divided into three periods: a pre-crisis period, a post-crisis period, and a
crisis period, where some ECB countries were under economic duress. During the
crisis period, the lagged indicators impacted the companies listed on the DAX30
more than they did during the pre-and post-crisis periods (Celebi & Hönig, 2019).

2.3.1.1 The Producer Price Index
The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures price movements in domestic production
(BLS, n.d.c). The PPI is published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
The PPI has been observed to both affect the stock market returns and to have an
effect on how the stock market develops (Flannery & Protopapadakis, 2002; Sirucek,
2012). An increase in the PPI shows an increase in inflation, affecting the level of
returns of the market portfolio (Flannery & Protopapadakis, 2002). Sirucek (2012)
studied how macroeconomic variables affect the development of the S&P 500 index
and the development of the DJIA index. Sirucek (2012) concluded that the PPI had a
negative impact on the development of the stock indices. Additionally, the
relationship between the development of the DJIA index and the PPI was more
significant than the relationship between the PPI and the development of the S&P
500 index.
Macroeconomic news and information influence the stock market, foreign exchange,
and the U.S. bond market (Suk Joong et al., 2004). Information and news related to
the PPI and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) influence how the U.S. stock market
develops (Suk Joong et al., 2004). The authors discovered that a significant positive
effect in mean stock market returns emerged when the PPI and CPI were lower than
previously expected. In comparison, negative inflation news resulted in minor stock
18

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

market returns. In addition, Suk Joong et al. (2004) concluded that the stock market
returns are affected predominantly by news related to price levels and inflation, while
the stock market, foreign exchange, and the bonds market are affected by
information and news explicitly related to the PPI.

2.3.1.2 The Consumer Price Index
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change in prices of goods and
services that are paid by the consumer (BLS, n.d.a). The CPI is published by the BLS
monthly. Flannery and Protopapadakis (2002) concluded that the CPI functions as a
risk factor to stock market returns. The relationship between the CPI and the stock
market is similar to the relationship between the PPI and the stock market. An
increase in either the PPI or the CPI shows an increase in inflation, affecting the
market portfolios’ returns.
Hamid et al. (2006) researched the price transmission between the following
variables: CPI, PPI, S&P 500 index, and DJIA. The price transmission varied
through three different time periods, 1926-1945, 1946-1972, and 1972-2003. The
authors concluded that during the most recent time period (i.e., 1972-2003), the CPI
and the PPI did not significantly affect the DJIA and S&P 500 index. The DJIA and
the S&P 500 index did not affect the PPI or the CPI.
Serfling and Miljkovic (2011) researched the relationships among macroeconomic
variables and the S&P 500 index. The relationship between the S&P 500 index and
the CPI was influenced when one of the variables changed (Serfling & Miljkovic,
2011). The authors concluded that historical changes in the money supply, S&P 500
index, industrial production index, and the CPI could predict changes in the S&P 500
index. In addition, historical changes in interest rates, the S&P 500 index, dividend
yield, CPI, and the money supply can be used in predicting changes in the CPI
(Serfling & Milkovic, 2011).

2.3.1.3 The Industrial Production Index
The Industrial Production Index (IPI) is an indicator in the U.S. measuring the actual
output from manufacturing, gas and electric utilities, and mining (Federal Reserve,
19

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

n.d.). It is published monthly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System. The index reports changes in production, and an increase in the index, in
turn, shows growth in the manufacturing industries.
The IPI is extensively studied in relation to general economic development and the
stock market. Sirucek (2012) observed a statistically significant relationship between
the DJIA and the IPI. Indication on how industrial production affects stock market
development was presented in the study conducted by Humpe and Macmillan (2007).
In their study, they researched how macroeconomic variables affect stock market
development in the U.S. and Japan. Their results indicated that the U.S. and Japanese
stock markets were positively affected by industrial production. Further, interest
rates and inflation negatively influenced the U.S. stock market, and the money
supply negatively influenced the Japanese stock market.
Industrial production has also been studied in relation to developing countries.
Rahman et al. (2009) studied how selected macroeconomic variables affect the stock
market prices in the Malaysian stock exchange. The results from the study indicated
that of the selected variables, industrial production strongly affected the development
of stock market prices.
The IPI, together with other macroeconomic variables, and their historical values,
can be used in predicting the stock market. Historical values of the IPI, interest rates,
the money supply, CPI, and the S&P 500 index can be used in predicting current
changes of the S&P 500 index (Serfling & Miljkovic, 2011). Even historical values
of the S&P 500 index, interest rates, and the IPI can be used in predicting changes in
the IPI.

2.3.2 Business Cycle Indicators
Business cycle indicators attempt to anticipate the economy’s fluctuations. These
indicators are often constructed by different variables attempting to forecast
economic activity. Additionally, they can be used to forecast the peaks and troughs
of the business cycle. The business cycle indicator included in this study is the
OECD CLI.
20

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

2.3.2.1 The Composite Leading Indicator
The CLI is made by the OECD for most of the OECD countries. The CLI is used to
predict turning points in the business cycle (OECD, 2021). The CLI’s components
are short-term economic indicators in the form of time series. The components of the
CLI are leading indicators of the GDP (OECD, 2021). The composition of variables
in the CLI depends on the country that its business cycles it measures. The choosing
of the variables depends on certain criteria (Fichtner et al., 2009). The component
must have an economic reason for the leading relationship with GDP. The
component may cause business cycle fluctuations or measure economic activity at
certain stages of the business cycle (for instance, early housing starts) (Fichtner et al.,
2009). The component must lead the GDP, and the data must be timely. The number
of components (5 to 11) in the CLI are country-specific (Fichtner et al., 2009).
Additionally, the components of the CLI are weighted and make the CLI a diffusion
index (OECD, 2021). The components of the U.S. CLI are the following: Weekly
hours worked: manufacturing, Manufacturing-Industrial confidence indicators,
Spread of interest rates, Consumer confidence indicator, Work started for dwellings,
Net new orders-durable goods, and the share prices of the NYSE Composite (OECD
CLI Turning Points of Reference Series and Component Series, 2021).
The CLI has been studied in relation to the stock market during different business
cycle phases (Dzikevičius & Vetrov, 2011). The composition of different asset
portfolios’ risk and return are affected by how the assets are weighted in the portfolio
and how they account for the fluctuations of the business cycle. If the business cycle
fluctuations are considered while choosing the assets into the portfolio, it is possible
to maintain the risk and return at levels chosen by the market participant
(Dzikevičius & Vetrov, 2011). Additionally, the stage of the business cycle affects
the stock market. In the recovery and expansion stage, the stocks are rising in value
and they are affected favorably, while the stocks are affected negatively by the
shrinking of the business cycle (Dzikevičius & Vetrov, 2011). Furthermore,
reallocation of stocks in portfolios during recessions can help in keeping the risk at a
manageable level (Dzikevičius & Vetrov, 2011).
Celebi & Hönig (2019) studied how different variables affect the German stock
index DAX30 index. The OECD CLI for the German economy was one of the
21

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

variables the authors included in the study. Celebi and Hönig (2019) concluded that
by conducting an OLS regression with a maximum of four lags, the variables
influenced the DAX30 index returns. Further, the German OECD CLI was measured
to have a positive relationship with the development of the DAX 30 index. The
relationship was observed to be the strongest when the OECD CLI was numbered
with three lags in the OLS regression.

2.3.3 Survey-based Indicators
The survey-based indicators use ‘soft’ data in gauging the opinions of their
respondents. The indicators are constructed by surveys directed to participants in the
manufacturing and service sectors (i.e., the PMIs) and to consumers (i.e., the
Consumer Sentiment Index). The surveys ask how the economy is currently and how
the respondents think that it will be in the future.

2.3.3.1 The Purchasing Managers’ Index
The PMIs are survey-based indicators that measure trends in manufacturing and
service sectors, and they are sent to the companies’ executives that operate in the
sectors (ISM n.d.a; IHS Markit, 2017). The surveys ask the executives if they think
that the economic activity in the sectors is shrinking, continue to stay the same, or is
expanding (ISM, n.d.a). The PMIs deliver information about the current economic
situation and the future expectations that the executives have related to the industry
in which the companies they work in operate. The first PMIs were surveys presented
to companies operating in the manufacturing sector, and later PMIs have been
developed for companies operating in the services sector as well. The most notable
PMIs are developed by Markit Economics and by the Institute for Supply
Management (ISM).
The PMIs values range from 0 to 100. The values between 0 and 49 state that the
economic activity in the sector is shrinking. The value 50 means that economic

22

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

activity in the sector remains the same, and a value above 50 means that the
economic activity is expanding in the sector (ISM, n.d.).
The PMIs are diffusion indices, with questions that are equally weighted in the index
(ISM, n.d.a; IHS Markit, 2017). The areas that the questions cover depends on if the
survey is directed to the manufacturing or service sector. The questions in the
manufacturing PMIs are intended to specifically cover manufacturing-related areas,
such as questions regarding employment, inventories, backorders, and supplier new
deliveries (ISM n.d.a; IHS Markit, 2017). The questions in the service PMIs are
related to the business activity, new orders, supplier deliveries, and employment
(ISM, n.d.b).
The formula for the PMIs follows a general diffusion index:
PMI = (P1 *1) + (P2* 0.5) + (P3*0)
P1 in the formula represents the percentage of executives that report expansion, P2
represents the percentage of executives that have reported that the economic activity
remains the same, and P3 represents the percentage of executives that have reported
that the economic activity is shrinking. The number 1, 0.5, and 0 respectively stands
for expansion, the economic activity remaining the same, and for the shrinking of the
economic activity.
Previous studies examining the relationship between the stock market and PMIs have
shown varying results. Dovolil (2016) studied the relationship and the predictive
power of different economic indicators, including the PMI, in relation to the S&P
500 stock index. Dovolil (2016) observed that the PMI was lagging the S&P 500
index by one month. Johnson and Watson (2011) observed a statistically significant
relationship between the manufacturing PMI published by the ISM and certain stock
market returns. The PMIs forecasting ability has been demonstrated in relation to
economic indices and the U.S. industrial economy (Jeon & Ji-Hong, 2017). Jeon and
Ji-Hong (2017) demonstrated that the PMI has a positive relationship with the PPI
and IPI in the U.S., that is, a change in the PMI often precedes a change in the PPI
and IPI.
Hu et al. (2017) analyzed how variables affect the S&P 500 index futures. They
asked 13 experts which variables market participants follow to determine when they
23

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

invest. One of the variables that the experts suggested that the market participants
follow was the ISM manufacturing PMI. Hu et al. (2017) further analyzed how the
variables affect the S&P 500 index futures and other futures. They concluded that
market participants observe the ISM manufacturing PMI when investing in the S&P
500 index futures. The ISM manufacturing PMI has also affected the fluctuation of
S&P 500 index futures and DJIA index futures, but other variables (e.g., US dollar
index, interest rates) in the study had stronger explanatory power in the prediction of
the rate of return of S&P 500 index futures (Hu et al. 2017).
In the current study, the ISM Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs, IHS
Markit Manufacturing PMI, and the Chicago PMI are included. The PMIs are
included in the present study to answer the aim; to observe how similar indicators
have performed before and during the pandemic. The PMIs will give regional
(Chicago PMI) and national (all the other PMIs) perspectives to the current study.

2.3.3.2 The Consumer Sentiment Index
The Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) measures consumer-related activities through
a survey, and it describes consumer behavior and their expectations of the economy
(Curtin, 2002). The index is survey-based, and it is published monthly. The idea
behind studying the CSI in relation to the stock market development derives from
that the consumers, with their spending and confidence, affect the economy and
stock evaluation.
Otoo (1999) examined the relationship between the fluctuations of stock prices and
the Consumer Confidence Index. Otoo observed that when companies increase in
equity values, then consumer confidence increase. In addition, Otoo (1999) noted
that consumers use the fluctuations of the stock market as an indicator of future
economic development.
The relationship between the stock market and consumer sentiment can be divided
into a long and short relationship depending on the timeframe. The long relationship
between the stock market and consumer sentiment has been observed to be almost
non-existent (Christ & Bremmer, 2003). However, there is a short relationship in
24

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

which the stock market affects consumer confidence. Christ and Bremmer (2003)
propose in turn that expected changes in consumer sentiment are reflected in the
stock market prices.
Charoenrook (2006) observed how consumer sentiment affects stock returns over the
periods 1979-2000 and 1955-2000. The research observed that the consumer
sentiment index could be used in the prediction of stock returns. Charoenrook (2006)
concludes that the changes in consumer sentiment work best as a predictor for excess
stock market returns at a timeframe of one month and at a timeframe of one year.

3 Methodology
This section begins with the presentation of the research method and design of the
present study. Further, the information about the data, variables and, how the data is
transformed before analyzed in the study are presented. The section follows with the
presentation of the different analytical methods in the study. It concludes by
presenting the validity of the research method and threats to validity.

3.1 Research Method and Design
There are three general research methods identified by Creswell and Creswell (2018,
pp. 41): quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research methods. According to
Creswell and Creswell (2018), quantitative research tests measurable variables by
examining their relationships. In addition, quantitative methods include statistical
analyses and interpretations. Quantitative research methods usually examine
relationships between different variables and attempt to understand the associations
or the causality between them (Creswell & Creswell, 2018 pp. 206). Furthermore, in
quantitative methods, the independent and dependent variables must be identified to
describe the relationship between the variables (Creswell & Creswell, 2018 pp.206).
Creswell and Creswell (2018 pp. 49) identify that research methods include different
research designs that provide an outline, which states the procedures of the different
research methods. The different research methods can use many specific research
designs. Three standard research designs are descriptive, exploratory, and casual
designs (Cooper & Schindler, 2011). Exploratory design can be used when the
problem does not have a clear definition, and there are no clearly defined hypotheses
(Cooper & Schindler, 2011 pp.129). One of the main objectives of the descriptive
research design is to discover associations among variables (Cooper & Schindler,
2011 pp. 134-135). The research methodology in the present study follows a
quantitative research method with a part descriptive and part exploratory design.

3.2 Data, Time period, and Data sources
The including of the indicators for the present study are based on few criteria. The
indicators must be researched in relation to stock market development. The
indicators’ data must be publicly available, either from the original sources or from
third-party sources. Additionally, reputable institutions and organizations must
publish the indicators. Furthermore, the indicators must measure some economic
aspect of the U.S. economy.
The two stock market indices are the study’s dependent variables, while the
indicators are the independent variables. The time period of the data is from January
2019 to January 2021. The time period is chosen to notice if Covid-19 has caused
observable short-term changes in the indicators’ performance before and after the
stock market crash in March 2020.
The indicator and stock market data are gathered from publicly available sources.
The CPI and PPI data are gathered from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS, n.d.b;
BLS, n.d.d). The IPI data is gathered from Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, n.d.). The
Chicago PMI data is gathered from the Institute for Supply Managers - Chicago
chapter (Institute for Supply Managers- Chicago n.d.). The OECD CLI data is
gathered from the OECD (OECD, 2021). The ISM Manufacturing PMI and the ISM
Non-Manufacturing PMI data are collected from the Institute of Supply Chain
Management (ISM, n.d.a; ISM, n.d.b) and from the indicator website
tradingeconomics.com (United States ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index, n.d.; United
States ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI, n.d.). The IHS Markit PMI data is gathered
from the IHS Markit website and from the indicator website tradingeconomics.com
(IHS Markit US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, n.d.). The University
of Michigan’s CSI data is gathered from the University of Michigan (University of
Michigan, n.d.). Both stock indices are gathered from finance.yahoo.com (Dow
Jones Industrial Average (2 February 2021); S&P 500 index (2 February 2021).

3.3 Variables
3.3.1 Independent Variables
3.3.1.1 Survey-based Indicators
The ISM Manufacturing PMI is an indicator that is published monthly by the
Institute for Supply Chain Managers. It is an indicator based on a survey directed to
purchasing managers in manufacturing companies. The survey is a composite
indicator divided into five sections. The sections are the following: employment,
production, inventories, new orders, and supplier deliveries (ISM, n.d.a).
The ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI is an indicator published monthly based on a
survey directed to the purchasing managers in non-manufacturing companies (service
sector). The ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI is a composite index with four sections:
business activity, new orders, supplier deliveries, and employment (ISM, n.d.b).
The IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI is an indicator based on a survey directed to
purchasing managers in manufacturing firms. The survey is divided into five
differently weighted sections: output, employment, delivery times, new orders, and
stocks of purchases. New orders and the questioned companies differ from the ISM
manufacturing PMI (IHS Markit, 2017).
The Chicago PMI measures the economic activity of manufacturing and service
industries around Chicago. It is an indicator based on a survey sent to purchasing
managers in manufacturing and service companies in the Chicago area. It is a
composite index with equally weighted parts. The survey is divided into new orders,
production, order backlogs, supplier delivery, and employment (Institute for Supply
Managers- Chicago, n.d.).
The CSI is published monthly by The University of Michigan, and it is a surveybased indicator. The survey consists of five questions asked to consumers regarding
how they perceive their financial situation, how it is expected to change during the
next year, how business conditions are expected to change during the next year and
the next five years. Furthermore, when is it a preferable time to spend much money
(University of Michigan, Surveys of Consumers n.d.).

3.3.1.2 Macroeconomic Indicators
The CPI measures the price difference of consumer products and services over time.
The CPI used in the study is the consumer price index for all urban consumers with
all items in American cities on average (BLS, n.d.a).
The PPI measures the changes in product prices of U.S. domestic production over
time. The PPI included in the current study is the producer price index of final
demand on all industries (BLS, n.d.c).
The IPI is a monthly published indicator in the U.S. It measures the output from
manufacturing, gas and electric utilities, and mining. The index reports changes in
the production and growth in the index show growth in manufacturing industries
(Federal Reserve, n.d.).

3.3.1.3 Business Cycle Indicator
The OECD (CLI) is used to predict turning points in the business cycle). It is
constructed by more minor economic and financial components, which can function
as leading variables for the GDP. The OECD publishes composite leading indicators
for almost all OECD member countries (OECD, 2021).

3.3.2 Dependent Variables
The stock market is represented by the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average
(DJIA) stock index and the value-weighted Standard & Poors’ 500 stock index
(S&P500 index). The S&P 500 index includes 500 companies covering almost all
market capitalization in the U.S. (Standard & Poors’ 500 index factsheet, n.d.). The
DJIA, in turn, covers 30 multinational companies that act in all industries except
transportation and utilities (The Dow Jones Industrial Average factsheet, n.d.).

3.4 Data pre-processing
Before the analyses can be conducted in the present study, the indicators’ data and
the stock indices’ data must be transformed. The indicators are transformed based on
their index type (See Table 3). Depending on the indicator, different transformations
are conducted. Additionally, indicators that are volume indices have different base
periods. Therefore, the base periods must be transformed so that they show accurate
measurements for the time period of the present study. Further, these indicators’ base
periods are calculated to the base periods of January 2019. The new base period for
the volume indices will be calculated by the following formula:

New Index Value = (Old Index Value/ New Base Value of Index) X 100

(3.1)

Furthermore, the stock indices’ data must be transformed. The data is composed of
the stock indices’ daily closing prices. Further, the stock indices’ closing prices are
published daily, while all the indicators included in the current study are published
monthly. The stock indices’ data is transformed instead of the indicators’ data, due to
that daily data is easier to transform to monthly data. Therefore, the stock indices’
daily closing prices are transformed by calculating the arithmetic mean of the daily
closing prices for each month of the time period of the current study. This makes the
indicators and the stock indices comparable in analyses.
Depending on the index type, further data transformation is done. The natural
logarithm is used to stabilize the variance (Shumway & Stoffer, 2011 pp.63).
ln x

(3.2)

Logarithmic transformation is conducted to both stock indices and the following
indicators: PPI, CPI, IPI, and the CSI. The PMIs and the OECD CLI are diffusion
indices, where the change between two index values is already measured. Further,
another technique that is used to transform the data to exhibit stationarity is first
differencing.
Y(i) = X(i)-X(i-1)

(3.3)
30

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

First differencing is performed to all the indicators and to the two stock market
indices. Differencing is usually used to exclude the non-stationary behavior time
series exhibit (Shumway & Stoffer, 2011 pp.62). Log transformation (for chosen
variables) and differencing (for all variables) help in making the indicators and stock
market indices stationary and prepared for further analysis.

3.5 Correlation
Correlations are conducted to measure how the stock indices move in relation to the
indicators. Correlation presents the strength of the association between two variables,
but it does not show the strength of causation nor if the variables are affected by
some other factors. In this study, the Pearson correlation method is used. The
Pearson correlation method measures the correlation between the values of -1 and 1
(Nettleton, 2014). The value of 0 informs of no correlation. The value of -1 informs a
perfect negative correlation in which the two variables move in opposite directions.
The value of 1 informs a perfect positive correlation in which two variables move in
the same direction. Correlation informs of the linear relationship between the
variables (Nettleton, 2014). The relationship between the stock indices and the
indicators shall be observed first by using correlation and then cross-correlation
Correlation and the correlation significance will also be tested between the independent
variables of the study. The independent variables that have the lowest correlation and
correlation significance among themselves will be used later in multiple linear regression
analysis. High correlation values between independent variables indicate that a change in
one of the independent variables may cause a change in another independent variable. This
will cause the regression model to contain flaws which will reduce the precision of the
model.

3.6 Cross-correlation
Cross-correlation measures similarities in two time series, and it is used to map lagand lead relationships between the time series (Shumway & Stoffer, 2011 pp.26).
The leading Xt-1 and lagging Xt+1 relationship are expressed in correlations between
the two time series with values between -1 and 1. Cross-correlation is used in gaining
information at which time the two time series correlate the most. The relationship
between the indicators and the stock indices will be further analyzed by crosscorrelation. This will show how and in what way the indicators can be used in the
prediction of the stock market indices. The strongest correlation and at what time this

32

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

occurs will be measured, and the indicators’ ability to serve as leading, coincident, or
lagging indicators will be further observed.

3.7 Regression Models
Four different regression models will be conducted in the analysis. Firstly, a simple
linear regression model to observe the level of significance a single independent
variable has on the dependent variables. Secondly, a simple linear regression model
that uses lagged values. The lagged values will be obtained from the crosscorrelation analysis. The lagged variables that have the highest correlation values
will be used in the lagged simple linear regression model. The indicators that will be
chosen for the multiple linear regression will be chosen by the results from the
correlation and correlation significance test between the independent variables. The
indicators that correlate the least and have the smallest correlation significance levels
with each other will be chosen for the multiple linear regression model.
The simple linear regression shows the relationship between the dependent variable
and a single independent variable. The Yi is the predicted dependent variable value,
Xi is the independent variable, β1 is the slope of the line, β0 is the intercept, and the ϵ
is the error estimate (Shumway & Stoffer, 2011 pp.48).
Yi=β0+β1Xi+ ϵ

(3.4)

Multiple linear regressions will be conducted with the coincident correlation values
of the indicators and with lagged values. The lagged values will be taken from the
cross-correlation analysis. The Yi is the dependent variable, Xi are the independent
variables, β0 is the intercept, each dependent variables slope coefficient βp, and ϵ is
the error term (Shumway & Stoffer, 2011 pp.48).
Yi=β0+ β1Xi1 +β2Xi2+...+βpXip+ϵ

(3.5)

The simple linear regression models measure how single variables affect the
variation in the stock indices, while the multiple regression models measure how
many independent variables can measure the variation of the stock indices’ values.

3.9 R and R Packages
The analysis of the data was performed using the software R (R Core Team, 2020). A
combination of the R software’s base operations and operations from other packages
was performed throughout the analysis of the data. Operations from the package
dplyr were performed to the collected data, so that the indicators and stock market
indices were comparable (Wickham et al., 2020) (see section Data pre-processing).
For the visualizations of the indicators and stock market indices’ data the package
ggplot2 was used (Wickham, 2016). For the correlations and regression models, the
analyses were performed mainly by operation from the base package of R. However,
operations from the package dynlm were also performed for the regressions (Zeiles,
2019).

3.10 Validity and Threats
Validity in research determines how accurately the researched concept or construct is
measured (Heale & Twycross, 2015). The aspects regarding the validity of research
depend on what type of research is performed (Roe & Just, 2009). For instance, the
validity is affected if the research is performed as quantitative or qualitative research
and if the research is conducted as experiments or surveys. That is, the research
approach and structure affect the validity.
Validity can be categorized in many ways. For the present study and for quantitative
and qualitative studies in general, external and internal validity are aspects of validity
that influence the research method. According to Roe and Just (2009), internal
validity concerns that the correlations in a study are of causal nature. This implies
that the independent variables can be proven to influence the dependent variables.
External validity, in turn, concerns that the results from the study can be generalized
outside the study to other studies, people, and concepts. Furthermore, validity can be
divided into subtypes, such as criterion validity, construct validity, content validity,
and face validity (Taherdoost, 2016). Criterion validity can further be divided into
predictive validity, concurrent validity, and postdictive validity. Similarly, construct

34

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

validity can be further divided into discriminant validity and convergent validity
(Taherdoost, 2016).
Heale and Twycross (2015) argue that content validity, construct validity, criterion
validity, and their subtypes affect quantitative research. Content validity can be
described as the extent to which an instrument in a study accurately measures all the
content in relation to a variable. Construct validity can be described as the extent to
which an instrument measures the variable. Criterion validity refers to how the
instrument correlates with other instruments that measure the same variable, that is,
how related they are (Heale & Twycross, 2015).
Internal- and external validity is affected by threats (Jenkins-Smith et al., 2017). For
instance, the variables included in a study may or may not affect and explain the
phenomena that are researched. Correlation may be discovered with variables in a
study, but not causation. There can be other factors that affect the researched
phenomena that are not included in the study, and these factors could be determined
afterward to be of major importance. All this can be described to be threats that
affect the external- and internal validity of the study. Jenkins-Smith et al. (2017)
present regular threats to the external- and internal validity. Threats for internal
validity can be categorized into these different categories: History; unexpected
events that occur during the experiment can affect the researched subject or
dependent variable. Maturation: Changes that can affect the dependent variable or
participants in a study, such as aging. Selection bias: to reduce selection bias in a
study, randomization of the participants can be performed. Experimental mortality:
Participants can cancel their participation in a study. Statistical regression: extreme
scores in regression models can move towards the mean. Instrumentation: The
measurement process is changed, or it is unreliable. Testing: pre-test results can
influence the results in a test (Jenkins-Smith et al., 2017).
Threats for external validity are described as following by Jenkins-Smith et al.
(2017): Testing; Pre-testing or other tests and measurement can affect similar tests
and measurements. Experimental setting: The participants may be affected by the
setting and not act normally because of it, making the results untransferable from the
experiment. Sample representation: The sample may reflect the population poorly,
undermining the possibility to generalize the results. Interaction of selection bias and
35

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

experimental treatment: selection bias in the choice of participants in a study can lead
them to be sensitive to the experiment, altering the results of a study. Interaction with
testing: The participants can be influenced by a test in a study affecting the results of
another test, which, in turn, can influence the generalization of the test (JenkinsSmith et al., 2017).

4 Empirical findings
The empirical findings of the study are presented according to the performed
analytical method. The findings are briefly discussed and compared in this section. A
deeper analysis and discussion of the results are performed in the fifth section of the
present study. This section begins with presenting the results from the correlation of
the indicators with the stock indices. It continues by presenting the results from the
indicators’ correlation and correlation significance test and by the cross-correlations.
The results from the regression models are presented last.

4.1 Indicators’ Correlations with the Stock Indices
Table 4 presents the nine indicators’ correlations with the two stock market indices.
Each indicator is correlated individually with the two stock market indices.

The indicators with the highest correlation with the S&P 500 index are the CSI, the
CLI, and the CPI. Interestingly, the highest positive correlations are with indicators
belonging to different categories. Furthermore, all the macroeconomic indicators
show positive correlations with the S&P 500 index, while the survey-based
indicators show more variation in their correlation values. The CSI has the highest
positive correlation, followed by the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI, the IHS Markit
PMI, and the ISM Manufacturing PMI. The Chicago PMI shows a low negative
correlation with the S&P 500 index.
The CSI has the highest positive correlation with the DJIA, followed by the CLI and
the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI. Furthermore, all the macroeconomic indicators
show a positive correlation with the DJIA, whereas the PPI has the lowest
correlation. There is more variation in the correlation values of the survey-based
indicators and the DJIA. The CSI has the highest positive correlation, followed by
the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI, the IHS Markit PMI, ISM Manufacturing PMI,
and the Chicago PMI.
The indicators’ correlations with the DJIA present similar results as the indicators’
correlations with the S&P 500 index. The similar results can be explained by the
almost identical development of the stock market indices during the timeframe of
2019 to 2021.
The indicator that displays the lowest correlation values with the stock market
indices is the Chicago PMI. Further, the Chicago PMI displays slightly negative
correlation values with the stock market indices. It can be explained by that the
Chicago PMI measures regional companies’ economic activities, which do not reflect
the national companies’ economic activities listed on the DJIA and S&P 500 index.
Interestingly, the indicator that has the highest positive correlation with both stock
market indices is the CSI. The CSI describes consumer behavior and their
expectations of the economy (Curtin, 2002), and the consumers’ expectations have
40

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

been negatively affected by Covid-19. Furthermore, this could explain the high
positive correlation the CSI has with the stock indices, especially by connecting the
stock market crash and fallen consumer sentiment.

4.2 The Indicators’ Correlation and Correlation Significance
Table 5 displays the indicators’ correlations and correlation significances. The
correlation and correlation significance analysis of the indicators will decide which
indicators will be included as the independent variables in the multiple linear
regression models. Furthermore, the exclusion of indicators that display too high
correlation and correlation significance from the multiple linear regression models
will make the models more precise.
The indicators that display the highest correlation with other indicators are the CLI,
the IPI, and the IHS Markit PMI. These three indicators will be excluded from the
multiple linear regression models. Additionally, many other indicators display high
correlation significances, which would affect the precision of the multiple linear
regression models. Therefore, other indicators that will be excluded from the
multiple linear regression models are the ISM Manufacturing PMI, ISM NonManufacturing PMI, and the CPI. The exclusion of these indicators will minimize the
multicollinearity in the multiple linear regression models. The indicators that are
excluded from the multiple regression models belong to the different indicator
categories.

The indicators that will be included in the multiple linear regression models are the
CSI, the PPI, and the Chicago PMI. Furthermore, these indicators will be assigned as
the independent variables in the multiple linear regression models. Interestingly, two
indicators belonging to the survey-based category and one to macroeconomic will be
included in the multiple linear regression models. The indicators’ correlation and
correlation significance test display that the CSI, the PPI, and the Chicago PMI are
not as likely to be affected by changes in other indicators as indicators with high
correlation and correlation significance.

4.3 Cross-correlations
Table 6 presents the cross-correlations between the indicators and the DJIA. The
lagging months are shown under positive lags, and the leading months are shown
under the negative lags. The bolded values are the highest positive correlations.

The indicators in Table 6 display the highest correlation values under +1 positive lag
with the DJIA. In other words, the indicators are lagging the DJIA with one month.
The indicators that have the highest positive correlation under the +1 lag are the IPI,
the CLI, and the CPI. Additionally, due to that, the highest positive correlation values
are under the +1 lag, the indicators display almost no leading abilities in relation to
the DJIA. However, some minor positive correlation values between the DJIA and
the indicators during leading months can be observed. Notably, the PPI with a
positive correlation value of 20% under the leading lag of -1. However, the
correlation values under the leading months are too minor to affect the development
of the DJIA.

From Table 7 can be observed that the indicators’ highest positive correlations are
under the +1 lagging month. Further, the indicators that have the highest positive
correlations are the CLI, the IPI, and the IHS Markit PMI.
The cross-correlations between the indicators and the DJIA (see Table 6), and the
cross-correlations between the indicators and the S&P 500 index (see Table 7)
display similarities. In both analyses, the highest positive correlations are under the
+1 lag. Furthermore, this implies that the indicators are lagging the stock market
indices by one month. Additionally, almost no leading abilities can be observed for
the indicators, and the correlations that can be observed under the leading lags are
too minor to affect the development of the S&P 500 index and the DJIA.

4.4 Simple Linear Regression and Lagged Simple Linear
Regression
The intention of the simple linear regression models is to determine how significant
the effect the indicators have in relation to the S&P 500 index and the DJIA. Firstly,
the results from simple linear regression models are presented. Secondly, the lags
with the highest positive correlation values from the cross-correlations are included
for the indicators in simple linear regression models with lagged variables. The
purpose of performing simple linear regressions with lagged values is to observe if
the lagged values generate a better fit for the model.

DJIA.

Performing the simple linear regression with coincident times for the independent
and dependent variables displays mostly nonsignificant values with one exception.
The exception being the CSI, with a p-value of p <.05. The CSI also has the highest
explanatory power of 14% (10% adjusted multiple R2). However, from the results
can be observed that the indicators do not explain the variation of the DJIA when
using coincident times for the indicators.

The results of the simple linear regression with the indicators and the S&P 500 index
as the dependent variable are displayed in Table 9. The results are similar to the

46

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

simple linear regression with the DJIA as the dependent variable (see Table 8). All
the indicators have a nonsignificant effect on the S&P 500 index.
Performing the simple linear regressions with coincident times for the independent
variables shows nonsignificant effects on the development of the DJIA and the
development of the S&P 500 index. In conclusion, using coincident times for the
indicators is unreliable in explaining the development of the values of the S&P 500
index and the DJIA.

The IPI, the CLI, the IHS Markit PMI, the CPI, the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI,
the CSI, and the PPI show very strong significance (p ≤ .0001). Further, the Chicago
PMI and the ISM Manufacturing PMI show strong significances (p ≤ .001).
Interesting changes can be perceived when simple linear regressions are conducted
with lagged independent variables. All the indicators generate a better fit, show
strong significances, and present higher R2. The cross-correlations (see Tables- 6 and
48

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

7) showed that the indicators lagged by (t+1), and the results from the simple linear
regression models with lagged independent variables effectively strengthened the
notion that the indicators do lag the stock indices during January 2019 to January
2020. In other words, the stock indices have fluctuated before the indicators, and the
indicator values have moved afterward, showing that no leading abilities can be
observed.

The indicator that performs the best in the multiple linear regression model with the
DJIA as the dependent variable is the CSI. The CSI displays a significant result,
while the other indicators do not. This, however, do not explain the development of
the DJIA.
The simple linear regression models (see Tables- 8 and 9) and the multiple regression
models (Tables- 12 and 13) display, that using coincidental times for the independent
variables make the models unsuitable in describing the development of the stock
indices. Therefore, the two following multiple linear regression models use the
lagged values from the cross-correlations.

that all the indicators in the model have a statistically significant effect. The

The multiple linear regression model with the S&P 500 index as the dependent

51

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

Chicago PMI has the highest significance level, followed by the CSI and the PPI.
The explanatory power of the model is circa 77% (Adjusted R2 is .74).
The results from the multiple linear regression models with lagged independent
variables display similarities. The models show an adjusted R2 nearing 75% (74%
and 74.95%, respectively), and the indicators have similar p-values. The similarities
can be mainly explained by the similar development of the stock indices during the
time period of January 2019 to January 2021.
The findings from the cross-correlation analyses imply that the indicators could not
be used in predicting the stock indices’ values and that they have been lagging the
stock indices. This notion has been enhanced by the results from the regression
models and by the difference in the results when the regressions are performed with
and without lagged variables. In conclusion, the analyses have shown that the
indicators lag the stock market indices.

5 Discussion
The empirical findings are further analyzed and linked to the previously presented
theories and studies in this section. The section starts by discussing factors associated
with the stock market crash and factors that have affected the indicators. Further, the
section continues in discussing the results of individual indicators according to which
group they belong to.
The Covid-19 pandemic caused a shock that continues to affect companies’
economic activities and countries’ economies. The stock market was early to be
affected, eventually leading to the stock market crash in March 2020. The reasons for
the crash can be argued to be caused by many factors. The pandemic led to
widespread uncertainty, and market participants started to expect the worst that could
occur. Furthermore, the regulations and restrictions that governments implemented to
combat the virus further increased the uncertainty. Additionally, the economic
activities of companies were restricted, and the companies had to implement new
policies to continue operating under new regulations. However, the regulations did
not directly affect the stock market, but different economic factors associated with
the indicators
The stock market could have been affected by a decline in liquidity and large
amounts of debt. The federal reserve started to provide more liquidity to the market
to encourage participation in the financial markets (Cox, 2020). Additionally, stock
market liquidity has shown to decrease before the business cycle has started a turning
point for recessions (Naes et al., 2010). One may also argue that the assets may have
also been too overvalued and in need of a correction.
The S&P 500 index and DJIA return predictability and price volatility have been
determined to be affected by a structural break during the onset of the pandemic
(Hong et al., 2021). Hong et al. (2021) argued that the break occurred explicitly
during the selling of stocks by members of the U.S. Senate before the stock market
crash of March 2020. Additionally, after the break, the predictability of returns and
price volatility increased. Hong et al. (2021) describe that the stock market crashed
after the U.S. senate members sold their stocks, highlighting information asymmetry
between market participants. The price volatility had a similar development as the
53

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

stock market returns predictability. Furthermore, Hong et al. (2021) conclude that the
stock market was affected by market inefficiency. In other words, the stock market
lacked efficiency in respect to the lack of information the market participants had.
Additionally, it can be argued that the stock market prices did not accurately reflect
their intrinsic value, affecting the risks and returns for market participants, leading to
implications to the risks and returns associated with asset pricing models.

Chart 4 The development of the stock indices.

The pandemic has had varying effects on the different indicators included in the
current study. The effects depend mainly on what the indicators measure and how the
outcome has been affected by the stock market, Covid 19, and regulations made to
lessen the spread of Covid-19. Whether it is production, consumption, sentiment, or
other measurable factors, the indicators have had one thing in common: the
indicators’ values fell during the times of the stock market crash. However, the stock
market crash may have only been an onset for recession, and other factors may have
54

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

affected the indicators more than the crash itself. Government regulations made to
combat the spread of Covid-19 have negatively affected different economic sectors
and the economy. Walmsley et al. (2020) estimated that the mandatory closure of
businesses has negatively affected the GDP and employment in the U.S., mainly due
to the reduction of production and indirectly by a loss of demand in labor. This, in
turn, has negatively affected other economic sectors. Furthermore, the consumer and
consumer spending have been negatively affected by Covid-19. Income and wealth
losses, a reduction in aggregate consumer spending, and negative outlooks on the
future, especially regarding employment, have influenced the consumer negatively
(Goibion et al., 2020). Additionally, del Rio-Chanona et al. (2020) describe that
different industries have and will encounter supply and demand shocks during the
Covid-19 pandemic. Industries, such as health and food and necessities, have had an
increase in supply and demand, while industries such as hotel, restaurant, travel, and
transportation have had a decrease in demand. Industries, such as mining,
manufacturing, and service, have been more affected by changes in the supply (del
Rio-Chanona et al., 2020).
.

5.1 Discussion: Results
5.1.1 Survey-based Indicators
The general objective of the PMIs is to observe and gauge how economic activity in
different industries develops (ISM, n.d.a; ISM, n.d.b; IHS Markit, 2017). The
questionnaires are sent to many companies operating in the manufacturing and
service industries, covering many questions on different economic factors affecting
the industry. Therefore, it can be argued that the PMIs could reflect companies’
economic activities more clearly, than indicators that measure a single economic
factor, such as inflation. However, this could also be interpreted the other way, that
is, the PMIs could offer a too narrow view of the economy, especially to be able to
effectively be used in the prediction of the development of the stock market indices.
The PMIs in the current study have shown mixed results depending on the performed
analytical method. The indicators’ correlations with the stock indices (Table 4)
55

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

present mostly positive, but also negative correlations. The Chicago PMI displays
negative correlations for both stock indices, while the other PMIs show positive
correlations for both stock indices. The reason may be that the Chicago PMI
measures economic activity in the Chicago area, in which the regional perspective is
not large enough in reflecting the development of the S&P 500 index or the DJIA
index.
The cross-correlations (Tables -5 and 6) show similar findings for all the PMIs, that
is, the highest correlation values emerge when the PMIs are lagged by one month.
The PMIs’ cross-correlations are in line with the findings of Dovolil (2016). The
indicators’ correlation and correlation significance (Table 7) display high correlation
significance values for all the PMIs except for the Chicago PMI. The reason can be
argued to be the same as in the findings of the indicators’ correlations with the stock
indices. That is, the Chicago PMI measures economic activity in the Chicago area,
and the regional view is too minor in comparison to indicators that measure
aggregate economic factors of the whole country. The same reasoning can be applied
to why the other PMIs have higher correlation significance values with other
indicators. That is, they cover more companies operating nationally, which are
therefore affected more by aggregate economic factors.
Furthermore, the indicators’ correlation and correlations significance (Table.7) led to
that all the PMIs, except the Chicago PMI, were excluded from the multiple linear
regression models. It was somewhat excepted, due to that the PMIs have been
observed to correlate with other indicators, such as the IPI and the PPI (Jeon & JiHong, 2017). Additionally, the PMIs positively correlated with each other and with
other indicators, such as the CLI, clarifying that the PMIs are affected by the
development of other indicators and that the PMIs also affect other indicators’
development. In conclusion, the PMIs might fit better for analyzing other economic
factors than the stock indices.
Performing the simple linear regressions with coincidental times (Tables -8 and 9)
did not show any meaningful results. However, the simple linear regressions with
lagged independent variables (Tables -10 and 11) show significant results for all the
PMIs. Previous studies have concluded that the PMIs significantly affect and have a
positive relationship with the stock market through studying the effect the PMIs have
56

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

on stock returns and stock market index futures (Johnson & Watson, 2011; Hu et al.,
2017). In the current study, the relationship between the stock market and the PMIs
has been further elaborated through the stock indices’ closing prices and the PMIs.
However, in the current study, the relationship was only observed when the PMIs
were lagged, which is in line with Dovolil’s (2016) research.
The PMIs showed a slightly negative development in the indicator’s values during
2019 (see Chart 5). This is contrary to the development of the two stock indices
during 2019, which continued to rise throughout the year. The IHS Markit PMI and
the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI continued to remain above the level of 50 during
the year, while the ISM Manufacturing PMI and the Chicago PMI fell below 50. The
Chicago PMI had the largest fluctuations compared with other PMIs, while the IHS
Markit PMI had the most neutral development hovering above 50. All the PMIs fell
after the stock market crash and after the U.S. government implemented regulations.
The values fell as low as 35, showing that the companies answering the survey had
highly negative outlooks on the future. This continued for a few months, but the
values rose quickly and had somewhat similar developments afterward during 2020.
However, the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI continued to stay around 55 after the
stock market crash. The indicator values imply that the companies operating in the
service sector had more negative outlooks on the future and may have been more
affected by the regulations and restrictions. It can be argued that the PMIs
developments are more in line with the recession than they are with the stock market
crash, due to the values started already to fall during January and February of 2020,
and the NBER stated that the U.S. economy entered a recession in February 2020
(NBER, n.d.).

58

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

The CSI shows positive correlations with the stock market indices (Table 4) and
relatively high positive correlation and correlation significance values with the other
indicators (Table 5). However, the correlations are minor enough for the CSI to be
included in the multiple linear regression models. The cross-correlations (Tables -6
and 7) show that the highest correlations are observed for the CSI when the indicator
is lagged by one month (t+1).
The CSI was the only indicator that showed a significant result in the simple linear
regression with the DJIA as a dependent variable (Table 8). It also showed a minor
significant effect on the DJIA in the multiple linear regression model (Table 13).
However, the explanatory power of the model was still insignificant. The CSI
showed significant results on the DJIA and S&P 500 index while lagged in both the
simple linear regression models and the multiple linear regression models,
solidifying that the indicator was lagging the stock indices in the current study.
Christ and Bremmer (2003) argued that consumer sentiment and the stock market
display a short-run relationship, in which consumer sentiment follows the
fluctuations of the stock market. These similarities can be drawn with the current
study; however, other factors have played a major role in the development of the
CSI.
Consumer sentiment fell during the stock market crash of March 2020, and it did not
recover to the previous values before the crash, as many other indicators did. This
can be linked with the negative expectations consumers had for their personal
economy due to Covid-19. Consumers were not only affected by negative
expectations on the future but by lockdowns, business closures, and loss in
employment, eventually leading to a decrease in consumer spending (Goibion et al.,
2020; Walmsley et al., 2020). Additionally, stock market crashes and negative
economic news increase consumers’ uncertainty and decreases consumer’
expectations (Van Dale et al., 2017).
Many factors can be argued to affect consumer sentiment during Covid-19, one of
them being the stock market crash. The stock market crash may have been one of the
first factors to which consumers reacted, leading to the initial fall of consumer
sentiment. This would be in line with Otoo’s (1999) observation that the consumer
uses the stock market fluctuations as an indicator for future economic development.
59

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

However, the difficulties faced by the U.S. economy and the difficulties related to
the personal economies of consumers continued to be influenced during the
pandemic, leading to low consumer sentiment values continuously, especially when
the virus spread, affecting more people and more industries, leading to negative job
prospects and uncertainty in the people’s future wellbeing.
Interestingly, the CSI is the only indicator in the current study fully concentrating on
the consumer, and it shows a drastic development during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The consumer can be argued to be more affected by Covid-19 and government
regulations than by the stock market crash. The argument is strengthened by that the
indicator continued to report low values after the stock market indices had already
risen.

Chart 6 The development of the CSI.

5.1.2 Macroeconomic Indicators
The macroeconomic indicators included in the current study consisted of two
indicators concentrating on inflation (CPI and PPI) and one on production (IPI). The
discussion of the results of macroeconomic indicators is also performed by following
this division.
Macroeconomic indicators and their relationship and effect on the stock market have
been extensively researched, through asset pricing theories and as individual
variables affecting the stock market and stock returns. One of the often-researched
60

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

macroeconomic indicators is industrial production (Rapach et al., 2005; Chen et al.,
1986; Serfling &Miljkovic, 2011; Humpe & Macmillan, 2007). However, the use of
either the CPI or PPI as variables measuring inflation is also common.
The macroeconomic indicators included in the current study have shown positive
correlations with the S&P 500 index and the DJIA (Table 4). It is somewhat
unexpected that the PPI and CPI showed positive correlations with the stock indices,
due to that in earlier studies, inflation has often negatively affected the stock market
(Humpe & Macmillan, 2007; Flannery & Protopapadakis, 2002; Sirucek, 2012; Suk
Joong et al., 2014). A rise in the indicators’ values have often led to that the stock
returns and stock market valuation have fallen, due to that, inflation diminishes the
purchasing power.
The cross-correlations (Tables -6 and 7) show that both indicators are lagging the
stock indices by one month (t+1). Interestingly, Serfling and Milkovic (2011)
demonstrated that historical values of the CPI, together with other variables, could be
used in predicting changes in the S&P 500 index. However, the results from the
current study could not replicate the results of Serfling and Milkovic (2011). Another
difference to the study made by Serfling & Miljkovic (2011) is that the CPI in the
current study had too high correlation and correlation significance values with the
other indicators, leading to it being excluded from the multiple linear regression
models. However, the PPI was included in the multiple linear regression models,
showing a significant effect on both stock indices when lagged. The results of the
PPI and CPI in the current study are also different from the results of Sirucek’s
(2012) study. In Sirucek’s (2012) study, the PPI had a more significant relationship
with the DJIA than with the S&P 500 index when no such results were observed in
the current study.
In conclusion, the cross-correlations showed the highest correlation values at t+1,
implying that the two indicators have lagging abilities. This was confirmed by the
results from the simple linear regressions and from the results of the multiple linear
regression models, showing that the indicators were unreliable to be used in the
prediction of the stock market indices during the time period of January 2019 to
January 2021.

61

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

Interestingly, the CPI and the PPI measured a decrease in values during the stock
market crash of 2020 (see Chart 7). Furthermore, the values of the PPI fell more than
the values of the CPI, followed by a sharp increase in the values. This implies that
there was a larger change in the selling prices of producers than the change in prices
paid by the consumers. The PPI values also rose faster and to higher levels than the
CPI. Furthermore, the rise could be linked with short-term inflation. If the rise would
continue, then long-term inflation could occur, which would eventually affect the
stock market prices and returns of the market portfolio (Flannery & Protopapadakis,
2002). The reasons for the fall of the PPI and CPI can be partly explained by
government regulations and lockdowns. For instance, there was a reduction in
demand for hotels and restaurants, and the hospitality industry, resulting in a fall in
PPI values (Mendez-Carbajo, 2021). The rise of the values can be credited to the
normalization of many industries that had been affected by Covid-19.
Industrial production has been shown to influence stock market development, stock
market prices, and stock returns (Sirucek, 2012; Humpe & Macmillan, 2002;
Rahman et al., 2009; Rapach et al., 2005). In the current study, the IPI had shown to
follow the development of the stock indices, in other words, the development of the
IPI can be partly explained by the development of the stock indices. The crosscorrelations (see Tables- 6 and 7) show that the IPI had the highest positive
correlation values with the S&P 500 index and the DJIA when lagged (t+1). In other
words, the indicator values followed the stock indices by one month.
The IPI was excluded from the multiple regression models due to it having high
correlation significance values with almost all the other indicators. This was
somewhat expected due to that industrial production has been demonstrated to be
strongly linked with other macroeconomic indicators. Additionally, changes in other
indicators have been described to be able to be used in predicting values of the IPI
(Serfling & Miljkovic, 2011). The IPI is also strongly linked with the PMIs due to it
measuring changes in the manufacturing industries.
The notion that the IPI follows the stock indices by (t+1) was strengthened when it
showed insignificant results in the simple linear regression models (see Tables -8 and
9). Additionally, by showing significant results in the simple linear regressions with

62

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

lagged indicators (Tables -10 and 11), concluded that the indicator has been lagging
the development of the stock indices during Covid-19.
The fall in the indicator values of the IPI during 2019 was short-lived (see Chart 7).
The decrease in industrial output can be mainly argued to be caused by the
lockdowns and business restrictions that started in the first quarter of 2020 (Dunford
et al., 2020). However, the values of IPI rose rapidly after the lockdowns and
regulations were implemented, showing a fast adaptation in manufacturing, mining
and gas and electric utility companies to the changes the regulations had. In other
words, the connection between the fall of the indicator values and the stock market
crash can be argued to be negligible.

5.1.3 Business Cycle Indicator- CLI
The OECD CLI’s objective is to measure and anticipate the turning points of the
business cycle (OECD, 2021). The indicator measured the latest trough in the
business cycle to have occurred in May 2020 (OECD CLI: Turning Points of
64

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

Refence Series and Component Series, 2021). The indicator shows positive
correlations with the S&P 500 index and the DJIA index (see Table 4) and high
correlation and correlation significance values with the other indicators (Table 5).
The high correlations with other indicators can be explained by that the components
of the CLI are related to the other indicators (for instance: manufacturing-industrial
confidence, weekly hours worked in manufacturing, consumer confidence and share
prices of the NYSE composite, OECD CLI: Turning Points of Reference Series and
Component Series, 2021). High correlations were observed with the IPI the PMIs,
which led to the exclusion of the CLI in the multiple regression models.
The high correlations with other indicators can also be argued to be linked with the
phase of the business cycle. An expansion in the business cycle is connected with
economic growth, and a downturn in the business cycle is connected with shrinking
economic activity (Zarnowitz, 1991). For instance, the high correlation with the IPI
shows the connection between the growth in manufacturing industries and the
business cycle.
The CLI’s cross-correlations with the S&P 500 index and the DJIA (see Tables- 6
and 7) show that it is lagging the stock indices with one month. Furthermore, the
lagged CLI in the simple linear regression model shows a significant effect on the
stock indices, when performing the simple linear regression with coincidental times
show insignificant effects. The results are in line with the results from Celebi and
Hönig (2019).
Another connection with results from previous studies can be observed. Dzikevičius
and Vetrov (2011) describe that the stage of the business cycle affects the stock
market, and the risks and returns. Furthermore, the shrinking of the business cycle
negatively affects the stock market. The NBER determined that the recent peak in the
business cycle occurred in February 2020 (NBER, n.d.), in which afterward the
business cycle started to shrink, reaching the trough in May 2020. The CLI started to
report lower values in February 2020 (see Chart 8), showing some indication that the
stock indices’ values might fall, but the stock market crash was short-lived, and the
downturn for the whole economy lasted longer. One may argue that this made the
indicator unreliable to be used in relation to predict the stock market development.

Chart 8 The development of the CLI.

5.2 Limitations
During the conduction of the current study, Covid-19 was still ongoing, and all the
effects that it had on the stock market, indicators, and the economy were still
unknown. Therefore, the current study was unachievable to describe all the factors
that influenced the indicators and the stock market.
This study was conducted using the time frame of January 2019 to January 2021. To
observe and describe the full effects of Covid-19 had on the indicator’s performance
in relation to the stock market, a longer time frame would have been preferable. This
would have made the analyses more accurate in observing the effects of Covid-19
and in assessing how well the indicators performed in relation to the stock market. A
longer time frame would have also made it possible to divide the time frame into
periods: before, during, and after Covid-19, making it possible to make comparisons
on how well the indicators have performed.
Additionally, analyzing monthly data instead of daily data has its own shortcomings
when using a short time frame. All the changes in the stock market and indicators
cannot be fully perceived. This, in turn, makes the findings from the analyses not as
detailed as the possible findings from using daily data.
It could be argued that more comparable indicators and stock market indices should
have been used in the study. For instance, studying indicators that measure economic
activity in certain industries and then choosing stock market companies that operate
in these industries could have led to more reliable results. There are also other
66

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

possible approaches that could have been used. The number of indicators could be
argued to be too few to be able to research the phenomena from enough different
perspectives. However, one factor fundamentally limiting the number of indicators
was the limited access to the data for different indicators. Many indicators are
published by private institutions, limiting the access without having certain
credentials or by simply making the access to the indicator data cost.
There are sophisticated analytical methods that could have better explained the
relationship between the indicators and the stock market indices. Additionally,
describing the effects of Covid-19 on the indicators and stock market indices. The
analytical methods included in the study were of familiar use to the author and
provided essential information about the relationships between the variables,
ultimately leading to their use in the current study.

67

6. Conclusion
The main aim of the study was to understand how the indicators can explain the
variation of the stock market indices’ values and how they have been affected by
Covid-19. The time period for the data of the indicators ranged from January 2019 to
January 2021. Nine indicators and two stock market indices were included in the
study. The indicators were divided into different categories, determined by what and
how they measure economic activity. Further, the indicators were compared by other
similar ones. Additionally, the indicators were analyzed in relation to the stock
market indices, that is, if they display leading, coincident, or lagging information in
relation to the stock market indices.
To understand the context of the present study, that is, how the stock market has
developed during the pandemic, and how the indicators have been affected by Covid19, theory related to business cycles and the stock market was presented.
Additionally, why, and how the business cycle fluctuates and how the stock market
and business cycles are connected were described. Further, stock market
development theories, such as the random walk hypothesis and efficient market
hypothesis were presented. Furthermore, asset pricing models, such as the capital
asset pricing model and its extensions and the arbitrage pricing theory were
described. The indicators were also thoroughly described, and the results of previous
research in which the indicators were studied in relation to the stock market were
presented.
The current study was conducted as a quantitative study with various analytical
methods. However, before the analysis was conducted, minor data processing was
performed, including logarithmic transformation and the first difference.
Additionally, the performed data processing depended on the indicators’ index type.
The analysis began by conducting correlations with the indicators and the stock
market indices. This was followed by measuring the indicators’ correlation and
correlation significance. In addition, cross-correlations with the indicators and the
two stock market indices were performed. Following the correlation tests, simple
linear regressions were conducted with the indicators as independent variables and
the stock indices as dependent variables. Further, simple linear regressions that used
the lagged values for the indicators from the cross-correlations were conducted.
68

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

Multiple linear regression analyses with the indicators with the lowest correlation
and lowest correlation significance values with each other were conducted. Lastly,
multiple linear regression analyses that used lagged values for the indicators were
performed.
The indicators’ correlations with the stock market indices were positive, except the
correlations of the Chicago PMI. The indicators’ correlation and correlation
significance resulted in six of the indicators being excluded from the multiple linear
regressions. The indicators that were included for the multiple linear regressions
were the following: CSI, PPI, and Chicago PMI.
The results from the cross-correlations show that the indicators’ highest correlation
values with the stock market indices occur when lagged by one month (t+1).
Furthermore, performing simple linear regression analyses show insignificant results,
except for the CSI when the DJIA was the dependent variable. However, performing
the simple linear regressions with lagged independent variables showed significant
results for all the indicators. Additionally, similar results were observed when
performing the multiple linear regression analyses. That is, insignificant results when
performing the multiple linear regressions with coincidental times for the indicators
and stock indices, and significant results when performing the multiple linear
regressions with lagged values for the indicators.
The results from the analyses indicate that the indicators from January 2019 to
January 2021 were lagging the stock market indices. In other words, the fluctuations
of the stock market indices precede the movement of the indicators. From this can be
concluded, that the indicators could not be reliably used to predict the stock market
from January 2019 to January 2021 or the stock market crash of March 2020. In
addition, the indicators’ values developed differently after the stock market crash,
depending on how the measured activity had been affected by Covid-19. For
indicators in the survey-based category, most of the PMIs returned to similar levels
as before the stock market crash, while the CSI continued to stay on a lower level
than before the crash. It can be argued that Covid-19 and government regulations
have affected the consumer more than it has the manufacturing or service sectors,
leading to a decrease in consumption. The macroeconomic indicators except for IPI,
in turn, have risen above the previous levels before the stock market crash. The PPI
69

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

and CPI have risen sharply, leading to concerns of short-term inflation. The
possibility of long-term inflation was unknown during the making of this study. The
business cycle indicator, OECD CLI, had started to report lower values after the
business cycle peak of February 2020 (NBER, n.d.). However, the indicator was
unable to predict the fluctuations of the stock market indices fully.
In conclusion, the indicators could not reliably explain the developments of the stock
indices during the time period of January 2019 to January 2021. Many factors,
directly and indirectly, affected the development of the indicators and the stock
indices, mainly effects of regulations the U.S. government implemented to combat
Covid-19.
The current study has made a preliminary description of the indicator’s performance
during Covid-19. This study’s results could help in explaining what factors have
affected the indicators, and how the indicators’ relationship with the stock market has
developed during Covid-19. The findings of this study are essential in understanding
how the indicators can be used by market participants in analyzing stock market
development.

6.1 Future Research
The results from the current study and the results from earlier studies show that the
indicators have performed varyingly depending on the country and time frame used
in the studies. Furthermore, there are other factors that affect the indicators and the
stock market. For instance, an economy that continues to change and globalize and
rapidly developing technology that affects different economic sectors may ultimately
lead to different results in future research. Therefore, concentrating on a single
indicator by observing a longer time frame could be preferable. This way, all the
factors affecting the indicator and the phenomena behind them could be thoroughly
researched. Additionally, any changes in the indicator’s construction method could
be observed.
Regarding the current study, how well the indicators have performed in relation to
the stock market during the Covid-19 pandemic is still unknown. The implications of
70

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

what Covid-19 have had on the stock market and indicators can only be completely
understood in the future when the pandemic is over.
Future research could concentrate on researching fewer companies listed on the stock
market or perform the research as a case study. Research could concentrate on
companies that operate in a specific industry and select the corresponding indicators
measuring economic activity in that industry. For instance, selecting to research a
manufacturing company could narrow down the selection of indicators and show
more concrete results. This would also make it easier to understand the reasons why
and how the company’s stock market value fluctuates.

Swedish Summary - Svensk Sammanfattning
Covid-19, Indikatorer och Aktiemarknaden – Utvärdering av Indikationer i
förhållande till Aktiemarknaden under Coronapandemin

Inledning
Coronapandemin har orsakat mycket fluktuationer och osäkerhet på den amerikanska
aktiemarknaden. En av de största följderna som pandemin fört med sig är kraschen
av aktiemarknaden i mars 2020. Kraschen som blev en början för recession i USA
(The National Bureau of Economic Research, n.d.).
Aktörer på aktiemarknaden kan använda sig av olika redskap för att underlätta
agerandet på aktiemarknaden. Redskapen stöder aktörerna i deras beslut om att delta
i aktiemarknaden. Ekonomiska och finansiella indikatorer är exempel på den här
typen av redskap. Indikatorerna kan vara till nytta för att försöka förutspå hur
aktiemarknaden fluktuerar och hur värdet på aktiemarknadsindex utformas.
Indikatorerna kan indelas i grupper beroende på typen av information de ger, till
exempel om produktion och konsumtion, och det ändamål som de kan användas till.
Indikatorerna visar information som kan användas för att förstå förfluten, aktuell och
framtida utveckling av aktiemarknaden.
Vilka indikatorer och hur bra de har mätt utvecklingen av aktiemarknaden har
varierat under olika recessioner (Stock & Watson, 2003). Det finns även variation i
hur väl indikatorerna har presterat under olika tidsperioder och i olika länder (Rapach
et.al, 2005). Sammanfattningsvis kan det påstås att vissa indikatorer har varit
inkonsekventa, medan andra har presterat bättre i flera studier. Ett exempel på detta
är konsumentprisindexet. Konsumentprisindexet har både rapporteras ha en ickesignifikant effekt på S&P 500 indexet (Hamid et.al, 2006) och en signifikant effekt
då den har studerats tillsammans med flera variabler (Serfling & Miljkovic, 2011).
Charoenrook (2007) har kommit fram till att konsumentens sentimentindex (eng.
Consumer sentiment index, egen översättning) kan användas till att förutspå
aktiemarknadens avkastning (Charoenrook, 2003). Christ och Bremmer (2003)
hävdar i sin tur att aktiemarknaden påverkade indikatorn, men att indikatorn i sig inte
hade någon effekt på aktiemarknaden.

72

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

Industriproduktionsindexet verkar vara en av de indikatorer som har presterat bättre.
Tidigare forskning tyder på att den påverkar aktiemarknaden signifikant (Humpe &
Macmillan, 2007; Serfling & Miljokovic, 2011; Rahman et.al, 2009). Ytterligare har
en del indikatorer också visats kunna förklara variationen i aktiemarknaden bättre då
de har förvandlats till tidsförskjutna variabler (Celebi & Hönig, 2019).

Syfte och ämnesmotivering
Syftet med denna avhandling var att tydliggöra hur olika indikatorer kan användas
för att förutspå aktiemarknaden. För detta ändamål har nio indikatorer valts. I
avhandlingen inkluderades: OECD:s sammansatta ledande indikatorer (eng.
Composite Leading Indicator, egen översättning), ISM produktionsinköparindex
(eng. ISM Manufacturing PMI, egen översättning), ISM tjänsteinköparindex (eng.
ISM Service PMI, egen översättning), IHS Markit inköparindex (eng. IHS Markit
PMI), Chicago inköparindex (eng. Chicago PMI), producentprisindex,
konsumentprisindex, konsumentens sentimentindex (eng. Consumer sentiment index,
egen översättning) och industriproduktionsindex. Aktiemarknaden representerades av
S&P 500 index och DJIA index.
Huvudsyftet med avhandlingen var att undersöka hur indikatorerna fungerat under
coronapandemin i relation till utvecklingen av den amerikanska aktiemarknaden och
om de kan användas till att förutspå dess utveckling. Vidare var syftet att få
förståelse för hur väl indikatorerna kan användas i olika sammansättningar, det vill
säga om utvecklingen kunde förstås bättre genom att använda en eller flera
indikatorer. Dessutom jämfördes liknande indikatorer med varandra för att se vilka
av dem fungerar bäst.
Orsaken till att studien utfördes var att utreda om indikatorerna kan användas av
deltagare på aktiemarknaden och beslutsfattare i olika organisationer. Att kartlägga
olika indikatorers prestationer i relation till aktiemarknadens utveckling är viktigt för
att det hjälper aktörer på aktiemarknaden att avgöra vilka indikatorer det lönar sig
följa och använda innan de fattar ett investeringsbeslut. Ytterligare är studien aktuell
och ger värdefull information om coronapandemins effekter på ekonomin.

73

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

Metod och redogörelse för undersökningen
Avhandlingen följer en kvantitativ forskningsmetod. Indikatorerna inkluderades i
avhandlingen baserat på bland annat följande inklusionskriterier: de måste mäta
amerikansk ekonomisk aktivitet, de måste vara publicerade av välkända institutioner
eller organisationer och det måste finnas tidigare forskning om dem i relation till
aktiemarknaden.
För att besvara forskningsfrågorna begränsades datainsamlingen till tidsperioden från
januari 2019 till januari 2021. Indikatorerna var oberoende variablerna i
avhandlingen, medan aktiemarknadsindexen var beroende variablerna.
D första analyserna som utfördes var korrelationer mellan aktieindexen och
indikatorerna. Styrkan av associationerna mellan indikatorerna och aktieindexen
prövades. Sedan analyserades korrelationer och signifikansen av korrelationerna
bland indikatorerna. Korrelationerna och de signifikanta resultaten av dessa avgjorde
vilka indikatorer som kunde användas i en senare multipel regression. För att förstå
sambandet mellan indikatorerna och aktieindexen gjordes korskorrelationer.
Korskorrelationerna i sin tur förklarar hur indikatorerna och indexen förhåller sig till
varandra. Resultaten från korskorrelationerna användes senare i en enkel lineär
regression och i en multipel regression där de oberoende variablerna var
tidsförskjutna. Enkla lineära regressioner och enkla lineära regressioner med
tidsförskjutna variabler gjordes med alla variabler. Multipla regressioner utfördes för
att kartlägga relationen och signifikansen av indikatorerna och aktieindexen.
Analyserna gjordes i programmet R(ref).

Resultat
Alla de indikatorer som inkluderats i denna avhandling förutom Chicago
inköparindexet hade en positiv korrelation med S&P 500 indexet och DJIA indexet.
Korrelationerna och korrelationssignifikanserna bland indikatorerna antydde att
Chicago inköparindexet, konsumentens sentimentindex och producentprisindexet
uppfyllde kraven för att inkluderas i de multipla regressionerna. Övriga indikatorer
hade för starka korrelationer och korrelationssignifikanser för att multikollinearitet
skulle ha kunnat uteslutas. Resultaten från korskorrelationerna för både DJIA indexet
74

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

och S&P500 indexet visade att alla indikatorer släpar efter aktieindexen med en
månad. Resultaten från de enkla lineära regressionerna var icke-signifikanta.
Resultaten från de enkla lineära regressionerna med tidsförskjutna variabler var
däremot signifikanta för varje indikator. Ytterligare var resultaten från den multipla
regressionen icke-signifikanta. Resultaten från de multipla regressionerna med
tidsförskjutna variabler var signifikanta för varje indikator.

Diskussion och avslutning
Avhandlingen fokuserade på ett aktuellt tema, det vill säga på att utvärdera hur väl
indikatorerna fungerat under coronapandemin. Avhandlingen har gett en inblick i
detta. Resultaten från tidigare forskning har kunnat konstatera att det finns mycket
variation i hur indikatorerna har presterat. Resultaten från denna avhandling kan i
stort sägas gå i linje med tidigare studiers resultat. Dock fanns det ett par undantag. I
denna avhandling hade Industriproduktionsindexet endast en effekt på aktieindexen
då indikatorn varit tidsförskjuten, medan tidigare forskning rapporterat att den alltid
haft en signifikant effekt oberoende om den var tidsförskjuten eller inte (Humpe &
Macmillan,2007; Serfling & Miljokovic, 2011; Rahman et.al, 2009). Resultaten för
Producentprisindexet och Konsumentprisindexet påverkade aktiemarknadsindexen
enbart då de var tidsförskjutna, vilket skiljer sig från vad tidigare forskning
konstaterat (Hamid et.al, (2006).
Det är värt att notera att det i denna studie uppstod signifikanta resultat för varje
indikator då de var tidsförskjutna, vilket är i linje med resultaten av Celebi och Hönig
(2019). Detta kunde tyda på att då man tidsförskjuter variabler ökar det
signifikansen. Utgående från detta kan det konstateras att indikatorerna följer
utvecklingen i aktiemarknaden och efter att förändringen i aktiemarknaden har skett
förändras även värden i indikatorerna.
Det finns faktorer som påverkar hur bra indikatorer går att använda i relation med
aktiemarknadens utveckling, vilket även denna avhandling ger stöd för. Tidsperioden
som man väljer för analyserna spelar en stor roll, ju längre tidsperiod desto tydligare
svar kan man förvänta sig. Det finns dock också problem med att välja en alltför lång
tidsperiod. Indikatorerna kan utvecklas och flera variabler kan läggas till i dem,
vilket försvårar användningen av indikatorerna under en längre tidsperiod och kan
75

Anton Kiukkonen: Covid-19, Indicators, and the Stock Market

även förändra dess prestation. Det bör även noteras att aktiemarknaden också
förändrats under en längre tidsperiod och att varje recession kan orsaka förändringar
i ekonomin, vilket kan påverka hur aktierna har presterat före och efter ekonomiska
kriser. Dessutom utvecklas den globala ekonomin hela tiden. Multinationella företag
verkar i olika länder och då ekonomiska kriser sker i ett land kan det antingen
påverka andra länder eller inte. Ju mer ekonomin globaliseras desto mer globaliseras
också enskilda länders aktiemarknader.
Framtida undersökningar skulle kunna koncentrera sig på färre indikatorer och
använda mera avancerade analysmodeller för att få tydligare svar. Uttömmande
analyser om indikatorer och aktieindex skulle kunna vara något som kunde utföras i
framtida studier. De inkonsekventa resultaten tyder på behovet av ytterligare
forskning.
