Title of the work: Voice symptoms, voice use and voice risk factors in day care personnel
Supervisors: Sofia Holmqvist-Jämsén, Greta Wistbacka and Viveka Lyberg Åhlander
Abstract:
Voice problems in the teaching occupation are common and the voice ergonomic risk factors well
documented, but the majority of the available literature focuses on teachers. There is not as much
literature found about the voice problems and voice ergonomic risk factors in day care personnel,
although this group also has a high risk for developing voice problems due to their profession. Day
care personnel work in a loud and often for the voice unsupportive environment, and the vocal load
is high. Knowledge about preventive voice care would be beneficial for this group but is often
limited.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of voice symptoms in day care personnel
and detect potential environmental and individual voice ergonomic risk factors. Do day care
personnel have a high vocal load? Are there any voice ergonomic risk factors in the day care
personnel’s environment?
One preschool teacher and ten day care employees participated in the study. Data about the
participants’ voice use at work was collected using a voice accumulator, Vocal Holter Recorder. In
addition to this, the participants answered a background questionnaire about general health and
voice health, the voice questionnaire forms Screen-11 and Voice Handicap Index, and a
questionnaire about percieved stress, the Percieved Stress Scale-10. Furthermore, an evaluation of
the environment and voice ergonomical risk factors at the work places of the participants was
conducted using ’’Röstergonomisk bedömning av arbetsmiljön: handbok i röstergonomisk
utredning’’ by Sala et al. (2011).
The results of this study showed that the prevalence of voice symptoms in the participants was 40%.
Several voice ergonomic risk factors were found in the participants’ work environment, of which the
most prominent one was high levels of background noise. Due to technical issues a large part of the
acoustical data could unfortunately not be used, but a qualitative analyse could still be conducted on
seven participants’ F0 values. In these analyses, a change in the participants’ F0 values could be
observed as a response to the high vocal load. The results of this study should be interpreted
critically and qualitatively, considering the small sample size.
Further research is needed on day care personnel as a considerable risk group for developing voice
problems in order to decrease the prevalence of voice problems and voice ergonomic risk factors in
this group and optimize the conditions for a healthy voice.

Sammanfattning:
Röstproblem i läraryrket är vanliga och de röstergonomiska riskfaktorerna är väl dokumenterade,
men majoriteten av den tillgängliga litteraturen handlar om lärare. Det finns inte lika mycket
forskning kring förekomsten av röstproblem och röstergonomiska riskfaktorer hos
dagvårdspersonal, trots att denna grupp löper stor risk för att utveckla röstproblem på grund av sitt
yrke. Dagvårdspersonal arbetar i en högljudd och ofta för rösten inte så ergonomisk omgivning, och
belastningen på rösterna är hög. Dagvårdspersonal skulle dra stor nytta av att lära sig röstergonomi,
men kunskapen kring ämnet är ofta begränsad i denna grupp.
Syftet med denna avhandling var att undersöka förekomsten av röstsymptom hos dagvårdspersonal
samt att undersöka förekomsten av röstergonomiska riskfaktorer. Har dagvårdspersonal en stor
röstbelastning? Finns det röstergonomiska riskfaktorer i deras omgivning?
En förskolelärare och tio dagvårdare deltog i denna studie. Data om deltagarnas röstanvändning
samlades in med hjälp av en röstackumulator, Vocal Holter Recorder. Som tillägg till detta, fick
deltagarna även svara på en bakgrundsblankett kring allmän hälsa och rösthälsa, röstformulären
Screen-11 och Rösthandikappindexet samt ett frågeformulär om uppfattad stress, Uppfattad Stress
Skala-10. Dessutom utfördes en evaluering av deltagarnas arbetsmiljö och förekomsten av
röstergonomiska riskfaktorer med hjälp av handboken ‘'Röstergonomisk bedömning av
arbetsmiljön: handbok i röstergonomisk utredning’’ av Sala m.fl. (2011).
Resultaten av denna studie visade att förekomsten av röstproblem hos deltagarna var 40%. Flera
röstergonomiska riskfaktorer upptäcktes i deltagarnas arbetsmiljö, av vilka den mest framträdande
riskfaktorn var höga nivåer av bakgrundsbuller. På grund av tekniska problem kunde en stor del av
det akustiska data inte användas, men en kvalitativ analys kunde ändå utföras på sju deltagares F0
värden. I analysen kunde en förändring i deltagarnas F0 värden observeras vid ökad röstbelastning.
Resultaten i denna studie bör tolkas kritiskt och kvalitativt med tanke på sampelstorleken.
Vidare forskning krävs om dagvårdspersonal som en betydlig riskgrupp för att utveckla röstproblem
för att kunna minska förekomsten av röstproblem och röstergonomiska riskfaktorer i denna grupp,
och optimisera förutsättningarna för en friskare röst.

1 Introduction
Day care personnel and preschool teachers are in their work environment exposed to several
risk factors for developing voice problems (Södersten, Granqvist, Hammarberg & Szabo,
2002). The ambient and activity sound levels are often higher than recommended, the
surroundings are not favorable for voice use and the vocal demands are high (Durup, Shield,
Dance, Sullivan & Gomez-Agustina, 2015; Lyberg-Åhlander, Rydell & Löfqvist, 2011;
Portela, Hammarberg & Södersten, 2013; Rantala, Hakala, Holmqvist & Sala, 2015;
Södersten, et.al., 2002). In addition, the knowledge about proper ergonomic voice care and
usage is often limited (Munier & Kinsella, 2007; Tao, Lee, Hu & Liu, 2020). As a
consequence, the prevalence of voice problems among day care personnel is high (De Alvear,
Barón & Martinez-Arquero, 2011; Kaļužnaja & Lakiša, 2016; Kankare, Geneid, Laukkanen
& Vilkman, 2012; Sala, Laine, Simberg, Pentti & Suonpää, 2001; Tao et.al., 2020). There is a
need for further research on this group to be able to identify and reduce the potential risk
factors and lower the prevalence of voice problems.
In this thesis I have chosen to use the term ’voice problems’, covering both undiagnosed
subjectively experienced voice symptoms as well as diagnosed voice disorders.

1.1 Voice problems in day care personnel and the teaching profession
In a study by Lyberg-Åhlander, Rydell, Fredlund, Magnusson and Wilén (2019) an extensive
research was conducted in order to investigate the prevalence of voice problems in the
general population in Sweden. The prevalence of voice problems in 74 351 participants in the
study was 16.9%. The profession with the highest prevalence of voice problems in the study
was teachers. Voice problems are common in the teaching profession as teachers are at a high
risk for developing voice problems. The prevalence of voice problems in teachers is therefore
well documented (Behlau, Zambon, Guerrieri & Roy, 2012; Devadas, Bellur & Maruthy,
2017; Lyberg-Åhlander et.al., 2011; Munier & Kinsella, 2007; Roy, Merrill, Thibeault, Gray,
& Smith, 2004; Smith, Gray, Dove, Kirchner, & Heras, 1997; Smith, Kirchner, Taylor,
Hoffman, & Lemke, 1998; Södersten & Lindhe, 2007; Williams, 2003). The occurrence of
voice problems in day care personnel is not as frequently reported, but studies have shown
1

that day care personnel is a risk group for developing voice problems. The prevalence of
voice problems in day care personnel is presented in table 1.

In the study by Kankare, Geneid, Laukkanen and Vilkman (2012), the occurrence of voice
problems in 119 Finnish kindergarten teachers was investigated. According to the results in
the study, 21% of the participants reported that they had two or more voice symptoms
occurring weekly or more often, and organic changes on the vocal folds were found in 10.9%
of the participants. As much as 94% of the participants had experienced some kind of voice
tiredness. Sala, Laine, Simberg, Pentti and Suonpää (2001) investigated the prevalence of
voice disorders among 262 Finnish day care center teachers and compared it with that of 108
hospital nurses. The results of the study showed that the prevalence of voice symptoms in day

2

care personnel was generally higher than in hospital nurses. According to the study, 37% of
the day care center teachers had had two or more symptoms occurring once a week or more
often during the last year, compared to 17% of the nurses. In the clinical exam, visual
changes on the vocal folds was found in 29% of the day care center teachers, compared to
only 7% of the nurses. Thirty-eight percent of the day care center teachers experienced that
their voice problems affected their work performance, while only 8% of the nurses
experienced this (Sala et.al., 2001). In a study by Kaļužnaja and Lakiša (2016), 69.7% of the
155 preschool teachers participating in the study had experienced voice problems during their
career. Many experienced that they often needed to take a break from speaking.
In a study by De Alvear, Barón and Martinez-Arquero (2011), the prevalence of voice
problems was investigated in 282 Spanish kindergarten and elementary school teachers.
According to the results of the study. 81.5% of the participants had experienced some kind of
voice symptoms. The prevalence of voice problems was 59%, and some kind of voice
problems were experienced by 62,7% of the participants. Tao, Lee, Hu and Liu (2020)
investigated the prevalence of voice problems in 211 kindergarten teachers and 203
elementary school teachers in China. According to the results of the VHI, the total prevalence
of voice problems in both groups was 59.7%. As many as 92.8% of the participants reported
experiencing some kind of voice symptom. Voice diseases such as chronic laryngitis and
pharyngitis also had a high prevalence in the group; 78.3% of the participants had been
diagnosed with a voice disease during their career, 70% during the last semester. The results
of the study showed that the kindergarten teachers had a slightly lower prevalence of voice
problems than the elementary school teachers (54.0% vs. 65.5 %). Kindergarten teachers also
had a slightly lower prevalence of voice symptoms and voice diseases than elementary school
teachers, although the prevalence was still high in both groups (Tao et.al., 2020).
In a study by Limoeiro, Ferreira, Zambon and Behlau (2019) the findings differed slightly
from previously mentioned studies as the prevalence of voice problems was investigated in
112 teachers, of which 38 were kindergarten teachers. In this study, the teachers rated their
voices as good and there were no differences found between the different teaching
professions. However, only the subjective evaluations of the participants’ voices were
obtained and there were still some voice symptoms reported by the participants. The most
common voice symptom reported in the study was dry or irritated throat.

3

The most common voice symptom reported in all of the studies investigating the prevalence
of voice problems among day care personnel and preschool teachers was hoarseness. Voice
tiredness, dryness and strained voice was also commonly reported.

1.2 Risk factors for developing voice problems in the teaching profession
Teachers and day care personnel are exposed to a variety of risk factors for developing voice
problems (Södersten et.al., 2002). Due to high noise levels and vocally demanding work
tasks, the vocal load in day care personnel is often high (Helidoni, Murry, Chlouverakis,
Okalidou & Velegrakis, 2012; Kaļužnaja & Lakiša, 2016; Lindstrom, Ohlsson, Sjöholm &
Waye, 2010; Lindstrom, Waye, Södersten, McAllister & Ternström, 2011; Portela et.al.,
2013; Remacle, Morsomme & Finck, 2014; Sala et.al. 2002; Simões-Zenari, Bitar & Nemr,
2012; Södersten et.al., 2002). Teachers and day care personnel are also exposed to several
environmental risk factors such as poor acoustics, poor indoor air climate and stress
(Vilkman, 2004). Furthermore, teachers and day care personnel are often uninformed about
preventive voice care (Munier & Kinsella, 2007; Tao et.al., 2020). Preventive measures like
optimizing the environment to support a healthy voice production and educating employees
in the teaching profession about preventive voice care and usage would benefit this group of
profession.

1.2.1. Voice use, vocal loading and background noise.
The levels of background noise are often high at day cares, with noise levels often around
70–80 dB (Grebennikov, 2006; Jonsdottir, Rantala, Oskarsson & Sala, 2015; Kaļužnaja &
Lakiša, 2016; Lindstrom et.al., 2011; Sala et.al., 2002; Simões-Zenari et.al., 2012; Sjödin,
Kjellberg, Knutsson, Landström & Lindberg, 2012; Södersten et.al., 2002; Vilkman, 2004).
The low age of the children, big groups and day care activities like free play indoors and
outdoors, gatherings and reading aloud, often also combined with properties of the rooms that
affect the room acoustics, result in high activity noise levels and a loud environment (Durup
et.al., 2015; Kaļužnaja & Lakiša, 2016; Portela et.al., 2013; Sjödin et.al., 2012; Södersten
et.al., 2002; Vilkman, 2004). In studies investigating the effect high noise levels at day cares
has on the children at the day cares, it was found that also children were bothered by the

4

noise (McAllister, Rantala and Johnsdottir, 2019; Waye, van Kamp and Dellve, 2013). High
noise levels caused irritation in the children, and some of the children reported that it was
sometimes difficult to hear and be heard over the noise. The children often reacted with
coping strategies like covering their ears or talking less, and sometimes the high noise levels
even caused physical symptoms like sore throat or ears, headaches or stomach pains
(McAllister, Rantala and Johnsdottir, 2019; Waye, van Kamp and Dellve, 2013). Ventilation
and other technical equipment create a constant source of ambient noise which adds to the
high noise levels (Lyberg-Åhlander et.al., 2011; Rantala et.al., 2015). In a study by
Karjalainen, Brännström, Christensson, Sahlén, and Lyberg-Åhlander (2020) the effect of the
acoustic properties in primary school classrooms on teachers’ health was investigated. In the
study, the noise levels from the ventilation system was higher than recommended and
associated with a higher prevalence of voice symptoms. Increased levels of background noise
often lead to an increase in vocal load, as we raise our voices unintentionally in response to
high sound levels - called the Lombard effect (Lane & Tranel, 1971). This increase in vocal
load is typically represented by increased or decreased values of the fundamental frequency
(F0), increased values of the sound pressure level (SPL) and sometimes even an increase in
the phonation time. This can result in a change in voice quality and vocal behavior, and lead
to vocal symptoms (Jonsdottir et.al., 2015; Kankare et.al., 2012; Sjödin et.al., 2012;
Södersten, Ternström & Bohman, 2005; Tao et.al., 2020; Vilkman, 2004).
In a study by Sala et.al. (2002) the vocal load in 51 day care center teachers in Finland was
investigated and compared to the vocal load in 25 hospital nurses. The background noise
levels and room acoustics in the day cares were also measured. The results of the study
showed that day care center teachers used both a stronger voice and used their voices more
than the nurses did. The average SPL value for the day care center teachers was 78 dB and
the average phonation time was 40%. The average SPL value for the nurses was 72 dB and
the average phonation time was 28%. The background noise levels at the day cares were
high, with an average noise level of 67 dB (Sala et.al., 2002). In a study by Södersten,
Granqvist, Hammarberg and Szabo (2002), the average background noise level at day care
centers in Sweden during the day of the study was 76.1 dBA, which is 20 dB higher than
what was recommended for the day cares. As a consequence, the day care personnel’s
average SPL was 85.4 dB, which is 9.1 dB louder than in the reference condition before the
work day. In the study, the participants’ average F0 was 247 Hz during work, which is higher
than the average F0 value from the reference condition (202 Hz). The average phonation time

5

in the group was also high, 17% (Södersten et.al., 2002). In a study by Portela, Hammarberg
and Södersten (2013), similar results were found as the mean F0 for the twelve preschool
teachers that participated in the study was significantly higher during work (266 Hz) than
after work (246 Hz), but both values were still high compared to laboratory recordings of
women’s F0. The phonation time was also higher during work than after (12% vs. 5.5%).
These participants had few opportunities to rest their voices during work (Portela et.al.,
2013). In a study by Lindström, Ohlsson, Sjöholm and Waye (2010) a raise in the F0 value
could also be observed in nine preschool teachers due to high noise levels. Furthermore,
Lindström, Waye, Södersten, McAllister and Ternström (2011) found that apart from raising
their voices in response to higher background noise levels, some of the preschool teachers in
their study maintained a higher SPL although the background noise levels decreased. The
participants’ SPL values ranged from 71–79 dB, and their F0 values ranged from 229–292
Hz. The noise levels at the preschools ranged from 64–72 dB (Lindström, Waye, Södersten,
McAllister & Ternström, 2011).
In a study by Simões-Zenari, Bitar and Nemr (2012), the effect of noise on the voices of 28
preschool teachers was investigated in three preschools in Brazil. The results showed that
75% of the participants experienced changes in their vocal quality, and about half of the
participants had a lower F0 value than expected. There were also changes in the values of
HNR, jitter and shimmer for some of the participants. Alterations in the voice production like
hyponasal resonance and locked jaw were found in 57% of the participants. The noise levels
at the day cares were high, ranging from 58.1 up to 83.7 dB, with an average noise level of
70.4 dB (Simões-Zenari et.al., 2012). Kaļužnaja and Lakiša (2016) also investigated the
effect of noise on voice and health in 155 preschool teachers or teacher assistants in 11
preschools. According to the results, almost 70% of the participants often felt the need to use
a stronger voice during work due to high noise levels. Almost as many (69.7%) had
experienced voice problems at work. The noise levels at the preschools were above
recommendations, with an average of 70 dB. The high noise levels also caused other health
complaints like headache and fatigue (Kaļužnaja & Lakiša, 2016).
Helidoni, Murry, Chlouverakis, Okalidou and Velegrakis (2012) compared the voice use of
kindergarten teachers with hospital nurses, and found that 90.7% of the kindergarten teachers
used a louder voice at work than nurses, perhaps due to high levels of background noise and a
longer distance between the speaker and the listener. The kindergarten teachers also sung
with the children, drank less water than the nurses and had a significant prevalence of upper
6

respiratory tract infections. Risk factors among nurses consisted more of habits and factors
related to life-style, like alcohol intake, smoking and speaking much on the phone. The scores
of the Voice Handicap Index were significantly higher for the kindergarten teachers than the
nurses (Helidoni et.al., 2012). Remacle, Morsomme and Finck (2014) compared voice
parameters between 12 kindergarten teachers and 20 elementary school teachers in Belgium,
collected during a week with an Ambulatory Phonation Monitor. According to the results of
the study, the vocal load was greater for kindergarten teachers than elementary school
teachers. The values for F0, SPL, cycle dose and distance dose were higher in kindergarten
teachers than in elementary school teachers, both during and after work. The average value
for F0 was 268 Hz for kindergarten teachers and 253 Hz for elementary school teachers. The
average SPL value for the kindergarten teachers was 81.7 dB, while the mean SPL value for
the elementary school teachers was 79.9 dB. The participants also completed the French
version of the Voice Handicap Index, which accordingly kindergarten teachers experienced
more voice problems than elementary school teachers (Remacle et.al., 2014). Munier et.al.
(2020), however, came to a different conclusion as the prevalence of voice symptoms were
investigated in 99 kindergarten teachers and 84 primary school teachers in Finland. The
prevalence of voice symptoms in this study was higher in primary school teachers than in
kindergarten teachers. The results showed that primary school teachers had higher scores on
almost all VAPP sum scores except for social sum, compared to the kindergarten teachers.

1.2.2. Environmental factors and health conditions.
Employees in the teaching profession are exposed to different voice ergonomic risk factors in
the environment such as poor room acoustics, poor indoor air climate and factors that are
associated with the culture and work tasks of the work place like working posture, the
availability of voice aids and opportunity to rest the voice (Vilkman, 2004). In environments
with high noise levels, the qualities and acoustics of a room play an important role in how the
noise affects the voice. The size of a room and furnishings affect the acoustics in a room, and
a room's property and acoustics can either support the voice or have the exact opposite effect
(Lyberg-Åhlander et.al., 2011; Mealings, Buchholz, Demuth & Dillon, 2014; PelegrinGarcia, Lyberg-Åhlander, Rydell, Brunskog & Lofqvist, 2010; Sjödin, Kjellberg, Knutsson,
Landström & Lindberg, 2014). A room’s qualities can especially affect unhealthy voices
(Lyberg-Åhlander et.al., 2011; Pelegrin-Garcia et.al., 2010). Poor acoustics result in changes

7

especially in SPL and F0 values. A room’s STv (room support) affects the auditive feedback
of the voice and can cause an increase in the SPL (Astolfi et.al., 2015; Lyberg-Åhlander,
García, Whitling, Rydell & Löfqvist, 2014). A long reverberation time can cause an increase
in both SPL and F0 as it often increases the sound levels in the room (Astolfi et.al., 2015;
Rantala & Sala, 2015). A longer reverberation time can also lead to a lower SPL value as a
result of voice tiredness (Rantala & Sala, 2015).
Poor indoor air climate is caused by dusty and unclean surroundings, insufficient ventilation
and low air flow, affecting the humidity and air quality in the room (Rantala & Sala, 2015).
Air humidity affect the phonatory effort and cause changes in the F0 values (Vilkman, 2004).
In an experimental study by Verdolini, Titze and Fennell (1994), low hydration levels of 9 –
32% increased the phonatory effort in the participants. Geneid et.al. (2009) investigated the
effect of organic dust on the voice and throat in nine participants with rhinitis or asthma in an
experimental arrangement, and found that exposure to dust may lead to occupational voice
disorders. The participants experienced changes in their voice and reported experiencing
voice symptoms from the exposure (Geneid et.al., 2009). Poor indoor climate has also been
reported to increase the risk of developing laryngitis (Rantala, Hakala, Holmqvist & Sala,
2012; Rantala & Sala, 2015).
There are few studies reporting about environmental risk factors in day cares and preschools.
Since preschool teachers and teachers work in a similar environment, studies about risk
factors in teachers’ environment are included where information about the situation in day
cares or preschools is missing. In that way, an overall comprehension of the environmental
risk factors in the teaching profession is provided. In a study by Sala et.al. (2002) RASTI
(Rapid Speech Transmission Index) levels at 27 Finnish day cares were investigated.
According to the study, the RASTI levels were below what is recommended in 12 of the
rooms, indicating poor acoustics in these rooms. In a study by Sala and Rantala (2016) the
acoustics of 40 classrooms in Finland were investigated. Only 14 rooms in the study had a
recommended reverberation time, and only one room had the STI value within recommended
guidelines (Sala & Rantala, 2016).
In a study by Ruotsalainen, Jaakkola and Jaakkola (1993), the indoor air climate in 83 rooms
in 30 day care centers in Finland was investigated. Humidity, air quality, temperature, carbon
oxide levels and air flow were measured. The results of the study showed that the indoor air
climate at many of the day cares centers was poor. The most common reason for this was

8

defective ventilation and air flow, which led to higher amounts of carbon oxide which
affected the quality of the air indoors. The air flow was insufficient in 70% of the rooms, and
the carbon oxide levels were too high in 18% of the rooms. Three of the day care centers had
too high concentrations of total volatile organic compounds that affects the air quality.
Further indications of poor indoor climate found at the day cares was too high or too low
temperature levels in most of the rooms, and unpleasant odors experienced by over half of the
day care personnel. The average relative humidity was 31%, but cold outdoor temperatures
often caused the humidity levels to decrease (Ruotsalainen, Jaakkola & Jaakkola, 1993).
Several other studies agree that poor indoor air climate at day cares seem to be caused mostly
by insufficient air flow and ventilation, causing high levels of carbon oxide and low air
humidity (Ferng & Lee, 2002; Kaļužnaja & Lakiša, 2016; St-Jean et.al., 2012). The sizes of
the rooms also affect the indoor air quality as the levels of e.g. carbon oxide increases in too
small spaces (St-Jean et.al., 2012). In a study by Tao, Lee, Hu and Liu (2020) 37.9% of the
211 kindergarten teachers in the study reported that the air humidity in their work
environment affected their vocal health.
Upper respiratory tract diseases and conditions such as asthma, reflux, allergies, rhinitis,
pharyngitis and laryngitis can have negative consequences on the voice and may lead to voice
problems (Charn & Mok, 2012; Devadas et.al., 2017; Lee, Lao & Yu, 2010; Munier,
Brockmann-Bauser, Laukkanen, Ilomäki, Kankare & Geneid, 2020; Simberg, Sala,
Tuomainen & Rönnemaa, 2009). Furthermore, diseases and conditions that affect the upper
airways have proven to be somewhat common in the teaching profession (Charn & Mok,
2012; Devadas et.al., 2017; Lee et.al., 2010). In the study by Helidoni, Murry, Chlouverakis,
Okalidou and Velegrakis (2012) mentioned before, kindergarten teachers were more prone to
develop upper respiratory tract infections than their control group of hospital nurses. In the
study by Munier et.al. (2020), a connection between asthma and respiratory infection and
subjective voice symptoms was found in the teachers and kindergarten teachers participating
in the study.

1.2.3. Stress.
The relation between stress and voice problems have been investigated in several studies, and
there is consensus that stress is a considerable risk factor for developing voice problems
(Devadas et.al., 2017; Lyberg-Åhlander, Rydell, Löfqvist, Pelegrin-García & Brunskog,
9

2015; Vilkman, 2004). Kooijman et al. (2006) reported that psycho-emotional aspects, such
as stress and high workload, were the most important risk factors for developing a voice
disorder. Some studies have also reported the effect of voice symptoms on stress levels.
Gassull, Casanova, Botey and Amador (2010) found that voice problems often led to a higher
reactivity to stress, and in a study by Lee, Lao and Yu (2010), 79,3% of the participants were
stressed because of their voice problems. Mendoza and Carballo (1998) found that stress
caused an increase in the F0, jitter and shimmer values. Day care personnel work in a loud
environment which may cause higher levels of stress, as high noise levels have been found to
increase the levels of stress (Jonsdottir et.al., 2015; Sjödin et.al., 2012). Jonsdottir, Rantala,
Oskarsson and Sala (2015) found that there was a connection between high stress levels and a
higher prevalence of voice symptoms in preschool teachers. In a study by Holmqvist,
Santtila, Lindström, Sala and Simberg (2013) where the connection between vocal symptoms
and stress symptoms was investigated in 1728 participants, it was found that there was an
association between the occurrence of vocal symptoms and stress symptoms. HolmqvistJämsén et.al.(2017) investigated the effect of raised cortisol levels and vocal symptoms in
170 participants. The results showed a positive connection between raised cortisol levels,
which is a biological stress marker, and the occurrence of vocal symptoms, providing an
objective view on the effect of stress on the voice. In a study by Rantala, Hakala, Holmqvist
and Sala (2012), 30% of the 39 teachers participating in the voice ergonomic assessment
reported that they were quite or very stressed. The results of the study showed that stress was
associated with vocal symptoms. Stress also correlated most strongly out of all of the risk
factors investigated in the study with the occurrence of vocal symptoms in the participants.

1.2.4. Gender.
Studies have concluded that the prevalence of voice problems is higher in women than men
in the teaching profession. In a study by Holmqvist, Santtila, Lindström, Sala and Simberg
(2013) women reported more vocal and stress symptoms than men. In a study conducted by
Smith, Kirchner, Taylor, Hoffman and Lemke (1998), the frequency of voice disorders was
higher in female teachers than in male teachers. Female teachers were also more likely to
report voice symptoms, like a tired or effortful voice, than male teachers. The same results
are reported in a study by Russell, Oates and Greenwood (1998), where the prevalence of
voice problems was significantly higher in female teachers than in male teachers. Women

10

tend to use a slightly higher voice level and have a higher phonation time than men. In the
study by Södersten, Ternström and Bohman (2005) women reported that they often felt like
they needed to use more effort in order to make themselves heard in loud environments. The
difference in voice use between women and men may be a cause for the higher prevalence of
voice problems in women (De Alvear, Barón & Martínez-Arquero, 2011; Södersten et.al.,
2005; Vilkman, 2004).
All participants in the studies investigating prevalence of voice problems or voice ergonomic
risk factors in day care center personnel have been women, so no gender comparison
regarding occurrence of voice problems is available in this population to date.

1.3 Aim of the study

Day care personnel is a risk group for developing voice problems as they are exposed to
several voice ergonomic risk factors in their profession. However, the literature about voice
problems and voice ergonomic risk factors in this group is limited. It is therefore important to
conduct further research on the subject in order to be able to reduce the prevalence of voice
problems and voice ergonomic risk factors in this profession. The aim of this study was to
investigate the prevalence of voice symptoms in day care personnel and detect potential risk
factors that may be the cause to eventual voice symptoms. Research questions: Do day care
personnel have a high vocal load? Are there any voice ergonomic risk factors in the day care
personnel’s environment?

2 Method
Several different data collecting methods were used in this study in order to achieve a
qualitative but comprehensive estimation of the day care personnel’s voice ergonomic
situation. Permission to conduct research at the day cares in Turku was obtained from Åbo
Stad (26.04.2018). Ethical consent was also granted from the board of Research Ethics in
Psychology and Speech-Language Pathology at Åbo Akademi University (22.01.2018).

2.1 Participants
In my thesis, both day care personnel without a pedagogical degree and preschool teachers
are included as subjects of interest. ’Day care personnel’ include all personnel at day cares
who work with children, regardless of their level of education. Participants in this study were
ten day care employees and one preschool teacher from four different day cares and one
school in Turku. The participants gave their signed consent to participate in this study before
the investigations. All participants were women (mean age 45,4 years, range 23–55 years).
Six of the participants were kindergarten teachers, two were social workers, one was a nurse,
one was day care employee and one a child minder. Eight of the participants had worked as a
day care employee for at least 10 years. All of the participants worked full time and at least
31–40 hours a week. The age of the children in the participants’ groups varied depending on
the day care: in some of the day cares they had smaller groups with a wider age range, while
in other day cares the groups were bigger with children of a narrower age span. Three of the
participants worked with children in preschool age. Table 2 presents the demographics of the
participants.

Of the reported health conditions or diseases that may affect the airways, throat burn or reflux
was the most common condition among the participants, this being reported by five of the
participants. Other health conditions that also occurred in the group was long-term sinusitis
or rhinitis, allergy that affects the airways and asthma. Two of the participants did not suffer
from any of the mentioned health conditions. The participants that answered that they
suffered from allergies or asthma also used allergy or asthma medication. Two of the
participants with reflux used reflux medication. Other medications that were used by some of
the participants were thyroxin medicine, migraine medicine, fibromyalgia medicine and
antidepressants. Three of the participants used no medication. Three of the participants
smoked, one daily and two more seldom. Health conditions and medication used by the
participants are presented in table 3 and 4.

2.2 Data collection
Acoustic data were obtained using a voice accumulator, Vocal Holter Recorder by PR.O.
Voice Srl. (Astolfi et.al., 2017). The Vocal Holter Recorder consists of a contact sensor that
is placed around the participant’s neck. The accumulator measures and registers acoustic
values that provides information about the vocal folds and the voice without recording the
speech itself. The accumulator is connected to the Vocal Holter Application on a smartphone
(Android). The participants wore the voice accumulator during a whole workday. Before the
long-term monitoring, a short-term monitoring was performed to obtain a reference condition
to compare the data from the long-term monitoring with. In the short-term monitoring, the
participant was asked to talk freely about a random topic for 1–5 minutes at a comfortable
voice level, and to produce a prolonged /a/ at a comfortable voice level three times. The
short-term monitoring was conducted in a quiet room with low background noise and with
similar conditions as during the long-term monitoring. The vocal parameters obtained from
the data registered by the voice accumulator were fundamental frequency, phonation time,
Cepstral Peak Prominence Smoothed, jitter, shimmer and differences in the sound pressure
level and the frames duration of pause and voice to which correspond the peak of occurrence.
In addition to this, the participants answered a background questionnaire about general and
voice health. In order to further investigate the prevalence of voice symptoms and stress
among the participants, the questionnaire forms Screen-11, Rösthandikappindexet (the Voice
Handicap Index, VHI) and Uppfattad stress-10 (the Perceived Stress Scale-10, PSS-10) were
14

used (PSS-10; Cohen, 1988; VHI; Jacobson et al., 1997; Screen-11; Zenger, 2019). The
Screen-11 consists of 11 questions about perceived voice symptoms during the last twelve
months. In Screen-11, four or more voice symptoms appearing weekly or more often may
indicate voice problems. The VHI consists of 30 questions divided into three subscales:
physical, psychological and emotional. According to the VHI, scores over 30 points may
indicate voice problems. The PSS-10 consists of ten questions about perceived stress during
the last month. In PSS-10, score of 14 o more indicates moderate to high stress. The
questions of all of these three questionnaire forms are rated on a Likert scale.
An evaluation of the environment and voice ergonomical risk factors at the work places of
the participants was conducted using ’’Röstergonomisk bedömning av arbetsmiljön: handbok
i röstergonomisk utredning’’ by Sala et al. (2011). Risk factors investigated included noise
levels inside and outside the rooms, air quality, the participants’ posture, voice use, stress
levels and the usage of aids. The evaluation consisted of observations, a short interview with
the participants and measurements of background noise levels, temperature and humidity
levels at the day cares. The measurements were conducted once during the day when the
rooms were empty. The noise levels were measured with a decibel meter and the temperature
and humidity levels were measured with a hygrometer. The range of noise levels was
measured both in the middle of the participants’ rooms and closer to noisy equipment like
ventilation. The reverberation time was subjectively measured by listening for echo in the
rooms after clapping. The air quality was investigated through interviews with the
participants and subjective observations.

2.3 Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences,
IBM SPSS Statistics 25, Armonk, NY, USA) for Windows. Descriptive statistics was used to
present general background information about the participants. Pearson’s correlation analysis
was used to check the correlation between the two voice questionnaires Screen-11 and VHI.
A paired samples t-test was used to compare changes in the participants’ F0 from the shortterm monitoring and the long-term monitoring. To find out connections between potential
risk factors and voice symptoms, different correlation analysis testing associations between
variables were used. Due to the data not being normally distributed, the non-parametric tests

15

Pearson’s correlation analysis, Fisher’s exact test and Chi square test were used. Furthermore,
Mann-Whitney U test were used to check connections between potential risk factors and
voice symptoms in additional experimental analysis.

3 Results
The different data collecting methods gave a comprehensive overview of the prevalence of
voice problems and voice ergonomic risk factors among the participants in the study. Due to
some fallouts in the questionnaires and technical issues with the equipment, the sample size
decreased and the results must therefore be interpreted carefully.

3.1 Voice problems
Seven participants reported that they had experienced voice problems during their career. The
problems had appeared several times a week for two of the participants. Six participants
experienced that their voice problems affect their work, and five had been on sick leave
because of their voice problems. The most common voice symptoms reported by the
participants was a sore throat and the loss of voice. Three of the participants had visited a
doctor or phoniatrician because of their voice problems, and one had been diagnosed with a
voice disorder (laryngitis). One of the participants had received voice therapy by a speech
pathologist ten times during a few months' time, and one had received voice therapy through
a group lecture. Three participants had received some sort of voice ergonomic information,
one of them in the form of singing lessons. The prevalence of subjectively experienced voice
problems among the participants is presented in table 5.

Regarding the responses in Screen-11, one participant did not answer the Screen-11 questions
and was excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining ten participants, four participants
had four or more voice symptoms in the Screen-11 occurring weekly or more often. One had
three symptoms occurring weekly or more often, and five had two symptoms or less
occurring weekly or more often. The mean score in Screen-11 in the sum score variable was
13.5 (SD = 8.48),the total score range: 3–29 p. The results of Screen-11 were normally
distributed according to the Shapiro-Wilk test (p = .278) and are presented in table 6.
With respect to VHI, two participants did not answer all of the questions and were therefore
excluded. Of the remaining ones, three participants had > 31 points points in the VHI, which

17

indicates moderate voice problems (Jacobson et.al. 1997). Six participants had < 30 points in
VHI, which indicates none or mild voice problems. None of the participants had over 60
points, which would have indicated severe voice problems. The mean score in the VHI was
19.7 (SD = 19.09). The highest score was 49 points, and the lowest 1 point. Of the three
subscales in the VHI (functional, physical and emotional), the highest mean and median was
found in the functional domain (M = 7.7, SD = 06.54). The results of VHI were not normally
distributed according to the Shapiro-Wilk test (p = .047), nor were the results of the physical
and emotional subscales in VHI (physical domain p = .038, emotional domain p = .032) due
to positively skewed test results. The functional subscale, however, was normally distributed
(p = .275). The results of the VHI is presented in table 6.

The participants who scored high in Screen-11 also scored high in VHI. According to Cohen
(1988; 1992) there was a strong positive correlation between the total score of Screen-11 and
the total score of VHI (Pearson’s r = .884, p = .001).

3.2 Voice use and vocal load
According to the background questionnaire, the participants often used a loud voice in their
profession; seven of the participants reported that they used a strong voice during work daily,
and four participants used a strong voice during work multiple times a week. Over half of the
participants used their voice for several hours during their leisure time. When asked about
18

habits that may affect the voice, two of the participants answered that they sung in their
leisure time, whereas two participants often used a strong voice. One participant reported
frequent speech over long time on the phone, and one participant answered that she has all
the aforementioned habits. Five of the participants answered that they did none of the listed
voice straining habits in the questionnaire. Table 7 presents the participants’ voice use and
habits.

Acoustic data from the monitoring of the participants was missing due to technical issues.
Thus, only the mean values from seven of the participants’ F0 could be qualitatively
analyzed. Since several F0 values was collected from each participant during the day, an
average F0 mean value was calculated from each participant in order to compare the mean F0
value from the short-term monitoring with the mean F0 value from the long-term monitoring
between the groups.

19

A statistically significant difference in the participants’ F0 mean value was calculated
between the short-term monitoring and the long-term monitoring. The mean F0 value was
higher during the long-term monitoring than during the short-term monitoring for all of the
participants except one, who had a lower F0 value. The mean F0 in the group from the shortterm monitoring was 224.6 Hz (SD = 31.07). The mean F0 in the group from the long-term
monitoring was 268 Hz (SD = 46.56). The participants’ average F0 values from the short- and
long-term monitoring are presented in table 8.

The data of the F0 mean from the short-term monitoring was normally distributed (p = .500)
as was the data of the mean F0 value of the participants from the long-term monitoring (p =
.761). According to Cohen (1988; 1992), there was a strong positive correlation between the
F0 mean value of the participants in the short-term monitoring and the long-term monitoring
(Pearson's r = .784, p = .037). Using an independent-samples t-test, the results showed that
the mean value of the participants’ F0 was significantly higher during the long term
monitoring compared to the short-term monitoring (t(6) = -3,9, p = .008). Figure 1 present an
overview over the participants’ individual F0 values from the short- and long-term
monitoring.

3.3 Risk factors
Several voice ergonomic risk factors were found in the participants’ environments. The risk
factors were both individual, like posture and lack of voice rest, and environmental, like high
noise levels and poor air quality.

3.3.1. Environment.
In the evaluation of the participants’ working environments using ’’Röstergonomisk
bedömning av arbetsmiljön: handbok i röstergonomisk utredning’’ by Sala et.al. (2011),
voice ergonomic risk factors were found at all of the day cares. The amount of risk factors
found in the participants’ environments is presented in table 9.

High levels of background noise were measured at all of the day cares. The noise levels were
above recommended levels and not adjustable. The source of the noises was often ventilation
and noise from outside of the room (like the corridor or the next room). The noise levels
ranged from 33.7 – 38.3 dBA in the middle of the room, 35.7 – 42.8 dBA from the ventilation
and 34.6 – 50.7 dBA from noise outside of the room. With the added noise from outside of
the room, the sound levels in the middle of the room often rose to 39 – 40 dBA in a couple of
the participants’ rooms. Six of the participants’ rooms had a slight echo in their rooms when
clapping. The spaces at the day cares were clean, but the air was often described by the
participants as dry and/or drafty. The participants (N = 7) of three different day cares was
experiencing that the indoor climate made them drowsy. Due to technical problems, the air
humidity at the day cares could not be measured. The temperature was below what is
recommended in five of the participants’ rooms.

22

From the observations in the assessment of the participants’ working environment, seven of
the participants used their voice frequently during work, and four often used a strong voice.
None of the participants used aids like voice amplifiers, but one of the participants said that
she would like to use one. Some of the participants often worked and talked with a nonergonomic posture, for example when they were reading story books for the children and had
their head turned to the side. All of the participants had the possibility to move around during
their work day, and their work tasks enabled them to change positions throughout the day.
Their work tasks also often enabled the participants to take a break and stay quiet at times
during the day.

3.3.2. Stress.
In the voice ergonomic evaluation, five participants answered that they were stressed at the
time of the investigation. According to the answers in the PSS-10 questionnaire about
perceived stress during the last month, 8 of the participants' stress levels had been moderate
or high. The mean total score in the test was 17.5 points (SD = 6.09). The lowest score was 8
points and the highest 31. The results of the PSS-10 were normally distributed (p = .503).
One of the participants also mentioned stress affecting her voice at work in the background
questionnaire.

3.4 Connections between voice symptoms and voice ergonomic risk factors

There was a positive correlation according to Cohen (1988; 1992) between both the total
scores of Screen-11 and noise levels from ventilation at the day cares (Pearson's r = .646, p =
.043) and the total scores of VHI and noise levels from ventilation at the day cares (Pearson's
r = .691, p = .039). To further investigate connections between voice symptoms and voice
ergonomic risk factors, Chi square test and Fisher’s exact test was used. There were no
significant results from these analyses, but a high effect size according to Cohen (1988; 1992)
was found in the analysis investigating the relationship between two or more voice symptoms
occurring weekly or more often and the prevalence of upper respiratory tract infections
(Cramer’s V = .535, p = .091). A moderate effect size according to Cohen (1988; 1992) was
also found in the analysis investigating the relationship between two or more voice symptoms

23

occurring weekly or more often and the amount of risk factors in the risk field ‘’Indoor air’’
(Cramer’s V = .356, p = .500).

Additional analyses
Mann-Whitney U tests were employed for examining the relationship between the
environmental risk factors and voice problems on a continuous variable. Here, the Screen-11
symptom score (range 0–11 points) served as the dependent variable whereas a given risk
factor (categorized into two groups using a median split) served as the independent variable.
Although no statistically significant effects of neither risk factor on the symptom score was
observed, we found a few considerable effect sizes for some risk factors (see table 12 and
13).

small sample size, there were still some interesting results found that are worth mentioning.
According to Cohen (1988; 1992), there were strong negative correlations between

24

differences in the participants’ F0 mean values from the short-term monitoring and the longterm monitoring and Screen-11 results (Pearsons r = - .927, p = .008). There were also
differences in the participants’ F0 mean values from the short-term monitoring and the longterm monitoring and VHI results (Pearsons r = - .934, p = .006). Differences in the
participants’ F0 mean values from the short-term monitoring and the long-term monitoring
and the total amount of voice ergonomic risk factors (Pearsons r = - .877, p = .010) and in the
participants’ F0 mean values from the short-term monitoring and the long-term monitoring
and the risk field ‘’Working posture’’ (Pearsons r = - .849, p = .016) were also found. In the
additional experimental analyses conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test with a given risk
factor as the independent variable and F0 mean as the dependent variable, moderate to high
effect sizes according to Cohen (1988; 1992) were observed in some of the analyses,
although the p-values were statistically non-significant. The results are presented in table 14
and 15 below.

4 Discussion
The aim of this thesis was to investigate the prevalence of voice symptoms in day care
personnel and detect potential voice ergonomic risk factors. Do the participants in this study
have any kind of voice problems? Are they exposed to any risk factors for developing voice
problems? What are the biggest risk factors in their environment? How do they use their
voices and do they have a high vocal load in their work?
The participants in this study was 10 day care employees and one preschool teacher. Teachers
are a known risk group for developing voice disorders, but literature about voice problems in
day care personnel and preschool teachers is limited. It can still be concluded from the
existing research that day care personnel and preschool teachers are a risk group for
developing voice disorders (De Alvear et.al., 2011; Kaļužnaja & Lakiša, 2016; Kankare et.al.,
2012; Lyberg-Åhlander, Rydell, Fredlund, Magnusson & Wilén, 2019; Sala et.al., 2001; Tao
et.al., 2020). It is therefore important to conduct further research about this group.

4.1 Prevalence of voice problems, background noise, vocal load and spaces
The prevalence of four or more voice symptoms occurring weekly or more often among the
participants’ of this study was 40%. Three participants’ scores in the VHI could be an
indication of moderate voice problems (Jacobson et.al. 1997). Considering the small sample
of this study, the prevalence of voice problems is prominent. A possible reason for the high
prevalence could be that day care personnel who already felt that their voice was affected by
the vocal load in their profession was more likely to be interested in participating in this
study. Many of the participants reported that they had experienced some sort of voice
problems during their career, and it was common that their voice problems affected their
work performance or attendance. In the most recent study investigating the prevalence of
voice problems in kindergarten teachers in Finland, the prevalence of voice problems in 119
kindergarten teachers was 21%, and as much as 94% of the participants in the study had
experienced some kind of voice tiredness (Kankare et.al., 2012). In another earlier study
investigating the prevalence of voice problems in 262 day care center teachers in Finland, the
prevalence was 37% (Sala et.al., 2001). In a very recent study reporting the prevalence of
voice problems in day care personnel in China, 54% of the 211 kindergarten teachers

26

participating in the study had some kind of voice problems (Tao et.al., 2020). The prevalence
of voice problems in the current study should be interpreted carefully due to the small sample
size, but the findings comply with the previously reported prevalence of voice problems in
day care personnel, further demonstrating that this group is a risk group for developing voice
problems.
The biggest risk factors for day care personnel for developing voice problems are high noise
levels and high vocal load (Helidoni et.al., 2012; Kaļužnaja & Lakiša, 2016; Lindstrom et.al.,
2010; Lindstrom et.al., 2011; Portela et.al., 2013; Remacle et.al., 2014; Sala et.al. 2002;
Simões-Zenari et.al., 2012; Södersten et.al., 2002). As the prevalence of voice problems in
the study by Kankare, Geneid, Laukkanen and Vilkman (2012) was similar to the prevalence
in the current study, so were the noise levels. The background noise levels in the current
study were high and not within recommended limits at any of the day cares. The lowest noise
level measured was 33.7 dB, and the highest up to 50.7 dB. The recommended upper limit for
noise levels at workplaces in the current study was 33 dB (Sala et.al., 2011). The high noise
levels were in most cases caused by ventilation or noise from outside of the room. The
statistical analysis showed a positive relation between background noise and the prevalence
of voice problems in the participants. Although the results of the statistical analysis should be
interpreted carefully due to the small sample size, the findings are supported by several
previous studies (Jonsdottir et.al., 2015; Kaļužnaja & Lakiša, 2016; Kankare et.al., 2012;
Sjödin et.al., 2012; Södersten et.al., 2005; Tao et.al., 2020; Vilkman, 2004). The high noise
levels at the day cares were also the biggest risk factors in this current study for the day care
personnel.
As high noise levels lead to a higher vocal load, an assumption of the thesis was that high
vocal loading was a voice ergonomic risk factor for the day care personnel (Lane & Tranel,
1971). The participants’ voice use in the current study was frequent, and they often used a
loud voice. Several of the participants further used their voices several hours after work.
These reportings suggest that the vocal load was high among the participants. Unfortunately,
the acoustic data from the monitoring of the participants was missing due to technical issues,
and it was therefore not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding the vocal load in the
participants. However, the values of seven participants’ fundamental frequency was obtained
and could be qualitatively analyzed. These analyses showed that the F0 values was higher in
the long-term monitoring than in the short-term monitoring for almost all of the participants.
The changes in the participants’ F0 values could be a reaction to the high noise levels in their
27

work environments, causing a higher vocal load (Lane & Tranel, 1971; Lindstrom et.al.,
2010; Lindstrom et.al., 2011; Lyberg-Åhlander et.al., 2014; Portela et.al., 2013; Remacle
et.al., 2014; Simões-Zenari et.al., 2012; Södersten et.al., 2002; Vilkman, 2004). However,
there were some unexpected results found in the statistical analysis where a negative
correlation between the F0 values and prevalence of voice symptoms was found, indicating
that a higher prevalence of voice problems caused a smaller change in the F0 value. This
would suggest that a change in F0 in response to higher vocal load could actually be a sign of
a healthy voice behavior (Lyberg-Åhlander et.al., 2014). These results could of course also be
explained by the small sample size in the analysis, leading to an uneven division of healthy
and unhealthy voices. One participant’s F0 values differed from the other values as they were
slightly lower during the long-term monitoring compared to the short-term monitoring. This
participant worked in a day care with very high noise levels. She had voice problems that
occurred weekly and affected her work attendance, and a score on the VHI indicating
moderate voice problems.
The acoustic properties of day cares are not very frequently investigated in previous
literature. Only in a study by Sala et.al. (2002), the acoustics of 27 day cares in Finland was
investigated. According to this study, only 12 of the rooms in the study had poor acoustics,
indicating that the acoustics at day cares might not be that big of a problem. Poor acoustics
like high reverberation time and low room support can have a negative effect on the voice
however, as it can raise the noise levels even further and fail to support the voice (Astolfi
et.al., 2015; Lyberg-Åhlander et.al., 2014; Lyberg-Åhlander et.al., 2011; Mealings et.al.,
2014; Pelegrin-Garcia et.al., 2010; Rantala & Sala, 2015; Sjödin et.al., 2014). The day cares
in the current study were very different in size and had therefore also different acoustic
properties. Some of the day cares had smaller rooms with and a low roof, which caused a
lower reverberation time and room support. The advantage of these day cares was that they
were able to divide the groups into smaller spaces and rooms, which decreased the activity
noise levels. The day cares with bigger spaces often had a higher reverberation time and
higher noise levels. The day cares where the acoustics were poor posed another risk factor for
the vocal health of day care personnel. One of the day cares was open planned with big
spaces and a high roof. The reverberation time and noise levels were high at this day care,
and the participants mentioned in conversations aside from the formal interviews that their
vocal health was affected negatively by this. They experienced difficulties in being heard and

28

felt that their voices often failed to meet the vocal demands at work.

4.2 Environmental and individual voice ergonomic risk factors
Voice ergonomic risk factors were found in all of the participants’ work environments. The
average amount of risk factors in the day cares was 11.5 (SD = 2.12). In the current study,
most risk factors were found in the risk field ’’Indoor air’’. The most common complaints
about the indoor air climate at the day cares were that it felt dry, stuffy or drafty. Seven of the
participants felt that the indoor air made them drowsy. According to Vilkman (2004),
employees in the teaching profession such as day care personnel are exposed to different
environmental voice ergonomic risk factors, of which poor indoor air climate is a prominent
risk factor in the environment of day cares (Ferng & Lee, 2002; Kaļužnaja & Lakiša, 2016;
Ruotsalainen et.al., 1993; St-Jean et.al., 2012; Tao et.al., 2020). Poor indoor air climate is
most commonly caused by unclean surroundings, insufficient ventilation or too small spaces
which affect the air quality and humidity (Rantala & Sala, 2015; Ruotsalainen et.al., 1993;
St-Jean et.al., 2012). The rooms in the current study had a working ventilation and the spaces
were clean, but the groups were often big, with many children in the same room which may
increase e.g. the levels of carbon oxide, worsening the air quality. The temperature in some of
the day cares was below recommendations and might be related to the drafty feeling some of
the participants experienced.
There was a moderate effect size between the prevalence of voice ergonomic risk factors and
voice problems found in the current study, indicating that the environment had an effect on
the vocal health of the participants. According to previous literature, the prevalence of voice
ergonomic risk factors causes a higher vocal load. The results of the current study also
showed that an increasing amount of voice ergonomic risk factors caused a smaller change in
the participants' F0 value. As mentioned previously, a static F0 value in response to a high
vocal load could also be a sign of an unhealthy vocal behavior, further implying that the
prevalence of voice ergonomic risk factors does indeed have a negative effect on the vocal
health. There was also a moderate effect size between the occurrence of voice symptoms and
the environmental risk field ’’Indoor air’’ in the current study, indicating that there was a
connection between indoor air climate and the prevalence of voice problems. Poor indoor air
climate has previously been reported to cause changes in the voice and affect the vocal health

29

negatively (Geneid et.al., 2009; Rantala et.al., 2012; Rantala & Sala, 2015; Verdolini, Titze
& Fennell, 1994).
In the current study, nine of the participants suffered from some kind of upper respiratory
tract infection or condition that may affect the voice, of which the most common condition
was heartburn. Eight of the participants used some kind of medication. Studies have shown
that the prevalence of upper respiratory infections is a risk factor for developing voice
problems (Charn & Mok, 2012; Devadas et.al., 2017; Lee et.al., 2010; Munier et.al., 2020;
Simberg et.al., 2009). In the current study, moderate effect sizes were found between the
prevalence of voice symptoms and the prevalence of upper respiratory tract infections. These
results are in line with previous studies stating that upper respiratory tract infections are a risk
factor for the vocal health in teachers and day care personnel (Munier et.al., 2020).
Stress affected several of the participants in the current study. Eight of the participants had
been highly or moderately stressed during the last month, and five were stressed at the time
of the investigation. The average total score in the PSS-10 for the group was 17.5 points (SD
= 6.09). One of the participants reported in the background questionnaire that stress affected
her voice. Stress is reported in previous studies to be a voice ergonomic risk factor, although
the literature about the impact of stress in day care personnel is limited. However, a negative
impact of stress on the voice was not detected in the current study as there were no
connections found between stress and voice problems in the statistical analysis. An
explanation for this might again be the small sample size, but it is also probable that stress is
not the most prominent voice ergonomic risk factor. Since there is a lack of research about
the effect of stress in day care personnel, assumptions about how stress affects, or does not
affect, the voice in day care personnel cannot be made.
In this study, the impact of several other possible voice ergonomic risk factors was
investigated but turned out not to have a considerable impact in this study or it was not
possible or beneficial to check for relationships. These potential risk factors were size of the
groups of children, age of the children and gender (Durup et.al., 2015; Kaļužnaja & Lakiša,
2016; Portela et.al., 2013; Russell, Oates & Greenwood, 1998; Sjödin et.al., 2012; Smith
et.al., 1998; Södersten et.al., 2002; Vilkman, 2004). The age range of the children varied
within the groups and was therefore not possible to use in the analysis. There were no
connections found in the analysis including the size of the groups. Since all participants in
this study were women, a gender comparison was not possible.

30

4.3 Preventive voice care in the teaching profession.
Several of the participants in the current study reported that they would be interested in
learning about preventive voice care. Only three participants had previously received some
sort of voice training. The knowledge about preventive voice care is often limited among day
care personnel and teachers. In a study by Tao, Lee, Hu and Liu (2020), 91.5% of the 414
kindergarten and elementary school teachers participating in the study had never received any
kind of voice training. In a study by Munier and Kinsella (2007), 93% of the 304 teachers
participating in the study had never received any kind of voice education. A study by
Kankare, Geneid, Laukkanen and Vilkman (2012) reported slightly better results, as 62% of
the preschool teachers reported that they had received some kind of voice training. Improper
use of the voice is a risk factor for developing voice problems as well as other factors like
unergonomic posture and lack of voice rest may affect the voice negatively (Arboleda &
Frederick, 2008; Hammarberg, Södersten & Lindestad, 2007; Tao et.al., 2020).
Preventive voice care consisting of ergonomic voice use, the use of aids like voice amplifiers
and the optimization of the environment for the voice is essential in order to sustain a healthy
voice, especially during conditions with high vocal load (Vilkman, 2004). In a study by
Sjödin, Kjellberg, Knutsson, Landström and Lindberg (2014), preventive measures like noise
isolation, smaller groups, voice education and the use of recovery rooms for voice rest had a
positive effect on the voice health of the preschool teachers. Karjalainen, Sahlén, Falck,
Brännström and Lyberg-Åhlander (2020) found that teachers who had received voice
ergonomic education improved their ability at evaluating their voices and well-being. They
also had a lower prevalence of burn-out symptoms. The use of voice amplifiers has proven to
be beneficial for teachers as it resulted in a significant decrease in the F0 and SPL values
(Sapienza, Crandell & Curtis, 1999; Jonsdottir, 2003). In a study by Jonsdottir (2003) the use
of a voice amplifier also reduced the prevalence of voice symptoms in the five teachers
participating in the study. In order to improve the indoor air quality, it would be important to
have a working mechanical ventilation as it improves the air quality (St-Jean et.al., 2012).
Since the vocal load in day care employees is high and they are a risk group for developing
voice problems, preventive measures and education in preventive voice care would be
important for this group.

31

4.4 Limitations of the study
There were several limitations of this study which affected the results. One limitation was
technical issues that arose during the investigation. Technical problems with the voice
accumulator Vocal Holter Recorder, which was the main data collecting method for this
study, resulted in data completely missing from the analysis, decreasing the amount of the
acoustic data obtained. During the investigation, there were also different instructions given
as to how to use the Vocal Holter Recorder, which resulted in a non-consistency throughout
the measurements. Due to technical problems with the hygrometer, the humidity at the day
cares could not be measured either.
Another limitation of the study was the small sample. It was decided to include only a few
participants in the study in order to conduct a qualitative and narrow evaluation of each
participants’ situation, but this quickly becomes a limitation when data is missing due to
technical issues, as mentioned, or mistakes or misunderstandings. generalization of the results
of a small sample are also not possible, and the results should always be interpreted carefully.
Improvements could also have been made to the background questionnaire, as some of the
questions were misinterpreted or misunderstood.

4.5 Conclusions and future research

The aim of this thesis was to investigate the prevalence of voice problems in day care
personnel and detect potential risk factors that may be the cause to eventual voice symptoms.
The findings of this study support previous literature, stating that day care personnel are a
risk group for developing voice problems. The vocal load in this profession is high due to
high noise levels, and day care personnel are exposed to several individual and environmental
voice ergonomic risk factors. Furthermore, there is a lack of knowledge about preventive
voice care in this profession. In the current study, the prevalence of voice problems was 40%.
There where environmental risk factors in all of the day cares, the biggest risk factor being
high background noise levels. Although a large part of the acoustic data obtained with the
Vocal Holter recorder was missing due to technical issues, the F0 values of seven of the
participants was obtained. The analysis of the data showed a change in the F0 value from the

32

short-term monitoring to the long-term monitoring in all of the seven participants. An
interesting find was the changes in the participants’ F0 in response to high vocal load,
indicating that a fluctuant F0 could be a sign of a healthy voice behavior. Although the results
of the statistical analysis must be carefully interpreted due to the small sample size, a few
connections and relevant effect sizes that are in line with previous literature could be
observed. The most important finding was a positive correlation and a moderate effect size
between the prevalence of voice problems and noise levels at the day cares. Preventive
measures and education in preventive voice care would be important for day care personnel,
as it would decrease the vocal load and the risk of developing voice problems.
Since the research about this group is limited, further research is recommended in order to
achieve a more comprehensive understanding of especially the voice ergonomic risk factors
in day care personnel. A larger sample size would be beneficial in order to be able to
generalize the results. Since day care personnel clearly is a risk group for developing voice
problems, it would be important to conduct further research on this subject in order to lessen
the prevalence of voice problems and risk factors in this group.

Swedish summary/Svensk sammanfattning

Röstsymptom, röstanvändning och röstergonomiska riskfaktorer hos
dagvårdspersonal.

Introduktion

Dagvårdspersonal och förskolelärare är utsatta för flera olika röstergonomiska riskfaktorer i
sitt yrke (Södersten m.fl., 2002). Bullernivåerna är ofta för höga och röstbelastningen är stor
för dagvårdspersonal ( Durup m.fl., 2015; Lyberg-Åhlander m.fl., 2011; Portela m.fl., 2013;
Rantala m.fl., 2015; Södersten m.fl., 2002). Utöver detta är dagvårdspersonal utsatt för flera
röstergonomiska riskfaktorer i arbetsmiljön (Vilkman, 2004). Dagvårdspersonal skulle dra

33

nytta av att lära sig om röstergonomi, men kunskapen kring ämnet är ofta begränsad i denna
grupp (Munier & Kinsella, 2007; Tao m.fl., 2020).
Förekomsten av röstproblem hos 119 finska barnträdgårdslärare i en studie av Kankare,
Geneid, Laukkanen och Vilkman (2012) var 21%. Hela 94% av deltagarna hade upplevt
någon form av rösttrötthet. I en studie av Sala, Laine, Simberg, Pentti och Suonpää (2001)
var prevalensen för röstproblem hos 262 finska barnträdgårdslärare 37%. En av de största
röstergonomiska riskfaktorerna för dagvårdspersonal är de höga ljudnivåerna på daghemmen,
som kan uppgå till så mycket som 70–80 dB (Grebennikov, 2006; Jonsdottir m.fl., 2015;
Kaļužnaja & Lakiša, 2016; Lindstrom m.fl., 2011; Sala m.fl., 2002; Simões-Zenari m.fl.,
2012; Sjödin m.fl., 2012; Södersten m.fl., 2002; Vilkman, 2004). Barnens unga ålder samt
olika aktiviteter som fri lek bidrar till de höga ljudnivåerna, men bakgrundsbuller från till
exempel ventilation bidrar till en stor del av bullret (Durup m.fl., 2015; Kaļužnaja & Lakiša,
2016; Lyberg-Åhlander m.fl., 2011; Portela m.fl., 2013; Rantala m.fl., 2015; Sjödin m.fl.,
2012; Södersten m.fl., 2002; Vilkman, 2004). I en studie av Sala m.fl. (2002) var
bullernivåerna på de finska daghemmen i höga, med en medelnivå på 67 dB. Eftersom man
ofta automatiskt höjer röststyrkan vid höga ljudnivåer (Lane & Tranel, 1971), ledde detta till i
en ökad röstbelastning hos deltagarna i studien. Barnträdgårdslärarna använde en röststyrka
på 78 dB i medeltal, och fonationstiden var 40%. Både röststyrkan och fonationstiden var
mer hos barnträdgårdslärarna än hos deras kontrollgrupp av sjuksköterskor. Liknande resultat
rapporterades från daghem i Sverige, där höga bullernivåer ledde till en ökning i deltagarnas
röststyrka och F0 värden (Södersten m.fl., 2002).
Personer i läraryrken är även utsatta för andra både individuella och i arbetsmiljön
röstergonomiska riskfaktorer, som dålig akustik i rummen, dålig inomhusluft, stress och
luftvägssjukdomar eller andra tillstånd som påverkar rösten negativt. Det finns dock inte
många studier kring hur dessa riskfaktorer påverkar dagvårdspersonal. Ruotsalainen,
Jaakkola och Jaakkola (1993) undersökte inomhusluftens kvalitet på 30 daghem i Finland och
rapporterade att inomhusluften på de flesta daghemmen i studien var dålig på grund av bland
annat ineffektiv ventilation och luftutbyte. Stress och luftvägssjukdomar har även
rapporterats ha en negativ påverkan på rösten hos dagvårdspersonal (Jonsdottir m.fl., 2015;
Munier m.fl., 2020). Det skulle dock behövas mer forskning kring ämnet för att kunna
noggrannare kartlägga röstergonomiska riskfaktorers påverkan på dagvårdspersonals
rösthälsa.

34

Syfte
Syftet med avhandlingen var att undersöka förekomsten av röstsymptom hos
dagvårdspersonal samt att undersöka förekomsten av röstergonomiska riskfaktorer. Eftersom
litteraturen kring ämnet är begränsad och det finns ett behov av att utöka forskningen kring
ämnet, är denna avhandling relevant.
Metod
I studien deltog en förskolelärare och tio dagvårdare från fyra svenskspråkiga daghem och en
förskola i Åbo. Data kring deltagarnas röstanvändning samlades in med hjälp av en
röstackumulator, Vocal Holter Recorder, som registrerade akustiskt data från stämbandens
vibrationer. Utöver detta fick deltagarna även fylla i ett bakgrundsformulär om allmän hälsa
och rösthälsa, röstformulären Screen-11 och Rösthandikappindexet samt ett formulär om
upplevd stress, Upplevd Stress Skala-10. En utvärdering av deltagarnas arbetsmiljö och
röstergonomiska riskfaktorer utfördes även. Utvärderingen inkluderade instrumentella
mätningar av bland annat bullernivåer på deltagarnas arbetsplatser, intervjuer och
observationer.
Resultat och slutsatser

Förekomsten av röstsymptom hos deltagarna i avhandlingen var 40%. Tre av deltagarna hade
ett resultat i Rösthandikappindexet som skulle kunna indikera på en måttlig röststörning.
Höga bullernivåer var den största röstergonomiska riskfaktorn i studien, vilket även
rapporterats tidigare (Helidoni m.fl., 2012; Kaļužnaja & Lakiša, 2016; Lindstrom m.fl., 2010;
Lindstrom m.fl., 2011; Portela m.fl., 2013; Remacle m.fl., 2014; Sala m.fl., 2002; SimõesZenari m.fl., 2012; Södersten m.fl., 2002). Bullernivåerna var högre än rekommendationerna
på alla daghem i nuvarande studie, och deltagarna ansåg att rösten belastades av detta. På
grund av tekniska problem fattades data från de akustiska mätningarna med
röstackumulatorn, men sju deltagares F0 värden kunde ändå analyseras. I analysen framkom
det att nästan alla deltagares F0 värden höjdes under dagen, vilket kan vara en reaktion på de
höga ljudnivåerna och orsaka en stor röstbelastning (Lane & Tranel, 1971; Lindstrom m.fl.,
2010; Lindstrom m.fl., 2011; Lyberg-Åhlander m.fl., 2014; Portela m.fl., 2013; Remacle

35

m.fl., 2014; Simões-Zenari m.fl., 2012; Södersten m.fl., 2002; Vilkman, 2004). Daghemmens
utrymmen varierade i storlek och egenskap, men flera daghems utrymmen hade brister i
akustiken och i kvaliteten på inomhusluften. På grund av det begränsade samplet kunde
samband mellan olika variabler endast tolkas kvalitativt i den statistiska analysen, men några
intressanta riktningar som överensstämmer med litteraturen observerades ändå. Det fanns ett
starkt samband mellan buller och förekomsten av röstproblem, vilket har observerats i flera
studier tidigare (Jonsdottir m.fl., 2015; Kaļužnaja & Lakiša, 2016; Kankare m.fl., 2012;
Sjödin m.fl., 2012; Södersten m.fl., 2005; Tao m.fl., 2020; Vilkman, 2004). Det fanns även
ett negativt samband mellan deltagarnas F0 värden och röstproblem, vilket är ett intressant
fynd eftersom det skulle indikera att ett fluktuerande F0 värde är ett tecken på ett friskt
röstbeteende (Lyberg-Åhlander m.fl., 2014). Det fanns ett samband mellan förekomsten av
röstergonomiska riskfaktorer och röstsymptom, vilket tyder på att arbetsmiljön har en
påverkan på rösthälsan (Ferng & Lee, 2002; Kaļužnaja & Lakiša, 2016; Ruotsalainen m.fl.,
1993; St-Jean m.fl., 2012; Tao m.fl., 2020). Detta syntes även i analyser med F0 värden och
förekomsten av röstergonomiska riskfaktorer. Vidare fanns det ett samband mellan
luftvägssjukdomar och förekomsten av röstproblem (Munier m.fl., 2020).
Resultaten i nuvarande studie visar att dagvårdspersonal är en riskgrupp för att utveckla
röstproblem, även om resultaten bör tolkas kritiskt på grund av det begränsade samplet.
Dagvårdspersonal har en stor röstbelastning på grund av höga ljudnivåer i sitt yrke, vilket kan
leda till röstproblem. Dagvårdspersonal är dessutom även utsatt för andra röstergonomiska
riskfaktorer i arbetsmiljön. Det finns ett behov att utöka forskningen kring ämnet, eftersom
litteraturen gällande röstproblem hos dagvårdspersonal är begränsad. Därför behövs det
vidare forskning för att kunna minska förekomsten av röstproblem och röstergonomiska
riskfaktorer i denna yrkesgrupp.

Skriftligt samtycke
Voice symptoms, voice use and voice risk factors in day care personnel
Hej, och välkommen att delta i min Pro gradu avhandling!
Jag studerar femte året talterapi vid Åbo Akademi och gör just nu min Pro gradu avhandling
om förekomsten av röstsymtom hos dagvårdspersonal och röstergonomiska riskfaktorer i
deras arbetsmiljö. Resultat av tidigare studier har visat att personer som använder rösten i sitt
arbete har många röstergonomiska riskfaktorer i sin arbetsmiljö. Resultaten tyder också på att
dagvårdspersonal kunde vara en speciellt utsatt grupp. Därför är det viktigt att noggrannare
kartlägga arbetssituationen, röstanvändningen och arbetsmiljön.
Undersökningen går ut på att du får bära en röstackumulator (Vocal Holter recorder) under en
hel arbetsdag. Röstackumulatorn är en apparat som bärs runt halsen och mäter och registrerar
akustiska värden som ger information om stämbanden och rösten. Apparaten spelar inte in
det du säger. Ackumulatorn är ansluten till en applikation (app) som laddas ner på telefonen.
Appen kan tyvärr dock endast laddas ner på Android-telefoner, så för att kunna delta i studien
bör du ha tillgång till en Android-telefon. Röstackumulatorn är diskret och stör inte arbetet.
Som tillägg till detta får du även fylla i ett frågeformulär och delta i en intervju (ca 30 min).
Resultaten i studien anonymiseras och behandlas konfidentiellt. Avhandlingen har blivit
godkänd av den forskningsetiska nämnden i psykologi och logopedi vid Åbo Akademi, och
beviljats forskningslov av Åbo stad.
Information som samlas in till studien är namn, ålder, allmänna uppgifter om daghemmet och
din daghemsgrupp och svar på en frågeblankett om bland annat din hälsa, allmäntillstånd,
stress, röstergonomi och röst. Dessa uppgifter jämförs med det akustiska data som samlats in
med hjälp av röstackumulatorn för att kunna kartlägga förekomsten av röstsymtom hos
dagvårdspersonal och identifiera eventuella riskfaktorer för att utveckla röstsymtom.
All information som samlas in är endast till för min studie och all data kommer att behandlas
konfidentiellt. Det insamlade materialet och datamatrisen för de statistiska analyserna
kommer att anonymiseras. Avhandlingen kommer att rapportera endast värden och resultat
för insamlat och analyserat data och enskilda deltagare kan inte identifieras utifrån det.
Insamlade uppgifter kommer att förvaras säkert bakom två lås i utrymmen vid ämnet
logopedi, Arken. Uppgifterna bevaras i 5 år efter att datat publicerats i en tidskrift, eller ifall
publicering inte sker, 5 år efter avslutat projekt. En dataskyddsbeskrivning finns till påseende
vid ämnet logopedi vid Åbo Akademi.

På denna blankett ger du ditt skriftliga samtycke till att delta i studien genom att kryssa i
nedanstående rutor och ge din underskrift. Ditt deltagande är frivilligt och du har rätt att
avbryta ditt deltagande när som helst utan att ange orsak.

□ Ja, jag är myndig.
□ Ja, jag har förstått ovanstående och godkänner att mina uppgifter används i studien, samt
att de förvaras vid ämnet logopedi, Arken.

□ Ja, jag samtycker till att delta i studien.
□ Ja, jag samtycker till att ge mina kontaktuppgifter för att kunna bli kontaktad gällande
eventuella praktiska arrangemang gällande tidpunkt för datainsamling och intervju.

PRESSMEDDELANDE

Voice symptoms, voice use and voice risk factors in day care personnel

Pro gradu-avhandling i logopedic
Fakulteten för humaniora, psykologi och teologi, Åbo Akademi

Resultaten från en pro gradu-avhandling vid Åbo Akademi visar att dagvårdspersonal är en
riskgrupp för att utveckla röstproblem. Sara Alopaeus har undersökt förekomsten av
röstproblem och röstergonomiska riskfaktorer hos dagvårdspersonal i Åbo. Förekomsten av
röstproblem hos deltagarna var hög, och flera röstergonomiska riskfaktorer hittades i
deltagarnas arbetsmiljö. Även deltagarnas röstbelastning var hög.
Tio dagvårdare och en förskolelärare deltog i avhandlingen. Materialet samlades in med hjälp
av en röstackumulator, Vocal Holter Recorder. Ett bakgrundsformulär om rösthälsa och
allmänhälsa, röstformulären Screen-11 och Rösthandikappindexet samt ett formulär om
upplevd stress, PSS-10, kompletterade det insamlade datat. Utöver detta utfördes även en
evaluering av deltagarnas arbetsmiljö och förekomsten av röstergonomiska riskfaktorer.
Trots att dagvårdspersonal är en riskgrupp för att utveckla röstproblem, är den tillgängliga
