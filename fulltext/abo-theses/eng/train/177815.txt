Effects of the non-indigenous Harris mud crab on eelgrass growth
Master’s thesis, 54 pp. (+ appendix)

Abstract
Biological invasions are occurring at increasingly fast rates, and they are among the most serious
threats to biodiversity. Introduced species interact with local communities, potentially altering the
food web structure and functioning. The Harris mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) is an
introduced species in the Baltic Sea, where its distribution range is expanding. Since there are no
native crab species in the northern Baltic Sea, the mud crab is expected to affect the structure and
functioning of native ecosystems. It utilises a range of habitats and was recently discovered in
eelgrass (Zostera marina), an important foundation species, in its introduced range. Mud crab
predation on invertebrate grazers and mussels could induce a trophic cascade through top-down
processes, which would negatively affect eelgrass by promoting filamentous algae and altering
sediment nutrient levels. Previous studies suggest the mud crab can induce trophic cascades in the
Baltic Sea, where the simple food web structures are vulnerable to change. Effects of the mud crab
in eelgrass have not previously been studied. Here, I conducted a field survey to measure mud crab
densities in an eelgrass meadow. Then, I studied the potential occurrence of a mud crab induced
trophic cascade and direct physical disturbance to eelgrass through an aquarium experiment. The
density of mud crabs in an eelgrass meadow in the Archipelago Sea was 21 crabs/m-2, which was
five times higher than the last sampling in 2015. The mud crabs readily consumed invertebrates in
the aquarium experiment, but no trophic cascade occurred; the mud crab did not affect porewater
nutrients, algal growth or eelgrass growth. Light availability was instead the determining factor for
eelgrass and algal growth. The burrowing behaviour of the mud crab did disturb eelgrass and caused
uprooting of planted shoots. This is the first record of mud crabs uprooting eelgrass shoots. The
density of mud crabs in the Baltic Sea is generally poorly known and the data available have been
collected using varying methods, making comparisons difficult. Here, I present an estimate of mud
crab densities based on core samples that sample both burrowed and active crabs to accurately
reflect the population structure and density. Mud crab burrowing behaviour could disturb eelgrass,
especially transplanted shoots that are not stabilised by complex root and rhizome structures.
Further studies are needed to determine the occurrence of trophic cascades and uprooting of shoots
in field conditions.

1. Introduction
1.1 Non-indigenous species
Ecosystems are formed by a network of multiple interactions between species and their
environment, and these interactions result in a flow of energy through food webs. Changing the
interactions can have unpredictable far-reaching effects, which may resonate across trophic levels.
Biological invasions caused by the introduction of non-indigenous species (NIS) are especially
effective at inducing changes in recipient ecosystems (Carlton 1996, Paolucci et al. 2013). NIS are
species or lower taxa that have been moved outside of their natural range, intentionally or
unintentionally resulting from human activities (Olenin & Minchin 2011). Sometimes the true
origin of a species is unclear, then it is referred to as a cryptogenic species (Carlton 1996). NIS can
potentially alter local biodiversity and modify the structure, functions and services that the
ecosystems provide (Strayer 2012).
Biological invasions are considered one of the most serious threats to biodiversity, second only to
habitat destruction and loss (Niemivuo-Lahti 2012). The rate at which biological invasions are
occurring is rapidly increasing (Leppäkoski & Olenin 2000a, Ojaveer & Kotta 2015) and constitutes
an unprecedented form of global change (Ricciardi 2007). Currently, 193 NIS and cryptogenic
species have been recorded in the Baltic Sea (AquaNIS 2020). The number has drastically increased
since 2001, when 100 recorded species were listed (Leppäkoski et al. 2002). The main global vector
of NIS transfer is ship traffic (Molnar et al. 2008, Bailey 2015), an activity that has increased
fourfold between 1992 and 2012 (Tournadre 2014). The main ways in which NIS have been
introduced to the Baltic Sea are through intentional introduction (e.g. for aquaculture),
transportation of the habitat itself containing NIS (e.g. ship fouling or ballast water), and through
opening canals and rivers that allow active or passive natural dispersal (Leppäkoski et al. 2002).
The spread of NIS simultaneously adds common species and removes unique or endemic species
(Ruiz et al. 1997). Thereby, it is facilitating a subtle long-term process of homogenization of the
world’s biodiversity leading to increased homogeneity in the ecosystems (McKinney & Lockwood
1999). Generally, NIS have increased local species richness in the Baltic Sea, but they have also
caused local declines of several native species (Leppäkoski et al. 2002). Many of the nonindigenous species in the Baltic Sea originate from warmer areas (Leppäkoski et al. 2002).
Therefore, rising temperatures and changes in salinity conditions can potentially influence the
invasion patterns of NIS in the Baltic (Leppäkoski et al. 2002, Holopainen et al. 2016). If global
warming continues, warm-water species are more likely to establish in large areas of the Baltic Sea
(Holopainen et al. 2016).
Through their effects on native ecosystems, NIS also further threaten the sustainability of natural
resources (Ojaveer & Kotta 2015). Thus, several international policy/legislative frameworks and
tools have been developed (Ojaveer & Kotta 2015). For example, the EU Marine Strategy
Framework Directive (MSFD) (European Commission 2008) explicitly requires the impacts of NIS
1

Linn Engström
to be evaluated and embedded into an ecosystem context. The European Commission Decision
contains two criteria for assessing the impacts of NIS (Descriptor 2, European Commission 2010) in
relation to the progress of achieving good environmental status. The criteria regard the abundance
of NIS and their environmental impact at the level of species, habitats and ecosystems, which will
be addressed in this thesis. Research into the effects of NIS in the Baltic Sea is essential to develop
an understanding of the potentially far-reaching effects of NIS in the Baltic Sea and globally, and to
enable appropriate management.

1.2 The Baltic Sea
The Baltic Sea is one of the world’s largest brackish-water sea areas, covering almost 400 000 km-2.
The area is non-tidal and shallow. It is a unique area, influenced by strong environmental gradients
(e.g. temperature, salinity, exposure) that determine the species distribution (Snoeijs-Leijonmalm &
Andrén 2017). These gradients can be described as three-dimensional (longitude, latitude, depth)
and they vary temporally over years, seasons and days. This environmental variability in the Baltic
Sea offers hospitable conditions for NIS originating from across the world, displaying varying
ecological tolerances (Leppäkoski & Olenin 2000a). Furthermore, the species richness in the Baltic
Sea is naturally low, which allow NIS to colonize empty niches (Paavola et al. 2005). The
biological diversity of the Baltic Sea originates to a large extent from NIS (Leppäkoski & Olenin
2000a). NIS often provide a new function (e.g. feeding strategy) or a new trophic level, thus they
can potentially restructure the local community (Leppäkoski et al. 2002). The Baltic Sea serves as
both a recipient and donor area, which makes it an important node in the global network of NIS
transfers (Leppäkoski & Olenin 2000b).
The semi-enclosed sea is subjected to multiple anthropogenic pressures, and it is sensitive to
stressors such as pollution due to its characteristics. These characteristics include a long water
residence time (30-40 years), shallow depth and a large catchment area (Korpinen et al. 2012). The
catchment area covers 1 700 000 km-2, which is large compared to the volume of the Baltic Sea.
The catchment area is also densely populated, with 85 million inhabitants (HELCOM 2018). The
effects of anthropogenic pressures reflect on the degraded state of the sea; long-term trends are
dominated by large-scale eutrophication, accumulation of contaminants and over-exploited fish
populations (HELCOM 2018). The associated increase in phytoplankton and ephemeral macroalgae
is considered one of the most serious threats to the environment in the Baltic Sea (Bonsdorff et al.
1997, Jansson & Dahlberg 1999, Snoeijs-Leijonmalm et al. 2017). Eutrophication has been a
prevailing issue for decades. Although the annual nutrient input into the Baltic Sea has decreased,
the status of the marine environment has not improved, and most areas are still suffering from
eutrophication (HELCOM 2018)

1.3 The mud crab
The Harris mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii Gould, 1841), hereafter referred to as the mud crab,
is an introduced species in the Baltic Sea, native to the northwest Atlantic (from Canada to the Gulf
of Mexico) (Williams 1984). The mud crab has been present in the southern Baltic Sea since the
1950s or earlier (Turoboyski 1973), but during recent years it has expanded northwards and was
first observed in the Finnish Archipelago Sea in 2009 (Karhilahti 2010). Shortly afterwards, the
crab was discovered in the Gulf of Riga as well (Kotta & Ojaveer 2012). The mud crab has rapidly
increased in abundance and extended its distribution area to several habitats after the first
observation in Finland (Fowler et al. 2013). It is a relatively small species, reaching a carapace
width of 26 mm in the Baltic Sea (Turoboyski 1973).
The mud crab is the first and, so far, only crab species to become established in the northern Baltic
Sea (Elmgren & Hill 1997, Boström 2003, Bonsdorff 2006, Gagnon & Boström 2016). Therefore,
the introduction of the mud crab into the area can be assumed to alter functional links in the food
web and affect the community structure and functioning (Forsström et al. 2015, Gagnon & Boström
2016). The lack of competition from native crab species in the northern Baltic Sea can potentially
further facilitate its expansion (Gagnon & Boström et al. 2016). The mud crab has been identified as
a potentially or locally harmful non-indigenous species in the Baltic Sea and is included in
Finland’s National Strategy on Invasive Species (Niemivuo-Lahti 2012).
Mud crabs utilise available habitats in an opportunistic manner. In their native range they are
typically found in habitats that offer shelter, e.g. oyster reefs or other natural structures that form
cavities, but these structures are a limiting resource in the northern Baltic Sea (Fowler et al. 2013).
Mud crabs occur in several types of habitats in the northern Baltic Sea, e.g. in reed belts
(Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex steud), bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus Linnaeus, 1753)
beds, buried in muddy bottoms, hiding under small rocks and are even found at exposed hard
bottom sites (Fowler et al. 2013). More recently, it was discovered that mud crabs also utilise
eelgrass (Zostera marina Linnaeus, 1753) as a habitat in the Archipelago Sea (Gagnon & Boström
2016). Mud crabs occur in seagrass meadows in their native range as well, but this is the first time
they have been recorded in seagrass in their introduced area (Gagnon & Boström 2016). This broad
range of habitat use suggests that mud crabs colonize almost all available types of habitat in Finnish
coastal waters (Fowler et al. 2013).

The mud crab is one of the most widely distributed brachyuran crab species is the world (Roche &
Torchin 2007). Generalist species, such as the mud crab, tend to be successful invaders (Weis
2010). The mud crab possesses many characteristics of a successful invader, such as high
reproductive capacity, a planktonic larval stage, omnivorous feeding habits and tolerance to a wide
range of temperature (1-35 °C) and salinity (1-40 ‰) (Turoboyski 1973). Mud crabs can even
survive short periods of being frozen (Turoboyski 1973). Mud crabs are present at depths down to
20 meters (Hegele-Drywa & Normant 2014), and at low temperatures they migrate to deeper waters
and bury themselves in the sediment (Turoboyski 1973).
The mud crab is omnivorous and feeds on sessile and mobile macroinvertebrates, as well as algae
and dead organic matter (Turoboyski 1973, Hegele-Drywa & Normant 2009, Forsström et al. 2015).
It is an efficient predator of littoral grazers and mussels (Forsström et al. 2015). The mud crab
readily consumes gammarid amphipods (Gammarus spp.) isopods (Idotea spp.), blue mussels
(Mytilus trossulus Gould, 1850/Mytilus edulis Linnaeus, 1758) and gastropods (Theodoxus
fluviatilis Linneaus, 1758) (Forsström et al. 2015, Jormalainen et al. 2016). Mud crabs prefer to
prey upon small and medium sized prey, which suggests that they could potentially alter the prey
population size structure (Forsström et al. 2015).
Several studies have identified the mud crab as an omnivore, however, Aarnio et al. (2015) suggest
the trophic level of this novel species might be more complicated than this, as stable isotope
analyses suggest that the mud crab undergoes an ontogenetic diet shift as it grows. The isotope
signatures position small individuals (< 12 mm) among primary consumers, while large individuals
(> 12 mm) are more similar to secondary consumers (Aarnio et al. 2015). In other words, small
crabs primarily feed on detritus and plant matter, while larger individuals prey on other animals.
The reason mud crabs undergo this dietary shift remains unclear, but it could for example be due to
size-specific nutritional requirements related to moulting and growth (Aarnio et al. 2015).

Mud crabs contribute to secondary production as they are consumed by different predatory species
in the Baltic Sea, including fish such as the fourhourned sculpin (Myoxocephalus quadricornis
Linnaeus, 1758), perch (Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758) and roach (Rutilus rutilus Linnaeus, 1758)
(Ovaskainen 2015, Puntila-Dodd et al. 2019) as well as seabirds such as goldeneyes (Bucephala
clangula Linnaeus, 1758) and great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis Staunton, 1796)
(Forsström et al. 2015 and references therein).

1.4 Eelgrass
Seagrass meadows are critically important ecosystems across the globe. They provide a multitude of
ecosystem services, such as nursery and feeding areas, high faunal production and diversity, carbon
sequestration and storage, primary production, sediment stabilization and nutrient recycling (Duarte
2002, Green & Short 2003). The complex three-dimensional habitat they form supports diverse
infaunal and epifaunal communities on otherwise species-poor sandy substrates (Boström &
Bonsdorff 1997, Boström et al. 2006, Jephson et al. 2008). Eelgrass is the only seagrass species in
the Baltic Sea, and forms some of the most diverse marine ecosystems in Scandinavia (Boström et
al. 2014). Seagrasses are foundation species that provide critically important habitat; however, they
are threatened by several factors including human-mediated stressors such as overfishing,
eutrophication and habitat destruction (Duarte 2002, Boström et al. 2014). They are also affected by
biological stressors such as disease and factors related to human mediated climate change (Orth et
al. 2006). Biological invasions also pose a potential threat, as they have been shown to have
multiple negative impacts on the native community structure and functioning in seagrass
ecosystems around the world (Williams 2007).
Significant global declines of seagrass ecosystems, in areal extent and habitat value, have been
experienced over the past decades (Orth & Moore 1983, Short & Wyllie-Echeverria 1996, Waycott
et al. 2009). The rapid rates at which seagrass decline is progressing makes them among the most
threatened ecosystems on the planet (Orth et al. 2006, Hughes et al. 2009, Waycott et al. 2009). The
rate of decline in seagrass meadows has accelerated during the past century, but the largest losses
have occurred after 1980 (Waycott et al. 2009). However, a recent trend reversal has been
documented in Europe (de los Santos et al. 2019). It has been estimated that 35 % of seagrass area
has been lost globally during the period 1879-2006 (Waycott et al. 2009). In Europe, the largest
percentage of seagrass area decline have occurred in the Baltic Sea (de los Santos et al. 2019).
Large-scale losses have been documented in Denmark since the early 1900s where an estimated 80
% of eelgrass area has been lost (Boström et al. 2003). In addition, local losses of 60-100 % of
eelgrass area have been reported from Sweden, Poland and Lithuania (Baden et al. 2003, Boström et
al. 2003).
The eelgrass meadows in the northern Baltic Sea generally have low genetic diversity and mainly
reproduce vegetatively due to the low salinity (Reusch et al. 1999). At its northernmost distribution
range (southern Finland; Boström et al. 2003), large meadows often consist of one or only a few
5

Linn Engström
clones and they can be more than 1000 years old (Reusch et al. 1999). Due to the low genetic
diversity, these low-salinity populations may be at considerable risk to human impacts and climate
change (Reusch et al. 1999). In the case of large scale-declines in eelgrass distribution in this area,
the probability of recolonization is very low, and recovery would be slow (Reusch et al. 1999). The
recovery process is further complicated by a combination of environmental factors (Krause-Jensen
et al. 2012), such as the relative abundance of top predators, intermediate predators and
mesograzers which mediate macroalgal blooms (Hughes et al. 2013). The importance of an
ecosystem approach to understand and predict seagrass losses and recovery has been highlighted
through a growing body of literature providing evidence for bottom-up and/or top-down control
(Crowder & Norse 2008, Foley et al. 2010).
According to the Red list of Finnish species, eelgrass is listed as “near threatened” (Hyvärinen et al.
2019). Eelgrass meadows are included in legislation that concern coastal areas through several EU
directives, such as the Habitats Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrate Directive and
the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Furthermore, HELCOM also recognises the need to
protect and monitor eelgrass ecosystems, however, without any legislative power.

1.5 Top-down control and trophic cascades
Trophic cascades have been identified in a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial systems (Pace et al.
1999). A trophic cascade occurs when changes on one trophic level in the food web resonate across
more than one trophic link (Carpenter & Kitchell 1993). Trophic cascades are stronger and more
likely to occur in marine than terrestrial ecosystems, due to trophic links generally being stronger in
marine benthic systems (Strong 1992, Shurin et al. 2002, Shurin et al. 2006, Leroux & Loreau
2008). It has been suggested that trophic cascades are limited to simple ecosystems (Strong et al.
1992), however, recent findings suggest that they can occur in diverse communities with complex
food webs as well, if the interaction strength is skewed toward only a few functionally dominant
species (Pace 1999, Moksnes et al. 2008, Hughes et al. 2013).
The importance of higher trophic levels in regulating communities and ecosystem functioning has
gained more recognition recently. For a long time, the mechanisms limiting the size of natural
populations were assumed to be regulated mainly by primary producers or the input of limiting
nutrients (bottom-up control), meaning that nutrient supply enhances primary production which
resonates to higher trophic levels (Banse 2007). In contrast, higher trophic levels can also regulate
lower trophic levels through predation (top-down control) (Hairston et al. 1960). Declines in toppredators may cause mesopredator release, which is an increase in smaller predators (e.g. mud crab)
(Frank et al. 2005, Sieben et al. 2011, Nilsson et al. 2019). High abundances of mesopredators can
significantly reduce the densities of mesograzers, which release algae from grazer control and
allows algae to thrive in response to elevated nutrient levels (Moksnes et al. 2008, Baden et al.
2010).

6

Linn Engström

Drifting mats of filamentous algae have become increasingly common
in the Baltic Sea (Vahteri et al. 2000, Lehvo & Bäck 2001). If algae
are allowed to grow, they can form mats of unattached drifting algae
which risk shading other macrophytes, and they can form hypoxic
conditions when decaying (Valiela et al. 1997). Hypoxic conditions
can reduce the ability of mesograzers to control algal growth, by
limiting mesograzer populations (Valiela et al. 1997). In the absence
of top-down control, mesograzer populations are able to respond to
enhanced resource availability by increasing in abundance and hence
control algal growth, even under increased nutrient loading (Hughes et
al 2004, Valentine & Duffy 2006).
Trophic cascades through top-down processes have been identified in
seagrass meadows, where extensive seagrass decline has occurred as a
result. Along the Swedish west coast, the decline in piscivorous fish
led to a mesopredator release, which was linked to an increase in
macroalgal blooms (Eriksson et al. 2009) and extensive eelgrass loss
(Moksnes et al. 2008, Baden et al. 2010, Baden et al. 2012). The area
was affected by eutrophication from before, but the severe effects of
algal blooms in eelgrass meadows only appeared after the decline in
piscivorous fish, which subsequently caused mesograzer populations
to almost disappear (Baden et al. 2012). Trophic cascades have also
been recorded in the context of recovering seagrass ecosystems. The
recovery of a top predatory sea otter (Enhydra lutris Linnaeus, 1758)
population facilitated eelgrass recovery in a highly nutrient loaded
estuary in California (Hughes et al. 2013). The sea otters had
mitigating effects on nutrient loading indirectly through the predation
on crabs (mesopredators), which consequently allowed mesograzer
populations to recover and better control the development of algae
(Figure 2, Hughes et al. 2013).
Furthermore, field studies on the mud crab in the northern Baltic Sea
have identified trophic cascades, which have most likely been caused
by the introduction of the mud crab (Jormalainen et al. 2016, Kotta et
al. 2018). Jormalainen et al. (2016) recorded a shift in community
structure in rocky F. vesiculosus habitats, where an ongoing invasion
of mud crabs caused a pronounced decrease in amphipod and isopod
populations, which allowed epiphytes to prosper and subsequently F.
vesiculosus growth rate declined. Kotta et al. (2018) documented
similar trends where the mud crab exerted strong top-down control,
which resulted in a decline in richness and biomass of benthic

invertebrates as well as an increase in phytoplankton biomass and pelagic nutrients.
Both top-down and bottom-up processes regulate marine communities, and it can be hard to
separate the processes since they interact. The recognition of top-down impacts are however
becoming evident and there are studies stating that top-down processes are at least as important as
bottom-up processes in seagrass ecosystems, and that the positive effects of epiphyte grazers are
comparable in magnitude to the negative effects of nutrient enrichment in seagrass ecosystems
(Hughes et al. 2004, Östman et al. 2016). The interactions between top-down and bottom-up
processes are complex and context dependent (Baden et al. 2010). We are just beginning to
understand the complexity of effects from large-scale changes on trophic levels for the status of
marine communities, where local conditions (e.g. nutrient loads) may interact with the release of
consumer control (Scheffer et al. 2005, Casini et al. 2008, Östman et al. 2016).

1.6 Aim of the thesis
Previous studies suggest that the mud crab can alter ecosystem functioning and structure, to the
extent that trophic cascades can arise (Jormalainen et al. 2016, Kotta et al. 2018). Since the mud
crab is a novel mesopredator in the northern Baltic Sea, it may add to the predation pressure on
important eelgrass mesograzers and thereby indirectly affect eelgrass, as illustrated in Figure 3. In
this thesis I studied the interactions between the mud crab, eelgrass, mussels and mesograzers. The
mud crab consumes mesograzers, such as Gammarus spp. and T. fluviatilis, which effectively
control algal growth (Hughes et al. 2004, Eriksson et al. 2011). Mud crab predation on mesograzers
could alleviate grazing pressure on algae, allowing algae to thrive and potentially compete with
eelgrass for light and nutrients, which would negatively affect eelgrass growth (Baden et al. 2010,
2012, Hughes et al. 2013, Jormalainen et al. 2016).
Mussel biodeposition of faeces and pseudofaeces fertilize the sediment and enhance eelgrass growth
(Reusch et al. 1994, Peterson & Heck 2001, Wall et al. 2008). Mud crab consumption of mussels
could therefore disrupt this bottom-up process and lead to decreased fertilization in sediments,
which could negatively affect eelgrass growth. Furthermore, mud crabs could potentially disturb
and uproot eelgrass due to their burrowing behaviour. The effect of mud crabs in eelgrass
ecosystems has not yet been studied, therefore this thesis is a contribution to filling this knowledge
gap. The aim of this thesis was to study the potential effects of the mud crab on eelgrass growth,
including indirect effects through predation on grazers and/or mussels and direct effects through
physical disturbance (Figure 3).
Research questions
1. What is the natural density of mud crabs in an eelgrass meadow in the Archipelago Sea?
2. Does the mud crab indirectly affect eelgrass through a trophic cascade?
3. Does the mud crab directly affect eelgrass through physical disturbance?

2.1 Study site and ecosystem
The study site is a semi-sheltered bay at Ängsö (60° 06’31”N; 21°42’45” E), in the Archipelago Sea
(Figure 4). The eelgrass meadow studied here is interspersed with sandy patches (Gagnon &
Boström 2016) and grows mixed with stands of other co-occurring plant species (e.g. Stuckenia
pectinata L. Börner, Zannichellia palustris L.) (Gustafsson & Boström 2014) at 2.5–5 meters depth

(Gagnon & Boström 2016). It covers an area of about 7 hectares (Gagnon & Boström 2016), with a
mean shoot density of 285 shoots m-2 (in June 2017) (Gagnon et al. unpublished data). The salinity
in the area ranges between 5.5–7 psu and the annual surface water temperature range is 0–22 °C.
During summer months the eelgrass meadow is often covered by drifting filamentous algae
(Gustafsson & Boström 2014, Gagnon et al. 2017), which was confirmed by our observations
during sampling in May when dense algal mats were present.
The site is well studied from previous sampling and experiments that have been conducted in the
meadow and surrounding area since 2004 (Boström et al. 2006, Gustafsson & Boström 2014, Duffy
et al. 2015, Gagnon & Boström 2016, Röhr et al. 2016). Common eelgrass epifauna in this area
consist of the mesograzers Idotea spp., Gammarus spp., T. fluviatilis, Hydrobia spp. and the filter
feeder M. trossulus (Gagnon et al. 2019). These above mentioned mesograzers play an important
role in consuming periphyton and filamentous algae (Neckles et al. 1993).

2.2 Mud crab density
The density of mud crabs in the eelgrass meadow at Ängsö was studied in the field using scuba
diving on 6 June 2019. Randomly placed core samples were taken within the eelgrass meadow. In
total 60 core samples were taken; three samples were always taken next to each other and placed in
the same mesh bag. Altogether, there were 20 mesh bags, containing 3 core samples per bag. The
10

Linn Engström
total area sampled thus equals to 0.52 m-2. The core (⌀ 10.5 cm) was manually pushed 10 cm deep
into the sediment before the content was placed in the mesh bag (mesh size = 0.5 cm, which
allowed sediment to wash out of the sample bag). Small juvenile crabs could have exited though the
mesh, thus this sampling was aimed at adult crabs. The samples were treated directly after
sampling, during which the crabs were counted and sexed based on their abdominal structure. The
density of mud crabs at this site was previously studied in 2015 by Gagnon & Boström (2016),
when mud crabs were noted in eelgrass for the first time outside of its native range.

2.3 Experiment design and setup
An aquarium experiment was set up to answer research questions 2–3. The experiment was
conducted at the flow-through aquarium facility at Skärgårdscentrum Korpoström. The dimensions
of the aquaria were 30 b x 20 l x 50 h cm. They were exposed to natural sunlight in an indoor
facility and supplied with seawater from a nearby harbour, the salinity was 6.4 psu at the beginning
of the experiment. The lower section of the windows in the facility were covered in an attempt to
limit differences in light conditions among the aquariums. The experiment ran for 40 days from 22
May–1 July 2019. Seven treatments were carried out (see Table 1), each with five replicates. The 35
aquariums were placed in two rows, using a semi-randomized design.

Mud crabs were collected for the purpose of the experiment during the period 15 April–7 May 2019
in Turku, Kaarina and Parainen. Crab traps consisting of baskets filled with rocks and ceramic pot
shards were used to trap mud crabs (Figure 5). The crabs were kept separated by sex in aquariums,
which were filled with seawater and oxygenated by air pumps until the start of the experiment. As
substrate they were provided with sand, pot shards and rocks, and they were fed with defrosted
chironomid larvae and fresh Gammarus spp. or M. trossulus regularly, which they consumed
readily. The crabs were starved for 24 hours prior to the experiment. Only male crabs with carapace
width >15 mm were used in the experiment, due to the difference in diet between large and small
11

Linn Engström
crabs (Aarnio et al. 2015). Since we studied the effects of predation, we wanted to make sure the
crabs were carnivorous (i.e. > 12 mm carapace width) (Aarnio et al. 2015). Also, males tend to be
more active than females during this time, since females may be gravid and thus spend more time in
shelter caring for their eggs (Turoboyski 1973). Two males were used per aquarium, one larger (20–
23 mm) and one smaller (15–19 mm).

Figure 5. One of the crab traps used to collect mud crabs for the
aquarium experiment.

Sediment (sand) and eelgrass shoots were collected from a shallow area in Ängsö (Figure 4). The
sediment was sieved through 1 mm to eliminate infauna and litter before being placed in the
aquariums into a 10-cm thick layer. It was allowed to stabilize in the aquariums for two days before
eelgrass was planted. Eelgrass was collected by scuba diving, then carefully cleaned from epifauna
and epiphytes before being planted into the aquariums. Nine natural eelgrass shoots were planted in
each aquarium, along with three artificial eelgrass shoots (to measure epiphyte colonisation). The
artificial eelgrass shoots consisted of individual 30 cm long wrapping strings folded in half and
anchored to a plastic mesh.
The eelgrass was allowed to acclimate for four days before grazers and mussels were added to the
respective treatments. Blue mussels (M. trossulus) and grazers (gastropods T. fluviatilis and
gammarids Gammarus spp.) were collected from F. vesiculosus stands and hard surfaces in the
vicinity of Korpoström. Mussels larger than the crabs were excluded, because the crabs would
likely not be able to open them. The grazers and mussels were allowed to settle for 30 hours before
the start of the experiment when mud crabs were added. Densities of the organisms used in the
experiment were determined based on existing data on their natural densities in the Ängsö eelgrass
meadow (see Table 2). Four data loggers (HOBO Pendant® Temperature/Light Data Logger 64 K,
Onset, USA) were deployed throughout the experiment in control treatments (two in each row, in
the control aquariums to avoid interfering with epifauna) to measure light and temperature.

2.4 Execution of the experiment and treatment of samples
At the end of the experiment the aquariums were emptied, and remaining organisms were counted.
M. trossulus, Gammarus spp. and T. fluviatilis that were not found were assumed to have been
consumed by mud crabs. M. trossulus with broken shells were also considered consumed. It should
be noted that Gammarus spp. reproduced during the experiment, leading to very high population
densities in both control and crab treatments (see appendix Figure A), which is why only adult
Gammarus spp. were analysed.
Sediment organic content was measured by taking sediment samples in the beginning and the end of
the experiment. The loss-on-ignition (LOI) method was used to determine the total organic content
of the sediment (see Schumacher 2002). The samples were dried at 100 °C for 24 hours, and then
weighed. Thereafter, the samples were burned at 520 °C for 3 hours and weighed again. The
difference in weight before and after burning represents the amount of organic content in the
sediment. Organic content was calculated using the formula below:

𝑂𝐶 % =

𝐼𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 − 𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡
× 100
𝐼𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡

Nutrient concentrations in the sediment was studied by taking porewater samples. The samples were
taken at the end of the experiment by inserting a rhizon porewater sampler into the sediment at the
same depth as the eelgrass rhizomes. The rhizon was connected by a syringe to a glass jar with a
rubber lid which had been decompressed, the air pressure difference allowed suction of porewater
into the jar. The samples were frozen and later analysed for ammonium (NH+4) and phosphate
(PO43-) concentrations, by the accredited laboratory of Lounais-Suomen vesi- ja ympäristötutkimus
Oy, using continuous flow analysis.
The amount of epiphytes was determined by scraping epiphytes off the artificial shoots. The
epiphytes were then dried in 60 °C for 48 hours, then weighed. Loose filamentous algae in the
aquariums were collected to study macroalgal blooms, by sieving (1 mm) the content of the water
13

Linn Engström
column and the surface layer of sediment in the aquarium at the termination of the experiment. The
collected filamentous algae were then dried in 60 °C for 48 hours then weighed.
Six days before the experiment was terminated, three shoots of eelgrass from each aquarium were
punctured with a syringe near the base of the shoot. This created a scar on the leaves, which was
used as a marker to determine the growth of the leaves (see Short & Duarte 2001). After the
experiment was terminated, the parts of the leaves which had grown since the puncturing were dried
at 60 °C for 48 hours, and then used for calculating growth rate (mg dw-1 day-1). The shoot lengths
of the punctured eelgrass shoots were also measured, to study overall growth. Eelgrass shoots that
uprooted were counted over the course of the whole experiment.

2.5 Statistical methods
The data from the experiment were analysed in R (version 3.6.2, R Core Team 2020) using a linear
mixed model (LMM), generalized linear models (GLM), generalized linear mixed models (GLMM)
and Bayesian generalized linear models according to Table 3. Additionally, a Wilcoxon rank sum
test with continuity correction was performed to analyse the difference in mean light intensity
between rows (placement of aquarium) (Figure 6), using the wilcox.test function in the native
“stats” package. The mean values from two data loggers on each row were compared between rows.
To determine if data fulfilled assumptions for parametric testing, Shapiro-Wilk and Levene’s tests
were used prior to analysis. The fixed factors that were included in the LMM, GLM and GLMM
models are treatment and row. Row was included as, despite our attempts at limiting differences in
light conditions, row 1 had significantly lower light intensity than row 2 (W = 864.5, Z = -4.01, r =
0.71, n = 33, p < 0.0001, Figure 6, Appendix Figure B). Aquarium was included as a random factor
to account for pseudoreplication in cases where several samples were taken from the same
aquariums (i.e. for eelgrass growth and shoot length). The significance of the fixed factors and
interactions were assessed using the Anova function in the package “car” (Fox & Weisberg 2011).
Non-significant higher-level interactions were removed in the models, and AIC (Akaike's
Information Criterion) values of full and simplified models were compared. The models with the
lowest AIC values were selected.
For the mixed models (LMM and GLMM) I used the lmer and glmer functions in the R package
“lme4” (Bates et al. 2015). For GLMs I used the function glm in the native “stats” package. A small
value (+1) was added to measurements of filamentous algae, to fit the assumptions of a gamma
distribution. Bayesian generalized linear models were used to analyse T. fluviatilis and M. trossulus
using the function bayesglm in the package “arm” (Gelman & Yu-Sung 2020). The reason why a
regular logistic regression could not be applied to these two analyses in the way as e.g. Gammarus
spp. was analysed, was due to an issue with data separation, which occurs when a predictor variable
perfectly predicts the outcome variable (UCLA: Statistical Consulting Group n.d.). In this case data
14

Linn Engström
separation occurred in T. fluviatilis and M. trossulus because all values in one grazer treatment were
zeros, and the differences between mussel treatments were distinctly different. To determine the fit
of the Bayesian generalized linear models as well as the regular logistic regressions, validity tests
for the fitted models were conducted based on randomized quantile residuals in the package
“statmod” (Dunn & Smyth 1996).
Type I anova in the “stats” package, function anova, (R Core Team 2020) was used to report results
(Table 4) for all but the mixed models. The mixed models were analysed using type II anova (Wald
chisquare test) in the “car” package (Fox & Weisberg 2011) with the function Anova. The
difference between the two is the order in which the factors are taken into account. To explore
significant effects between treatments, Tukey all-pair comparisons were performed by using the
function glht within the package “multcomp” (Hothorn et al. 2008). Lastly, the function cld within
the same package was used to visualize the results from the all-pair comparisons as letters
representing significant differences in the result figures.

3. Results
3.1 Mud crab density
The density of mud crabs in the eelgrass meadow at Ängsö was 21 crabs/m-2. Within the 20 samples
taken, a total of 11 crabs were found. The proportion of males and females was close to equal: 45 %
were females, 55 % were males.

3.2 Predation
Mud crabs readily consumed the animals present in respective experimental treatments (Figure 7ac, Table 4). The number of T. fluviatilis was significantly lower in the treatments including crabs
(ZIC and ZMIC) compared to control treatments (ZI and ZMI) (p < 0.001, Table 4, Figure 7a).
Similarly, the number of Gammarus spp. decreased in the crab-invertebrate treatments ZIC (p =
0.002, Table 4, Figure 7b) and in ZMIC (p < 0.001, Table 4). M. trossulus was consumed in both
crab treatments (ZMC and ZMIC, p < 0.0001, Table 4) compared to respective control treatments,
but to a significantly higher degree in ZMC than in ZMIC (p = 0.003, Table 4, Figure 7c), where
more food resources were available.

3.3 Sediment organic content
There were no significant differences in sediment organic content between treatments when
comparing values between the start and the end of the experiment (p = 0.07, Table 4). There was,
however, a weak trend indicating that the sediment organic content increased as M. trossulus were
included and decreased when invertebrate grazers or mud crabs were included (Figure 8).

3.4 Porewater nutrients
There was a significant interaction effect between row and treatment (p = 0.004, Table 4, Figure 9)
on ammonium concentrations. The mud crab had no clear effect on ammonium concentrations,
except on row 1 where there was a significant increase between the treatments ZMI and ZMIC (p =
0.017, Table 4). There was no effect of treatment (p = 0.55, Table 4, Figure 10) nor row (p = 0.25,
Table 4) on phosphate concentrations in the porewater, but the concentrations followed the same
pattern as ammonium when visually assessed.

3.5 Epiphytes and filamentous algae
The amount of epiphytes on the artificial eelgrass shoots was significantly affected by both row (p =
0.0001, Table 4, Figure 11) and treatment (p < 0.0001, Table 4). The smallest amounts of epiphytes
were found in the mussel treatment (ZM) on row 1 and the largest in the invertebrate grazer and
crab treatment (ZIC) on row 2. On row 1, ZM differs significantly from both ZI (p < 0.001, Table 4)
and ZIC (p < 0.001, Table 4). On row 2, ZIC differs significantly from Z (p = 0.03, Table 4) and
ZMC (p < 0.019, Table 4). Also, the amount of epiphytes varied greatly within the treatment ZMIC
between rows (p < 0.01, Table 4). The general trend was that invertebrate grazer treatments had
more epiphytes than mussel treatments, and no effects from the mud crabs were detected.
The amount of loose filamentous algae in the water column of the aquariums varied between rows
(p < 0.0001, Table 4) and treatments (p < 0.0001, Table 4, Figure 12). The largest amount of
filamentous algae was found in the control treatment Z, with eelgrass alone, especially on row 2. Z
differed from ZI (p = 0.006, Table 4), ZIC (p < 0.001, Table 4), ZMC (p < 0.001, Table 4) and
ZMIC (p < 0.001, Table 4). Furthermore, ZIC, which had the overall smallest amounts of
filamentous algae, differed form ZM (p < 0.001, Table 4) and ZMI (p = 0.03, Table 4). ZM had
more algae than ZMIC (p = 0.013, Table 4). No differences caused by the mud crabs were detected.

3.6 Eelgrass growth and shoot length
There were no significant differences in eelgrass growth rate between treatments (p = 0.25, Table 4,
Figure 13), the growth rate was instead controlled by the light conditions of the row (p < 0.0001,
Table 4). Similarly, shoot length was not affected by treatment (p = 0.90, Figure 14, Table 4), but
instead by row (p < 0.0001, Table 4).

4. Discussion
The aim of this thesis was to study the potential effects of the mud crab on eelgrass growth, through
trophic cascades or direct physical disturbance. To gain a better understanding of the occurrence of
mud crabs in eelgrass, mud crab densities were sampled in an eelgrass meadow where an
established mud crab population exists. An aquarium experiment was conducted to study the
indirect and direct effects of mud crabs on eelgrass for the first time. The density of mud crabs
found at Ängsö in an eelgrass meadow was 21 crabs/m-2. The aquarium experiment showed no
indirect effects on eelgrass by mud crabs through a trophic cascade, but the mud crabs physically
harmed eelgrass through their burrowing behaviour, which caused eelgrass shoots to uproot.

4.1 Mud crab density
The density of mud crabs (21 crabs/m-2) in the eelgrass meadow at Ängsö was five times higher
than previous estimates (4 crabs/m-2) by Gagnon & Boström (2016). The higher density found in
this study likely reflects population growth in the study site as well as more accurate sampling
methods. The sampling methods differ between the previous and present study, which should be
considered when comparing the results. In Gagnon & Boström (2016), the mud crabs were collected
through epifaunal sampling. Because mud crabs burrow in the sediment, we chose to study the
densities using core samples and were thereby able to collect crabs hiding in the sediment. The
density found in this study reflects the density of adult mud crabs, since the mesh size of the sample
bags (5 mm) could have allowed juveniles to exit. Taking the potential loss of juveniles into
consideration, the density could be a slight underestimation.
The density of mud crabs in the Baltic Sea is not well known, as they are not targeted in monitoring
programs (Lokko et al 2018). Indications from a pilot experiment using artificial reefs in the northeastern Baltic sea, show that the number of mud crabs per m-2 seafloor area is anywhere from a few
to 1000 crabs (Lokko et al. 2018 and references therein). More conservative estimates have been
made in Gulf of Gdańsk (Poland), where samples that were taken by bottom dredging showed
maximum densities of only 0.19 crabs/m-2 in Puck Bay and 0.05 crabs/m-2 in Gdynia and Sopot
(Hegele-Drywa & Normant 2014). In the Dead Vistula (Poland), a density of 0.5–6 crabs/m-2 was
estimated based on bottom dredging samples (Turoboyski 1973). In the Taman Bay in the Sea of
Azov the density of mud crabs was estimated to 1.4 crabs/m-2, by visual assessments along transects
(Zalota et al. 2016). In comparison to the recorded mud crab densities in the southern Baltic Sea and
the Sea of Azov, the densities found at Ängsö are much higher than has been found. However, the
methods used in the above-mentioned studies differ from the one used in this study, which should
be taken into consideration. The lack of targeted NIS monitoring and surveillance is one of the main
challenges in the Baltic Sea, thus future monitoring and standardization of methods are called for to
combat data scarcity as well as variability in methods and data quality (Ojaveer et al. 2014,
Lehtiniemi et al. 2015).

24

Linn Engström
Most of previous studies and monitoring have used traps to estimate mud crab abundance in terms
of catch per unit effort (CPUE) (e.g. Roche et al. 2009, Fowler et al. 2013, Forsström et al. 2018).
CPUE is commonly used for monitoring populations of mobile species, e.g. fish (Olin et al. 2016,
George et al. 2019). It is easier, quicker and cheaper than scuba diving for core samples. The
downside is that CPUE cannot be used to compare densities, i.e. the average number of individuals
per given area. The core samples used in the present study provide an accurate estimation of
population density and structure, by sampling both active crabs moving around and passive crabs
hiding in the sediment. Based on the results from the present study, core samples can successfully
be used as a method for studying mud crab densities in soft bottom habitats.
The ratio of female and male mud crabs was close to balanced between the sexes in the Ängsö
eelgrass meadow. Malmberg (2020) found almost exclusively male crabs outside of eelgrass
meadows, while females were more common inside the eelgrass meadow, showing a sex dependent
difference in habitat occupancy. Male mud crabs are known to be more active and move around,
while females stay in sheltered areas (Turoboyski 1973), which could explain why females were
more common inside than outside an eelgrass meadow. Male crabs have been disproportionately
found in trapping studies (Czerniejewski & Rybczyk 2008 and references therein, Ovaskainen 2015,
Malmberg 2020), which can be explained by spatial and temporal variations, population structure as
well as potential method bias. Since male mud crabs are more motile, they are possibly more likely
to be caught. These sex dependent differences in activity and habitat occupancy should be
considered when sampling. Thus, direct sampling, such as core sampling, allows for a more precise
selection of habitat (e.g. inside vs. outside of vegetation) and accurate sampling of crabs both on
and in the sediment.

4.2 Predation on invertebrates did not induce a trophic cascade
The mud crabs consumed M. trossulus, T. fluviatilis and Gammarus spp. as expected based on
previous studies that have identified said organisms as some of their main food sources (HegeleDrywa & Normant 2009, Forsström et al. 2015). However, this did not cause a trophic cascade and
thus contradicts the hypothesis (Figure 2). To answer research question number two, the mud crab
did not indirectly affect eelgrass growth through a trophic cascade. One explanation as to why no
trophic cascade occurred, relates to the fact that M. trossulus, T. fluviatilis and Gammarus spp. did
not facilitate eelgrass growth as hypothesised based on previous studies. In the following section I
will discuss potential reasons why the invertebrates did not facilitate eelgrass and thus why no
trophic cascade occurred.

4.2.1 Grazers and mussels did not enhance eelgrass growth
Mussels alter the sediment biogeochemistry through biodeposition of faeces and pseudofaeces,
which enrich sediments with nutrients (Kautsky & Evans 1987, Vinther et al. 2012). The nutrients

excreted by mussels mainly consist of nitrogen and phosphorus (Kautsky & Wallentinus 1980,
Kautsky & Evans 1987), but they are typically measured as ammonium and phosphate, respectively,
as they are the common forms of the elements in benthic coastal ecosystems and the main forms of
nutrients used by plants (Touchette & Burkholder 2000, Iheagwara et al. 2013, Metzger et al. 2019).
Biodeposits by M. trossulus create favourable substrates for sediment bacteria, which generates
increased mineralisation and regeneration of nutrients (Stock & Albers 2000). Thus, biodeposition
may increase nutrient availability and can stimulate eelgrass growth (Reusch et al. 1994, Peterson &
Heck 2001a, Carroll et al. 2008, Wall et al. 2008), as hypothesised in this study. The mussels did
not enhance eelgrass growth in this experiment, and porewater nutrient concentrations did not rise
in mussel treatments. In contrast, the lowest porewater nutrient concentrations and eelgrass growth
rates were found in the mussel treatment (ZM, Figure 8–9 and 12), although they were not
statistically significant from the control treatment.
It is possible that mussels in this case induced sulphide stress, which would explain the low growth
rate of eelgrass. The biodeposits from mussels may turn the sediments sulphidic (S2-) as a
consequence of enhanced sulphate (SO2-4) reduction rates (Vinther et al. 2008). Sulphate reduction
occurs when anaerobic sulphate-reducing microorganisms respire, as they utilize sulphate as a
terminal electron acceptor and produce hydrogen sulphide (H2S) (Muyzer & Stams 2008). Since
sulphide is toxic to plants, enhanced sulphide pools can negatively affect eelgrass growth and
photosynthetic activity (Holmer & Bondgaard 2001) and lead to increased seagrass mortality (Koch
et al. 2007). Plant tissues are more susceptible to sulphide intrusion in conditions where oxygen
levels are low (Pedersen et al. 2004). Since M. trossulus biodeposits on the surface of the sediment,
it may lead to lower oxygen levels near the plant meristems due to increased sediment respiration,
which makes the meristems more vulnerable (Vinther et al. 2012). In this study, sulphide
concentrations were not measured, and it is therefore not possible to draw any final conclusions on
whether sulphide stress occurred or not.
The porewater concentrations of ammonium and phosphate did not indicate elevated nutrient
concentrations in mussel treatments, instead they were low (Figure 8–9). This does not necessarily
fully explain the nutrient levels in the aquariums and does not rule out the possibility of harmful
amounts of nutrients accumulating in the aquariums. It is possible that ammonium was converted to
nitrite or nitrate through a nitrification process carried out by microorganisms, which would explain
why the fertilization of mussels is not detected and why ammonium levels are lowest in mussel
treatments. Nitrification is an oxidation process where ammonium (NH4+) is converted to nitrite
(NO2-) and then to nitrate (NO3-) (Ward 2008). However, ammonium can also convert directly to
nitrogen (N2) in anoxic conditions, through a process called anammox (van de Graaf et al. 1995).
The concentrations of nitrite, nitrate or nitrogen were not analysed in this study. Nitrogen exists in
several chemical forms, of which ammonium is one (Gruber 2008). In the present study, only
ammonium was analysed, since it is the main source of inorganic nitrogen and the preferred
nitrogen source for eelgrass (Short & McRoy 1984, Touchette & Burkholder 2000).

Another possible reason that could explain the low ammonium and phosphate concentrations in the
mussel treatment (ZM) could be that the nutrients were used by loose filamentous algae or
epiphytes, which are fast growing and take up ammonium much more efficiently than seagrasses
(Cornelisen & Thomas 2002). According to my observations, large amounts of filamentous algae
developed early in the experiment in the mussel treatments. However, the amounts of filamentous
or epiphytic algae were not particularly high in ZM at the time of sampling. It is noteworthy, that
the sampled loose filamentous algae are not equal to the total amount of algae formed in the
aquariums over time. Throughout the experiment, floating algae were removed from the top of the
tank to prevent them from clogging the overflow filter. Also, some of the filamentous algae were
removed at the point when eelgrass shoots were punctured, due to the movements of our hands in
the aquariums even though caution was taken. However, all aquariums were subjected to this same
disturbance and it should thus be standardized.
The mesograzers T. fluviatilis and Gammarus spp. feed on fast growing algae (Eriksson et al. 2011),
and normally control algal growth. However, in this study the treatments including mesograzers (ZI
and ZIC) contained the largest amounts of epiphytes. This can be explained by the high densities of
Gammarus spp. which formed in the aquariums over time as they reproduced. The high densities of
Gammarus spp. likely produced large amounts of faeces, which would add nutrients to the
aquariums and facilitate epiphyte growth. Interestingly, the same trend does not appear regarding
loose filamentous algae, where the amounts of filamentous algae in ZI and ZIC did not increase
compared to other treatments. This suggests either that the mesograzers preferred to feed on loose
filamentous algae rather than epiphytes, or that epiphytes benefitted to a larger extent from faeces
excreted by Gammarus spp., possibly due to the epiphytes position in the water column. The fact
that Gammarus spp. were able to produce such an amount of offspring, also shows how the mud
crabs were not able to control a fertile population under the experimental time period, even though
they did consume a large proportion of the grazers (see appendix Figure A). However, in natural
conditions other predators would add to the predation pressure. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that
the faeces and associated nutrients would not accumulate in such a way in natural conditions.

4.2.2 Other implications of mud crab predation
M. trossulus was consumed to a significantly lower degree in the treatment with all prey species
present (ZMIC) than in the treatment with only mussel and crab (ZMC). Thus, M. trossulus may
have experienced lower predation risk due to higher alternative prey availability in the ZMIC
treatment (Nordberg & Schwarzkopf 2019), or the difference can be explained by a potential
preference for soft shelled prey. Forsström et al. (2015) found a similar trend, suggesting that the
mud crab prefers soft-shelled crustaceans such as Gammarus spp. over hard-shelled M. trossulus.
Similar preferences for soft-shelled prey have been observed in other crab species (Buck et al.
2003). It has been suggested that crabs might avoid hard shells because of the risk of claw damage
from breaking them open (Juanes & Hartwick 1990).

27

Linn Engström
Since the mud crab is a novel predator in the northern Baltic Sea, it is likely that the prey do not
recognize the mud crab as a threat and thus lack anti-predation behaviour (Cox & Lima 2006, Sih et
al. 2010, Anton et al. 2020). This phenomenon is especially pronounced in contexts where the
introduced predator lacks native congeneric relatives in the recipient community (Anton et al.
2020). Since there are no native crab species in the northern Baltic Sea, the prey would likely not
recognize the mud crab as a threat (Forsstöm et al. 2015). This would partly explain the mud crabs
ability to catch Gammarus spp., which are highly mobile organisms. The high densities of
Gammarus spp. also likely made them easier to catch in the confined area of the aquariums.

4.3 The importance of interspecies interactions for seagrass
The largest amounts of loose filamentous algae formed in the control treatment (Z) with only
eelgrass, which shows that eelgrass does not do well alone. Eelgrass does not naturally occur alone,
but it interacts with a range of species from different functional groups of flora and fauna (Boström
et al. 2006, Gustafsson & Boström 2011, 2013). Several studies have explored the importance of
biodiversity and interspecies interactions in seagrass ecosystems (e.g. Hughes et al. 2004, Baden et
al. 2010, Duffy et al. 2015). In general, high biodiversity facilitates healthier and more productive
ecosystems that are more resilient to disturbance (e.g. Hughes et al. 2008, Hensel & Silliman 2013).
The accumulation of filamentous algae in the treatment Z in the absence of grazers is in line with
previous studies that have highlighted the importance of grazers in seagrass communities (Valentine
& Duffy 2006, Duffy et al. 2015). Grazers control algal growth and thus decrease competition
between seagrass and algae for light and nutrients (Neckles et al. 1993). Simultaneously, eelgrass
offers shelter and food resources to grazers and other organisms (Boström & Mattila 1999, Boström
et al. 2006, Voigt & Hovel 2019).
Mussel treatments contained less filamentous algae than the control treatment (Z), even though
mussels could have fertilized algae in the aquariums (Vinther et al. 2008). However, suspension
feeders like M. trossulus remove suspended particulate matter, such as phytoplankton, from the
water column and thus increase water clarity (Jørgensen 1990, Chowdhury et al. 2016). This way
M. trossulus could have removed algal propagules. Besides filtering the water and fertilizing the
sediments, mussels contribute to several indirect effects in seagrass systems. They increase the
structural complexity of the habitat, as they add surface for settlement and shelter (Zhang &
Silliman 2019). The increased habitat complexity may indirectly reduce the predation pressure on
mesograzers, as they are provided with more hiding places (Peterson & Heck 2001). Larger
populations of mesograzers would be more efficient at controlling epiphytes and filamentous algae,
which would allow more light to reach the seagrass (Östman et al. 2016).
Previous studies on the relationship between bivalves and seagrass have yielded varying results,
ranging from positive and neutral to negative (e.g. Reusch et al. 1994, Carroll et al. 2008, Vinther et
al. 2012, Castorani et al. 2015). Mussel fertilization may be harmful to seagrass especially in
eutrophic conditions (Vinther et al. 2008, Vinther & Holmer 2008, Vinther et al. 2012). However, a
28

Linn Engström
recent review by Gagnon et al. (2020) showed that 51 % of studies on seagrass-bivalve relationships
have reported positive interactions, and only 24 % negative interactions. Thus, the interaction is
often positive, but highly context dependent. The present study adds to the growing literature on
context dependent outcomes regarding seagrass-bivalve interactions.
Even though loose filamentous algae prospered in the control treatment (Z), the amount of
epiphytes remained similar to other treatments. It is possible that loose filamentous algae and
epiphytes competed for light and nutrients, which could explain why loose filamentous algae
thrived, but epiphytes did not. The macroalgal bloom formed by loose filamentous algae could have
shaded epiphytes that grow below them on the eelgrass leaves. Macroalgal blooms require higher
nutrient loading rates to form than epiphytic algae, due to higher individual biomass, lower nutrient
uptake rates and longer turnover times but persist a long time (Havens et al. 2001).
Macroalgal blooms caused by eutrophication are becoming increasingly common and constitute one
of the most serious problems in the Baltic Sea (Bonsdorff et al. 1997, Jansson & Dahlberg 1999,
Lehvo & Bäck 2001). The macroalgae eventually accumulate and form drifting algal mats, which
shadow and suffocate underlying flora and fauna (Valiela et al. 1997). Shading is stressful and
detrimental to eelgrass, but eelgrass resistance to shading is greater when it grows in polycultures
(Gustafsson & Boström 2013). Eelgrass commonly occurs in polycultures in the Baltic Sea,
consisting of 5–10 angiosperms, which together have positive effects on eelgrass performance (Salo
et al. 2009, Gustafsson & Boström 2011, Gustafsson & Boström 2013). This further highlights the
importance of facilitative effects generated by biodiversity. Furthermore, seagrass interacts with
microbes, which provide e.g. enhanced nutrient availability, phytohormone production and defence
against pathogens (Tarquinio et al. 2019). Together these interactions can increase ecosystem
resilience and form a more productive eelgrass meadow.

4.4 The influence of light
Light availability is the primary determining factor for seagrass productivity (Dennison & Alberte
1985, Zimmerman et al. 1995), thereby it naturally affected eelgrass growth rates in this
experiment. Furthermore, light intensity affected porewater nutrient concentrations. The ammonium
concentrations were generally higher in low light intensity (row 1) in the absence of mussels. In
contrast, ammonium concentrations were slightly higher in high light (row 2) than low light (row 1)
in mussel treatments (ZM and ZMC). Castorani et al. (2015) also found an interaction effect
between light intensity and ammonium porewater concentration from mussel biodeposition.
Castorani et al. (2015) suggested that the interaction between light and mussel fertilization could be
due to changes in eelgrass metabolism, leading to a reduced uptake of ammonium. Using
metabolomic analysis, Hasler-Sheetal et al. (2016) revealed a cryptic interaction between light
conditions and mussel fertilization on eelgrass, which did not show when applying traditional
approaches. The analysis showed that mussel fertilization stimulated eelgrass nitrogen and energy
metabolism under high light conditions. However, in low light conditions the mussels disrupted
29

Linn Engström
eelgrass metabolism, enhancing responses against sulphide toxicity and causing tissue deterioration
and inhibited oxidative energy metabolism (Hasler-Sheetal et al. 2016). Similar changes in eelgrass
metabolism may have occurred in this experiment as well, which could explain the interaction
between light and ammonium.
Eutrophication has caused low light conditions as well as hypoxia in large areas of the Baltic Sea
(HELCOM 2018), which may shift the interaction between bivalves and seagrass from mutualistic
to antagonistic (Vinther et al. 2008, Vinther & Holmer 2008, Vinther et al. 2012). The shift may be
induced due to enhanced sulphide pools caused by mussel fertilization, and in hypoxic and low light
conditions eelgrass is more vulnerable to sulphide intrusion. The lowered light conditions in the
Baltic Sea has widescale effects on macrophytes, and one of them is decreased maximum depth
distribution. For example, on the Swedish west coast where large eelgrass losses have occurred, the
depth distribution of eelgrass has decreased with roughly two meters (Moksnes et al. 2018).
The environmental context is an important determinant for the strength, mechanisms and sign of
interspecies interactions (Menge & Sutherland 1987, Connolly & Roughgarden 1999, Norkko et al.
2006, Gammal et al. 2019). In the present study, the environmental context depended on treatments
and light intensity. Light (i.e. row) significantly affected porewater nutrients, algal growth and
eelgrass growth and was thus one of the most prominent determining factors in this experiment. The
environmental context such as light limitation (abiotic stress) can affect the direction of species
interactions, according to the stress gradient hypothesis (Bertness & Callaway 1994, Bertness &
Hacker 1994). The stress gradient hypothesis predicts that facilitative interactions become
increasingly important in conditions where abiotic stress is elevated (Bertness & Callaway 1994,
Bertness & Hacker 1994). Often habitat-modifying organisms, such as mussels or crabs, are able to
both alleviate and exacerbate environmental stressors, potentially forming particularly complex
species interactions (Kawai & Tokeshi 2007). In this study, eelgrass was most likely stressed by
mussel fertilization, light limitation and physical disturbance by crabs. Thus, eelgrass was subjected
to several co-occurring stress pathways (fertilization, disturbance), which together with light formed
complex interactions.

4.5 Physical disturbance caused uprooting of eelgrass shoots
Crabs are effective burrowers that rework sediment through bioturbation, which can affect sediment
organic content (Botto and Iribarne, 2000), biogeochemistry, porewater characteristics and nutrient
benthic fluxes (Gilbert et al. 1998, Fanjul et al. 2007, 2011) as well as erosion (Farron et al. 2020)
and microtopography (Qiu et al. 2019). The burrowing behaviour is in some cases known to
damage vegetation (Davis et al. 1998, Garbary et al. 2014, Howard et al. 2019, Derksen-Hooijberg
et al. 2019).

30

Linn Engström
The mud crab caused an increase in porewater ammonium concentrations, but only on row 1
between the treatments ZMI and ZMIC. Thus, the effect of mud crab bioturbation on sediment
nutrients remained limited. Bioturbation by macrofaunal species are known to influence sediment
nutrient and oxygen fluxes (Gilbert et al. 1998, Needham et al. 2011). Furthermore, other burrowing
crab species have been shown to alter porewater characteristics, increased sediment oxygenation
and influenced organic matter degradation rates (Fanjul et al. 2007, 2011, Needham et al. 2011,
Giorgini et al. 2019). Mikkola (2016) did not find any effects of the mud crab on sediment nutrient
levels. However, the results from the present study suggest that the mud crab could affect porewater
nutrients to some degree, although it is likely context dependent as the effect only appeared between
two treatments and only on one row.
The mud crabs caused uprooting of eelgrass shoots in the aquarium experiment (Figure 14), due to
their burrowing behaviour. It was clear that the mud crabs preferred to seek shelter in the corners of
the aquariums, where they dug pits in the sediment, changing the sediment landscape in the
aquariums (Figure 15). This is the first record of mud crabs dislodging planted eelgrass shoots. At
least one other invasive crab species is known to damage eelgrass beds through physical
disturbance. The European green crab (Carcinus maenas), which has been introduced worldwide,
damages eelgrass beds when it digs burrows in the sediment and shreds plants which has led to
losses of eelgrass beds and interfered eelgrass restoration projects (Davis et al. 1998, Malyshev &
Quijón 2011, Garbary et al. 2014, Howard et al. 2019). Furthermore, loss of eelgrass caused by the
European green crab has likely resulted in a trophic cascade, as fish abundance and biomass have
drastically decreased in areas where the European green crab has removed eelgrass (Matheson et al.
2016).

Figure 16. A picture showing the extent of which the mud crabs were able to modify the
landscapes in the aquariums with their burrowing behaviour. Notice how the rhizomes of
some of the eelgrass shoots are exposed and coming loose, and some shoots are partly
buried in the sediment. In the bottom right corner one mud crab is visible.

31

Linn Engström
Bioturbation by mud crabs had similar uprooting effects on eelgrass plants in this experiment as in
the above-mentioned studies, even though the mud crab is a significantly smaller crab species than
the European green crab, which can reach over 90 mm in carapace width (Grosholz & Ruiz 1996).
However, further studies are needed to determine if the mud crab uproots eelgrass in field
conditions. The confinement in small aquariums may affect the burrowing behaviour of mud crabs,
since they were concentrated to the corners of the aquariums. Also, natural eelgrass meadows have
complex root and rhizome structures which make them harder to dislodge than the transplanted
eelgrass used in this experiment. In field conditions, the mud crab might not necessarily uproot
eelgrass, but it may damage roots and rhizomes while burrowing, since they are within depths that
coincide with mud crab burrowing. However, transplanting shoots is a common method used in
restoration projects. In this context, transplanted shoots are sensitive to bioturbation by the mud
crab, in a similar way as the European green crab can remove transplanted eelgrass (Davis et al.
1998).
Restoration projects are becoming increasingly important, as environmental degradation proceeds
globally and valuable seagrass habitats disappear (Valdez et al. 2020). Restoration efforts are
implemented worldwide to mitigate and/or compensate for losses of these important habitats;
however, the success rates are low, and the efforts are expensive (van Katwijk et al. 2016). Only 37
% of seagrass restoration efforts have been successful, which is explained by scale of effort, site
characteristics and planting methods (van Katwijk et al. 2016). Non-indigenous species (NIS) such
as the mud crab can interfere with seagrass restoration in several ways. When seagrass is
transplanted it is susceptible to NIS, especially if seagrass is planted in low densities (Ceccherelli et
al. 2000). As previously mentioned, NIS can physically disturb restoration efforts, causing e.g.
uprooting of shoots (Davis et al. 1998). Additionally, restoration efforts may facilitate spread of
NIS when moving seagrass from donor to recipient area, especially if transplants come from distant
donor sites and bring sediments (Wasson et al. 2001). NIS should be taken into consideration in
restoration and preferably they should not be present as they increase the risk of damage on the
restoration. Furthermore, facilitative interactions may be incorporated in the restoration effort to
improve restoration success. However, Gagnon et al. (2020) suggest that studies on seagrassbivalve interactions including only native species had significantly more positive outcomes than
studies including NIS. Thus, the mud crab should be considered a potential disturbance in
conservation and restoration efforts of valuable eelgrass habitat, as it could physically harm eelgrass
or affect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in unknown ways.

4.6 Methodological limitations and considerations for future research
This was to our knowledge the first study to investigate the potential top-down effects of mud crabs
in an eelgrass community and first to find mud crabs can uproot planted eelgrass shoots. However,
the limitations of this study must be addressed. First of all, nutrients seemed to accumulate in the
aquariums, causing epiphytes to flourish in grazer treatments, which contradicts the general concept
of grazers removing epiphytes. It is possible that the fertilization effect of M. trossulus was affected
32

Linn Engström
similarly by the aquariums. Since the reproductive Gammarus spp. formed high population
densities, which in this case may have contributed to nutrient accumulation, it could in future
studies be considered to keep the sexes separated and to not use gravid females.
The study was conducted on a small spatial and temporal scale. The relatively small size of the
aquariums could have influenced how the nutrients accumulate, possibly through hydrodynamics
inside the aquariums or due to low rates of water exchange. The fresh seawater entered the
aquariums from above and exited from above. Therefore, it is possible that only the upper layer of
the water column exchanged properly, potentially allowing nutrients to accumulate at the bottom.
Interestingly, Gagnon et al. (unpublished) found that M. trossulus facilitates eelgrass growth by
fertilizing the sediments, by conducting an aquarium experiment in the same facilities as the present
study but using three times larger aquariums (60 x 30 cm). This further supports the theory that the
size of the aquariums could have influenced the results. The spatial scale is an important factor to
consider, as it may influence the results in any type of study (Thrush 1999). Additionally, the
temporal scale may have been too short for this type of study, since negative effects on eelgrass
from stressors such as NIS likely accumulate over time. Short-term aquarium experiments are
useful for showing short-term mechanisms, but field experiments are necessary for showing longterm cumulative impacts of stressors such as the mud crab. Regarding the field sampling of mud
crabs, the spatial scale could have been extended to include more than one eelgrass meadow, to
better reflect mud crab densities in eelgrass beds in the Archipelago Sea overall.
Furthermore, the light conditions were difficult to standardize along the two rows of aquariums.
However, this allowed us to also study the effect of light availability on the response variables in
this study, and e.g. revealed an interesting interaction between light conditions and porewater
nutrients. The effects of varying light conditions could have been minimized by choosing a different
experimental design. A block design could have been applied to eliminate differences depending on
the placement of the aquarium. However, a block design would have come with constraints to the
number of treatments and replicates that could be performed simultaneously in the limited space
and time. In that case the number of treatments would have had to be reduced. Many of the issues
faced in this experiment, such as nutrients accumulating, could have been avoided by opting for a
field cage experiment. Nevertheless, field experiments of that kind come with their own risks and
challenges. However, this study presents new findings as well as points out knowledge gaps and can
thus provide a base for future research.
As in general with experimental trials, caution should be taken when generalizing the results and
applying them to natural systems. Future research is needed to disentangle the effects of mud crab
predation on invertebrates in field conditions. It seems unlikely that a drastic decrease in
mesograzers and M. trossulus would not resonate over trophic levels. Thus, further research is
warranted. Field experiments would allow natural water exchange and prevent any excess
accumulation of nutrients. Additionally, the physical disturbance from the mud crabs which caused
eelgrass shoots to uproot should be tested in field conditions in both ambient eelgrass beds as well
as restored plots. The former would be necessary to understand from a management perspective and
33

Linn Engström
the latter from a restoration point of view. To fully understand the impacts of this novel species in
the Baltic Sea, its effects on different trophic levels need to be studied in the different invaded
communities, such as other soft and hard bottom habitats.

5. Conclusions
The density of mud crabs found within an eelgrass meadow at Ängsö was 21 crabs/m-2, which is a
higher density compared to previous findings within the Baltic Sea (Turoboyski 1973, HegeleDrywa & Normant 2014, Gagnon & Boström 2016). However, differences in sampling methods
make comparisons difficult, thus a standardized method which allows for comparison of densities is
needed. Core samples as used in the present study can be used to accurately estimate adult mud crab
density and population structure.
Mud crabs readily consumed invertebrates in the aquarium experiment, however, this did not cause
a trophic cascade. M. trossulus, Gammarus spp. and T. fluviatilis did not facilitate eelgrass growth,
thus predation on them did not affect eelgrass. M. trossulus likely caused sulphide stress instead of
facilitating eelgrass, such reversed interaction has been identified previously in eutrophic conditions
(Vinther et al. 2012). Nutrients seemed to accumulate in the aquariums, which explains e.g. how
grazers caused epiphytes to flourish. This study contributes to the growing literature on the
importance of context dependency in determining seagrass interactions with other species. Light
was the determining factor for eelgrass and algal growth, and it interacted with porewater
ammonium concentrations. The mud crab caused changes in porewater ammonium in one instance,
although they were limited to one treatment and appeared to depend on light conditions. Due to
confounding factors in the experiment, the possibility of trophic cascades occurring in the field due
to mud crab induced top-down processes in eelgrass cannot be excluded but warrants further
studies.
Furthermore, the mud crab physically disturbed eelgrass and caused uprooting, due to its burrowing
behaviour. Other crab species are known to physically harm seagrass and have caused major
damage to natural seagrass meadows as well as seagrass restorations (Davis et al. 1998, Howard et
al. 2019). Especially transplanted seagrass may be vulnerable to disturbance; thus, the mud crab
should be carefully considered in such a context. This is the first record of mud crabs dislodging
eelgrass, although this needs further testing in field conditions.

Swedish summary- svensk sammanfattning
Den introducerade slamkrabbans effekt på ålgräsets tillväxt
Slamkrabban (Rhithropanopeus harrisii Gould, 1841) är en introducerad art i Östersjön, som
härstammar från den nordamerikanska östkusten (Williams 1984). Arten har förekommit i södra
Östersjön sedan 1950-talet eller tidigare (Turoboyski 1973) och har nyligen etablerat sig i norra
Östersjön, där den första gången påträffades i finska Skärgårdshavet år 2009 (Karhilahti 2010). I
norra Östersjön finns naturligt inga andra arter av krabbor (Elmgren & Hill 1997, Bonsdorff 2006)
och således utgör slamkrabban en ny funktionell roll som kan förändra funktionella länkar i
födoväven och påverka samhällsstrukturen (Forsström et al. 2015, Gagnon & Boström 2016).
Slamkrabban har därmed identifierats som en potentiellt eller lokalt skadlig introducerad art
(Niemivuo-Lahti 2012). Slamkrabban är en opportunistisk art som utnyttjar en mångfald av olika
habitat och födokällor. Nyligen påträffades slamkrabban första gången i en ålgräsäng i dess
introducerade område (Gagnon et al. 2016). Som födokälla konsumerar slamkrabban detritus, alger
och evertebrater (Turoboyski 1973, Hegele-Drywa & Normant 2009, Forsström et al. 2015). Några
av dess vanligaste byten består av blåmusslor (Mytilus trossulus), gastropoder (Theodoxus
fluviatilis) och gammarider (Gammarus spp.), som upprätthåller viktiga funktioner för bland annat
ålgräset (Gagnon & Boström 2016).
Tidigare studier indikerar att slamkrabban kan orsaka trofiska kaskader (Jormalainen et al. 2016,
Kotta et al. 2018). En trofisk kaskad sker då förändringar på en trofisk nivå leder till effekter över
flera än en trofisk länk (Carpenter & Kitchell 1993). Eftersom slamkrabban är en ny predator i
Östersjön, kan den orsaka ökat predationstryck på herbivorer. Effekterna av slamkrabban i
ålgräsängar är okända. Syftet med denna avhandling var därför att studera slamkrabbans potentiella
effekter på ålgräset, vilket inkluderar indirekta effekter genom en trofisk kaskad och direkta effekter
genom fysisk störning.
Frågeställningarna i avhandlingen är:
1. Vad är den naturliga densiteten av slamkrabbor i en ålgräsäng i Skärgårdshavet?
2. Kan slamkrabban indirekt påverka ålgräsets tillväxt negativt genom en trofisk kaskad?
3. Kan slamkrabban fysiskt störa eller skada ålgräset genom att den gräver i sedimentet?
För att svara på fråga 1 studerades slamkrabbans densitet i en ålgräsäng vid Ängsö (Figur 3), där
sampel av sediment togs med hjälp av proppar (⌀ 10,5 cm). Sammanlagt togs 60 slumpmässigt
placerade sampel i ängen, totalt 0,52 m-2 undersöktes. Krabborna räknades och könsbestämdes. För
att svara på frågorna 2–3 utfördes ett akvarieexperiment i Skärgårdscentrum Korpoströms
genomflödesanläggning. Experimentet bestod av sju behandlingar med fem replikat. Akvarierna
placerades på två rader, som härefter benämns rad. Behandlingarna innehöll olika kombinationer av
slamkrabba, M. trossulus, Gammarus spp. och T. fluviatilis tillsammans med naturligt och
artificiellt ålgräs (för att provta epifyter) (Tabell 2). Experimentet pågick i 40 dagar, varefter de
36

Linn Engström
kvarvarande organismerna räknades och sampel togs för att undersöka sedimentets organiska halt,
näring i porvatten (ammonium och fosfat), samt mängden lösa trådalger och epifyter. Ålgräsets
tillväxt undersöktes genom att sex dagar före experimentets avslut punktera ålgrässkottets nedre del,
vilket bildade ett ärr som användes som markör för att beräkna tillväxten per dag. Under
experimentets gång räknades även antal ålgrässkott som lossnat ur sedimentet. Data från
akvarieexperimentet analyserades i R med linjära modeller som bestod av generaliserade linjära
modeller (GLM), bayesiansk GLM och blandade linjära och generaliserade modeller (GLMM och
LMM) (se Tabell 3). Som förklarande variabler inkluderades behandling, rad och akvarium (då
flera sampel tagits från samma akvarium). Rad inkluderades eftersom det fanns en skillnad i
ljusintensiteten mellan raderna som akvarierna placerades på (Figur 6). Skillnaden i ljusintensiteten
mellan raderna undersöktes med ett Wilcoxon rank sum test.
Densiteten av slamkrabbor i ålgräsängen vid Ängsö uppmättes till 21 krabbor/m-2. I
akvarieexperimentet konsumerade slamkrabban en väsentlig andel av bytesdjuren M. trossulus,
Gammarus spp. och T. fluviatilis (Figur 7 a-c, Tabell 4), men detta orsakade ingen trofisk kaskad,
enligt resultaten nedan. Behandlingarna hade ingen signifikant effekt på den organiska halten i
sedimentet, men en trend visade att behandlingar med endast ålgräs eller ålgräs tillsammans med
betare (T. fluviatilis, Gammarus spp.) tenderade att minska i organisk halt över tid, medan
behandlingar som inkluderade M. trossulus tenderade att öka i organisk halt över tid (Figur 8,
Tabell 4). Slamkrabban hade ingen tydlig inverkan på koncentrationen av ammonium i porvatten,
förutom på rad 1 där en signifikant skillnad mellan behandlingarna ZMI och ZMIC fanns (Figur 9,
Tabell 4). Inga signifikanta skillnader förekom i koncentrationen av fosfat mellan behandlingarna
(Figur 10, Tabell 4). Mängden lösa trådalger och epifyter påverkades inte av slamkrabban, men det
fanns signifikanta skillnader mellan rad och mellan övriga behandlingar (Figur 11–12, tabell 4).
Ålgräsets tillväxt per dag och den totala längden av ålgrässkotten påverkades inte av
behandlingarna, men raden hade en betydande inverkan på vardera (Figur 13–14, Tabell 4). Antalet
ålgrässkott som lossnat under experimentets gång var signifikant högre i behandlingar som
inkluderade slamkrabba, än i behandlingar utan slamkrabba (Figur 15, Tabell 4).
Slamkrabbors densitet i Östersjön är dåligt känd, till vilket denna studie bidrar med data. Densiteten
vid Ängsö (21 krabbor/m-2) är mycket hög jämfört med uppmätt densitet i studier från Polen (0,5–6
krabbor/m-2 och 0,05–0,19 krabbor/m-2 (Turoboyski 1973, Hegele-Drywa & Normant 2014,
respektive)) eller i tidigare undersökningar vid Ängsö (4 krabbor/m-2 (Gagnon & Boström 2016)). I
akvarieexperimentet uppstod ingen trofisk kaskad, vilket till stor del kan bero på att T. fluviatilis,
Gammarus spp. och M. Trossulus inte hade de gynnande effekterna på ålgräset som förväntades. M.
Trossulus förväntades öka mängden tillgänglig näring till akvarierna och gynna ålgräsets tillväxt,
men kan istället ha orsakat stress för ålgräset, eftersom höga näringshalter kan leda till
ackumulering av sulfider i sedimentet som skadar växten. Betarna (T. fluviatilis, Gammarus spp.)
förväntades ha minskat på mängden alger (lösa trådalger och epifyter), men istället ökade de, högst
sannolikt på grund av att Gammarus spp. förökade sig i akvarierna och avföringen (näring) från de
stora populationerna möjliggjorde algtillväxt. Slamkrabban orsakade genom sitt grävande beteende
att fler ålgrässkott lossnade ur sedimentet. Åtminstone en annan krabbart, Carcinus maenas, har
37

Linn Engström
dokumenterats ha liknande effekter som har stört restaureringsprojekt och skadat naturliga
ålgräsängar (Davis et al. 1998, Garbary et al. 2014, Howard et al. 2019). Detta är dock första
gången som slamkrabban observerats orsaka sådan fysisk störning hos ålgräs, och fortsatta
undersökningar i fält krävs.
