Australia Has Never Felt as Far Away as Now:
Australians In Finland And Social Exclusion During the COVID-19 Era

Abstract
Through critical theories of social exclusion and alienation, this chapter seeks to outline the
difficulties that Australian citizens have faced on the subject of returning to their home
country after Australia closed their borders in March 2020 as a reaction to the COVID-19
outbreak. I will analyse, discuss, and investigate different national reactions of the COVID19 case. Using data collected from a focus group interview with five Australians residents in
Finland, I employ phenomenology methods to analyse the data with reference to my research
question: if Australians feel excluded due to the Australian border restrictions. This chapter
argue that Australians, that were not able to return before the national border closure in
Australia and cancellation of international flights, suffer from alienation from their homeland.
Such alienation and exclusion can prevail and further distance and isolate Australian
individuals overseas from their counterparts/family within Australia. The limited capacity of
returning Australian citizens from overseas has excluded citizens from returning, and the
expenses of flights and self-financed quarantine in Australia is leading to further difficulties
for them to be able to return.

1. Introduction
I am a Finnish citizen; as a citizen I have rights, privileges, and responsibilities. One of these
is the right to carry a passport. One of the privileges a passport gives is access across borders.
During the era of the COVID-19 pandemic this access has become restricted. Many
governments have decided to close borders and set up restrictions. My wife, an Australian
citizen, is one of those individuals who was affected by these restrictions, as her flight was
cancelled in March 2020 from Finland to Australia due to the pandemic. Thereafter capacity
restrictions as well as compulsory hotel quarantine was set up by the Australian government

(Australian Government Department of Health, 2020), creating further obstacles in reaching
one’s home country. This piqued my interest in the subject, do these restrictions create
exclusion towards a nation’s citizens? Free movement has after all been a fundamental aspect
in most Western societies, especially travelling from and back to the country of a person’s
citizenship.
The hypothesis is that Australians are excluded from their home country due to the border
restrictions that were created after COVID-19. Therefore, because of this exclusion there is a
possibility to become alienated towards their country of origin. Another argument towards
exclusion is the role of media in creating a biased political and pro-restriction attitude within
a society i.e., Australia.
This research will be based on an open interview with five Australians living in Finland,
discussing how COVID-19 has affected their lives and free movement of returning to or
visiting their home country.
In the following sections, I will provide theories of social exclusion and alienation, and
examine arguments on how these theories affect citizenship. Thereafter I will provide
background information on COVID-19 origin and National COVID-19 response models. I
will then discuss my methodology before examining the empirical section of the interview
and examining arguments of the media’s impact towards exclusion. Finally, I will discuss
whether national border restrictions during the era of COVID-19 have led to exclusion based
on this research.

2. Social exclusion
Social exclusion represents a division between an included majority and an excluded minority
(Levitas, 2005, 7). This is considered as the base argument when it comes to social exclusion,
and can be used within most theoretical frameworks, i.e., poverty, gender, sexuality, age, and
race. Social exclusion being a powerful concept, requires analytical clarity, due to its
flexibility (Levitas, 2005, 178). Therefore, social exclusion can be included in most social
theories or problems where a person has been excluded from a majority or having difficulties
to achieve the same rights as the majority. When it comes to contemporary research within
2

Alexander Rehnberg
1901622
27.11.2020
Research Chapter

social exclusion, there is an emphasis towards the “importance of intermediate institutions,
not just between individual and state” (Levitas, 2005, 182). This chapter is heavily influenced
by the difficulties that individuals encounter when outside the borders of their nation and are
under a hegemony that preferably puts those within the borders first.
Giddens discusses in Sociology how “Social exclusion refers to ways in which individuals
may become cut off from full involvement in the wider society.” (2009, 498). This theoretical
perspective can be applied on people that are outside of a nation’s border and are not able to
be part of the wider society within a nation’s border. According to Giddens, important aspects
of the discussion regarding social exclusion are the social forces which shape people’s
circumstances (2009, 498). Social forces can be fluid during a pandemic or other catastrophe,
meaning that people’s circumstances become shaped according to the social force’s outcome.
In testimonial injustice someone can be “wronged specifically in her capacity as a knower.”
(Fricker, 2007, 20). To be wronged is partly one-sided, as the party that feels wronged is
usually the excluded party, being part of a minority. Whereas the party that might have
wronged someone possibly has decided to keep the majority safe. For many of the Australian
“stranded” citizens their belief of injustice comes from them feeling wronged due to being
stranded outside of Australia. The testimonial injustice in this case being that to the stranded
citizens capacity as a knower, there is a feeling that the country has wronged them. “For
Marx, alienation refers to feelings of indifference or hostility…” (Giddens, 2009, 892). The
feeling of being wronged and having experienced injustice may lead towards indifference and
hostility, which according to Marx can be referred to as alienation.

3. Alienation
“Alienation is the inability to establish a relation to other human beings, to things, to social
institutions and thereby also – so the fundamental intuition of the theory of alienation – to
oneself.” (Jaeggi, 2014, 3). When you become alienated towards your own country, there can
be a sense of powerlessness and lack of relation towards the nation’s social institution. This
naturally applies to the internal division between people outside the borders and people that
are within the borders as well, leading to social exclusion and possibly alienation towards
those inside the borders.

Research Chapter

According to Jaeggi, critical theory in terms of alienation as a concept within social
philosophy has its beginning in Rousseau’s work “Discourse on the Origin of Inequality
Among Men” (1755). Rousseau’s work discusses how some become alienated from their own
needs and how recognition and self-worth become dependent on other’s opinions (Jaeggi,
2014, 7). Jaeggi continues by discussing the two main themes of alienation that Rousseau
influenced, these being authenticity and social freedom. Authenticity is a modern ideal of an
“agreement with oneself and one’s own nature” (2014, 7). And social freedom where an
unalienated form of socialization is created through a normative ideal, in the opposite of “the
exclusively negative effects of socialization” of Rousseau’s alienated character (Jaeggi, 2014,
7). “Alienation is a taken-for-granted worldview of our relationship to the world that has
profound consequences for approaches to knowing (science) and acting (praxis) in the
world.” (Rowe et al., 2020). The practical appropriation of alienation theory is here
considered within the framework of internal division, indifference, and the loss of relation to
self and the world.
When a person suddenly becomes aware of their own life becoming alien to them, they can
become indifferent to people that once meant something to them, or future projects and hope
becomes pointless (Jaeggi, 2014, 43). Alienation could partly be a false consciousness, where
it becomes difficult to distinguish between being and not-being part of community (Rowe et
al., 2020). Government border closure could be argued to create a false consciousness of
citizenship and what rights citizens have, as they have difficulties reaching their home
country. Therefore, citizens may feel that they are not part of the country anymore.

3.1 Citizenship
According to Richard Bellamy, in Citizenship: A Very Short Introduction, theories of
citizenship are categorized as normative theories and empirical theories. Normative theories
“attempt to set out the rights and duties a citizen ideally ought to have”, whereas empirical
theories describe and explain how rights and duties fall into a citizens’ possession (2008, 34).
Even in a democratic society, certain rights can be withdrawn from citizens if the necessity
arises. There can be some change accomplished through unity, although the opposite of the
unity argument would be social co-operation, where citizens are expected to follow rules and
norms (Byrne, 2005, 40). Rights being withdrawn from citizens outside borders could be
4

Alexander Rehnberg
1901622
27.11.2020
Research Chapter

defined as exclusion and possibly alienation. One could also speculate that citizens could be
excluded through restrictions that restrict freedom of movement in general, but my theory
leans towards the inability for citizens to return to their home country. This is due to the
pandemic which has influenced political discourse and national policies that has adverse
effects on citizens of different nationalities.
“Membership lies at the heart of citizenship. To be a citizen is to belong to a given political
community.” (Bellamy, 2008, 53). Part of having a membership means that you will have
access to the institute or community you are a member of. It is an exclusive access that in
most situations mean you can return to your country without any hindrances (Bellamy, 2008,
53).

4. Origins and speculation of COVID-19
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 began in Wuhan, China, at
the end of 2019 where the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported the first cases of
the novel coronavirus (WHO, 2020). There have been many speculations about the timeline
and start of COVID-19, but I will follow the WHO’s timeline as it is a one of the leading
organisations in countering global epidemics.
China shared the genetic sequence for the respiratory virus before any cases had been
confirmed outside of China. By January 13th, 2020, there was a case recorded in Thailand
(WHO, 2020). At the end of January there was evidence of human-to-human transmission,
and 82 cases had been reported from 18 other countries other than China (WHO, 2020). On
the 11th of March 2020, “WHO made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as
a pandemic.” (WHO, 2020). By March 17, 2021, there have been approx. 121,000,000 cases,
and approx. 2,680,000 deaths in 221 countries (worldometer, 2020).

5. National COVID-19 response model
Most countries have based their COVID-19 models on the recommendations of different
health institutes, such as the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare of Finland

5

Alexander Rehnberg
1901622
27.11.2020
Research Chapter

(THL, 2020), and Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW, 2020). The use of
different models in response to measures in “flattening the curve” (slowing down) or
eliminating COVID-19 is based on research from earlier pandemics, as well as constant new
data (Chang et al., 2020). Models are fluid and responses are different depending on the
COVID-19 situation. Due to technology, tracing and intervention all of this is easier than it
was during the early 20th century Spanish Flu pandemic. Now it is possible to follow up on
pandemic dynamics, age-dependant attack rates, reproductive numbers, age and social
dependant transmission rates, household clusters and other epidemiological parameters
(Chang et al., 2020). From these different parameters, nations have created different models
as counter measures to slow down the spread of COVID-19.
“Border closure is unlikely to be able to prevent importation, and can have huge economic
and personal costs.” (Boyd et. al., 2017). This argument has been trending due to the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic and different restriction models that countries have created to prevent
the pandemic from spreading. Although there are negative effects for border closures, Boyd
et al. also states that there have been positive results when discussing border closures,
especially for smaller island nations. This is due to the effective prevention of the spread of
pandemic influenza, leading to the healthcare system not being over-encumbered by
influenza patients. Therefore, a nation being able to save in costs and preventing possible
economic stress (Boyd et al., 2017).
Sections 5.1 and 5.2 below give a short insight into the national COVID-19 prevention
models of Australia and Finland. Section 5.3 is a table based on the prevention towards
COVID-19 in Finland, Australia, and Sweden. I have introduced Sweden in this table as their
prevention model in the beginning of the pandemic, was the opposite of Australia’s, as they
did not restrict the citizens’ rights of free movement within the country, or even leaving the
country as this right is mandated in the Swedish Constitution of 1974 (The Constitution of
Sweden, 2016, 31). The Swedish model has been problematic as it has strained the Swedish
healthcare system where many hospitals have been over-encumbered by COVID-19 patients.

5.1. The Australian model

6

Alexander Rehnberg
1901622
27.11.2020
Research Chapter

As the virus started spreading to other countries, many governments began creating plans to
reduce the spread of the virus. In some cases, this was done through border restrictions.
Australia being one of these countries set the the Biosecurity Act 2015 into motion.
“On 18 March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia, the
Governor-General declared that a human biosecurity emergency exists. The
declaration gives the Minister for Health expansive powers to issue directions and set
requirements in order to combat the outbreak. This is the first time these powers under
the Biosecurity Act have been used.” (Parliament of Australia, 2020; Biosecurity Act,
2015).
The implementation of this act led to an overseas travel ban that was considered as a
biosecurity emergency requirement. Australia was not the only country globally that created
new restrictions when it comes to travelling, but it has been one of very few countries that has
made it hard for their own citizens, who are overseas, to return, move back or visit their home
country. The mentality towards quarantining and border closure, is not a new vision in
Australia. As an island nation it has had the necessary tools to quarantine itself and stay
‘immune’ towards the ‘diseased’ world. “The Quarantine Act was later merged to form the
Immigration Restriction Act, with quarantine influencing immigration policy.” (Moloney, K.,
Moloney, S., 2020). Australia has the possibility to close its borders to remain safe from the
diseased outside world.

5.2. The Finnish Model
The Finnish model of COVID-19 restrictions has been much closer to the Swedish model.
There have been stricter rules for restaurant and business opening times, as well as
international travelling. The quarantine model has been the same as the global one where two
weeks has been recommended for quarantining at home, but there has not been a need for
self-funded mandatory hotel quarantine like in Australia. The Finnish institute for health and
welfare created a traffic light model which Finland has been following when it comes to
travelling (2020). In this model green means “The risk of infection is not significantly greater
than in Finland”, red is the opposite of green where infection is greater than in Finland, and
7

Grey “Countries subject to EU external border restriction” where non-essential travelling
should be avoided (Finnish institute for health and welfare, 2020). Travelling to certain
countries was and will be restricted during the pandemic even in Finland, but in Australia it is
prohibited to leave the country unless granted an exemption by the Australian Border Force
(covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au, 2021).

Different countries have dealt with this pandemic in different ways (see e.g., THL.fi,
folkhalsomyndigheten.se, government.se, health.gov.au) The Australian strategy could be
considered the strictest when it comes to border restrictions etc., but Sweden and Finland
have also increased restrictions as the COVID-19 situation is fluid and rapidly changing.
Finland has not yet (25.01.2021) imposed mandatory hotel quarantine for arriving passengers.

6. Methodology
Qualitative research is concerned with subjective meanings, i.e., understanding human
experience. In interviews one tries to access content within a person’s mind through
empathetic skills (Silverman, 2020, 3). Experiences and statements are supported by
reasonable arguments and data, which suggest plausible conclusions (Silverman, 2020, 5).
This qualitative research is based on phenomenology entailing systematic collection and
qualitative data analysis of empirical materials and the interview on exclusion during the
COVID-19 era. Phenomenology is an empirical research method used in investigating and
describing a phenomenon (Larsson & Holmström, 2009, 59; Groenewald, 2004, 5). In
phenomenology there is not just one style. “Therefore, it is difficult to claim one single
definition of phenomenology.” (Qutoshi, 2018, 216). A key argument in phenomenology is
that experience involves i.e., perception, thought and emotion, and how these involve

9

Alexander Rehnberg
1901622
27.11.2020
Research Chapter

intentionality as the individual in question focuses on a specific thing or thought
(Groenewald, 2004; Qutoshi, 2018).
The data for this research are from two primary sources. (1) A focus group interview, which
is a qualitative approach in gaining plausible and in-depth understanding of an issue or issues
(Nyumba et al., 2018). This method is used when there is a need to obtain data from a group
of individuals, that have been purposely selected (Nyumba, 2018). The focus group interview
with five Australian citizens residing in Finland in December 2020 via Zoom. (2) Secondary
information gathered from newspaper articles, documentation, government guidelines and
acts, academic research, and social media to assist in creating descriptive data for this
research.
I created a post with information about the interview in a Facebook group called Aussies in
Finland and eight people showed interest in participating. I then contacted these people via
email and two men, and three women were chosen randomly. This was due to (1) all the
interested participants being white Australians, therefore, none were chosen on racial
grounds. (2) It was desirable to have an equal split between normative genders within the
interested participants. One of the female participants had lived for a longer period in Finland
and therefore she was a good candidate (13 years), as she had possibly become used to the
social structure in Finland. The other participants were within a similar age bracket and had
lived in Finland for a shorter to medium period (1-8 years).
The research participants will be referred to as A, B, C, D and E.


A is an Australian citizen who has lived in Finland since 2019. A is married to a
Finnish citizen and was pregnant during the interview.



B is an Australian citizen who has lived in Finland since 2014. B has permanent
residency in Finland due to work.



C has lived in Finland since 2019 and is currently studying. C has dual citizenship as
his mother is an Australian born Finn.



D is an Australian citizen who has lived in Finland since 2012 and is married to a
Finnish citizen.



E has lived in Finland since 2007. E has multiple citizenships of which two are
Australian and Finnish.

All participants, except D, have not been back home to Australia during the COVID-19
pandemic. D was in Australia in March 2020 when COVID-19 became a pandemic and had
to “race back to Finland” (D). Most of the participants had planned to visit family and others
in Australia in 2020, but due to the capacity of flights arriving to Australia and expensive
compulsory hotel quarantine, this was not possible.
The first part of the interview process was to eliminate which participants were eligible for
the interview, therefore Australian citizens residing in Finland were the focus without any
specific character trait. The interview questions were categorized by each theme that are part
of this research. The first theme was COVID-19, the second theme was Restrictions and
Social Exclusion through Media and the third theme was Citizenship and Alienation. All the
participants signed a consent form. In the data collection phase, the interview was recorded
through three different methods, by Zoom recording, voice recording and camera recording to
help with future transcribing. After the recorded interview, the material was transcribed. Then
the data analysis was started, which was completed according to the material from the
transcription and other empirical data that has been personally archived.

7. The Effect of COVID-19
COVID-19 has affected everyone in the globe differently. For the research participants these
effects range from financial, social and health. The subsequent paragraphs show how the
participants in this study are affected by COVID-19.

7.1. Financially
During a pandemic that effects the entire country, unemployment rates would possibly rise,
especially if the pandemic goes on for a longer period. In the Finnish Statista Research
Department article, they state that “roughly 24.4 thousand [24,400] people have become
unemployed and 39.2 [39,200] thousand people temporarily laid off mainly because of the
coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Finland.” (2021). Therefore, as the unemployment has
risen, people have less financial capital to support themselves. A higher unemployment rate
11

Alexander Rehnberg
1901622
27.11.2020
Research Chapter

has been identified by scholars of Social Exclusion as a critical factor leading to social
exclusion (Giddens, 2009; Pohlan, 2019). Unemployment is especially difficult for those that
have worked in a low-income position, as they have likely not been able to save up or
expected to be laid-off. There is also less new employment available, as the whole country is
being affected by the pandemic, especially in the lower-productivity sector (Farchy &
Immervoll, 2020, 12). One of my research participants says (A):
I was struggling to find work… I mean Covid has not helped that situation in any way,
I have used the time now to do my degree… I have managed to do almost a whole
two-year degree in eight months… However, I am pregnant at the moment. (A).
A observes that finding work during COVID-19 pandemic has been difficult. She has used
her free time to study towards a degree. Difficulties finding work means less/no income to the
family. Being pregnant also makes it even more difficult for A to find work as women suffer
often from discriminatory practices at work or during job interviews because of their
childbearing and care responsibilities (see Giddens, 2009). Unemployment, being pregnant
and being an immigrant makes A’s chances for employment very difficult. Therefore, Levitas
(2005) identify immigrant women as people with high chances of becoming poor – hence
socially excluded.
In addition, the issue of employment is also discussed by B as follows:
All of our performances [opera] have been cancelled… I can’t really complain other
than losing a bit of pay, which I have survived quite fine. (B).
Dance performances and other entertainment show were greatly hit by COVID-19. B laments
the cancellation of their performances and how it has affected her. This has led to her losing
some pay, which would affect her finances now and, in the future, adding to the chances of
moving towards poverty (see Giddens, 2009).
These lack or reduction in income opportunities (see A and B above) one can argue that the
cost of living and possibilities of travelling, especially travelling back to Australia, has
become more difficult. Thus, this can add to the social distance.
In addition, two of the participants discuss the financial aspect of the hotel quarantine:

12

Alexander Rehnberg
1901622
27.11.2020
Research Chapter

I would have tried to get to Australia for Christmas this year. If not for the hotel, the
compulsory pay your own way held at hotel quarantine. I also cannot afford that kind
of money. (E).
The Australians in Spain who were stuck, literally, could not get out and then when
they try and get back in there after paying exorbitant fees for the flights and the hotel
quarantine (C).
E and C observe how the compulsory hotel quarantine that is self-funded is adding to the
difficulty of travelling to Australia. Financially E cannot afford the hotel quarantine
expenses. The higher flight expenses are another part which adds to the hotel quarantine
expenses. There is a requirement of a higher financial capita for each returning citizen.
Excluding those that are not financially able to meet certain requirements and therefore
leading to a contemporary form of exploitation (see Byrne, 2005). Finances which add to the
distance towards the possibility to travel to Australia, also add to the social distance.

7.2. Socially
Before COVID-19 social distancing depended on social norms. In Finland, Australia and
Sweden hugging and shaking hands was something most people did whenever they met an
acquaintance before COVID-19. Now social distancing has become a global term due to the
pandemic (Sorensen et al., 2021), as hugs have become elbow bumps, and handshakes have
become fist bumps. There are signs in shops and outside, recommending keeping a 1–2-meter
distance to others. There is also a stronger emphasis on hand and coughing/sneezing hygiene
and wearing a mask (See the table on pp. 8-9). Social distancing during COVID-19
emphasises keeping a physical distance to others (Sorensen et al., 2021). Distance is now
more prominent, as it is difficult to socially meet up with friends and family that live close
by. Therefore, increasing the distance towards a person’s social network that exists
abroad/outside of borders. D observes the physical distance and mental distance to Australia:
Going home has not been possible. I think that is sort of mentally been the hardest
part… one of the hard parts about Covid and living abroad is that, although Australia
is really far away. It has never actually felt that far away until now. (D)
D laments the fact that he cannot go back to Australia during COVID-19 and describes it as
the most difficult effect of COVID-19 mentally for him. This inability to return home has
13

Alexander Rehnberg
1901622
27.11.2020
Research Chapter

made the distance between Finland and Australia feel even further mentally. The country
specific restrictions have occurred through national policies, due to the pandemic (see the
table on pp. 8-9), this has led to the mental distance growing towards your home country as it
is harder to travel there. Therefore, the distance has become even wider, and this influences
people’s wellbeing as establishing your relation towards your fellow citizens becomes harder
(see Jaeggi, 2014). The distance between Finland and Australia is vast, and COVID-19 has
mentally increased that distance farther. Social distancing has become a norm in Finland in
everyday life.
In addition, two of the participants observe social distancing in everyday life:
However, I am pregnant at the moment. So, that has changed things with all mother
groups and everything being online and things like that. (A)
I find I am speaking more to my friends back in Melbourne, than then to my classmates
[Metropolia University] here…, it is difficult to make friends (C).
Due to COVID-19 there are restrictions for larger group gatherings in Finland (see the table
on pp. 8-9). A observes that during her pregnancy the social support which was before
COVID-19 participated in proximity with other mothers, has now changed as the
participation is online. For C social distancing has affected his ability to socialize with his
University peers, therefore he is more in contact with his friends in Melbourne than those at
the Metropolia University in Helsinki. Social distancing affects an individual’s possibility for
full involvement in the wider society, Giddens (2009) refers partly this to as Social
Exclusion.
In addition, A discusses the social distance due to the restrictions during the COVID-19 era:
My parents had a trip planned here in August this year, which was unable to be done.
And I had a trip planned there this Christmas which was not able to happen. (A).
Flights have been greatly reduced globally due to COVID-19. A laments how the restrictions
have affected the possibility to travel, as her parents flight to Finland in August 2020 and her
flight to Australia for Christmas 2020 never took place. Due to the Australian overseas travel
ban, it is difficult to be granted an exemption to travel out from Australia (See Australian
Model). The incoming passenger capacity model that Australia uses, has decreased the
chances of flying to Australia (See the table on pp. 8-9). The social forces that have taken
14

place during COVID-19 in the form of border closures and restrictions, have shaped people’s
circumstances (see Giddens, 2009). According to Fricker (2007) the wronged party is usually
the excluded party. In Australia, the majority still believes the restrictions are necessary to
keep them safe, therefore citizens outside of Australia that have been wronged have no voice
in the matter of national policies.

7.3. The effect of the Finnish and Australian response models
EU have an agreement of open travel between member countries (European Commission,
2021), so that for instance the ferries between Finland and Sweden or Finland and Estonia
have been working during most periods of the COVID-19 era. Australia is not under this
pressure, as it does not belong to a union such as EU. One of the participants observe
Australia’s COVID-19 situation and the restrictions:
The situation is actually really good in Australia and they are an island. They are far
away from everything else. So, they have the possibility to put these restrictions in
place (A)
A observes how positive the COVID-19 situation is in Australia, as it is an island which is far
away from other countries. Therefore, it has had the possibility to implement the restrictions.
There has also been positive results, especially, with smaller island nations in preventing the
spread of influenza (see Boyd, 2017). The healthcare system is not over-encumbered by
influenza patients, which was the case in i.e., Sweden. There can be another negative effect
though, as closing borders can lead to economic and personal costs (see Boyd, 2017).
One of the participants says the following about the Australian hotel quarantine:
The hotel quarantine does make sense, but there is no other alternative and I do not
think that is really good. (B).
There are other countries that have implemented a hotel quarantine into their response to keep
COVID-19 from spreading. B observes that the hotel quarantine seems sensible, but that it is
not sustainable to have no other alternatives. Even though the hotel quarantine has proved to
be efficient in controlling the spread of COVID-19, the Australian government has not
provided any other solutions, yet, to their COVID-19 model. In the beginning the model was
15

Alexander Rehnberg
1901622
27.11.2020
Research Chapter

shaped to flattening the curve (Australian Goverment Department of Health, 2020). Australia,
as said, has done very well in tracing down any possible cases and therefore, they have
managed to keep COVID-19 from spreading to a minimal level.
A, B and D discuss the Australian COVID-19 model in comparison to the Finnish model:
I feel like we do really need to begin living with this and Australia’s methods are not
sustainable. So, it feels like it cannot keep going on forever. So, Finland feels a lot
more sustainable. (A)
I feel like the way that Finland’s doing things is sustainable in the longer run. (B)
If you do look at back, in my opinion, looking at it from a bigger picture that Finland
has done amazingly well, and I have really appreciated it, but I know that a lot of
people disagree. (D).
A, B and D observe that the Australian COVID-19 model is not sustainable in the long run,
whereas the Finnish model seems more sustainable now. There is a positive effect to
mandatory testing which should be relevant even here in Finland, instead of voluntary (2020).
Australia has mandatory COVID-19 testing for returning passengers, as it makes it easier to
trace the disease and intervene if needed (Chang et al., 2020). This does not necessarily mean
that COVID-19 can be fully eliminated, even though Australia has been able to keep COVID19 almost non-existent most of the time (Coatsworth, 2020; Groch, 2020). Self-quarantine is
voluntary in Finland, which can be shortened by testing and the official quarantine period is
usually 10 days (THL, 2020). The Finnish model has been fluid, i.e., when COVID-19 cases
increased the government decided to lockdown the region of Uusimaa in April 2020 and there
will be nationwide lockdown in March 2021 (Finnish Government). This has only taken place
once, for a short period in Finland. Otherwise, the restrictions have been quite relaxed, and
freedom of movement has not changed. Unnecessary travelling should be avoided, which is
the same in most countries.

7.4. Losing basic rights
Freedom of movement has been discussed during COVID-19. Sweden’s national response
model received positive feedback as it did not restrict the citizens’ rights of free movement
within the country, or even leaving the country as this is stated in the Swedish Constitution of
16

Alexander Rehnberg
1901622
27.11.2020
Research Chapter

1974 (see The Constitution of Sweden, 2016). Also, in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, it is stated in article 13 “Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and
residence within the borders of each state. Everyone has the right to leave any country,
including his own, and return to his country.” (1948). C reflects on the different countries
lockdowns in the beginning of the pandemic.
I think there was a woman or maybe it was a couple [Australian Citizens] in Spain in the
beginning, they had been trying to get back [Australia] since. That is right, the story was
they tried to leave the country before borders closed, but then Spain had the lockdown
really early and then by the time the lockdown finished they could not get back to
Australia. (C).
C observes how Australian citizens, in Spain missed their opportunity to return to Australia
before Australia closed their borders. This was due to different countries having lockdowns
during different time periods; therefore, it has been difficult for the citizens to coordinate
their flights back to their home country. Lockdowns took place in many different countries
when COVID-19 was categorized as a pandemic and when COVID-19 started spreading
uncontrollably (WHO, 2020). This sounds perhaps as an extreme example, but for many this
would have been mentally a very challenging event. There were no global guidelines per se
for how the countries should create restrictions and bring back returning citizens.
Membership [citizenship], loses its meaning as different countries become incoherent with
regard to their global agreements (Bellamy, 2008).
One of the research participants observes that:
Those people who want to get home now maybe did not even think that they needed to
get home until two weeks ago, maybe they just lost their job because the country they
are working in, got into something massive spike in cases or whatever reasonable
(D).
D argues how the people that are in dire need to return to Australia now, might not have
known how their situation would be before the lockdowns and when the pandemic started.
Which is what the Australian government expected the citizens to do, before stricter
restrictions (Martin & Murphy, 2020). As a member of an institution [a country], you usually
always have the right to return to that country or have access to it (Bellamy, 2008). It is
usually an exclusive right as well, meaning that those that are denied direct access, become
excluded (Bellamy, 2008; Giddens, 2009). The restrictions have made these rights become
17

Alexander Rehnberg
1901622
27.11.2020
Research Chapter

fluid, as there is no longer a direct access to a country, i.e., flights have become limited and in
Australia there is a capacity limit as well.
In addition, A discussed the following restrictions as well:
I can enter the country [Australia], absolutely I can get the permission. I can find a
magical flight and I can do the quarantine at my own expense, but you have a life
here and I have my husband who cannot enter the country without a visa. (A).
A laments how she can enter Australia, but her husband cannot enter as he needs a visa for it.
There is an excluding factor for some of the participants to return to Australia, as even if they
do find a flight, their spouses or children cannot enter the country without a visa and
exemption, which is granted only for special cases (Australian Border Force, 2021). The
Australian Border Forces are those who will grant an exemption for leaving the country.
In addition, the issue of citizenship is discussed further by E:
There are people who are desperately trying to go home, and citizenship may feel
different for them, than it does for me at the moment. (E).
E observes that people who are desperately trying to go back to their home countries,
citizenship may feel different to them, as it does for her. For those that are desperately trying
to go home citizenship may feel very different at the time when they are stranded, compared
to those who are at a comfortable position in their residing countries. Citizens ought to have
certain rights (Bellamy, 2008), but there are cases where these rights need to be changed for
the common good. During COVID-19 countries have had to put those within a country first,
due to keeping the majority safe, towards the incoming residents which could be considered
the minority.

7.5. Media portrayal
Media tends to be biased or possibly even involved in party politics (Eide, 2010, 71). Media
in Australia is heavily influenced on news of COVID-19, and how well the government has
kept Australia safe. For many Australians that are stranded overseas (Rothwell, 2020;
Amnesty International, 2020) it has been particularly difficult for them as it has been
disheartening to follow the media that is very pro-government. B observes the following:
18

Alexander Rehnberg
1901622
27.11.2020
Research Chapter

I think yeah within the country they are trying to really push this view that they are
keeping the people within Australia safe. And their majority rules, you know, there is
more people inside of Australia than Australians outside of Australia. (B).
B argues that the media is pushing the viewpoint of keeping people safe in Australia, and
how the Australians within the country are right in comparison to those outside of Australia.
Media’s portrayal has been leaning towards the direction of portraying anyone outside
Australia as a risk for COVID-19 and that it has been their own choice not to return earlier.
This takes the discussion back to the people that might not had known of their future situation
would be beforehand, and financial situation that effects their possibility to pay for all the
fees.
A observes the following:
She [A’s mother] has so much sympathy towards my specific situation and that she
cannot believe that she cannot get out of the country and that me and my husband
cannot come into the country and it is just horrific. Then two minutes later in the
same conversation, she will talk about how there is everyone else. It seems entering
the country is just travellers that have had so much time to get home and they are
disregarding Australia and the rules, and they are just bringing Covid home (A).
A observes how her mother sympathises with her situation of not being able to travel back to
Australia and that she cannot travel to Finland. Yet soon after A’s mother’s perspective
changes as she does not sympathise with other Australians being abroad that are trying to
return. As these Australians should have returned earlier and now, they are only bringing
COVID-19 back to Australia. This dual perspective of having sympathy towards your own
kin for not being able to return, yet at the same time not being able to sympathise with other
Australians seems problematic. There is an indifference towards those that are not related or
close friends (Giddens, 2009). This indifference can be harrowing, as Levitas (2005) remarks;
there is a small minority that includes and majority that excludes. Therefore, people end up as
pawns between social forces (Giddens, 2009).
In addition, A observes the influences that affect her mother’s perception as following:
I know that she [A’s mother] is not getting that idea from herself. I think she is
definitely getting that from the media that we are all just out here travelling, and we
should have been home already by now (A).

19

Alexander Rehnberg
1901622

Research Chapter

A laments that her mother would not be getting the idea herself, but that the media has
affected her perception of returning Australians. Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated the
following: “Australians living overseas had had many opportunities to return to Australia: “If
they’re choosing to do so now, they’ve obviously delayed that decision for a period.” (Taylor
& Mills, 2020). There is no discussion from the Australians perspective that are abroad, as
they may not have known of their situation earlier and they might financially not be able to
return. The media in Australia has become partly a government “public health
authoritarianism” in reporting of COVID-19 and is partly under a “political control” narrative
(Sun, 2021). Therefore, it can be claimed that the media and government officials are
influencing people’s perception of COVID-19 and those that may risk their safety.

8. Conclusion and discussion
In this chapter, I discussed the social effects of some Australian citizens in Finland during the
COVID-19 pandemic. As COVID-19 is still an ongoing pandemic the results for this study
are fluid as are the different nation’s restrictions during this era. There have not been many
studies in relation to social exclusion and COVID-19 in terms of citizens that are abroad. This
study has relied on empirical data, which examines the multidimensional consequences of
excluding returning citizens.
Through assessing media and government declarations and combining this with the
transcription from the focused group-interview, I studied the causal impact of the COVID-19
restrictions and its excluding effects on Australian citizens in Finland. I found that mentally
these restrictions have created a further distance for the Australians in Finland to Australia.
There is also a correlation towards minor negative effects in social integration and social
participation for Australians in Finland due to COVID-19. Results suggests that, aside from
financial and social constraints due to COVID-19, there have been factors of exclusion
towards Australian citizens living in Finland due to the border closures in Australia. The
results also show that the exclusion has been perceived differently on individual levels, and
not to the extent of the Australians feeling alienated towards their own country. Although for
the Australians that I interviewed the situation is different compared to other desperate
Australian citizens trying to return to Australia, as they have either lived in Finland for a
20

longer period or have a family in Finland. Therefore, for them there has not been an urgent
reason to move back to Australia.
Countries that have strict border closures have experienced some backlash as citizens have
been prevented from visiting their i.e., dying family members in a different country. This is
the personal cost of limitations on international travel. The other part is the economic strain
that a country must go through due to border closures. Therefore, there cannot yet be
finalized results of how the border closures have affected all the citizens that have not yet
been able to return to their home country. Although Australia is far away from Finland, the
restrictions established by the Australian government, has made the participants feel that the
distance is even farther.
