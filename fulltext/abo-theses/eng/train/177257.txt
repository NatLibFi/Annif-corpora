Abstract:
With the rapid development of big data, AI and other information technologies, enterprises have
begun to focus on their own information construction, while customers' demands and requirements
for related services are also increasing. The insurance industry is purely information-based and
information-oriented, therefore efficient gathering, processing, analyzing, and using a vast amount
of information is essential for business operations in this area. The use and development of IT is
crucial. All activities between insurance companies and customers occur around information and
information technologies mediate the relationships throughout the whole life cycle of insurance
products. Therefore, in contrast to other industries, the modern insurance industry has a natural
dependence on IT. Information technology is of vital importance to insurance companies and
effective use of information and IT is a primary competitive advantage for insurance companies.
As one of the most influential insurance company in China, Ping An applies information technologies
in multiple fields extensively and aims to become a world-leading fintech company on the basis of
core information technologies. This study describes how information technologies are used in the
development of life and health insurance product development in the company, with particular
focus on and what kinds of data and information are used in product development.
This thesis is based on interviews within the company and it aims to invesigate the use of
information and IT in data analysis in life and health insurance product development. To reach the
aim of the thesis two research questions are set and 10 interviews were conducted with senior
manager, technicians in information and actuarial departments, and sales managers to collect
information and answer these questions. The interview materials provide an overview of the full
cycle of insurance product development process. The results show in the context of big data, the
insurance product development is changed into a better way.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Area of research
Information and IT has become increasingly important in many areas, including the
insurance industry. As in other sectors of the economy, the insurance industry has
experienced many changes in IT over the years. Information affects the insurance
industry in various aspects.

In this thesis, I attempt to explore how public

information and statistics on health, death, traffic and market influence life and
health insurance product development and how big data analysis and other
analytical techniques and tools are used in this process.
The market competition of insurance in China is increasingly fierce and intense. In
order to enhance competitiveness, Chinese insurance companies have to provide
high-quality products and services to maximise consumer satisfaction. The premise
of developing a high-quality insurance product requires an in-depth study of the
consumers’ demands, and choosing-purchase behaviours, and IT has brought
effective tools which help to gather and process data and information effectively
about customers' needs and behaviours (Annual Report, 2017) Thus, the necessity
of research about information and information technology used in the insurance
industry to understand consumer’s needs and develop new products is apparent.
The purpose of this thesis is to build a comprehensive understanding of information
use and IT applications in insurance product development.

Life and health

insurance products, and their development process, are analysed to reach the aim.
The reason for choosing life and health insurance is that they are the main products
of the insurer.

1.2 Research question
Considering the overall research purpose, the research questions for the thesis are
the following:

2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
In this chapter, the fundamental concepts of life and health insurance and IT
methods which are applied in life and health insurance product development are
introduced

2.1 Presentation of insurance business, life and health insurance
2.1.1 Insurance and Insurance development
Insurance is a contract in which a policy holder applies for financial protection from
an insurer. The policy holder pays the insurance premium to the insurer according
to the contract. The insurer takes the liability for compensation insurance for the
property loss or other insurance term condition (Wei & Lin, 2008), The essence of
insurance is risk transferring. Policyholders pay premiums to insurers then insurers
undertake the insured’s risks. When risks occur, they are transferred from the
insureds to insurers. Thomas and McSharry (2015) explain that risk is the
quantitation or measurement of uncertainty. Commercial insurance can be roughly
divided into property insurance, life insurance, health insurance, liability insurance,
credit insurance, and marine insurance.
An insurance policy is a financial agreement between the insurer and the
policyholder. For instance, an insurer agrees to pay some benefits, if the insured
meet the condition of term of the insurance, while the policyholder agrees to pay
premiums to the insurance company to secure these benefits. The premiums will
also need to reimburse the insurance company for the expense associated with the
policy(Dickson, Hardy & Waters, 2009). Policy holder is an individual who contracts
with an insurance company and has the obligation to pay insurance premiums in
accordance with the insurance contract. Insurer, or insurance company which
contracts with the policyholder, is liable for compensation or payment of the
insurance. The insured is the protected target of the insurance contract. The
beneficiary is the individual who is designated by the insured or the policy holder
that has the right to claim insurance benefits (Wei & Lin, 2008).

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

Insurance business represents commercial activities which are profit-driven as the
objective of the organization. The success of insurance business is the amount of
premium (Rubin, 2000). In China, the main profit of local giant insurers comes from
life and health insurance premiums.
The origin of the insurance business can be traced back to ancient Roman times. The
Romans invented marine insurance to reduce the risks of shipping. With the
development of society, prototypes of fire, property and other insurances
successively emerged in Europe (Liu, 2008). In contrast to other types of insurance,
the emergence of life insurance came relatively late. Edmond Hally, the British
astronomer, geophysicist, mathematician, meteorologist and physicist created the
first annuity table based on mortality data collected from historical record, and this
is viewed as the major leap forward for life assurance (Kopf, 1927).
The development of the China’s insurance industry is later than that in Europe. The
first Chinese insurance company was opened by British in Guangzhou in 1805. After
1805 until the establishment of People's Republic of China, many insurance
companies are formed. After the establishment of People's Republic of China, only
one insurance company was founded, the company was domestics and operated by
the government. Until 1980s, private Chinese insurance companies were permitted
to found, and China’s insurance industry began its development. The development
of Chinese insurance industry is difficult, due to large population, regional disparity,
low insurance awareness, and low income which are the impediment of
development. However, with the growth of economy and the policy support from
government, the prosperity of the industry has flourished (Liu, 2008). The late
development of Chinese insurance means that the gap with foreign insurance
industry is big. To minimise the gap and penetrate deeper of the native market, a
great effort must be made.
2.1.2 Life insurance
Life insurance is a contract between an insurer and an insurance policyholder. Life
insurance is also an investment and family property planning, it is also a type of
10

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

income after retirement. It is a form of protection in which a policyholder makes
regular payments to an insurer. In return, a sum of money will be paid to the
beneficiary after a fixed period of time, or after the death of the insured (Wei & Lin,
2008). The death of the insureds is regarded as a risk to the insurer. The risk will
transfer from the insured to the insurer in life insurance if the insured is
underwritten. Shang (2006) illustrates that in life and health insurance, risks are
predictable if historical data is analysed and understood well, and even different
types of mathematical models can be built to quantify the possibilities of risks.
According to the past data, such as death rate, insurers can realise an acceptable
range of risk rate, and design appropriate products with precise premium rates to
avoid losses. Based on the characteristics of life insurance, it helps to prevent
insurance beneficiaries from falling into financial difficulties caused by the death of
insureds. Insurance compensation can be used to cover funeral and other death
expenses, and it can be regarded as the replacement of the earning of insureds.
Common types of life insurance include term life insurance, permanent life
insurance and endowment insurance. Life insurance covers a specific time period. If
the insured dies during the period of coverage, the beneficiary has the right to claim
the compensation. After the period expires, the insurer is no longer guaranteed the
benefit of the insured and policyholder (Wei & Lin, 2008). Permanent life insurance
is an insurance that covers the remaining lifetime of the insured. The validity of the
contract ends upon the death of the insured. Due to the prolonged duration of
permanent life insurance, its premium is inevitably higher than life insurance (Wei
& Lin, 2008). Endowment policy is an insurance contract which pays an accumulated
sum after a certain time or of death. Meaning the insured receives the value of the
policy if the individual survives the endowment period. In contrast to other types of
life insurance, this policy functions similarly to a long-term investment, thus the
premium can be expensive (Wei & Lin, 2008).

2.1.3 Health insurance
Health insurance covers the losses caused by health problems. It also covers part or
all the medical costs of the insured. It includes insurance for losses from accident,
11

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

medical expense, disability, and accidental death and dismemberment (Marcinko &
Hetiko, 2006). The essence of health insurance is to transfer the health risks from
insurees to insurers. Health insurance includes medical insurance, disability income
insurance and long-term care. Of which, medical insurance can be further divided
into illness medical insurance and accident insurance.
Marcinko and Hetiko (2006) defined underwriting as signing and accepting an
insurance policy thus guaranteeing payment in case loss or damage occurs. The
main risks of health insurance are generally illnesses and accidents. Therefore, the
terms and conditions of health insurance are generally stricter than those of life
insurance. Hoyweghen (2007) demonstrated that the translation of an individual
into an insurance risk is not a strict technical-arithmetical conversion of the
individual’s health characteristics into a statistical risk category. The insurers must
inspect the latest actual situation of every single customer before underwriting. The
feasibility of underwriting relies on both the calculation and inspection result (Sun
& Lan, 2010). Before underwriting, insureds must be evaluated strictly on their state
of health, the career, working and living environment and other factors. Moreover,
the insureds should tell the insurers about their medical history. It is necessary for
insureds to submit their physical examination results. If the health status of insureds
do not meet the requirement of the terms, they need to pay higher premium or
accept the term of exclusions in a specific condition. The observation period refers
to a period of time the insurer is entitled to observe insureds’ overall health status
before making a judgment on their qualification of a certain policy. The observation
period of some Chinese health insurance products, for example, is 90 days; the
insurance policy becomes effective after the observation period, given full
qualification of the insured. The insurance company would not pay any benefits if
the insured does not meet the health standard during any time of the observation
period.

Rationed payment medical insurance, reimbursement medical insurance and
subsidy or allowance type medical insurance are the most common health
insurance. (Sun & Lan, 2010). In rationed payment medical insurance, the insurance
12

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

amount is fixed. As long as the insured suffers from any of the diseases listed in the
clauses of the insurance, regardless of whether or how much medical expenses have
occurred, the insurance company will pay the insurance benefits in a lump sum
according to the amount in the contract (Sun & Lan, 2010). Reimbursement medical
insurance is the policy in which the insured pay losses and costs for medical first
and then apply reimbursement for covered loss from the insurer (Sun & Lan, 2010).
The costs are reimbursed according to the proportion agreed in the insurance
contract. In allowance type medical insurance, the insurance company pays the
insurance benefit according to the actual number of days which the insured spend
in the hospital.

2.2 Insurance product development
Insurance product development is the process to create new products, and it aims
to meet the needs of the insurance market. It not only refers to design a brand-new
insurance product, but also includes the improvement and combination of existing
products (Purushotham et al., 2017),

2.2.1 Insurance product development process
Both clients and insurers’ core benefits must be considered in insurance product
development. The core benefit of clients is the value of term or content in the
insurances. For instance, in life insurance, core benefits of clients are the needs of
pension, health care and medical, and insurers must fulfil those demands to retain
clients. Therefore, the term, content and coverage are key parts in insurance product
development. For insurer, they need to make enough profit from their clients to stay
in business. Hence, premium design is another key part in insurance product
development (Purushotham et al., 2017).
Purushotham et al. (2017) illustrate that there are several types of new insurance
product development, the most common types are: brand new product
development, revision and repricing. Development of a brand-new product requires
information on strategy, premium pricing, management, and the budget.
13

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

Brand new product involves bringing to the market significantly new different
product features or functions. A new product would require a unique system
identifier or would be filed as a new product.
Revision and enhancement mean to change, modify, add or delete the condition and
terms in current products. Purushotham et al. (2017) believe revision and
enhancement cover the spectrum of changes between a rate change and a new
product because many new insurance products are design based on the old
products. Repricing and rate change refer to the premium adjustment of products,
the policies are remained (Purushotham et al. 2017).
To provide for consistency in responses across participating companies, the key
product development process has been defined. The steps are the following:
(Purushotham et al. 2017).
•

Idea Generation: Ideas for new products. Views are discussed and selected
for further formal analysis.

•

Product Concept and High-Level Feasibility: Study and research about the
feasibility of selected view and idea. Selected ideas are projectised and
funded.

•

Product planning and design: Clause and content of products are designed.

•

Establish Underwriting Guidelines: Establish underwriting rules and
processes.

•

Product Pricing: Actuarial pricing that includes setting the rates, reserves,

•

Product Launch: Product development complete.

•

Tracking of Results: Feedback from market and clients, compare and
measure the business results.

2.2.2 Traditional insurance product development
Data analysis has begun to influence the insurance industry since the emergence of
actuarial science. (Franklin, 2001) Actuarial science is the pillar of life and health
insurance product development. The actuarial methods link to probability
calculation and risk evaluation. The methods are applied to calculate premiums,
14

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

reserves, and dividends for participating policies, and develop products. (Rubin,
2000) Actuaries used modern mathematical and statistical methods to predict the
uncertainties of the business and evaluate the risks. Actuarial science is developed
based on mortality data and analysis, demographics and probability research.
Actuaries adjust calculation according to those historical data. However, the
insurance market became more complicated by the progress of society, and
actuaries need to involve more uncertain factors into their calculation to achieve an
accurate result. Relying only on traditional statistics methods does not seem
sufficient in today’s era. A more stringent requirement of data is necessary to meet
the current need of the actuarial science. As the quantity and quality of data improve,
it will be impossible to calculate increasingly accurate estimates based directly on
the information with old-fashioned data analysis methods. (Thomas & McSharry,
2015) Thus, modern IT methods are used to support a more comprehensive data
collection as well as an accurate data analysis process.
Solutions like big data analytics and artificial intelligence not only satisfied the needs
of insurers but also redefine the roles of insurance. These methods enable insurers
to obtain information about customers’ habits and behaviours and to analyse the
information.

High-quality data analysis results show precise risk rates. By

understanding the risk rates, the role of insurance is no longer only to protect risk
or compensate for loss but also to predict and prevent risks. (Swan, 2015)
IT impacts today’s insurance industry positively, it not only changes the role of
insurance but also change the aim of insurance. Traditional insurance product
development means that new products, based on market surveys, and customers
analysis have been developed unilaterally. Economic benefits have been the only
purpose of the product development and customers’ needs have not been
adequately considered. Low customization forces customer to accept insurance
products which may not fully satisfy their needs. However, with the advance of
internet and IT, insurers realised that the centre of business is not products but
customers. Customization product is generated, customers’ experience and needs
became the reference of product development (Johne,1993).
15

2.3

Data management and IT solutions

Hislop (2005) defines data as raw material such as numbers, images or words which
result from observation or measurement. The value of raw data is limited if no data
processing is implemented. Unprocessed data cannot be used to enhance decisionmaking. To extract evidence for decision-making, data is organised into a
meaningful pattern, and the meaningful pattern is referred to information (Hislop,
2005). Data management is the way to organise data. It provides the interpretation
of qualitative empirical materials (Huberman & Miles, 1994). Data management is
the process to acquire, store and process data, and it requires the use of both
hardware and software.
The emerge of e-commerce 20 years ago, influences modern business and generates
a new business model, and it triggers the rapid increase of social data volume. Then
with the growing popularity of smartphones, search engines, and big data, a sociotechnical phenomenon is defined and spread. The phenomenon generates both the
volume and variety of data more than ever, and the data management became more
challenging. Therefore, advanced methods are needed to process data characterised
by high volume and diversity (Krishnan, 2013).

2.3.1 Big data and big data solutions
Big data is high-volume, high-velocity and high-variety information assets that
require high efficiency and accuracy of information processing for enhanced
decision-making and perception (Swan, 2015). Volume is the amount of stored data.
It differs from traditional data, in the way that the size of big data is massive. Terms
like terabytes, petabytes and even exabytes are used to describe the volume of big
data. The volume of data is also used to measure if the data can be considered as big
data or not (Hilbert, 2016). The size of data in the insurance industry is even more
massive than other industries due to the fact that both variety and amount of data is
required to make accurate predictions. Traditional data processing methods are not
able to process all available data, therefore big data techniques have been applied.
Variety refers to the type and characteristics of data. The data type in big data is not
only in text form, the data type includes images, audio, and video. The diversity of
16

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

data helps insurance companies understand the market, customers and the
environment entirely (Katal, Wazid & Goudar, 2013). Velocity is the speed at which
the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges that lie in
the path of growth and development. Big data is often available in real-time. To
remain competitive, insurance companies need to focus on the changes in market
and environment, then insurance companies make a quick response to the changes.
New product development and products upgrade are methods of immediate
response to the demand (Katal, Wazid & Goudar, 2013). Term veracity was added
later to describe the characteristics of big data later. It refers to the data quality of
gathered data, it relates closely with the accuracy of data analysis and predicts
(Habart & Janssen, 2017).
The quality is also the most crucial factor in big data. Quality of data includes
completeness, accuracy and appropriateness (Olson, 2012). The completeness of big
data means data include sufficient historical information to assess the
characteristics of the underlying risks and identify trends in these risks. The
accuracy refers to the data which is recorded regularly and coherently and without
material errors. Suitability is the consistency of data and the data is consistent with
the assumptions underlying the actuarial and statistical techniques applied to them
in the calculation of technical provisions.
The insurance industry was one of the first to take advantage of IT solutions.
Insurers adopted new methods to deal with the challenges of big data era when it
emerged. One of the most innovative moves is the creating of a big data platform for
individuals with specific insurance needs. By the platform, insurers can collect those
individuals’ information and negotiate highly customised contracts for them. The
platform allows insurers to extract deep knowledge of the individuals by analysing
customers’ data. Through the data analysis results, the insurer can precisely locate
customers who have the possibility to underwrite. In addition, by understanding
those customers’ needs, insurers are able to design the high-customised insurance
product to them. Big data also provides easy access to some of the information
necessary for pricing and will gradually reduce the use of the traditional paper
questionnaires. Hence, it allows faster decision-making (Habart & Janssen, 2017).
17

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

In the context of big data, a vast amount of information is available to gather from
different channels. In addition, different formats of data can be processed to provide
useful information for insurers. Big data solutions provide ways to collect, store and
analyse a high volume of data efficiently. Analytical solutions for big data provide
precise and high-quality results that reveal specific needs and associated risks of
individuals. These solutions also ensure the quality and accuracy of data. To some
extents, the role of insurance is transferred from understanding and protecting risks
to predicting and avoiding risks in the era of big data (Benno, 2018).
The challenges of big data processing are the high volume and complexity.
Unstructured data is data that is not organised in a pre-defined manner, the type of
unstructured data is various, and it accounted the vast majority data volume in a
company. Big data tools like Hadoop, Hive and NoSQL are used to deal with
unstructured data (Krishnan, 2013). Big data and other IT solutions such are utilised
to support decision making are used to transfer data into meaningful information.
However, these solutions differ from each other due to their purposes,
characteristics, and targets are different. Big data solutions have capacity to deal
with larger amount of data than other IT solutions, and the solutions are able to
process real-time data. Big data solutions apply parallel processing method which
enhances the efficiency of processing the data by assigning multiple tasks into
several implementation processes, and thus it makes analysing the large volumes
faster.

2.3.2 Artificial intelligence
Artificial Intelligence is a branch of Computer Science dealing with the simulation of
intelligent behaviour in computers. Machine learning is a core application of AI,
which support systems with a self-learning ability. Machine learning start with
observations of data, then it accesses and searches for the patterns of data. The
ultimate aim of the machine learning is allowing the computers learns automatically
thereby the computer can make better decision based on the historical data (Benno,
2018).
18

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

Rajendra and Srinivas (2016) state that artificial intelligence has been emphasizing
and applying in the insurance industry. The machine learning algorithms help
insurance companies to understand the characteristics and needs of customers; it
improves the accuracy of premium pricing. AI helps insurance company in product
development. It provides content recommendation to customer and enhance risk
control. Advanced insurers have established comprehensive scenarios of AI
applications such as smart perception, prediction, risk management, and services to
ensure the quality of data and accuracies of data analysis results. Besides, through
voice and image recognition, machine learning, natural language processing and
other technologies, customer service has been simplified.
Machine learning is an efficient tool which process vast amounts of real-time big
data in succession. Systems established on machine learning algorithms use large
amounts of real-time data and data analytics results to conduct its unceasing study
and improvement (Schanz & Sommerrock, 2016). Insurers take reference from
machine learning results when a new product plan is set. Through the continuous
observation and analysis of relevant data, risks in the new product is calculated and
the results are reported to insurers. According to the result, insurers will define the
acceptable limitation of risks. The high-risk terms will reveal from the results,
insurers are warned thereby loss is prevented. High risks probably cause losses to
insurers, to prevent the situation, insures may set high premium or decide not to
take the risks.

Insurance product development is labour-consuming process,

machine learning can enhance the research and development efficiency and reduce
research and development costs (Schanz & Sommerrock, 2016).
Many actors in society are concerned about over-using of personal data in many
industries. The concerns are probably to become more prominent in the era of big
data and artificial intelligence, and the situation may cause a new challenge. In
insurance industry, customers’ data is a critical information asset, and through
analysis, detailed customers’ personal information is known by insurers. Although
data protection regulations were issued to control the collection and use of personal
data by insurers in most countries (Benno, 2018). However, customers must
19

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

provide key personal information in underwriting. Therefore, take value from
customers’ personal data while protect customers’ privacy is a problem insurer
must take seriously.

2.3.3 Business intelligence
Business intelligence is an ability which uses the information assets of firms
intelligently to support better decision-making. It is a concept and method for
enhancing the decision-making operation ability. It aims to transfer the data and
information that companies store into core competence (Xu, Zhang & Jiang, 2005).
It involves collecting massive amounts of raw data regarding all aspects of the
business, from productivity to profits and losses, and transforming it into actionable
insights.
Data analysis is a complicated process, multiple types of data are involved and
interacted. In the insurance industry, data of finance, actuarial, marketing,
customers, sales, human resources management, and production management are
core data relates to decision making. The data can be organised, or non-organised,
different data stored in different forms. In this condition, it is not conducive to data
management and analysis if data is not integrated. Therefore, a comprehensive
system is built to integrate, classify, store and analyse multiple types of data in one
data warehouse. This called the business intelligence system. BI systems allow the
data analysis based on classification, forecasting and simulation methods, which
enables gathering new and useful business information. The approach to integrate
data for BI named business intelligence solution. As an integration tool, business
intelligence solution enables access to different dispersed data from sources of
different structures and formats (O’Brien & Markas, 2010).

The data warehouse is an essential part of business intelligence, it is established to
centralise, store and partition data. The functions of data a warehouse are data
analysis and reporting (Nedim & Clare, 2016). It is defined as a collection of
integrated databases established to support the decision support system function.
Data warehouse receives data sources from multiple different systems. Data from
20

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

systems is extracted in a unified format, then data is cleansed, transformed,
integrated, and finally loaded into the data warehouse. Data warehousing emphasise
the data gathering from diverse sources for query and analysis. The operational
system is the main information source of data warehouse. Multiple operational
systems are built in different departments to gather data from various aspects.
Those systems are independent of each other, and the data is stored separately in
each system. To facilitate data analysis, data should be stored centrally. Hence, raw
data extracted from each operational system is integrated later to combine data
from disparate sources into meaningful and valuable information. Data warehouse
differs from a database. It organises the stored data for data analysis and decision
support, but the main purpose of the database is to store and query data for the
operational system. The main purpose of data integration is to deal with
unprocessed data. Data without processing is called unprocessed data. Unprocessed
data is generally incomplete and inconsistent, and it cannot be analysed directly.
Analysing without pre-processing is difficult to use further.
Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a tool to conduct multidimensional data
analysis, it is an important part of business intelligence and it has become a driving
engine in data warehouse industry. The functions of online analytical processing
include business reporting for sales, marketing, management reporting, business
process management budgeting and forecasting, financial reporting, etc. The
essence of online analytical processing is linking disparate databases and then
analysing data concentratedly in multiple dimensions. A dimension can be regarded
as an aspect of thinking or analysis such as time and place. OLAP is used to analyse
current customers’ data, the data is integrated and classified for further use (Xu,
Zhang & Jiang, 2005).
Big insurance companies in China have developed at least for a decade, vast volumes
of data, and they have invested and upgraded in hardware to meet the vast volume
of data. Few giant insurers have already achieved data integration, which provides
the feasibility of organise, store, query and in-depth analysis of data. Chinese
insurers realised that the core element that influence the insurance industry is
transferred from products to customers, satisfy customers’ needs is the key to the
21

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

fierce competition. The way to satisfy customers’ needs is keeping close relationship
with customers and understand their instant demand by advanced IT tools. Insurers
can categorise the data of customers who contribute the major benefit to the insurer,
then analyse the attributes of the data and develop specific insurance products to
these customers. Risk evaluation is the premise of insurance product development.
Planning of insurance term and setting of premiums that have high requirement of
risk evaluation impact insurers’ profit and business. The balance between a
competitive premium and low risk coverage is the success of an insurance product.
Insurers need to know if the new product can generate profit, and, which term may
cause losses. For example, through the report, an insurer realised that main claim
submitters are insureds with liver cancers. Thus, the insurer has to re-evaluate the
risk of liver cancer and re-set reasonable premium for the insurance (Xu, Zhang &
Jiang, 2005).
Insurers face challenges in business intelligence, and one of the biggest challenges
is that the cost is high and professional technicians are required to implement BI
solutions (Xu, Zhang & Jiang, 2005). The function of BI can’t be fully used due to
some insurers lack of skilful technicians, thus, only the reporting function of BI is
emphasised by some insurers.

2.3.4 Data mining
Data mining can be defined as the process of selecting, exploring, and modelling
large amounts of data to uncover previously unknown patterns. It is the process of
revealing unexpected relationships in data (Ratner, 2011). The two main tasks of
data mining are classification and clustering. A class is a set of data samples with
similar feature or relationship, data in a class distinguished from other classes. A
cluster is a process of grouping similar objects into a class. The cluster is used to
classify objects in a meaningful way (Wang & Fu, 2005). Through the classification,
data and objects are organised and modelled, and future trends are predicted based
on the models. Through the specific result of data mining, decision-maker can
answer crucial business questions with greater accuracy. However, the premise of
taking full advantage of data mining in the insurance industry is managed, analysed,
22

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

and exploited data of the customer properly. Customer data is unique and a valuable
corporate asset. Data mining can track customers’ activities and predict their future
behaviour. It provides answers like who is a loyal customer and who will not
purchase our products anymore, and those answers influence the product
development (Berry & Linoff, 2004).
The insurance industry is an information-based industry. During the development
of insurers, enormous amount of business and customer data is accumulated. It’s
imperative to apply an effective method to discover and use the potential knowledge
from the accumulated data (Wang, Geng & Chen, 2008). So far, powerful Chinese
insurers have built their own data warehouse for data mining. The aim is to enhance
the efficiency of transfer vast amount of raw data into useful knowledge that better
decision-making. The main purposes of data mining in insurance industry are risks
accessing and customer classifying. It can dig out detailed information as
consumption structure of the market, consumption habit, social status and
influence, and even this information of customers’ families’ members can be
collected by insurers.
Data mining also play a key role in insurance product development by providing
reference for decision-making. Data mining reveals useful knowledge which
indicate success or failure, profit or loss to new products. Data mining search for
potential knowledge and relationship of risks. It digs out elements that cause risk
thereby insurers can prevent and control in product development stage (Wang,
Geng & Chen, 2008). The use of data mining in life and health insurance industry
mainly includes set premium, retain old customers, attract new customers and
detect insurance fraud. Processing customer data is another use of data mining, it
supports the analysis of customers’ state, predicts the customer’s purchasing
behaviours, and digs out the key elements that affect the customer maintaining. The
methods for dealing with customers’ data is categorizing, customers are categorised
by key index such as the possibility of purchase insurance products or the possibility
of renewal. Throughout the data mining, customers that with the high possibility to
purchased insurance are located and their needs are also determined (Wang, Geng
& Chen, 2008).
23

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

2.3.5 Multiple IT solutions
Solutions that deal with data is shifted in the era of big data. A single IT solution is
not able to meet the information needs of modern insurers. Today, insurers use
multiple IT solutions to achieve different information goals. The importance of data
has become more vital in insurance industry, since the good decisions only can be
made by extracting key information from correct analysed data. Big data, BI, data
mining and AI solutions help insurers to analyse data to get the insights needed. The
relationship of those solution is neither opposite nor overlapping, they need to be
synchronised to achieve the information goal together. The solutions are not the
same, but they share a lot of features. The ultimate goal of those solutions is to help
insurers to enhance their decision-making. However, the purposes and using of
those solutions differ from each other. For instance, in data analysis, big data
solutions focus on data processing, BI solutions focus on the relationship of data
while data mining focus on details and patterns of data (Wang, Geng & Chen, 2008).
IT solutions share many similarities, but also differ at some key points, for instance,
BI and big data solutions. Big data solutions focus on data analysis and provide highquality result to support decision-making while BI solutions aim to enhance the
decision-making in a strategic way (Habart & Janssen, 2017). In data analysis, the
object data of big data and BI is distinct. Big data solutions can analyse semistructured data and structured data while BI majorly deal with structured data. In
data collection, big data is collected from a variety of sources while BI utilises data
from a single and specific source. The big data channel is comprehensive, it can be
acquired from social media and other sources, whereas BI’s main data sources are
database and flat files. In the analysis, big data solutions can process the historical
data and also data coming from real-time sources, whereas in BI, it processes the
historical data sets (Krishnan, 2013).

authorised by the general manager, the aim of new product development is to gain
benefits to the board and company.

Figure 3. Main Department of the Company

3.4 Departments participating in insurance product development
The information for this section was collected from during the interviews with
supervisor and one of the interviewees, an actuary. Supervisor introduced the
product development process and the departments which are involved in product
development.

The actuary also provides the information in the interview to

describe the necessity of actuarial in product development. New insurance product
development is a time-consuming and human resource-consuming process in which
and multiple core departments are involved. The whole process starts from the idea
or intention to generate a new product, First, the idea is approved if it reaches the
goals and meets the needs of the insurers. Then the idea is transferred into an
executable plan. After that, a business analysis is conducted to verify its
accessibilities to market and determine the new product’s costs and profits. Once
the plan is confirmed, the actuarial department begins the policy design and
premium pricing. Finally, the new product is officially issued.

3.4.1 Actuarial department
28

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

The actuarial department plays a core role in insurance product development. The
product department is responsible for product design, provide support to the
strategy of the company. The department defines the feasibility and form of new
products, it also defines the demands of the customer. The department guides the
development processes, reviews the blueprint of new products. The department
also researches insurance products from other companies and takes part in
promotion and track of products. The responsibilities of the pricing department are
pricing and adjusting the premium and interest rate of products. Professional
actuaries are recruited in the department to conduct the complicated calculation
and to build complex mathematical models to achieve the goal of pricing. Also,
actuaries need to analyse premium and interest rates of products from competitors
to ensure the accuracy and correctness of the company’s strategy. The evaluation
office’s responsibilities are to review the results of compensation capacity and
reserve the amount which are calculated by actuaries, review the data and its
resource, evaluate and predict the profit, risks and reinsurance, assess the result of
cost analysis, and competitive intelligence which provided by product department
and other departments, assess actuarial terms, and review the requirement of China
Insurance Regulatory Commission. In addition, the office is responsible for internal
and external communication and coordination about report and auditing. Main
responsibilities of the marketing department are the market survey, promotion
planning and administration, build and maintain the positive brand image.

4 METHODOLOGY
In this chapter, the methodological framework is discussed. The research purpose,
the research approach, questionnaire design, and information collection are
described and evaluated as applied in this research.

4.1 Research purpose
The purpose of the thesis is to understand how the insurer uses information and
relevant technologies in life and health insurance product development. In order to
conduct the research, a 2-months internship was carried out in a Chinese insurance
company named Ping An. Ping An emphasises the importance of applications of
information and information technology, and the need for a comprehensive, and
functional information systems to support the data and information analysis and
meet the information need of the company (Annual Report, 2017). Based on the
insurer’s experience of IT use and product development, required information is
acquired. The company provides valuable and relevant information, accurate data
and other resources to author supporting the research. Through the study,
interviews and observations were conducted to study how, the life and health
insurance product development processes and promotion methods of Ping An are
realised. Relevant information and data were collected, recorded, organised and
used to answer the research questions.

4.2 Research approach
The research is conducted to understand and describe the process of developing
health and life insurance and to obtain the answers to the research question.
Seidman (2006) and Creswell (2007) argue that qualitative methods should be
adopted if the research has no links with establishing mathematical models or set
hypotheses to illustrate a phenomenon. Corbin and Strauss (2008) illustrate that
qualitative research methodology is considered to be suitable when the researcher
either investigates a new field of study or intends to ascertain and theorise
prominent issues. Thus, a qualitative research method is appropriate. To answer the
research question, in-depth and extensive understanding of the issues is required,
31

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

therefore the most appropriate qualitative methods to collect data is interview, and
the form of data is textural and non-numerical.
Interview is one of the most common methods used in social sciences, Kvale and
Brinkman (2008) emphasise there are multiple types of interview and of those
existing approaches, structured, semi-structured and unstructured are used most
frequently. The interview method used in this thesis is semi-structured. The reason
is to collect more unexpected relevant data and generate new ideas from interview.
(Kvale & Brinkman, 2008).
Moreover, case study research is a qualitative approach in which an investigator
explores a case, through detailed, in-depth data collection involving multiple
sources of information (Creswell, 2007). It is another qualitative method used in this
research. The case study approach is familiar to social scientists because of its
popularity in medicine, law and political science. Health care and law elements are
involved in insurance industry; thus, the case study method seems to be an
appropriate approach and it will be used in the thesis to collect key information.
The specific and detailed data is collected using the semi-structured interviews.
Interviewees who agreed to participate in the interview provided useful data as
much as possible to support the research and the quality of interviews are ensured.
Moreover, the structure of the interviews is flexible, interviewees are allowed to
provide any relevant data in the interviews and communication after interviews,
consequently, new ideas are inspired and generated from interviews and
communications to support the research. One difficulty in the interview was that the
interviewees could not provide many internal data of the company due to the
confidentiality of the company which fully understandable.
Three types of interview formulas were designed to collect different data and
information from various aspects. Questions for senior supervisor were designed to
gather information about the product development process, and decision making in
product development. Questions for the information technicians were designed to
understand how data is gathered and processed and then turned into information,
32

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

what type of data is required to be gathered and processed. Questions designed for
sales managers to understand the information on life and health insurance. Besides,
multiple questions were set to the actuary to understand the importance of actuarial
in product development. The main life and health insurance products are studied as
the case to explain the product development process.

4.3 Research design
Qualitative methods are used for information collection. The collected information
is organised to provide a clear research result. Interview questions are designed for
multiple interviewees to collect data and answer the core research questions;
supplementary information was collected by observation.

Two interviewees labelled as “Q” and “W” are sales managers in Ping An. Their main
business is selling life insurance products. In the interviews, they introduced the
basic information of Ping An’s life and insurances, such as type, content, the clause
of products. The interviews were all conducted in 2018. An interviewee denoted as
“J” is sales managers too. Data about specific products was collected during the

33

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

interview with J. A detailed product analysis was conducted with the help with J also.
The interview date was 16.7.2018.
In the interview with the senior supervisor Li, data about the basic state of the
company, structure of the company, basic information about insurance product
development was collected.
Interviewee denoted as “C” is a professional technician who works in the
information department. He provided all IT information of the company, which
includes the methods, tools and process of data collection and analysis. Several
interviews were held with C.
Interviewee denoted as “D” is an actuary in Ping An, and useful data of life and health
insurance product development was provided during the interview. The data
includes process, content, required data and information in life and health product
development.
The interviewees also provided relevant data after the interviews to help and guide
the research.

4.4 Data analysis method
Content analysis methods is used in this research to analyse data. Qualitative
content analysis is one of the research methods that were used to analyse text data.
Text data might be in verbal, print, or electronic form, and it is collected from narrative
responses, open-ended survey questions, interviews and observations, (Kondracki &
Wellman, 2002). The research data is mainly collected from interviews. The aim of data
analysis is to understand the use of IT in life and insurance product development in the
said company.
The main objective of this thesis is to understand the life and health insurance
development process. Throughout the analysis, how IT solutions are used in the process
is understood. The interview data is categorised into three main aspects; data of life and
34

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

health insurance products, data of life and health insurance product development and
IT used in product development. To conduct the analysis, a sample of life insurance
bundle is selected, categorised data is analysed separately. The data is analysed by

studying an insurance product and its development process. Based on the collected
information, the required data in product development is learned and key types of
data are selected to answer the research question, i.e., “what kind of data is required
for life and health insurance product development”?
The features of the data are determined by analysing, and generally, the sizes of
those types of data are huge, which require advanced IT solutions to deal with.
Multiple solutions are applied to collect, store, organise, classify and process data.
Through the discussion and interviews with the technician, the solutions and their
roles are introduced, and their functions in the different stages in the development
process are analysed.

35

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

5 INSURANCE PRODUCT AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
Information of the insurance product and its development is acquired from the
interview with supervisor Li, two sales managers and one the actuary employees.
The detailed content and process of development of the main life and health
insurance product is introduced in this chapter.

5.1 Content of insurance product development
According to the Chinese Insurance Law, (Insurance Law, 1995) new insurance
products must be filed and review by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission,
and the commission stipulates that insurance products and contracts must include:
•

The basic information of the insures: Name, gender, and contact information,
address.

•

The basic information of policyholders, insureds, and beneficiaries: Name,
gender, and contact information, address.

•

Insurance subject: Targets of insurance, properties, health and life are the
primary insurance subject. It is the premise of product design because the
demands of clients can be met only if their needs are clearly defined.
Insurance subject is the needs of customers.

•

Insurance liability and liability exemption: Scope of liability and the
exemption refers to the term and condition out of scope liability.

•

Insurance period and Insurance liability start time: The valid period of
insurance. The start and end time of the insurance and liability period are
consistent.

•

Insured Value: The value of insurance subject, measured in monetary value

•

Insurance Amount: the maximum amount an insurance company will pay if
an insured asset is deemed a total loss.

•

Premium: Cost policyholders need to pay to insures to validate the insurance
contract.

•

Insurance compensation and payment method.

5.2 Main life and health insurance product
The product development process is confidential of the company, thus the specific
information about it is uncollectable. However, the supervisor indicates that Ping
An developed products based on the standard development process. In the
interview, the senior supervisor elaborated on a few key processes in basic life and
health insurance product development by introducing how the main insurance
product of the company is developed. Due to the product is well-designed, the sales
manager also suggests that the main insurance product should be used to analyse
the process of product development. The sales manager and the senior supervisor
provide the specific product material and help to analyse what data and information
used in product development.
Ping An Luck is one of the most profitable comprehensive life and health insurance
product of the company. The product is upgraded annually to fit the changing
demand of markets. The 2018 edition of the product named Ping An Luck 18, and
the last version is Ping An Luck 17. As the main insurance of Ping An, it is prevailing
in the native life and health insurance market. The company promotes the insurance
vigorously by its powerful marketing network, consequently, it contributes to
occupy the market share firmly.
Ping An Luck 2018 is an insurance bundle product, the main part of the product is
life insurance. The bundle includes additional critical illness insurance with early
payment term, additional malignant tumour insurance, additional long-term
accidents injury insurance, additional critical illness exemption, additional minor
exemption, and additional accidental medical treatment. Life insurance, critical
illness insurance, accident insurance, and critical illness exemption are compulsory
and must be selected by customers. Other terms are optional, customer can select
depends on their own needs. In addition, the insurance amount of each term can be
customised based on customers’ demands, and the premium of each term varies
according to the insurance amount customer set by themselves. If insurance amount
of each term is confirmed by the customer, the premium of each term and total

37

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

premium are calculated by the system immediately, then the customer can decide
the payment period, pay in 10 years, 20 years and 30 years is the basic selection.
As the main part of the combination, life insurance is the most profitable term. The
content of this life insurance product is when the insured dies or reaches the age
specified in the insurance contract, the insurer pays the insurance premium. The
payment of insurance amount can be one-time payment, or it can be paid in
instalments in accordance with the contract to protect the beneficiary’s life in the
future, usually after retirement. The compulsory term of the life insurance is the
insurance amount of life insurance must be higher than other products in the
combination. The reason is the compensation amount of critical illness linked with
the insurance amount of the main insurance. When a customer receives an amount
of critical illness compensation, the equal amount of insurance amount is reduced
from the main life insurance.

5.3 Other products in bundle
Critical illness insurance, malignant tumour and Long-term accident injury
insurance are other insurances in the bundle. The coverage of critical illness
insurance in the bundle covers more types of illness than other illness insurances.
80 types of heavy critical illness and 20 types of minor critical illness are included,
which made it prevailed in the market.
Malignant tumour is one important term in the critical illness coverage. The
company sets malignant tumour insurance as an independent insurance in the
combination is to prevent the recurrence and metastasis in future. The term
provides continue protection to customer after cure of cancer. The content of the
insurance is if customer suffer malignant tumour which is specific in the critical
illness insurance, and recovered at last, then after five years, if the insured suffer
malignant tumour again, the customer can claim for compensation again for cancer
cure.
The content of long-term accident injury insurance is insureds encounter accident
when drive a private car, and take public transportation, insurers will pay the
38

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

compensation to the beneficiaries.

The compensation condition is death or

disability of insureds in accidents. If insured injured survives in an accident and
without being disabled, the claim is invalid. The advantage of the insurance is high
insurance amount and compensation, insured can claim double insurance amount
for compensation. For instance, a customer set the insurance amount of accident
insurance 500000 RMB, if the insured dies in an accident, his beneficiaries can claim
for 1 million RMB in total, and they can receive the insurance amount of main
insurance due to the insured dies.

5.4 Key process of developing the main product
5.4.1 Originating of product
Idea originating is the beginning of insurance product development. Insurance
product development includes new product development, enhancement or revision
of current products, and repricing or rate changing of existing products. As
mentioned, Ping An Luck 18 is an enhanced edition of the life and health product in
the past year. Compares to the previous edition, the premium and insurance amount
are higher, and more insurance subjects and illnesses are added in the insurance
coverage, besides, exemption condition of the current edition was changed also.
Although no significantly brand-new features and function were added, it is still a
new product. The idea of updating the main bundle product annually comes from
the understanding of the fluctuating of market. Market and needs float constantly,
to respond to the floating, periodical business or product plans must be delivered
and executed. However, superficial understanding and experience of the market are
insufficient to transfer a raw idea or concept into a performable plan. To achieve the
plan, one who generates the idea must refer to the corresponding professional data
to determine if the idea is practicable (Interview with Q, 11.7.2018).
Data guides idea generation. Market survey and national illness data reflect that
both critical illness incidence and critical illness types have increased from 2017 to
2018. To cope with the situation, the company decided to add corresponding types
of critical illnesses into the bundle’s coverage thereby satisfy the needs of the
39

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

market. Another instance is that Ping An issued a new health product which was
designed specifically for cancers which name is Cancer Defender 2018. It is not a
brand-new product with different and new added functions or characteristics, it was
upgraded and enhanced from the previous cancer insurance. The motivation of
enhancement and revision to the previous product is that the decision-makers
noticed that data indicates that the cancer population grew rapidly in past years.
Thus, the idea to develop a corresponding is reasonable and feasible. (Interview
with Q, 11.7.2018) The data from International agency for Research on Cancer
shows the number of new cancer cases occurred in China in 2018 is 4285033 (see
Table 3), and the number of prevalent cases, in the last 5-years is 7827961 (
Globocan 2018).
Table 3. Cancer population fact sheets of China 2018

Given that the increase of the cancer population is steep, the obvious changing in
data was impossible to be neglected by the company. On the other aspect, the old
cancer product cannot meet the increasing needs of the market. Thus, the necessity
to generate ideas and draw up plans for a new cancer insurance development was
confirmed.
Data which lead to idea generation can be raw. The raw data will be processed in
the product development for further use. However, data is not the only factor which
brings about idea generation, personal knowledge and experience can also generate
40

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

idea. Experienced managers might be sensitive about the changing and trend of
market and environment, hence they probably work out a plan and implement in
advance. In this situation, personal knowledge creates ideas, then relevant data is
needed to review the feasibility of the idea (Interview with Q, 11.7.2018),
Ideas of a new product might be generated by the general manager because the
individual knows the needs of both company and market, the most important point
is that, the individual has the right and sufficient resources to generate an idea and
achieve it. Through the data provided by core departments, such as marketing and
actuarial department, the idea will be shaped and transferred into a plan.

5.4.2 Feasibility assessing
If the ideas of new products are accepted by the general manager, a review of the
feasibility of development is required. In this phase, more types of data are needed
and involved. Raw data is processed, classified and analysed for decision making.
Compared to an enhanced and repriced product, the feasibility review and product
concept generation of a brand-new product consumes more time and resources.
Additional data and information are also required. A product which is updated from
a previous version has generated concept and feasibility review from the original
version as reference. The method of review for upgrading existing products only
involves assessing and testing the content of previous terms using current data and
information. The main bundle product Ping An Luck is an appropriate example here.
The main content of feasibility check for the bundle are re-setting premium
according to the analysed data and adding critical illness types to the insurance’s
coverage. However, a tremendous amount of work has been done to access the
feasibility when the company determined to design and launch bundle as the main
product.

The primal feasibility assess requires to determine which types of

insurances are needed by the market, then design and develop determined
insurances respectively. Then actuaries built up primary mathematical models and
provide a premium scope. In addition, prerequisite like a long-term overall market
survey is imperative (Interview with Q, 11.7.2018).
41

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

Another example to explain the feasibility assessing is the cancer insurance
mentioned above. The motivation of developing new cancer insurance is that the
needs from the customers were increased while the old product can no longer meet
current demand because the premium of the old cancer insurance was high, and the
insurance amount was not enough to cover medical expenses of cancer curing.
Therefore, the feasibility of new cancer insurance development is reducing the
premium and increasing the insurance amount.

According to the feasibility,

actuaries re-calculated new premium and new insurance amount (Interview with Q,
11.7.2018).
If the result of data analysis shows the feasibility of development, the development
process will move to the next stage, product planning and design. If the feasibility
is low or null, the development plan will be ceased or delayed.
5.4.3 Product planning formation
Product plan formation is the process to design insurance policies. Product
development department takes the main responsibility to conduct the planning
work. Due to the fact that specific types of data and information are required, the
department needs to communicate and corporate with the marketing department,
actuarial departments and other subsidiaries for data exchange and collection. For
instance, market survey reports from the market department indicate that the
demands of the customer are fluctuating, results of actuarial calculation suggest that
the premiums of current products are above the average prices, therefore, adjusting
of premiums is urgent. Necessary data and information are depended on the type of
product. For instance, the illness population amount, types of illness and other
environmental or social data is required in health insurance of the bundle, and
mortality table is critical in life insurance of the bundle. Marketing data is needed in
all types of product development because it reflects the demand of customer and
some business state of the industry and competitors. In old product upgrading and
enhancement, all data of old products is required to review for a redesign. Once data

42

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

is processed completely, a report will be made and submitted to the general
manager, then general manager decides if to approve and implement it.
5.4.4 Product development
Insurance terms design, underwriting design, and actuary are the main content of
product development. The whole development process is managed as a project.
Different departments work and coordinate together to execute the plan until the
project is completed. In brief, the insurance term design is the process to determine
content and coverage. The critical illness insurance in the bundle product is used to
illustrate how this process works.
The motivation to design critical illness insurance is to meet the market need by
covering the type of critical illness as much as possible. Taking all critical illness
types into the insurance’s coverage is inadvisable because both research and
development expenditure and compensation will be costly. The aim of developing
a new product is profit gaining, thus, only illness with high prevalence are taken into
the coverage. Through the relevant data and information about illness, the product
development confirmed that dozens of illnesses are applicable in the coverage. The
types of heavy critical illness are malignant tumour, malignant mole, liver failure,
serious brain injury, serious motor neuron illness and other illnesses. The types of
minor critical illness include early malignant lesions, carcinoma in situ, skin cancer,
single limb loss, moderate coma, cerebral haemangioma, visual impairment, hearing
loss. Moreover, the illness insurance also provides compensation to major surgery
as heart valve surgery, aortic surgery, craniotomy, coronary artery bypass surgery,
and other few types of surgeries (Interview with Q, 11.7.2018).
Compensation terms and condition design is another key content in insurance
product development because they define detail of compensation. In the interview
with Li, the compensation content of life insurance in the bundle is introduced. The
table below is an insurance payment plan for a 30-year-old male white collar, he sets
insurance amount of every term by his individual choice. The insurance amount of
life insurance is 310000 RMB, this means his beneficiary will receive 310000 RMB
43

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

as compensation if he dies. As mentioned, insurance amount of the critical illness
insurance must be lower than that the life insurance, hence the insurance amount of
critical illness can be set as any amount which is under 310000 RMB.
If the customer suffers from critical illness in the future, and he receives 100% of
the critical illness compensation, which is 300000 RMB, then the life insurance
amount is reduced to 10000 RMB because the compensation is taken from life
insurance amount. This means, that when he dies, the beneficiary will only receive
10000 RMB. However, the remained insurance amount can still provide protection
to the customer, because malignant tumour insurance, accident insurance and
accidental medical treatment insurance in the combination are still valid. If the
insurance amount of life insurance is equal to the critical illness insurance, when the
customer receives full amount of compensation, the same amount of insurance
amount is removed from life insurance. It means the insurance amount of the main
insurance is reduced to 0. Then the insurance contract ends, and the customer loose
protection from other insurances in the combination (Interview with Li, 16.8.2018).

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

A favourable compensation condition to the customer stimulates their desire to
purchase the product. Given that, beneficial terms to a customer are designed in
critical illness insurance in the bundle. A beneficiary can claim for minor critical
illness three times, and the compensation amount is 20% of critical insurance
amount each time the insured suffers a specific minor illness in the coverage.
Therefore, the beneficiary can receive 60% of critical insurance amount in total, and
the compensation of minor illness is not linked with the main insurance amount. For
instance, the insurance amount of critical illness insurance is 300000 RMB, a
customer can receive 180000 RMB in total for minor critical illness, and the
beneficiary can still receive 300000 RMB if the insured suffers a heavy critical
illness. Moreover, unlike heavy critical illness, the compensation of minor illness is
not taken from the main insurance amount.
Another beneficial term to the customer is an exemption. It is a common term in life
and health insurance, the term provides a huge advantage to insureds and
policyholders. The exemption target can be both insureds and policyholders, it is
based on the requirement of insurance condition. The condition exemption term in
the bundle is that if insureds suffer from a heavy or minor critical illness for the first
time, the policyholder need no longer to pay the premium in the remaining payment
period, and other terms of the insurance remain valid until the end of the contract.
If a payment period of a customer is 20 year, and the insured suffer a critical illness
in the first year after sign the contract, the policyholder no longer need to pay for
the premium in the next 19 years, and the insured can still claim for compensation
of other insurance terms in the bundle.
There are some terms set to ensure the benefit of the company also, such as
deductible amount setting. Deductible amount is stipulated by the company in some
health insurance products. Deductible means the minimum amount of the insurance
benefits; the insurance company will not pay if the medical cost of insureds is lower
than the minimum amount of the insurance benefits. (Interview with W 4.7.2018)

45

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

5.4.5 Underwriting condition design
Underwriting condition design is associated directly with the risks, appropriate
underwriting condition prevent possible loss of the company. It sets limitation to
the customer with high risks. In the different types of insurance products, the
underwriting conditions are different (Interview with Q, 11.7.2018). Required
information and data in underwriting condition design are risk rates such as death
rate in every age, risk rate in various occupations, risk of illness, risks in different
region, environment, etc. Data of risk rate and risk are gathered from channels of
big data and statistic. Then actuaries calculate the premiums in different risk
condition based on the risk rates.
Common underwriting limitations in life and health insurance are age, profession
and health state. Age is a critical underwriting condition. Age limitation is set in all
life insurance and premium of life insurance increase with age. A customer can’t be
underwritten if age dose not match with the age requirement of insurance. For
instance, the upper age limitation of the bundle is 55 for both male and female, and
the premium increase with the age of the insureds. Table 4 shows that an insured
31 years-old male’s yearly payment is 13,877.45 RMB if the individual decides that
the insurance amount of the bundle is 310000 RMB. One shares the same state with
the insured but older persons need to pay more than the yearly payment. People
who are over 55 is not allowed to underwrite and purchase the bundle. According
to the actuary calculation result, people over 55 years old have high risks. The high
risk probably causes loss of the product (Interview with Q, 11.7.2018).
Profession and health state are also essential factors which influence underwriting.
Customers with high risks professions and poor health state can also be
underwritten, but they need to pay an extra premium and submit specific
certificates which insurers required to ensure that they are qualified to underwrite.
Overall, the price of the premium depends on the risk of the customer. The premium
gap between the customer with high risk and low risk is enormous, in some
condition, customers with high risks need to pay several times of premium than low46

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

risk customers. Hence, underwriting condition is not only limitation but also an
advantage to the customer with less risk.

5.4.6 Actuary
In the interview, the actuary indicates that actuarial is a work to analyse, evaluate,
and manage future risks in various economic activities based on the basic principles
of economics, using various scientific and effective methods such as modern
mathematics, statistics, finance, and law. It is the foundation of the contemporary
insurance industry, and it is applied in finance and investment field also (Interview
with Li, 16.8.2018).
Risk control is the primary responsibility of the actuary. One of the most important
methods to control risk is pricing reasonable premium to insurance. Sufficient
premium from the customer can ensure the profitability of insurance companies and
help to reduce risk to some extent. In addition to calculating the premium for
insurance products, actuaries also take responsibilities for many aspects, like
researching the insurance laws for insurance accidents, the distribution law of
insurance accident losses, the average loss of insurance insurers and their
distribution rules, insurance rates and liability reserves, insurance company
solvency and other insurance specific issues. Actuaries need to calculate the basic
risk rate and extra risk rate. For example, an individual might not be underwritten
by paying a standard premium because his or her risks are relatively higher than
common. To be underwritten, the individual must pay a higher premium than the
standard. Therefore, extra rates and premiums needed to be calculated (Dickson,
Hardy & Waters, 2009).
The actuaries’ take responsibilities for assessing, quantifying, managing and
monitoring the risks inherent in insurance products, pension schemes and other
financial transactions that provide benefits contingent on uncertain future financial
events. In order to do this, they need to be able to build, test, implement and
interpret models to project and evaluate the future asset and liability cash flows

47

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

under a range of possible assumptions for the coming experience. In the insurance
industry, actuaries participate in product development and financial management.
In product development, actuaries design new insurance clauses based on the
demand of the market. Premium pricing and insurance rate calculation is a core part
of insurance product development, it is also the major job of actuaries. Actuaries
need to use past life statistics, current bank interest rates and expense rates, to
determine the price of the policy. Also, they need to calculate the reserve of new
product and cash value of insurance policy. Insurance reserves are the fund
insurance company prepare for future compensation. In order to ensure insurance
company will perform insurance compensation or payment obligations as promised,
a certain number of funds must be prepared to correspond to the legal liability or
business-specific needs. The reserves are drawn from premium income or surplus.
(Interview with Li, 16.8.2018).
In addition to developing new products, actuaries also audit and evaluate existing
products and their clauses. The purpose is to determine whether the existing clauses
can still satisfy and meet the demand of customer. If the answer is negative, then
premium and coverage must be adjusted to remain competitiveness of the products.
Data analysts and actuaries are similar, and both are involved in data analysis
processes. Data analysts and actuaries share the same skill sets and work content,
they use mathematical and statistical techniques to process data and report the
result. However, they differ in the work content. The data processed by data
analysts are in a wide scope, the types of data are various, while actuaries only need
to analyse data which relate to insurance policies, risks and possible losses
associated with accidents. In addition, actuaries require the analysis results to set
premium price.
Actuaries are in charge of financial management as review the company’s annual
financial report; evaluate the company's investments to ensure the safety and
profitability of the investment; participate in the company's development plan,
provide effective data support and professional advice for the company's future
48

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

economic decisions. This means actuaries know clearly how many profits the
insurer needs to maintain business. Hence, another main job of actuaries is premium
setting. Premium is variable in most life and health insurance product. In premium
pricing, actuaries calculate not a fixed price but a list of prices instead. The reason is
that every customer is unique, and the condition of every customer is unique also.
The factors used to distinguish the difference of customer include age, career, health
condition, living place. In insurance, these elements are risks, and the premium
varies according to risks. Age is the main risk factor in insurance. For example,
although a 30-year old male has the same health condition, job and accommodation
environment as a 55-year old male, if they select the same health insurance product,
the 55-year old male need to pay extra premium than the 30-year old male because
he has higher accident and disease risk than the 30-year old male. If the premium is
fixed, customers with low risks need to pay more, they probably chose to give up the
product; or customers with higher risks can pay less, insurance companies transfer
all risks from them, the consequence is the cost increasing (Interview with D,
3.8.2018). To gain profits and decrease costs, actuaries must set premium
accurately, or predict the risks accurately. Modern data mining technology is applied
in the company to improve predictive accuracy. Ping An has partitioned the
databases into small groups according to the characteristics of the data. The data of
each group can be queried, analysed and modelled. Database partition is conducted
by using variables associated with risk factors, profits, or behaviours. Partition
based on the variables can provide apparent relationship and contrast of data
analysis. Consequently, the risks are easier to predict, as well as the possibility of
claim (Interview with D, 3.8.2018).

5.4.7 Feedback from the market
Results tracking is the most direct and effective way to receive feedback from
customer. In order to collect the feedback information, service personnel will
contact customer through telephone after underwriting to conduct satisfaction
survey. In addition, sales agent is able to contact with customer to collect and record
more specific feedback information. The feedback result is analysed later to verify
the quality of products. The result is also a critical reference to product upgrade.
49

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

Important data required to upgrade the Ping An Luck 18 is collected from the
feedback of its previous version.

6 REQUIRED DATA AND IT TOOLS IN LIFE AND HEALTH
INSURANCE DEVELOPMENT
Through the analysis of the product bundle and interviews, main data and
information needed in life and insurance product development are determined.

6.1 Required data and information
6.1.1 Market survey
Market demand is the motivation for product development. In a mature insurance
market, financial insurance is commonly the most profitable product to insurers.
However, native insurance market in China is immature, life and health insurance
are source of revenue for the Chinese insurers. Hence, Ping An and other large
Chinese insurers focus on the sales and development of life and health insurance.
There is a wide variety of life and health insurance products, multiple insurances
should be purchased if customer need a comprehensive protection. Ping An’s
market survey indicates that: life insurance is the best-selling product in the Chinese
market; in recent years, with the increasing incidence rate of critical illness, such as
cancer and tumour, health insurance has grown in popularity. Meanwhile, the
increase of private cars in China lead more traffic accidents in recent years, hence
the sales of accident insurance have arisen. (Interview with J, 16.7.2018)
Through the survey, the company realised that life, health and accident insurances
will prevail in the market steadily and customers prefer to purchase comprehensive
insurance bundle instead of purchase multiple insurance products separately. The
reason for this preference is defined, which is customer believe that being
underwritten and evaluated for every single insurance before purchasing is timeconsuming and complex. However, customer only need to be underwritten and
evaluated for only one time if they purchase bundle products, and the premium of
bundle is relatively low when contrast to multiple independent insurance products.

51

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

Market survey gives key information in product development, it gives the direction
to a company’s business. Market survey not only collect information from market,
but also from competitors. By understanding competitors’ products, the company
can identify the market niche and fill the gap by provide unprecedented product into
the market.

6.1.2 Public statistics and data
Development of life and health insurance requires professional data in actuarial. The
most critical data in life insurance development is the life table. The table shows the
probability a person of that age will die before his or her next birthday. The table
fully reflects the law of life and death of a certain group of people from birth to death.
(Interview with C, 30.7.2018) Statistics can be calculated and derived by applying
the probability and statistical formula, such as life expectancy at different ages,
proportion of people in specific age which still alive, longevity possibility of people
in a specific age.
In order to price insurance products and ensure that insurance companies retain
sufficient reserve to maintain solvency, actuaries must predict future insured events
such as death, illness and disability. To do this, the actuary developed a
mathematical model for the cause, amount, and timing of these events. By studying
the incidence and severity of events in the past, actuaries expect to understand the
causes and law of these events over time, and based on the law, actuaries can
calculate the when these events occur again in future, and how many times these
events will occur. For instance, current life expectancy increased continuously, and
based on the situation, actuaries need to know whether life expectancy will continue
to increase in the future. The possibility or expectation are usually represented in
percentage. It shows the number of events that occur in a specific population based
on age or other relevant demographic characteristics. (Interview with C, 30.7.2018)
According to the life table and relevant statistics, actuaries calculate the risk rates in
each age. Basically, higher age means higher risk. Actuaries of the company
calculated that Ping An Luck 18 is profitable if consumer’ age range is from 18 to 55.
52

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

Teenage, children under 18 years old and adult over 55 years old have high risks
which can cause direct loss to company because more capitals must be prepared to
ensure the solvency and more claims may occur.

6.1.3 Disease data
The coverage of the last edition of critical illness insurance includes 80 types of
illness, and current critical illness insurance cover 100 types of illness. The coverage
range has increased due to the data shows incidence rates of some illnesses grown
during past years. In addition, record and data of other Ping An’s illness insurances
reflect that claims number for some illnesses were not in the coverage in old Ping
An Luck has increased last year. Therefore, more illnesses were added into the
coverage of the critical illness insurance.
Disease database is a data management and analysis system which classifies
diseases by type. Data are normalised and stored in the system for research use.
The company corporates with an official institution and some companies which
provide relevant public disease data. Through the disease analysis statistical
database, all cases accumulated in the for past many years can be analysed to obtain
a statistical result. The profession database technology and scientific classification
methods are used to summarise the disease knowledge system, thus the qualities of
collected data, research resources and calculated statistical results are high. The
results and data provided by these systems can reflect the regional and national
disease situation in time realistically, and the result is a critical factor which
influences the design of health insurance (Interview with C, 30.7.2018).
The type of disease is various, in order to manage the disease data, case of different
kinds of illnesses are recorded and classified. Partition is used in a disease database
system to build minor database to store specific illness cases. The common disease
databases are liver cancer database, diabetes database, gallbladder cancer database,
thyroid disease database, pancreatic cancer database, heart surgery database,
tumour chemotherapy database, and respiratory disease database. Through those
databases, the actual situation of each disease can be understood. The data shows
53

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

the number of real cases, the growth rate of disease and other critical information
which are used in product development. However, the data in disease databases is
not only the amount of case, but also specific data as age gender and other basic
information of patients. The most important is data about the treatment and
relevant costs can be gathered. Based on it, the average cost in a specific disease can
be calculated, and results are very useful to actuaries. Actuaries can reference the
average cost in premium and insurance amount pricing. (Interview with C,
30.7.2018)

6.1.4 Traffic accident rate
The traffic accident rate is a core index in accident insurance development. The rate
is the relative relationship between the number of traffic accidents in the country or
a certain region (the number of casualties and deaths) and the number of people in
the country in a period. The relevant statistics are accounted, record and issued by
official institutions. In addition, relevant data can be gathered from historical claims
and sales records. The car insurance of Ping An seized Chinese market stably for
years, the sales volume is huge. Through the information of customer and claim
record, the company can obtain information like a significant difference in driving
behaviour between male and female drivers. Female drivers cause fewer accidents,
hence the premium is relatively lower than male drivers. The data also shows that
education and age influence driving behaviour greatly. Moreover, a detailed result
like risks of driver in different age and gender can be calculated. Based on the result,
actuaries can price accurate and reasonable premium for drivers in a different
situation (Interview with D, 3.8.2018).
The sales and claim data show both death and casualty rates have grown in past
years due to the claim number increased. The claims record shows the costs that the
customers spend on treatment after an accident. The cost consists of treatment cost,
nursing expenses, compensation for lost income, rehabilitation cost. Ping An
realised that the cost had increased, and the original insurance amount of accident
insurance can no longer meet the demand and cover the costs of treatment. Thus,
the insurance amount was recalculated in the new edition of accident insurance.
54

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

6.1.5 Other data
Apart from the 4 types of data above, insurers need data like customer data, sales
data, operation data, product data, finance data and other data from both internal
and external. However, all the data insurers need in developing new product has
huge volume, and the forms of these types of data differ from each other. Thus,
professional tools like big data analysis, data mining, AI are used to process the data
analysis to obtain accurate and correct results for decision-making.

6.2 IT used in in life and health insurance product development
6.2.1 Big data solutions
The company has applied big data solutions for years, and up until now, the
company established one of the largest big data platforms among Chinese financial
institutions. In the interview, C introduced that in 2017, over 900 million credit
inquiries were processed, and compares to other insurers, this volume is really huge
and stupendous (Interview with C, 30.7.2018). On the big data platform, the
company has built a strong network of ecosystems and applied the big data
technology to areas such as financial services, health care, auto services. One of the
most important functions of the platform is to collect customers’ information from
different information channels. With the upgrade of the platform, functions like
synchronisation service and real-time data gathering are achieved to provide
efficiency. Through the platform and services, customers’ information can be
uploaded immediately (Interview with C, 30.7.2018).
In the development of the insurance company, massive data is accumulated and
gathered. In the past years, the company’s insurance business has grown stably, and
the number of new customers has increased rapidly. As a consequent of it, the
volume of data increased, and extra data storage space was required. Therefore,
Ping An applied big data solution to store and manage data systematically. The
company realised also that with the expansion of business, more data about the
society, market and other industries are required for the analysis to make the right
decisions to remain competitive, and the most important is that the type of the data
is different (Interview with C, 30.7.2018). For that reason, the insurer needs a
55

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

powerful data storage platform that provides by big data technics to store and
process any type of data it collects for the use of product development.
Insurers are required to implement internal processes and procedures to ensure the
suitability, completeness and accuracy of the data used within this framework. To
ensure the quality of data which is upload from operational systems, the primary
source of the data is refined and catalogued. Incorrect, inaccurate, and other types
of bad data can cause serious problems in data analysis. Bad data affect the accuracy
of data analysis result, and data analysis result is the crucial basis of decision
making. Therefore, data should be made available and accurate for use by managers
and other business professionals for data mining, online analytical processing,
market research and decision support (O’Brien & Markas, 2010). The quality of data
associates directly with data report and decision-making, and some data analysis
result is the basic of insurance product development and decision-making.
6.2.2 Artificial intelligence
The company has established comprehensive scenarios of AI applications such as
smart perception, prediction, risk management, and services to ensure the
accuracies of data analysis results. The company’s AI and deep learning technologies
have reached world-leading levels. In disease forecasting, the company has achieved
precision rates of over 90% for influenza and hand, foot and mouth disease and 92%
for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease respectively. The medical image reading
technology ranked first in lung nodule detection and false positive reduction with
precision rates of 95.1% and 96.8% respectively according to test results of Lung
Nodule Analysis (LUNA), an international authoritative assessment in the medical
imaging field (Annual Report, 2017). With the exception of forecasting, another
major function of AI used in the company is making premium pricing accurate.
At present, scientific and effective differentiated pricing methods are required by
Chinese insurers. The reason is some Chinese insurers adopt follow-up strategy in
product pricing and conduct virulent price competition. Hence, premium pricing is
one of the bottlenecks which restrict the development of the Chinese insurance
industry. To break the bottlenecks, the company applied the AI technics to make
56

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

premium pricing. The company combines the necessary information of customers’
living habits, age, insurance experience and other essential information to explore
the insurance preferences of policyholders with AI technologies as machine learning
algorithm. In data analysis, the data is used to build mathematical models, through
the models, critical results like risk rates, possible compensation amount, death or
accident rates are calculated. Then the calculated results will be used in machine
learning algorithms to forecast the future risks, consequently, the accurateness of
premium pricing is increased (Interview with C, 31.7.2018). With AI and actuary
technologies, the company can calculate the differentiated price and recommend
appropriate insurance products to every single customer after analysis.
Differentiated pricing means that companies provide products and services to
customer with different price. Customers can adjust the insurance amount and
premium which calculated according to their economic situation. Therefore, both
customers who require products with full protection with higher price and
customers who need only basic protection can be satisfied at the same time.
The insurer also applies machine learning solution to learn from historical business
data over the years as a training process. Through the learning, the system can
analyse and acquire the information in different business scenario. It is possible by
machine learning algorithms that review every single customer’s data and provide
high-customised insurance products to them after analysis.

6.2.3 Business intelligence
The company applies business intelligence mainly for multidimensional data
analysis and data integration. Operational systems were installed in the core
departments in Ping An such sales, marketing, or customer relationship
management department, and separated systems are built for each (Interview with
C 31.7.2018). However, data is stored or distributed in different data systems and
partition within the company, and the data can’t be processed without integration.
In this situation, business intelligence methods are used to seek the valuable data
from the systems and partition, then integrate the data with different form or
structure (Interview with C, 3.8.2018). For instance, customers’ data is stored in an
57

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

independent partition according to the category. Valuable customers are located,
and their data is stored in a unique partition for analysing (Wang and Fu, 2005).
Data integration combines data from multiple data sources and stores them in a
unified form. The process of building a data warehouse is called data integration.
Several data integration methods are used by the company in data pre-processing
to get a more accurate analysis of the results. Data grouping, statistics calculation,
basic statistical graphs drawing, data value conversion, and data normalisation is
the necessary steps in data pre-processing. Those help the insurer to master the
distribution characteristics of data, which is the basis for further analysis and
modelling. In addition, a large amount of historical data was accumulated and stored
separately within different traditional information systems, and it affected the
efficiency of data utilisation because the data forms are not uniform and old data
analysis system does not support data integration. The development of BI is based
on data integration, which requires a certain volume of data. The disadvantage of
traditional information systems emerged with the increasing of both volume and
type of data in life and health insurance industry. The traditional information and
business systems are designed for dealing with separate transaction process, multilevel analysis and statistics is beyond the ability of the systems. Business intelligence
can obtain various types of customers’ data and business data from traditional
business systems, thereby establishing a multi-level analysis system, and translate
it into commercially meaningful knowledge for insurer (Xu, Zhang & Jiang, 2005).
Integrated and structured data is analysed using the OLAP solution. Through the
analysis, the value of data is revealed and used as a reference for decision-making.
The insurance product development requires comprehensive information from
different aspects. Using the OLAP solution, data in multiple dimension is analysed,
which means it reveals relationships between different dimensions. For instance,
the insurer retrieves the sales status of a life insurance product in Beijing last year.
In this situation, dimension includes time and location, if one dimension is missing,
such as location, the insurer receives the sales status of whole country, and the
retrieval result is not accurate enough for decision-making (Interview with C,
3.8.2018).
58

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

6.2.4 Data mining
Markets change over time, as well as the products which customers need. It is critical
that insurers identify and monitor the change of customer’s demands, prospect and
trend of insurance and the adjustment of policies. Data mining supports the
monitoring of the change of data, and the change of data always reflects a shift in
reality. Through data mining, demand change of the customer can be realised in a
short time. The company attaches importance to the change of market and
customer, it responds quickly to the changes. The company focuses on modifying old
products and designing new products to meet the changing demand of customer as
soon as possible (Interview with D, 3.8.2018).
Insurance companies need to know what policies are profitable in the future to cope
with the changes in demand and market. For example, elevator accidents frequently
happened in China in the past few years. Not like other accidents, elevator accident
was out of compensation scope of accident insurance products. The elevator
accidents trigged the concerns of customers, through data mining, the company
realised the concerns of customers and added the elevator accident into
compensation term in its main accident insurance before its competitors in 2018.
Then the new clause attracted the attention of consumer, and it is the unique selling
proposition of the product.
Data mining does not only provide the answers to questions such as what the change
in the market is, what is the most profitable product and policy currently, but it also
generates new questions for analysts and decision-makers. The questions are, after
data analysis of potential products, which product is the most profitable? Which has
the lowest risk or highest risk rate in market? Which will seize the most prominent
market? With further analysis, all questions will be answered, the most optimised
decision will be made, and the most profitable product will be selected. (Interview
with D, 3.8.2018) However, parts of data relate to personal and private information,
confidential, legal and ethical issues may cause (Sapsford & Jupp, 2017). The
company tries to avoid the issues in data collection and data mining and respect for

59

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

underrepresented social groups and attempts made to avoid their further social
exclusion.
6.2.5 Mobile application and data collection
The company focuses on the application of artificial intelligence as well as big data.
AI is applied in data analysis, and it is also developed for customer data collection
and for customer self-service. The company developed a mobile application for its
users, through the application, users can purchase about more than 80% of products
from the company by using the application. The whole process of underwriting can
be implemented by users without the help by salespersons (Interview with C,
31.7.2018). If a user has purchased any products and uploaded personal
information in the past, his or her historical data is recorded. The historical data
include personal information and transaction record. The important information in
transaction record includes the amount of premium and types of products. The
amount of premium and types of products purchased reflect the demand and
positioning of customers. Moreover, before underwriting, the illness history and
current health state are required to upload, in this condition, illness data of
customers are collected for disease forecasting. To reach the qualification of
underwriting, users must upload personal information and the information is stored
for future use.

7 DISCUSSION
The rapid development of the Internet led to IT expanding by insurers. Insurers realised

the importance of data and started to collect and analysis data with advanced and
sophisticated IT solutions since 1980 (Clark & Libarikian, 2014). Insurers can
understand more from data analysis results using the advance analytical techniques,
thus decision-making can be enhanced. However, the role of insurance is still
understanding the risk and compensating for policy holders’ losses. Today, by
applying advanced IT solutions, more types of data can be collected and analysed.
For instance, insurers can only collect limited information about customers’ habits
and lifestyles, such as basic income situation, personal level of consumption,
working place. Now, in the era of digitalisation and big data, insurers can predict
accurate market trends and find the questions and answers that insurers did not
know before.

7.1 Information required in life and health insurance product development.
Through the interviews and analysis of the main product, the information that are
require and used in the product development is introduced. The source of data
insurers need mainly comes from market survey, public statistics and other data
that links with customers, market and business. In life and health insurance product
development, data that reflect the regional or national health status is crucial. There
are two types of data which can indicate the health status. The first type is data as
disease rate that reflects the health state directly. The second type of data that gives
information of health status indirectly as living and purchasing habits, marital
status, or even food consumption of customers and market. The data is gathered
from both internal and external. Internal data can be queried directly from the
databases of the company. External data consists of public datasets and online data.
Open data from scientific research institutions, enterprises, and governments is
available to the company. Besides, the insurer also gathers free online data or
purchase data from cooperating data providers.

7.2 IT solution used in life and health insurance product development
61

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

The IT solutions play a major role in life and health insurance product development
from data collection to data analysis. It contributes to generate key information or
knowledge which is the important basis that guides the decision-making through
the whole development process. Based on the data collected from the interviewees
and the analysis of the content, interviewees introduce that big data, BI, AI and data
mining are the main IT solution Ping An used in insurance product development.
Insurance product development requires knowledge and information as reference,
which are extracted from relevant data analysis. The IT solutions impact insurance
industry in many aspects. On the rapid development of both hardware and software
of IT and internet, insurer realised that to remain competitive, a bold change must
be made. Insurers used to focus more on products instead of customers, customers’
demands were not fully considered, and customers were not highly involved in
product development. To solve the problem, IT solutions were used to build a better
understanding of customers and their needs.
Finding 1. The IT solutions lead a better understanding to customers and affect
insurance product development.
Johne (1993) argues that the competition is then to be more aggressive in future.
Insures must revise the traditional way of the product development to give a distinct
competitive advantage. Providing high-customised insurance product is a main
trend in the insurance industry. Because of the emergence of customised products,
customers are no longer forced to accept the insurance term that provide no benefit.
The change brought benefit to both insurers and customers, the insurance business
was expanded, and customers’ benefits were protected. Ping An works on
developing customised product for years. Through IT solutions as BI and data
mining, the company can locate and attract valuable customers. The valuable
customers are located and are partitioned in a group. Data in the group is integrated
and analysed to understand the specific demand and expectation. After that
customised product is designed according to customers’ needs. Ping An emphasis
on information as customers’ education, jobs or social position, due to the

62

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

information tells the financial states of them.

Then actuaries set reasonable

premium based on the states.

Finding 2. In the big data context, the way to collect customers’ information is
changed.
IT brings benefit to insurer, in the context of big data, information channel of the
company has become more extensive. Habart and Janssen (2017) explain that big
data platform is one of the most innovative creation in the big data era. Ping An built
one of the largest big data platform in Chinese insurance industry. The platform
links with the company’s information system and applications. The platform is used
by both the company and customers, and it also allows the interaction between the
company and its customers. Customers can purchase insurances, claim, and request
services from the platform. When customers purchase and underwrite insurance on
the platform, their personal information is uploaded into the platform. Thus, it is one
of the most efficient way to collect customers’ information for Ping An. AI techniques
are also used in the platform to enhance the user experience and satisfaction. The
AI analyses customers’ needs and recommend appropriate insurance products to
customers. Then AI calculates premium according to customers’ states. Due to
individual differences, customers have different health state and risks. Therefore,
the premium must be calculated independently for every single customer by AI.

Finding 3. Multiple IT solutions are used to meet different information needs.
Throughout the study of how IT solutions work in product development, a
conclusion is reached. That is the solution used by the company share many
common grounds. They all contribute to decision-making, and own abilities to
process data, and they all conduce to the design of high-customised products.
However, the use of them are different. Data analysis of BI solution data analysis not
only enables decision-making but also involves an active part in the development of
strategies and methods that make sure the success of organisations, whereas big
63

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

data solution focus on more about data and data processing, and data mining
solution focus pattern analysis of data. BI solution can only process structured and
historical data while big data solutions can deal with both structured and
unstructured, and real-time data. Therefore, those IT solutions needs to be
synchronised and work together to satisfy multiple information needs of insurers.

Finding 4. Challenges of IT solution.
The interviewee “C” illustrated that development of China’s insurance industry and
IT started relatively late than Western countries. One of the biggest gaps between
Chinese and Western insures is the IT application in insurance business. Western
insurers are more experienced in informatisation, to catch up with them, Chinese
insurers have to invest more on both software and hardware. Big data, BI, AI and
data mining solutions require a huge cost, and more costs is needed to maintain the
system (Interview with C, 30.7.2018). Although the benefit of applying those
solutions is huge, but insurers need to consider the cost-efficiency, the cost is one
critical challenge of using IT solutions. Professionalism is another challenge of IT
solution. All those solutions require professionals to implement, BI requires tools
as OLAP and warehousing, Big data solution requires tools like Hadoop and Hive,
hence insurers needs professional with different IT skills. Although the machine
learning can help to reduce the labour-intensive in IT, but machine learning
algorithm is one of the most complicated work that needs high-skilful technicians
and experts (Xu, Zhang & Jiang, 2005). Thus, insurers must consider how to recruit,
cultivate or retain the professionals. Complexity of data analysis is the third
challenge that insurers facing. The volume of data will remain increasing, which
create more difficulties in data mining and extracting since not all data can make
value for decision-making. With the increasing of data volume, the data analysis will
be more labour-consuming or time-consuming. Customers privacy is also the
challenge of IT, it causes many concerns to customer. Customer is pleased with AI
since, it improvs customers’ buying experience through high-customised products
after data analysing of their personal data. However, almost customers are
displeased with violation of personal privacy. With the development of IT solutions,
64

Yu Qin: The use of IT in life and health insurance product development

more customers information is acquired by insurers (Benno, 2018). Although
collecting information from customers is the rights of insurer in underwriting, but
they need to keep the balance between customers’ privacy and the benefit from
customers’ information.

65

8 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
The thesis presents the data analysis process in insurance product development and
the explains required information needed in the product development with the
focus on the big data analytics. The development process of Ping An life and
insurance company is analysed to provide the results. As one of the largest
insurance company in China, Ping An shows its advantage and expertise in its
business capability. The whole process of product development is professional and
standardised in Chinese insurance industry. Thus, the research result can be
referenced by other Chinese insurance companies to review their information using
and information technology application in product development.
However, the limitation of the research is obvious. The author of this thesis believes
the research can only be applied to Chinese life and insurance company. On the one
hand, the difference in medical and insurance system between China and other
countries is huge, thus, the gap in product design is huge also. On the other hand,
the Chinese insurance industry had started late compares to the Western insurance
industry. As such, Chinese market shows its immaturity when compares to Western
insurance market; and the need of consumers are different also. Therefore, the
difference in product development is existing between Chinese and foreign
countries.
Product development is one of the most critical and confidential processes in the
insurance industry. It influences risk, profit and loss of insurance company.
Therefore, the information and data related to product development provided by
interviewees are limited. Core data and information in product development is
confidential which is not allowed to be revealed and used. If more information and
data are permitted, more detailed research results may achieve.
