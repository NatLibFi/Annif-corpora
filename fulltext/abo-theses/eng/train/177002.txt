Introduction: The purpose of this thesis is to give an insight into which variables affect
legitimacy in conflict-torn states, with a special focus on the relationship between values and
services. The specified research question is what are the views of the population on
legitimacy in areas where counterinsurgency operations have been conducted?
Theoretical framework: Whether a political system is considered to be legitimate or not
inherently revolves around the values of the population. The values determine which services
are expected to be provided by the political system to the population. The different sources
of legitimacy presented account for the heterogeneity of the population. Instrumental types
of legitimacy include types of legitimacy based around the needs of the population.
Substantive legitimacy focus on the values of the population. The heterogeneity of the
population is ever more important to consider in the context of conflict-torn spaces and when
conducting counterinsurgency operations.
Methodology: A repeated cross-sectional study using case study design was chosen. The
data was collected by Böhnke et al. (2017) during the years of 2007 to 2015 and the total
number of respondents was 12,428. Survey questions were operationalized according to the
different sources of legitimacy.
Results: Input legitimacy results show a strong involvement of societal institutions in
decision-making. Input on a governmental level is relatively important, but the trend has
remained stagnant over time. Output legitimacy indicate an initial sharp improvement in
security which afterwards stagnates or even declines in 2011. Services provided by the
government are initially at low levels, but with a positive trend. Throughput legitimacy
indicate the importance of both patronage and societal institutions. Patronage is primarily
based around economic and military influence. External legitimacy results indicate sharp
changes. COIN forces and NGO:s are initially viewed in a very positive light. This changes
especially in the case of COIN forces over time, since they are viewed in a more negative
light later in the study. The norms and values of the respondents do not change considerably
over the scope of the study. Tradition is portrayed to be an important aspect of everyday life,
and a break from tradition results in negative consequences. However, a trend can be seen
that external actors are viewed to have a more negative impact on local customs. Patrons are
viewed as important even though the results show them to not be a large contributor of
services.
Conclusions: Pure types of instrumental legitimacy are more prone to change during a short
amount of time. Substantive types of legitimacy in combination with input and throughput
are much more stable since they are connected to population values. The results support the
theory that traditional societies cling to their values when experiencing a short-term increase
in improved living standards. Societal institutions remain more important than democratic
elections and political institutions.
Key words: Legitimacy; State-building; Counterinsurgency

1 Introduction
Nearly two decades after the 9/11 attacks and the start of the war on terror, young men
and women, who were not even born at the start of the conflicts, can participate legally
in the still ongoing fighting. It is difficult to regard the operations in the Middle East
as a success, considering the fact that the campaigns have resulted in the exertion of
unimaginable amounts of resources and the health and life of both innocents and guilty.
The explosive emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the
resurgence of the Taliban showed that none of the goals of the counterinsurgency
operations had been achieved. The goals were to provide security, which would entice
the creation of stable governments. Stability would in turn root out the conditions for
terrorism (ISAF see UNSCR 1510; MNF-I see UNSCR 1546). This raises the question
as to why legitimacy building actions and effective state-building are so difficult to
achieve in fragile and conflict-torn states?
The apparent lack of stable – and to some extent legitimate – governments in
Afghanistan and Iraq respectively is even further startling when considering the fact
that the military doctrine that shaped the two operations is especially adamant on the
importance of building legitimacy. The Counterinsurgency Field Manual – 3-24 (FM
3-24, 2006) – based on the initial years of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq –
modernized the U.S. armed forces into the 21st century regarding how to fight an
insurgency. The need for a new doctrine was apparent with the change of the conflicts
from conventional warfare to irregular warfare in the shape of insurgencies. The
importance of the doctrine was illustrated by the fact that it was unofficially used as
NATO’s doctrine for counterinsurgency operations and the fact that Britain went so
far as to completely adopt it as its own doctrine up until 2009 when Britain published
its own counterinsurgency doctrine (Nyhamar, 2009, 7-10). A further attest to the
importance of legitimacy can be seen with the doctrine’s new version called
Insurgencies and Countering Insurgencies – FM 3-24 from 2014. The new doctrine
contains lessons learned from 10 years of counterinsurgency conflicts, where
legitimacy is brought forward as a specifically important variable (FM 3-24, 2014).
Still, with both the means and the motivation through overwhelming resources and
operation goals which aim to create a legitimate government, the desired result would
not follow suit.
5

Kim Backström
This creates the question of what can explain this deviation between theory and
practice? Wiechnik (2012) claims that the failures to create stable governments in
Afghanistan and Iraq are grounded in a legitimacy problem. He pinpoints three
problems with the counterinsurgency manual: first, that the phenomenon of political
legitimacy was not sufficiently taken into account and handled in a constructive way,
second, that it was clearly visible that the doctrine was written when policy focus was
on spreading liberal democracy, also in stability operations, and third, that forcing the
incorporation of a democratic system too early on in an counterinsurgency operation
might have contra-productive consequences. Again, FM 3-24 (2006) clearly pinpoints
legitimacy as a main variable in counterinsurgency operations, and even more in the
updated version of the doctrine (FM 3-24, 2014), but at the same time neglects going
deeper into the theory of political legitimacy and instead leaving the explanation as
follows:
Legitimacy, the acceptance of an authority by a society, and control are the central issues in
insurgencies and counterinsurgencies. This is true however the U.S. enables a host nation to
defeat an insurgency. The population of a particular society determines who has legitimacy
to establish the rules and the government for that society. A population’s values and cultural
norms will determine who that society perceives as a legitimate authority. Both the
insurgency and the host nation attempt to control the population by some mixture of consent
and coercion.
FM 3-24, 2014, 1-27

While this definition highlights the importance of values and norms, it leaves room for
significant interpretation regarding the varying levels of importance of specific norms
and values. Wiechnik (2013) puts a larger focus on values when talking about what
builds legitimacy, and because of this claims that many of the methods presented in
FM 3-24 are useless since they focus on good governance. Also, the actual practices
of the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq – where US domestic political pressure was
put on spreading liberal democracy – had long-term negative effects in building
legitimate governments, which instead could have been democratized in the long run.
However, this goes against theories of deliberative democracy, as Bohman (1997, IX)
puts it: “Broadly defined, deliberative democracy refers to the idea that legitimate
lawmaking issues from the public deliberation of citizens”, which instead of focusing
on norms in general puts a focus on the levels of involvement that citizens have
6

Kim Backström
towards the government. A government is considered to have democratic legitimacy
if its citizens have insight into the decision-making process and can affect the decisions
made, but what level of involvement is expected among the citizens? Other theories
on legitimacy are also valid, which instead focus on the services provided by the
government or good governance, but what type and level of service is expected by the
citizens?
These conflicting points regarding legitimacy building highlight a need for further
studies within the subject area, while also being politically relevant with the conflicts
still going on. This implies a failure in either the doctrine’s view on legitimacy or the
implementation of the doctrine. The worst scenario consisting of a failure of both view
and implementation. This leads to the purpose of the thesis, which is to give an insight
into which variables affect the origin of legitimacy in conflict-torn states. Focus is
placed on the relationship between values and services. What norms and values are
perceived important by the population and to what importance regarding which
services are provided and at what level of quality? Also, to what degree do the citizens
feel that they need to have influence in the decision-making process? The objective of
this study is to test these variables and different theories against each other. Hopefully,
this results in an increased understanding of differing theories and an awareness of
factors that helps or hinders the advance of legitimacy.
This introductory chapter has worked as a way to give a primary demarcation of what
this thesis will take into account, while also motivating the societal relevance and
research value in the primary research question. Next follows a chapter regarding the
theoretical framework of relevant research regarding the thesis. The first part of
chapter 2 focuses on the phenomenon of state-building, by presenting both theories
and real-world examples. Focus then shifts to the concept of legitimacy and how it is
presented and the different views that exist regarding which variables affect changes
in legitimacy. The impact of norms and values is further investigated. Different
definitions are brought forward and discussed, both regarding legitimacy in itself and
other societal phenomenon that have a special impact on the conditions in conflict-torn
spaces, creating a deeper theoretical understanding of the subject area. Finally, the
chapter shifts focus towards relevant research about counterinsurgency as a
phenomenon. This gives an insight into what has been the focus in counterinsurgency
operations – e.g. in Afghanistan and Iraq after conventional warfare has ended with
7

Kim Backström
the occupation of the respective countries and the establishment of new regimes – and
what methods are used to achieve the goal of stability in conflict-torn states. After the
theoretical review, the research question will be specified from its current form: Why
are legitimacy building actions and effective state-building so difficult to achieve in
fragile and conflict-torn states? Chapter 3 discusses the choice of methodology for the
analysis of the thesis and how the analytic part of the study is conducted. Chapter 4
consists of an empiric analysis which is done to try to answer the specified research
question. Chapter 5 summarizes a closing discussion based on the entire thesis. Finally,
chapter 6 provides a summary of the whole thesis in Swedish.

2 Theoretical framework
This chapter focuses on previous research regarding state-building, legitimacy and
counterinsurgency theory that is relevant for the research question of the thesis.
Principally, general definitions are given regarding different societal phenomena, and
the definitions are also used to describe differing scientific theories, which then are
weighed against each other in the context of the research area. This is done to create a
context to the current scientific view regarding the different subjects and enable a
further demarcation of the research area while giving insight into what is the best
methodology to answer the research question.

2.1 State-building
State-building is the creation of new government institutions and the strengthening of
existing ones. In this book I argue that state-building is one of the most important issues for
the world community because weak or failed states are the source of many of the world’s
most serious problems. […] The dominant trend in world politics for the past generation has
been, after all, the critique of “big government” and the attempt to move activities from the
state sector to private markets or to civil society. But particularly in the developing world,
weak, incompetent, or nonexistent government is the source of severe problems.
Fukuyama, 2004, ix-x

Fukuyama describes above the basics of state-building and also claims that the
implementation of large and strong state institutions are necessary to counteract the
chaos that would appear if the state does fail, citing the collapse of the Soviet Union
as an example. Fukuyama (2004, 119-121) does acknowledge that the contemporary
trend of cutbacks that have been done it the power of the state have been warranted
and that the situation of the Cold War with overpowered states pitted against each other
is nothing to desire. However, he still does stress the importance of a strong legitimate
state. Only through enough power is the state able to create stability through the rule
of law both domestically and internationally. He also cites that the benefactors of a
weaker state – e.g. non-governmental organizations, corporations, syndicates – only
further spreads out the power and legitimacy of the state to multiple actors and works
against stability. The complexity of state-building is also underlined by Bliesemann de
Guevara (2010) who studies the involvement of actors on national and local levels that
9

Kim Backström
not necessarily have the same views as the Western international community regarding
the end goal of state-building. Compromises are needed among actors to achieve a
stable end goal, and the context is ever more complex with the onslaught of
globalization and informalization. A level of balance is required in state-building.
Fukuyama (2004, 92-93) also mentions the so-called failed state as a major problem
in the modern globalized world. The domestic situation of a failed state that lacks
functioning institutions able to create stability affect other countries more than ever.
The existence of a failed state creates the dilemma of when an external actor is justified
to intervene and encroach on sovereignty of another actor. However, other scholars
have conveyed criticisms towards Fukuyama’s view on “failed states”. Weigand
(2015, 7) claims that the Weberian state has become the usual go-to definition as the
end-goal when discussing state-building. Weigand finds this definition lacking and
criticizes Fukuyama for defining every state without a centralized power center as
“failed”. The definition is overgeneralizing and to some degree derogatory since it
lumps a wide array of different political systems into the same non-Weberian failed
category. The “failed” state – further down more closely described as a hybrid system
(e.g. OECD, 2010) – has other institutions, which revolve around other systems of
political and economic organization and is not necessarily in need of external
intervention to be “fixed”. Boege et al. (2009, 13-14) agrees with Weigand and
encourages the usage of the term hybrid political orders instead of failed states. They
claim that the mainstream view in Western political thinking that failed states are a
hinderance to peace and economic growth is misleading. The strengths of the states
are not considered and the lens of state-building needs widening.
No matter the view on what constitutes a failed state, there is a consensus that states
arise and develop differently. Answers to this diverging development can be found in
several theories. Fukuyama’s view that institutions are responsible for the
development of states towards a Weberian state system can also be seen in Weber’s
writings. Weber (2013) describes how Protestantism was a contributing cause as to
why capitalism evolved. However, this view has received criticism from several other
scholars and Weber himself also agrees that his conclusions are not exhaustive but
maintains there being a cause and effect relationship between culture and statebuilding. Diamond (1999) sums up his view on why societies evolve differently in one
sentence: “history followed different courses for different peoples because of
10

Kim Backström
differences among peoples’ environments, not because of biological differences
among peoples themselves”. Diamond adheres to the theory of geographic
determination, which claims that it is the environment around the people that shape
the characteristics of said people’s society. Diamond (1999) portrays a cause and effect
relationship that explain through ultimate (the east-west axis enabling species and
domesticated plants

spreading) and proximate

factors (technological

and

organizational advancement and epidemic diseases) why for example it was the
Spanish conquistadors who invaded the Inca and not vice versa.
Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) on the other hand discard Diamond’s theory since it
does not explain the differences between poor and wealthy in the modern globalized
world. Weber’s (2013) earlier mentioned culture explanation as to why some nations
fail and why others do not is also criticized by Acemoglu and Robinson (2012). Culture
does explain differences in social norms that might incentivize institutional
differences, but at the same time is culture more of a symptom of a larger issue which
is not explained by the culture theory on its own. Acemoglu and Robinson (2012)
explain why poor countries remain poor because those with authority want the country
to continue to be poor, their explanation follows suit as to that of Fukuyama;
institutions. Extractive institutions that have unclear law and order while incentivizing
absolutism has been the norm through history. On the other hand, inclusive institutions
that have a clear law and order while incentivizing pluralism create more favorable
circumstances for growth. However, the development from traditional extractive
institutions towards inclusive institutions is disincentivizing towards potential
economic and political losers of an institutional change. Similarities can be seen here
between the Weberian state and inclusive institutions, and between hybrid states and
exclusive institutions.
However, before continuing regarding state-building is it prudent to further clarify
what constitutes a state in the contemporary world. Visoka (2018, 1-2) describe this
phenomenon in closer detail and out of the context of Kosovo. He states that the
number of recognized states has increased drastically with the end of colonialism, but
the recognition of states is still met with resistance and no definite criteria of
recognition exist. The reasoning behind this is that the changing of states results in not
only regional differences, but on a more global scale where other actors search for a
mandate for increased self-determination. Some basic criteria to be considered a state
11

Kim Backström
can be found in the recognition of the separatist state from the host-state – which in
the case of Kosovo is Serbia – and the admission into the UN. This shows that the
international community considers the state to have a certain level of legitimacy, which
in turn enables the state to function in the ever globalizing world. This links to the
source of legitimacy called external legitimacy, which will later be discussed in closer
detail. Fukuyama (2004, 37-38) continues on this topic and why institutions are so
important in state-building concerning failed states. External support to shape a host
nation from a failed state is defined instead as nation-building. While external support
has an impact on both the development of the society and the legitimacy of the host
nation, it does not necessarily have the desired outcome of the external actor. An
external lender does have a level of impact on societal development but is still largely
dependent on domestic conditions. An external occupier – e.g. the United States (US)
in Afghanistan – on the other hand does have a larger influence on the policies of the
host nation, but this on the other hand disturbs the legitimacy of the host nation
government. An external occupier deciding the actions of the host nation paint a
picture among the population of the host-government being an illegitimate puppet.
However, Fukuyama (2004, 97) does not claim that external actors should let
populations conduct state-building towards legitimacy in total isolation. Instead he
goes even further and claims that external actors have an obligation to act against
violations of human rights. This is based on the idea that contemporary states can no
longer be considered legitimate solely on the basis of the leader of a centralized state,
along the lines of the Westphalian system that claims that the state has complete
sovereignty over its own territory. Fukuyama cites examples such as the transgressions
of “legitimate” nationalist leaders such as Milosevic in multiethnic former Yugoslavia
or the absence of a functioning centralized government in states such as Somalia or
Afghanistan. However, it seems as if the humanitarian reasoning for intervention that
is promoted by the United Nations (UN) and different non-governmental organizations
(NGO) does not align with those of different governments. This division on when
international intervention is justified can be seen clearly in the conflicts of the Bush
administration in the early 2000s. Fukuyama (2004, 104-106) claims that the defining
view change regarding state sovereignty had come with the end of the Cold War
through the humanitarian interventions of the 90s. With the US as the world’s only
superpower were the risks for reprisals on US interventions significantly lower. This
12

Kim Backström
would create a division between the US and Europe with the breaches of human rights
regarding the handling of Afghan terror suspects and the invasion of Iraq. From this
Fukuyama (2004, 99) concludes that the will to intervene and promote state-building
– through democratic legitimacy and self-sustaining institutions – in so called failed
states derives from the will to either stomp out the grounds for terrorism or to create
the means for economic development.
Fukuyama (2004, 100-102) cites three stages of nation-building. First comes the postconflict timeframe, when active fighting has recently stopped. First priority is to
stabilize the area through short-term solutions, e.g. humanitarian aid in the type of
basic goods and services while also restoring law and order. Next step is to create the
groundwork for self-sustaining state institutions that over time take over more and
more responsibility and enables the external interveners to exit the host nation. Finally,
the third step – which is deeply intertwined with the previous step – involves
strengthening state authority in more expertise type areas such as banking and property
rights that in the long run enables growth and further stability. What level of support
that is needed and within which areas of government is determined largely by the
existing institutions of the host nation. Did the host nation previously have a
functioning centralized state with institutions or not? Does the population have a
history of democratic values or not? The easy part is to put an end to active fighting
and to find short-term stabilizing solutions. The hard part is to be able to create longterm self-sustaining institutions that are perceived as legitimate among the population,
and “since we do not in fact know how to transfer institutional capacity in a hurry, we
are setting ourselves and our supposed beneficiaries up for large disappointments”
(Fukuyama, 2004, 104).
Schedler (1998) convey the democratization process post World War II as something
to be admired, but that sustaining the democratic system is often as difficult as
establishing it. Schedler (1998, 105) concludes that “no democracy will never be fully
consolidated”, but constant work is needed for the actions of liberal peacebuilding to
continue. However, not everyone is as convinced that nation-building and intervention
in the name of liberalization and democracy is justified. Paris (2010, 338) criticize the
notion of liberal peacebuilding as a sort of formula for peace in conflict-torn spaces
but admits that criticism towards it has in some areas been overinflated. Paris (2010,
339) thereby propose revalue liberal peacebuilding by “(1) continuing to press forward
13

Kim Backström
with efforts to dissect and understand the paradoxes and pathologies of peacebuilding,
and (2) ensuring that this critical enterprise is well-founded and justified”. Richmond
(2010) agrees with Paris that the current form of liberal peacebuilding is not to be
preferred. hybrid solutions between liberal and local practices can have severely
negative consequences if local circumstances are not considered. Tailored solutions
for liberal peace are needed in accordance to the local societal context.
The results of state-building through external intervention – also known as nationbuilding in the US – are varying. Fukuyama (2004, 38-39) cites the flurry of
postcolonial states that arouse with the decline of European colonialism post World
War II as examples of failed nation-building. Post World War II Germany and Japan
on the other hand are examples of successful nation-building, which was a result of
the massive economic investments that were made but mostly because of the still
existing institutions that were allowed to continue and in the long run created the
opportunities of a democratic market system evolving. The postcolonial states did not
have the same kind of institutions available to themselves which combined with the
earlier and ongoing extortion of economic resources and governments with close ties
to externa actors further worsened the opportunities for state-building.
Böhnke et al. (2017) describes in further detail the effects of state-building in a postwar context. They look at the interactions between state and society in Afghanistan
and the impact of external actors. Also here is legitimacy and a social contract between
the state and the people brought forward as central in the state-building process.
Studies are presented that the efficiency of external actors to implement liberal peacebuilding is far from easy – citing examples such as multiple legitimate actors and
differing values – and that instead focus has been put on increasing output performance
to increase legitimacy, which is in accordance to the steps of state-building presented
earlier by Fukuyama. Böhnke et al. (2017, 20-21) find in their study that in the context
of Afghanistan is state formation and legitimacy very sensitive to external
circumstances, but that the state-building process has to be based around the host
nation context.
State-building has a crucial part in creating stability in the ever more globalized world.
The what, when and where of interventions and goals of state-building are debated,
but in any case necessary to take into account when looking at the legitimacy of a
political system, since the two phenomenon are closely knit together. Next will focus
14

Kim Backström
shift towards what exactly constitutes legitimacy and from where legitimacy
originates.

2.2 Legitimacy
During the Age of Enlightenment, an idea of a social contract was raised. Philosophers
such as Hobbes (1651), Locke (1690) and Rousseau (1782) believed that a society
needs to organize itself through a sort of agreement called the social contract, which
stipulates what is to be expected of individuals towards the society, alternatively
between the ruler and the ruled. The contract needs to be based on the values and
interests of the people in question to determine how the society in question should be
managed, and this would then legitimize the political system. This is a precursor to
modern legitimacy theory, although the idea of a legitimate rule through some type of
“right” goes even further back in history and will be discussed in more detail later on.
What needs to be addressed early on is the fact that perceived legitimate rule varies
considerably and is based on the specific societal context. Continuing the example of
the three Enlightenment philosophers, these differing views can be seen clearly.
Hobbes (1651) who lived through the devastating English Civil War advocated for an
authoritarian leader with supreme power. Locke (1690) had another point of view and
believed that citizens have the right to rebel and that power should be divided among
different political systems. Finally, Rousseau (1782), who came to inspire the French
Revolution, supported deliberation and active citizenship to bring forward the will of
the people. Further on in this chapter, it will become apparent that all three views can
be discerned in different schools of modern legitimacy theory.
However, before diving deeper into the theoretical framework, is it prudent to point
out that as with all types of societal concepts, there is no definite consensus on how to
define said concept and determine what variables that affect it. The same applies to the
concept of legitimacy, which is a multidimensionally constructed concept that looks
at relationships between multiple actors, making it close to impossible to take every
variable that affects the relationship into account (Lillbacka, 1999, 3-5). This means
that different contexts demand different definitions of legitimacy. Power and
legitimacy are closely intertwined. For one person to have power over another
individual is in itself common and understandable, but what level of power that is
15

Kim Backström
legitimate in another circumstance is instantly much more complicated (Beetham,
1991, 3). However, a good baseline of the concept of legitimacy stems from the field
of sociology, where Weber defines a state as a “human community that (successfully)
claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory”
(Weber, 1946, 3-4).
This type of a definition might seem backwards for a thesis focusing on legitimacy
since the definition explores what defines a state, but Weber apparently sees the two
concepts of a state and legitimacy as co-dependent. To be defined as legitimate, a state
needs to be able to exercise a certain level of control over its people within the territory
in question, which is concretized through a monopoly on legitimate physical force.
What then is the definition of legitimate force? This has to do with who exercises the
force and under what jurisdiction. For example, the military or police force of the state
exercise force with the direct jurisdiction of the state, while citizens or private
companies – such as private security companies – might be given the right to use force
by the state under special circumstances, e.g. the right to practice self-defense or the
use of licensed security guards. What specifically constitutes legitimate use of force
has to do with different types of legitimating actions that provide authority, which will
be defined later. Weber (1978, 215-216) talks about three “pure types” of actions that
legitimate the state on different grounds:
•

Rational-legal: beliefs in enacted rules and the rights of those elevated to
authority result in the concept of rational-legal authority

•

Traditional: beliefs in established traditions and the legitimacy of those who
exercise authority result in the concept of traditional authority

•

Charismatic: beliefs in an exceptional character or individual and the
legitimacy of the actions and thoughts of him/her result in the concept of
charismatic legitimacy

Presented above is a categorization of different roads to a legitimate state. Legitimacy
through rational grounds requires people to believe in the rule of law and to follow and
respect both the rules of the state and of those who uphold them, e.g. the police, the
military, and the courts in modern so called Weberian states enacting the rule of law.
Legitimation through traditional grounds, on the contrary, draws from people’s beliefs
in established norms and traditions that shape the culture within the territory in
16

Kim Backström
question, e.g., believing in Christian values and those who represent them when living
in a Christian area. Finally, legitimation through charismatic grounds can be achieved
when people find and believe in a person who is qualified through his/her qualities or
actions which stem from the person’s charisma. Real world examples could be great
leaders such as Alexander the Great or Augustus who reached divine levels of
charismatic legitimacy, or a more recent example such as Barack Obama or Nelson
Mandela who also came to great positions of power largely based on their own
achievements and charisma. However, it is worth noting that all of the previously
mentioned examples have a polarizing effect within the public opinion and more than
a few met their end violently.
This type of charismatic legitimacy that Weber portrays can be traced back to another
theory, that of the “great man”. Carlyle (1993) can be attributed as one of the
forefathers of this societal theory that claims that a single individual – the hero – is
essentially born to lead and have a decisive impact on the future of a society at
historical crossroads, citing examples such as Napoleon in the wake of the French
Revolution and Martin Luther regarding the Protestant Reformation. This view on the
cause and effect of history has over time lost favor, with the motivation that proponents
of great man theory oversimplifies history, which then implies that an overt emphasis
on the actions and characteristics of a single individual is far from a satisfying
explanation to what legitimizes a political system. However, even if the romanticized
view of the hero might be an oversimplification, there is certainly some truth to the
school of thought. No matter if a leader is born to lead or molded by his/her
surroundings, the person can in no way be considered “normal” in respect to the
overwhelming responsibilities that the office entails (Kirkpatrick & Locke, 1991).
Furthermore, “All the rigorous scholarly research and theorizing we may undertake
cannot diminish the human striving to locate heroic leaders” (Spector, 2016, 258).
Moving on to other views on legitimacy. Easton (1965, 286-288) agrees with Weber
on that there are more to the legitimacy of an authority than the political system itself
– and that the population in question also plays a part in the formula – but further adds
that when faced with the loss of legitimacy, the political system needs to determine
what kind of legitimacy is affected and towards what aspect of the political system.
However, Easton uses a similar but more complex classification of legitimacy
according to what exactly the legitimacy supports and from where the legitimacy
17

Kim Backström
originates. He separates between the type of legitimacy that is directed towards a
regime as a whole and legitimacy towards specific people in roles of authority. Easton
(1965, 190-191) defines a regime as “the persistence of systems in the face of change”
and claims that inoperability is inevitable if a system or its members cannot sufficiently
support the regime. Authorities on the other hand are according to Easton (1965, 212213) the occupants of authority roles who on a continuum have varying levels of
discretion and responsibility for making decisions. The two categories are both
important in the functionality of the political system, which can be seen in how they
are based on legitimizing ideologies, as portrayed below.
[…] the power of authorities and of the regime both depend on upon continuing validation
through some set of values, a legitimating ideology. […] an ideology purveys an image of
the purposes, organization, and operation of a system in terms of which obedience to the
authorities and acceptance of the regime may be considered right and proper, and therefore,
morally binding.
Easton, 1965, 292 & 294

As for Easton’s sources of legitimacy – presented below in table 1 – distinct
similarities can be seen in the previous categorization of Weber. The similar structure
of sources of legitimacy between these two leading social scientists shows that a
similar classification of legitimacy sources is legitimate in itself.

Beetham (1991, 1 & 19) makes a clear distinction between the different terms
authority, power and legitimacy. He maintains that power acquired and exercised
under justifiable rules and with consent can be considered legitimate and that political
institution then have authority over the other system in question. At the same time,
while the exertion of power illegitimately is marked by forms of resistance among the
population is it still a type of authority. It is important to emphasize that what is
considered legal and justified varies both between and within populations over time
and space, which will be discussed in more detail later on. However, first some
terminology needs to be addressed.
Dahl and Stinebrickner (2003, 28) defines a political system as a “collection of
elements that interact with one another and that individually and collectively exercise
influence over the individuals and collectivities that make up the elements or parts of
the system”. This includes – among other things – governments and institutions
subordinate to said government. Authority on the other hand is a type of influence
where the ruled follows the wishes of the ruler more or less automatically. This is the
desired end goal of the political system according to Dahl and Stinebrickner (2003,
38-43 & 60-61) who claims that authority is achieved through six different methods:
inducement, power, force, coercion, persuasion, and manipulation. The political
system is thereby presented by a multitude of methods to achieve authority. Authority
is preferably achieved through legitimacy since that is an especially cost-efficient way
19

Kim Backström
to rule, while the alternative – authority through coercive means – does not entail
automatic obedience and acceptance as easily.
This division in what is an acceptable method of achieving authority – legitimate
actions and/or coercive actions – can be seen in the established categorization between
the Weberian and hybrid political systems (OECD, 2010, 16-19). A Weberian system
includes modern Western states where the ruling government succeeds in having a
monopoly on violence within its territory that it controls, directly or indirectly provides
its citizens with some level of services – which connects to a distinct difference
between public and private sectors – and finally is recognized by other states. In a
nutshell, the Weberian state includes stable modern states with rule of law and a free
market. A hybrid political system on the other hand are to a larger degree made up
from kin and community ties, reflected in the rules of the system and a lack of
distinction between private and public. Services through public responsibility are not
an universal right and are instead determined through social groups. Using a concrete
example of the differences between the two systems – while recognizing the
occurrence of stark differences within the two categorizations – would be through the
phenomenon of corruption. While corruption in a Weberian system is looked down
upon as a crime or nepotism, in a hybrid system could something that might look as
corruption instead simply be viewed as an acceptable occurrence of patronage (OECD,
2010, 25-26).

2.1.1 Sources of legitimacy
A number of academic subjects study the phenomenon of legitimacy in different
aspects. While the disciplines might differ in their specific goals in understanding the
cause and effect of legitimacy on different phenomena, in their essence they emanate
from the same theory that legitimacy infer a form of acceptance. An example of this
can be found in organizational theory when looking at the moral legitimacy of an
organization using Suchman’s (1995, 574) definition – that “legitimacy is a
generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper,
or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and
definitions” – to see how a social enterprise gain legitimacy and thereby support
among constituents and stakeholders (Sarpong & Davies, 2014). The study revolves
20

Kim Backström
around the concept of legitimacy as a form of acceptance that involves social
constructs, which closely resembles the outline previously given by Beetham, Weber
and Easton. However, the specifics of what affects and what is affected by legitimacy
is presented differently both between and within the disciplines. This warrants a further
explanation of the different specific views on legitimacy within the demarcation of the
thesis.
Democratic legitimacy is one of the most studied types of political legitimacy. Scharpf
(2003) came to define the basics of democratic legitimacy when trying to define the
level of legitimacy of the European Union (EU). Scharpf (2003) argued that when
dealing with modern Western political systems that the trust in institutional elements
is the key explaining factor, which he translated into two types of legitimacy: input
and output. Input legitimacy is determined by what degree the will of the people is
represented in the decision-making process, while output legitimacy is made up from
the effects of said decisions. In a nutshell, input legitimacy is determined through the
effectiveness of elections, deliberation and active citizenship, while output legitimacy
is determined through the type and quality of the services and policies that are enacted.
The measurement of democratic legitimacy has later been even further expanded by
Schmidt (2013), who added a third source of democratic legitimacy; throughput. This
view considers how the process between input and output is made up, touching upon
issues such as transparency and corruption. The focus of a political system when it
comes to democratic legitimacy can be seen as a trade-off. Too large of a focus on
input legitimacy might strengthen citizen participation and the claim that the system is
democratic, while at the same time the output performance might be hampered since
too many people are involved in too many areas. The alternative is focusing on output
performance while neglecting input, which in turn might result in an effective but far
from transparent technocracy that can then be considered to suffer from a democratic
deficit.
One explanation to why this view on legitimacy is needed in a political system as the
EU could be the fact that among the conditions to become a member state – defined in
the Copenhagen criteria (1993) – is that the member state needs to “have stable
institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and
protection of minorities”. Essentially, a member state needs to not only fulfill the
criteria of the Weberian state, but also have solid democratic values. The values of EU
21

Kim Backström
member states are basically grounded in democratic values, leading to the usage of
democratic legitimacy being an accurate tool of measurement when it comes to levels
of legitimacy. However, this would not necessarily be the case with a conflict-torn
political system where the population might never have been socialized with
democratic values and may have experienced even lower levels of democracy during
the preceding conflict. Again, the norms and values of the population determines what
needs to be measured when determining the level of legitimacy of a political system.
The idea that deliberation and citizen participation is not the best tool when building
legitimacy is prevalent also when using other lenses. When discussing theories of
democratic legitimization in the context of the EU, Karv (2019, 59 & 66-67) points
out that it is only in the context of a political community based on democratic values
that democratic behavior legitimizes the state – essentially linking democratic
legitimacy to public attitudes – which cannot be accurately determined to be
democratically legitimate or not because of the lack of an exact “threshold”. A further
complication of an exact threshold of democratic legitimacy is illustrated by Linde and
Ekman (2003, 405-406) that talks about how the state can through successful economic
and political development generate goodwill among the population that weighs up a
temporal setback in regards to outputs, which links to Easton’s (1965) theories of
specific and diffuse support for political systems. Specific support according to Easton
(1965, 267-268) is about meeting public demands and translates into support as “a
consequence from some specific satisfactions obtained from the system with respect
to a demand that the members make”. Diffuse support on the other hand is according
to Easton (1965, 273-274) a type of reservoir of good will that weighs up negative
impacts from the outputs affecting specific support. Diffuse support can materialize
through a sort of blind belief in a higher cause, e.g. patriotism towards an authoritarian
regime.
This lack of a threshold to be declared democratically legitimate and the existence of
methods to gain legitimacy even when lacking democracy indicates that values and
norms are a major deciding factor when building legitimacy. The view that one’s own
personal needs and safety are deemed more important than self-actualizing views like
democracy in the context of a crisis affected area is in accordance with the theory of
hierarchy of needs constructed by Maslow (1954). This would be the case especially
if the population in question never has had an established experience of democracy
22

Kim Backström
and thereby no democratic values or a sense of democracy being the norm. It is hard
to believe that a quick implementation of democratic institutions would legitimize the
state without the grounded existence of relevant values within the population, e.g.
Afghanistan that up until the toppling of the Taliban never had had neither an
established democratic government or an efficient centralized government (OECD,
2010, 31).

Continuing the earlier example of Afghanistan to further illustrate the necessity of
different measurements of legitimacy. The lack of a centralized government is
concretized especially in tribal areas in Afghanistan where so-called “warlords” has
the legitimate rule and maintains legitimacy with armed forces loyal to him personally
(Nourzhanov, 2005). A legitimate leader like the warlord can be identified with traits
like having access to armed forces while operating in a failed state with undemocratic
tendencies, which works against the creation of a legitimate centralized state,
especially one based on democratic legitimacy. This is related to a more traditional
type of legitimacy called numinous legitimacy that relates to having the divine right to
rule, in accordance to the to the type of government called theocracy, where the ruler
is legitimized through fundamentalism and traditional beliefs (Beetham, 1991, 75).
This can be seen in feudal Europe’s political system where the king was seen as ruling
with God’s mandate while a similar situation occurred in China where the principle of
the Mandate of Heaven gave the emperor the right to rule.
Returning to a more contemporarily relevant view on legitimacy. Weigand (2015, 4)
defines a fragile state as a conflict-torn area where a number of armed groups are
present, meaning that the state does not have the “monopoly of the legitimate use of
physical force”. He continues that it is persistently hard to build legitimacy in a fragile
setting, in response to the lack of a conceptual understanding of the relevant context.
Weigand (2015, 15-17) presents a view on legitimacy – by looking at legitimacy either
“top-down at the authority’s claims and justifications, or bottom-up, looking at the
subjects’ perceptions” – in a conflict-torn setting through five factors:
•

Referent objects: a conflict-torn space has multiple actors who strive for
authority, who have differing relationships to the population in regard to
legitimacy determining factors.
23

Kim Backström
•

Claimed vs. perceived legitimacy: with multiple actors who claim to have
justified legitimacy over the population, the perception of legitimacy from the
population’s point of view needs to be considered.

•

Audience: as well as there are multiple actors striving for legitimacy, there are
multiple groups within the population that experience legitimacy building
actions differently, which needs to be considered on a more detailed level.

•

Degrees of legitimacy: when determining the level of legitimacy of an
authority, different classifications are to be used in relation to population
support to the authority. Specifically, active support, passive support, passive
resistance or active resistance.

•

Sources: from where does legitimacy originate? Two dimensions are presented
as instrumental and substantive legitimacy. Instrumental includes more rational
sources such as the needs of the people and the services provided by the
authority. Substantive on the other hand involves more abstract sources such
as shared values about what is “right”, which essentially includes all of the
earlier mentioned sources of Weber.

Weigand offers a more detailed tool of measurement of legitimacy by considering the
societal context of the conflict-torn space. Multiple actors try to influence the
population, what level of legitimacy does actor A claim to have and how is actor A
perceived by the different groups that make up the population? And how does these
opinions of support and resistance translate into actions? Finally, Weigand offers a
view on sources of legitimacy that through substantive legitimacy involves Weber’s
traditional view of norms and values, and through instrumental legitimacy involves
Schaprf’s view of input and output of the authority. This categorization creates a
complex and detailed tool to determine legitimacy in the equally complex context of a
conflict-torn space.
One final view on sources of legitimacy in conflict-torn spaces is presented by OECD
(2010, 23-29). Input is based on the process of agreed rules and norms of the society.
In a democratic state input would be the same as the earlier presented input legitimacy
by Scharpf while in a traditional society the process would be based around traditions
and customs. Output is based on the services provided by the authority, with security
being the most basic of public goods. What level of quality of the services and goods
24

Kim Backström
are produced and are they universal or bound to ethnicity or tribal belonging? Shared
beliefs constitute the norms and values of the population. What type and levels of
religious beliefs is prevalent among the population? What is considered tradition and
how are different actors influencing the populations views on tradition? With the
absence of traditional leaders and a failing rational-legal system increases the chance
of a charismatic leader to appears, which also is related to shared beliefs. Finally,
international legitimacy is determined in regard to the state’s sovereignty, recognition
and support from other international actors. OECD’s presentation of sources of
legitimacy follows mostly the same pattern of earlier presented views on legitimacy,
however adding the fourth factor of external actors and at the same time involving
modern international relations theories into the concept of political legitimacy.
From the research presented above, a pattern can be seen where the importance of
population values is highlighted which then determines the expectations of the relevant
population towards the political institution in question. In all cases is some level of
basic economic and physical security expected for a state to be considered legitimate,
but which further services that are expected are instead determined by what the
population in questions deems necessary. How values are formed and manipulated will
be described further in chapter 2.2. This norm-based view on legitimacy means that
there will be significant differences in values among populations, both in regard to
time and place. What is considered legitimizing in the rational-legal welfare state
Finland in the 2010s is far from the same as what would be considered legitimizing
just 20 years earlier, and an even larger difference would be with a hybrid state that
does not even revolve around a democratic national state with a functioning rule of
law. Now with a general overview of the concept of state-building and legitimacy
established, can a connection be seen in that the values and norms of the population
are central to a stable and legitimate political system. How the values and norms of the
people develop over time and can be affected will be examined closer next through the
phenomena of social conditioning.

2.3 Social conditioning
This chapter will look closer at this behavior and its impact on political legitimacy. A
political system that wants to be considered legitimate needs to base its rules and
25

Kim Backström
practices on values that are grounded in the beliefs of the population. While traditions
that shape norms and values might seem timeless and to have evolved organically over
a long period of time, this is not always the case since a common occurrence is that
the traditions in question are both of recent origin and sometimes also invented. In
Hobsbawm et al. (2012, 1-2) is the so called “invention tradition” described as
including traditions both “invented, constructed and formally instituted and those
emerging in a less easily traceable manner within a brief and dateable period – a matter
of a few years perhaps – and establishing themselves with great rapidity”. An invented
tradition is thereby described as a set of practices that – often through the utilization
of the past – instill a certain type of behavior among the population, while customs on
the other hand involves the precedent of certain long-term established actions.
Thereby, there is a form of duality of actions that evolve norms and values either
organically over time or synthetically and are affected either through overt or tacit
means.
With this in mind it is not far-fetched that the absence of beliefs in democratic rule
does not make the sudden introduction of a democratic political system to be
considered legitimate, same as a graduate shift in beliefs from traditional and
fundamentalist values towards secularism and modernism would destabilize a
medieval European king ruling with the mandate of God like “a bridge whose
foundations have been weakened by the slow processes of erosion” (Beetham, 1991,
75). A contemporary example of a divide between rational and traditional that
counteract each other can be found in the caste system in India. The ancient caste
system that categorizes individuals in a hierarchical way although in law abolished, is
still very much present in everyday society, which pertains to a separation between the
passing and the enacting of legislation because of a deviation between laws and values
(Gupta, 2005). Therefore, the beliefs and values of a population can both help and
hinder the legitimacy of a political system. However, since the values of people change
over time can the values then be actively manipulated to either undermine or
strengthen the legitimacy of a political system?
Going back to Maslow’s hierarchy of human needs and societal values, another theory
is relevant. Inglehart (1971 & 1977) was the first to present the categorization of
materialist and postmaterialist values. He claims that values in postindustrial societies
change and present empirical evidence from Western European countries by
26

Kim Backström
comparing value change in relation to living standards. This led to the categorization
of values between materialists and postmaterialists, and how the values correlate to
societal change. Materialists value economic and political stability, while
postmaterialists value types of self-expression (Inglehart, 1977, 28). Which type of
value that is increasing in the society in turn reflects what it is currently lacking. This
in turn is connected to the hierarchy of needs from which the determination of
materialist and postmaterialist values are formed. Maslow (1954) determined that
people need to fulfill different types of needs, which Inglehart (1977, 22) interpreted
as values change towards a certain direction under certain conditions. Materialist
values make up the lower levels of Maslow’s hierarchy – which includes economic
and physical security – while Postmaterialist values make up the top – which includes
self-actualization. This connects to the phenomenon of counterinsurgency that will be
discussed later in chapter 2.4. The most important aspect when conducting
counterinsurgency operations is to create a sense of safety, ergo satisfying basic human
needs – the lower levels of Maslow hierarchy and materialist values – since that is
what the population covet the most with the current societal context.
While regional variances of materialism-postmaterialism are significant, there is an
overall trend towards postmaterialism with increased freedom and liberty. Welzel
(2013, 2) talks about emancipative values – “the idea of existing free from dominion”
– are in themselves old ideas of human philosophy, but it is only with the relatively
recent increase in living standard starting with the Industrial Revolution that life has
become more promising. This has enabled more and more people to “ascend the utility
ladder of freedoms” that translates into more tolerance, freedom and better life offers
(Welzel, 2013, 2-3). This trend can be seen below in table 2 regarding the different
capabilities (empowered through technological advancement) and guarantees
(empowered through democratic achievement) of different political systems, where
the shades of gray represent expected likelihoods of cases to be found, with the darker
shade indicating a higher likelihood.

This study of value changes over time and space be further studied using the database
World Values Survey (WVS) by Inglehart and Welzel (2005). Here Inglehart and
Welzel (2010) expanded the materialist-postmaterialist division to traditional-secular
values and survival-self-expression values. Traditional values include family ties,
religion, respect for authority and national pride, secular-rational values serve as their
antipole. Likewise, survival values prioritize physical and economic security while
self-expression values prioritize social justice, tolerance and environmental protection.
When the societal context changes the values of the population also changes in
accordance to the society, however with a quite considerable time lag since the values
of the individuals reflect the values of his/her youth (Inglehart, 1977, 23). For example,
a change towards better physical security and a higher standard of living would in turn
increase postmaterialist sentiment, but only after a period of time.
Going back to great man theory, Hook (1945, 15) presents a form of conditioning that
reinforces the legitimacy-building abilities of the individual. He argues that the cult of
the hero is in the modern day more and more a synthetic product. Especially
authoritarian states – then and now – reinforce the beliefs in the leader though different
forms of psychological induction. However, nowadays the efficiency of the
conditioning is reinforced through the advancement of technology. Hook compares the
building of statues that a Roman emperor could order, while a 1940s dictator had the
opportunities to mass-produce images of himself through lithography. This
comparison does not make it far-fetched that the introduction of social media and a
28

Kim Backström
totally digitalized society even further enhances different types of conditioning. Social
conditioning can be seen as a reinforcement of Weber’s (1978, 215-216) charismatic
legitimacy and Easton’s (1965, 287) personal qualities. The previous description of
how authoritarian states condition – or socialize – the population to behave in a certain
way is closely similar to a description of the phenomenon of propaganda.
Oberschall (2010) looks at the impact of the media in the example of the war in
Yugoslavia. First, he compares the four views on ethnic violence: the primordial view
that claims that violence between ethnicities is ever present, the instrumentalist view
that ethnic sentiment can be manipulated by other actors for political goals, the
constructionist view points out that ethnicity is just one among many identities that
affect people, and finally a fourth model focusing on state breakdown over ethnicity
in itself as a factor. “The driving motivations are not ethnic hatreds but fear and
insecurity”, says Obershall (2010, 984) and brings forward the idea of “latent
nationalism”, that can be activated through manipulation by authority figures. The idea
of fear being the driving motivation to ethnic conflicts is supported by earlier discussed
ideas of the hierarchy of human needs. This manipulation was according to Obershall
(2010, 987) just one of many different methods that leaders of a crumbling soviet
political system used to remain in power, by spreading fear and uniting around the idea
of ethnonationalism were elites able to stay in power, providing one explanation as
“the media unleashed the war of words and symbols before the war of bullets”. This
leads back to how norms and values not only be change over time but can also
manipulated. Even tough Yugoslav leader Tito had tried to dampen the ethnic
hostilities during his reign had the menacing values prevailed among “older people,
the families of victims, intellectuals and religious leaders” (Obershall, 2010, 989).
Even after being conditioned to live in harmony under a communist regime for
decades, were populist leaders able to revive the dormant hostilities after a
significantly shorter time of conditioning. Loveless (2009) describe the effects of
media on population values through the example of Western media in post-communist
states. Exposure to media portraying Western values does affect population
preferences, but only when also exposed to the right institutions. Again, the media is
a tool that can be used to shape the norms and values of the population, but not singlehandedly. By using political mobilization through the medium of mass media, political
actors were able to revert previous conditioning and during a shorter frame of time.
29

Kim Backström
This is in accordance with the polarization of values that occur in times of economic
turmoil, e.g. the polarization towards communism and national socialism in the waning
days of the Weimar Republic (de Bromhead et al., 2012).
Continuing on the earlier example of authoritarian regimes, the conditioning of a
personal cult around Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany can be seen as an extreme of the
usage of this type of legitimacy. While Nazi Germany would be considered illegitimate
if measured through the lens of a modern day rational-legal system, the opposite would
be the case if measured through the loyalty of the conditioned members of the Hitler
youth, who since the early 1930s had been indoctrinated through the personal cult of
Hitler to put country over their own lives (Shirer, 1991, 222-227). Propaganda of the
type called “the big lie” focus on using an underlying technical truth and then distorting
that truth to such a degree that no one would think it was made up. This has been seen
as an underlying reason for a shift in public opinion against Jews in Nazi Germany,
eventually leading to the Holocaust (Pulzer, 1988, 15; Herf, 2006, 211; Herf, 2005,
61).
What initially had enabled this type of extreme social conditioning can partially be
accredited to the societal values and socioeconomic situation that had preceded the rise
of the national socialists in Germany at the end of the roaring twenties. The forced
implementation of a democratic system on a population that had no tradition of
democratic values and also during times of extreme economic troubles, combined with
the fact that economic uncertainties correlate with political polarization created the
means for the social conditioning that Nazi Germany conducted (King et al., 2008).
This shows that, as discussed earlier in chapter 2.1, the influence and legitimacy of the
great man through characteristics can be decisive but is shaped through the context
which can be described as the values of the population in question and the specific
environmental circumstances.

Figure 1. The impact of values and the determination of legitimacy

In conclusion, it seems – as presented in figure 1 above – as if both what rules and
laws that are perceived as legitimate and likewise which qualities about an individual
that constitute as legitimizing depend on the norms and values of the population in
question. The category traditional – that involves norms and values of the population
in question – is central to the legitimacy of a political system. Norms and values decide
whether the output, input and throughput of the system can be considered legitimate,
and to involve Easton’s (1965, 287) more facetted view, what type of political system
is in question and of whom does the system consist? Norms and values in turn
determine what qualities makes a figure to be considered as charismatically legitimate.
Laws are also impacted by the norms and values of what is perceived as right or wrong
in a society, and in turn then also affected by the so-called traditional legitimacy. All
of the aforementioned categories then together determine the legitimacy level of the
political system that materializes in through the level of responsiveness of the
population to different political decisions. Again, legitimacy can be seen as practicing
authority without having to use force. Then again it is much harder to draw a definite
real-world line as to what is legitimate and what is not, while also determining what
type of legitimacy has a bigger or smaller impact on the political system’s legitimacy.
This is something that has to be described closer in detail when conducting an
empirical analysis, which will be done in chapter 3 when motivating the methodology
31

Kim Backström
of the thesis. With the concept of how norms and values appear and change over time
concluded, the next chapter will instead look at more specific theories regarding what
is to be done when trying to create stability and legitimacy in a conflict-torn space.

2.4 Counterinsurgency
Revolution, plot (or coup d’état), and insurgency are the three ways to take power by force.
[…] A revolution usually is an explosive upheaval – sudden, brief, spontaneous, unplanned.
[...] In a revolution, masses move and then leaders appear. [...] A plot is the clandestine action
of an insurgent group directed at the overthrow of the top leadership in its country. Because
of its clandestine nature, a plot cannot and does not involve the masses. […] an insurgency
is a protracted struggle conducted methodically, step by step, in order to attain specific
intermediate objectives leading finally to the overthrow of the existing order.
Galula, 2006, 2

Galula describes above the differences between a revolution, a plot, and an insurgency,
separating these types of conflicts from the more traditional form of conventional
warfare. While all types of conflicts have some overlap between each other regarding
characteristics and are relevant in the study of conflict-torn spaces, is it insurgencies
that are of special interest in this thesis. Galula is considered to be one of the leading
theorists of modern counterinsurgency (COIN). Galula (2002) came to this leading
role within counterinsurgency theory as a result of his two-year involvement in the
Algerian war of 1954-1962. The war between the French colonial power and Algerian
insurgents boiled down to “the struggle for control of the population”, which would
continue to be the first goal of any counterinsurgency operation (Galula, 2002, 59;
Galula, 2006, 4).
A contemporary counterinsurgency theorist Kilcullen (2010) sees an insurgency as an
organized struggle that involves both political and military means to weaken the
control and legitimacy of the ruling government in favor of the insurgents. A
counterinsurgency then is a catch-all term for the methods used to fight an insurgency,
the methods including not only military measures but all types of methods available to
the ruling government. Kilcullen (2010) compares an insurgency with cancer, meaning
that there is no one straight forward solution to conducting counterinsurgency
operations. Instead, are defining factors needed to be determined continuously since
32

Kim Backström
the circumstances relevant to the counterinsurgency is never static and constantly
needs to be adjusted. This can be seen in the fact that even before the start of the
conflict have there already occurred a struggle between different actors over authority
and legitimacy towards the population (Kilcullen, 2006, 2-3). Actors such as a central
government, militias, ethnic groups, corporations, NGO:s and criminal organizations
all try to improve their legitimacy standing among the population within different
areas. This behavior is ever more prevalent within hybrid systems and conflict-torn
spaces where no actor can claim to have definite monopoly on legitimate violence.
Kilcullen (2010, 2-13) define three factors that affect the evolution of the insurgency
that create “the struggle to adapt” that can be applied through different principles. The
principles being the nature of the insurgency, the nature of the counterinsurgent and
the human environment. As mentioned, both in respect to counterinsurgency and
legitimacy are the views and norms of the people essential. This can be seen in the
counterinsurgency theory that Kilcullen (2010) advocates, which focus on
understanding the local context of what drives the conflict and to respect
noncombatants. The reason for the insurgency thriving can differ even on a local level,
again disproving any silver bullet solution. Respecting noncombatants, even though
they might be involved with the insurgency as either passive or active
supporters/sympathizers, creates stability and legitimizes the view that insurgents have
more to win by talking than by fighting. Some lethal violence is impossible to avoid,
but simply relying in genocidal killings have a stark negative effect on the
counterinsurgency operation. Kilcullen (2010, 5-6) cites Nazi brutality within
occupied territories on the eastern front during World War II as reasons to the strong
partisan presence. Instead Kilcullen (2010, 5) says that “scrupulously moral conduct,
alongside political legitimacy and respect for the rule of law, are thus operational
imperatives: they enable victory”.

33

Kim Backström

Figure 2. Inter-agency Counterinsurgency Framework according to Kilcullen (2006, 4)

This struggle to adapt rests on the framework that Kilcullen (2006) calls the three
pillars of counterinsurgency, presented above in figure 2. Information on different
levels serves as a basis for the conduction of counterinsurgency operations. Then
security, political, and economic pillars serve as the applied methods that in turn create
control and stability. All of the capabilities of the counterinsurgent are put to use, and
the specific focus of the operation needs to constantly be adjusted to serve their
intended purpose to legitimize the counterinsurgent while delegitimizing the insurgent.
Another aspect in contemporary counterinsurgency operations is that if the operation
is domestic or expeditionary. Domestic operations occur on the home turf of the
counterinsurgent, while an expeditionary operation further involves a third external
actor further complicating which methods that are to be enacted and their efficiency.
Kilcullen (2010, 11-12) claims that operating in another setting regarding both
geography and culture is significantly more demanding and is further hindered by the
fact that domestic policy in liberal-democratic states often want to give over control
before the situation has reached a stable enough point.
Kilcullen (2010, 29-49) also tries to give concrete practical advice how to implement
the theories of counterinsurgency into practice. The advice revolves around the already
discussed important aspects of understanding local conditions through intelligence
34

Kim Backström
gathering and networking, pragmatic leadership and decision-making, and most
important of all: keeping the initiative which enables the counterinsurgent to gain the
trust and legitimacy of the population. Anyhow, finding out whether the actions
implemented have the desired effect is as hard to decipher as knowing which action to
pursue in a counterinsurgency operation. Also, regarding this provides Kilcullen
(2010, 56-76) different tools that indicate success and adversity in the many relevant
societal areas when conducting counterinsurgency operations. Some metrics are to be
avoided – e.g. body count and area accessibility – since while they do say something
about the input of the counterinsurgent, they do not necessarily say anything about the
output. The proposed metrics to be used are instead based on output performance of
the relevant actors – population, host nation, external actor, insurgents – and is also
closely related to different sources of legitimacy. For example, increasing numbers of
businesses, new urban construction efforts and clear property rights are both indicators
of the efficiency of the counterinsurgency operation and the legitimacy of the state
moving towards a more Weberian model with inclusive institutions and physical
safety. Another example is the occurrence and price of luxury goods which says
something about the economic safety of the population. A final example is the
influence of host nation institutions like courts and the level of tax collection that the
host nation can conduct, all of this says something about the populations perceived
legitimacy towards the central government with emphasis on output-performance.
It is evident that there is a significant amount of similarities between
counterinsurgency theory and the earlier discussed phenomena of legitimacy and statebuilding. As with legitimacy is the population the main factor in a counterinsurgency
operation. Being perceived as more legitimate than the insurgent is a main objective
of the counterinsurgent. All parts of the host nation government are needed to create
stability, which can be identified through the economic and physical security of the
population, once again referring back to the theories of both Maslow and Inglehart.
There appears to be a will among external actors – when fighting an insurgency along
with a host nation – to strive towards liberal peacebuilding and trying to fix the “failed”
state. This relating to the previously discussed phenomenon of state-building where
the views of Fukuyama and Weigand among others were presented. Fields (2010),
former Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, illustrates in a
hearing

the

when

Kim Backström
counterinsurgency. He claims that reconstruction is closely tied to security and the
incorporation of local needs and values. This is in turn achieved in the long run through
the growing involvement of local institutions in the reconstruction process. Anyhow,
counterinsurgency is a complex type of operation and requires constant adaptation to
have any chance of success.
With the relevant theoretical framework presented follows next a summary of said
framework and a specification of the research question.

2.5 Summary of the theoretical framework
Legitimacy is a deeply complex phenomenon but is in its essence based around the
feelings of the population that determine what constitutes a legitimate political system.
Whether a population considers a political system to be legitimate or not revolves
around the populations expectations towards an authority. The most basic of
expectations is the assurance of physical and economic safety of the people. Here it is
important to remember that it is not enough that people are statistically safe, they need
also to feel safe. This relates back to another definition of legitimacy meaning to have
monopoly regarding legitimate violence, and also that the basics of human needs can
be ranked according to Maslow’s pyramid of human needs and Inglehart’s
classification of materialist and postmaterialist needs.
Based on the presented theoretical framework is it necessary to motivate the
demarcated usage of legitimacy in this thesis to answer a more detailed version of the
current research question: why legitimacy building actions and effective state-building
is so difficult to achieve in fragile and conflict-torn state? Next follows a motivation
of which views regarding the phenomena presented in the theoretical framework that
will be used when trying to answer the more detailed research question. One
categorization that can be done is that there are differing tendencies between nondemocratic and democratic political systems, presented below in table 3.
Table 3. Character tendencies among different political systems
Non-democratic
Materialist
Exclusive institutions
Human suffering

Democratic
Postmaterialist
Inclusive institutions
Human thriving

36

Kim Backström
Non-democratic systems – or hybrid, failed – tend to have more materialist values and
consist out off more exclusive institutions, this means that there is a larger chance for
human suffering according to the theory presented earlier by Welzel (2013).
Democratic systems – or Weberian, liberal – tend to have more postmaterialist values
and consist out of more inclusive institutions, this means that there is a larger chance
for human thriving according to Welzel (2013). In short, the more democratic a state
is, the more it is likely to have a higher standard of living thanks to inclusive
institutions, which makes the population more likely to value self-fulfillment. The
opposite is true for more non-democratic states that have lower standard of living
thanks to more exclusive institutions, which makes the population more likely to value
physical and economic safety over e.g. equal rights. This division in values needs to
be considered when trying to decipher the level of legitimacy of a political system,
presented below in figure 3.

Figure 3. Detailed sources of legitimacy

Figure 3 aims to compile the different sources of legitimacy presented in the theoretical
framework. First, there is a division of instrumental and substantive types of legitimacy
(Weigand, 2015). Instrumental types of legitimacy revolve around rational types of
legitimacy, based on the needs of the people and the services provided. This includes
the earlier mentioned category rational-legal described by Weber (1978) and
ideological by Easton (1965). Rational-legal/ideological legitimacy revolves around
37

Kim Backström
moral convictions in rules and authority roles, which in turn is affected by established
norms and values. This is illustrated by the subcategories of input, output, throughput,
and external which pertains from OECD (2010), Scharpf (2003) and Schmidt (2013).
Input being the opportunities to participate in the decision-making process. Output
describe the type and quality of the services and policies being enacted. Throughput
looks at the process between input and output, looking at occurrences of e.g.
corruption. External support derives from non-domestic actors e.g. recognition from
the international community, an expeditionary counterinsurgency force or funding
from emigrated nationals.
What the population considers to be the responsibility of the authority to provide is
then instead determined by substantive types of legitimacy, which can be divided into
the subcategories traditional (structural) and, charismatic (personal) taken from Weber
(1978) and Easton (1965). The norms and values of the population – meaning
substantive legitimacy or shared values – determine what services are expected, if
democratic participation is valued, if corruption is looked down upon or considered
patronage, and if external support makes the host nation seem stronger or to be
considered a puppet. There being different norms and values in nondemocracies,
hybrid regimes and democracies is only natural. Traditional/structural legitimacy
looks at beliefs in norms and traditions. Charismatic/personal are based around the
characteristics of a single individual pertaining to the great man theory (Hook, 1945).
All of these characteristics needs to be considered when trying to determine the
legitimacy of a political system. However, when dealing with a conflict-torn space are
even more variables needed to take into account. Weigand (2015) summarized the
circumstances of a conflict-torn state into four categories. First, the referent objects
need to be considered, since a conflict-torn space contains multiple actors who strife
for authority and to be considered legitimate in the eyes of the population. Secondly,
there is a need to distinguish between the claimed legitimacy of an actor and the
perceived legitimacy of the actor from the perspective of the population. Thirdly, the
need to recognize that the population is not a homogenous actor but consists of
multiple groups with varying interests. Fourth, classifications of support among groups
toward actors need to be constructed, e.g. through active or passive support and passive
or active resistance. Finally, the different types of support for the actors needs to be
considered. Easton (1965) defined specific support as meeting public demands for
38

Kim Backström
output – linking to instrumental legitimacy – and defined diffuse support as a reservoir
of good will pertaining from a sense of purpose towards the actor. Even tough an actor
might act against the population’s own best interest, the actor might still be considered
legitimate in the eyes of the public thanks to diffuse support.
This summary concludes the theoretical framework of the thesis, making the specified
research question: what are the views of the population on legitimacy in areas where
counterinsurgency operations have been conducted? Next will the expectations
towards the empirical study be presented as well as the motivations as to which type
of methodology will be used.

3 Methodology
Previous chapters have established the complexity of political legitimacy and statebuilding. A multitude of factors need to be taken into account when trying to determine
the views of a population regarding the legitimacy of a political system. This is ever
more complicated when the societal context is one where a full-on conflict has
occurred, and afterwards stability is aimed to be achieved through the usage of statebuilding through the lens of counterinsurgency theory. The theoretical framework
shows that the specific sources of the legitimacy of the political system are necessary
to investigate further when trying to create stability.
Instrumental types of legitimacy – based around the needs of the population and
services provided – combined with substantive types of legitimacy – based around the
norms and values of the population – determine the actual level of legitimacy of the
political system, while also affecting what level of effect specific types of legitimacy
building actions will have. The duality of instrumental and substantive legitimacy is
also reflected in the categorization of specific and diffuse support. Specific support
can be considered more logical and based on the obvious gains of the population for
supporting the political system. Diffuse support on the other hand is more abstract in
the sense that it pertains from a sort of reservoir of goodwill, which might materialize
through e.g. patriotism. For example, the norms and expectations of the population
towards democratic input and insight into the decision-making process determine the
effect of creating more or less democratic institutions. While a decrease in
transparency and input might have a negative impact on the legitimacy of a political
system in a Weberian state – e.g. a country within the EU – the same might not be the
case for a non-Weberian state – e.g. Afghanistan – where there is no established norm
of a working centralized political system based around democratic liberty and the rule
of law.
Furthermore, when dealing with the case of a conflict-torn space, the societal context
is ever more important. This means that further factors need to be considered than
when examining an area that is politically stable and does not suffer from security and
economic risks as a result of e.g. war or an insurgency. This creates a societal context
where multiple actors actively strive for control. There is a difference between the
claimed and the perceived legitimacy of the population, which is far from homogenous
and might show differing levels of support and/or resistance towards different actors.

Next, the aforementioned sources of legitimacy will be used to answer the research
question what are the views of the population on legitimacy in areas where
counterinsurgency operations have been conducted? How exactly the research will be
conducted will be discussed in detail in this chapter. First, some reflections on the
advantages and disadvantages of different relevant research designs. Then follows a
discussion regarding the data that will be used in the research. This motivates why the
data from the later on chosen case is the most expedient when answering the research
question. Afterwards, the variables will be operationalized for analyzing the data. A
discussion will be held regarding the validity and reliability of the research, while also
stating the strengths, weaknesses, and realistic goals of the research. The chapter
concludes with a summary of the methodology – concisely stating how the research
will be conducted, with what material and through which type of categorization –
enabling an analysis through the described methodology.

3.1 Research design
The theoretical framework shows that the values of a population change over time, and
this in turn has an impact on what is considered to be legitimate. Since the research
question looks at the specific case of population views on legitimacy under specifically
demarcated circumstances, the argument can be made that this research is of a theory
testing character, also called deductive theory (Esaiasson et al., 2012, 91-93; Bryman,
2018, 47-50). When testing a theory, the most desirable conditions would be to run the
same specific scenario multiple times while at the same time being able to manipulate
different independent variables. This would enable drawing conclusions regarding the
cause and effect of different variables. Since this is not humanly possible, the next best
option is to instead conduct systematic comparisons that involve both homogeneity
and variations. The observed cases should be similar in many ways to be comparable,
but at the same time be different so conclusions can be drawn regarding cause and
effect. A systematic comparison can be conducted in several different ways by using
different research designs. Every design has its own strengths and weaknesses,
meaning that that there is no “correct” way to conduct research. This chapter will try
to motivate the chosen research design of the thesis. Different designs will be presented
and compared to other relevant studies, enabling a choice of design to answer the
research question of this thesis.
41

Kim Backström
The argument can be made that the closest the researcher can come to turning back
time and manipulating circumstances is through experimental design (Esaiasson et al.,
2012, 93-96 & 327-345; Bryman, 2018, 77-87; Ekengren & Hinnfors, 2012, 80-84).
While there are multiple ways to conduct an experiment within the social sciences, the
common denominator is that there are at least two groups: an experiment group and a
control group. The experiment group is exposed to a stimulus while the control group
is not. The stimulus represents the independent variable which the researcher wants to
investigate to find out if and then how it affects the dependent variable. The controlled
circumstances give the experimental design high internal validity, and the effects of
the stimulus are easy to observe. However, experimental design suffers from low
external validity. This is the case since the sample used, while partially countered
through randomization, in no way guarantees to represent the entire relevant
population. Furthermore, the environment and context of the experiment might not be
representative of the intended real-world circumstances or have an unintended impact
on the results of the study. However, using experimental design would be inexpedient
in the case of this thesis. Finding a representative sample to use would be unreasonable
within the scope of this thesis, which can also be said about creating the correct
circumstances to actually conduct the experiment. This leads to the fact that another
research design needs to be considered.
Another research design to be considered is the comparative design (Esaiasson et al.,
2012, 101-108 & 210-226; Bryman, 2018, 102-107; Ekengren & Hinnfors, 2012, 8084). This design compares two or more cases to each other, and the data can be both
qualitative and quantitative. The cases have to be different to some extent, however to
what level is determined by what specific type of comparative design is being used.
Using the most alike design, the cases must be as similar as possible, apart from the
suspected causes and related effects. By pinpointing the few differences between two
cases, conclusions can be drawn regarding the cause and the effect of different
variables. The alternative method is using the most different design. Here the cases
must be different in many aspects, while being alike in outcome and having a few
similar variables. This also enables conclusions regarding cause and effect, but the
other way around in comparison to the most alike design. The strength of comparative
design is drawing conclusions regarding cause and effect. A few carefully selected
cases can be analyzed in depth. However, complex societal phenomena can rarely be
42

Kim Backström
explained through a few variables, which is further problematized by the hardships of
generalization. Even if there appears to occur causality in cause and effect regarding
two cases, there is no guarantee that would be the case when involving other cases.
Problems in reliability can also occur from errors in data gathering and categorizations,
especially when dealing with multiple sources of data.
Ortmann (2010) uses a comparative design to study the democratization process in
Singapore and Hong Kong by looking at regime legitimacy. The two cases are similar
in many ways, while at the same time having differing outcomes regarding
democratization. Ortmann (2010) categorizes different levels of regime oppositional
behavior by investigating the occurrence of social conflicts, public meetings and
protests, and policy decisions. The research design used is a most alike design, using
qualitative data. This research design in relation to this study is not the most suitable.
Two well-rounded cases to compare which are alike in many ways and have been
exposed to state-building through counterinsurgency are Afghanistan and Iraq.
However, the theoretical framework shows that the norms and values of the population
are essential when gaining legitimacy. Deciphering value change might prove to be
demanding when using regime documents and data regarding social conflicts. Another
solution would be to use other types of data, e.g. interviews or surveys. In this case the
availability of comparable data is the problem. WVS would be optimal since the
database records population values and has included Iraq since its fourth wave (20002004). However, WVS has no data on Afghanistan. Using data from different sources
complicates the comparative aspect. Gathering data independently by conducting
surveys or interviews in Afghanistan and Iraq is outside of the reasonable expectations
of this thesis.
Since finding data from two state level comparable cases proved to be difficult, a more
concentrated deep dive into one case is of more relevance to this thesis. A case study
focuses on a societal phenomenon and the relevant societal context (Esaiasson et al.,
2012, 108-110; Bryman, 2018, 96-102; Ekengren & Hinnfors, 2012, 80-84). The case
being studied is demarcated in three aspects: socially, regionally and chronologically.
This deep focus enables conclusions regarding cause and effect within the demarcated
area of the case-study. Also, the usage of qualitative, quantitative, or both types of data
does not matter. The advantage of case studies is the opportunity to deeply study
complex societal phenomena, which creates a high internal validity since the
43

Kim Backström
opportunities to determine the effects of specific variables are greater than in a study
with a wider focus. However, this has the effect of a lower external validity, since it is
harder to generalize the results of a case study to other cases.
Böhnke et al. (2017) conducted a repeated cross-sectional study in a part of the
northeast Afghanistan, using both surveys and semi-structured interviews. The usage
of repeated survey data gathered in a specific region creates some interesting research
possibilities. Cross-sectional surveys are gathered at a certain point of time and within
a short timeframe (Esaiasson et al., 2012, 227-250; Bryman, 2018, 87-92; Ekengren &
Hinnfors, 2012, 80-84). Data is gathered regarding a large number of variables,
enabling statistical analysis. A repeated cross-sectional study uses the same datagathering methods during several measurement points but utilizing different
respondents every wave. This gives a longitudinal aspect to the study. Going back to
Böhnke et al. (2017), they looked at state formation through legitimacy in two different
regions in Northeastern Afghanistan. The argument can be made that this makes the
study a comparative study involving several regions, alternatively a case study looking
at a specific larger region. The strong points of cross-sectional data are that it is easy
to replicate the results and it is more believable to generalize the results to the entire
population, giving the design a strong external validity. However, strong external
validity requires both randomization and representativity of the sample. Disadvantages
include low internal validity, since it is hard to determine causality when the data is
gathered at certain point in time. The data-gathering disadvantage is reduced when
conducting a repeated cross-sectional study. One final point of concern is the data
gathering process. It is hard to determine the honesty of the respondents and to make
certain there are no misunderstandings when answering the questions.
The cross-sectional data collected and used by Böhnke et al. (2017) is also suitable to
answer the research question of this thesis. A more detailed reasoning regarding the
characteristics of the data is conducted in the next section. The data enables a versatile
research design. The data gathered is of a cross-sectional design, but with longitudinal
elements since the survey is repeated. However, the study is not entirely longitudinal
since a new sample is used with each new wave when conducting a repeated crosssectional study. A case study element is also present since the societal context of
Afghanistan is relevant to the research question and further enables comparative
aspects between the two different regions where the data was gathered. The versatility
44

Kim Backström
of the design strengthens already strong points of the different research designs:
looking at the underlying reasons of one case, comparing to other cases, and
conducting statistical analysis. The weak points of the designs when used separately
are decreased: generalization to other cases and low internal validity since data is
gathered at one point in time and including too few variables. However, it is important
to keep in mind that more complex designs require more attention to detail when
drawing conclusions, since the risk for human error when handling the data is ever
greater (Bryman, 2018, 788).
Böhnke et al. (2017) use the gathered data to study the state formation process in
Afghanistan. They motivate their choice of case by referring to the historical context
of Afghanistan. The absence of a social contract can be seen in the historical lack of
ties between the state and the society in Afghanistan. Foreign actors have provided
external support to leading Afghan political institutions: European imperialist powers
during the Age of Imperialism, the US and Soviet Union during the Cold War, and
Western donors and the ISAF during the 21st century. While Böhnke et al. (2017) look
at similar issues such as state formation. This thesis aims to use another categorization
to study legitimacy change and include the lens of counterinsurgency theory. This
different lens hopefully provides further insights into what Böhnke et al. (2017)
already have presented in their study. Figure 4 below describes the planned analysis
of this thesis.

Figure 4. Analysis of legitimacy change over time after the implementation of COIN doctrine

45

Kim Backström

The implementation of counterinsurgency theory works as the independent variable
(X) of this thesis. The change in population views regarding legitimacy is then
analyzed over time to determine the effects of counterinsurgency doctrine on statebuilding. The takeover of responsibility in Afghanistan of the ISAF in 2003 can be
seen as the implementation of counterinsurgency theory. Then follows a resurgence in
Taliban fighting, all the while COIN tactics using Provincial Reconstruction Teams
(PRT:s) are implemented and evolved. This continues up until the dismantlement of
the ISAF and the partial withdrawal of the international COIN force in 2014, giving
over state-building responsibilities to the Afghan government. Three different
measuring points of legitimacy are used to study changes in population views towards
legitimacy. Specifically, the survey waves of Böhnke et al. (2017) conducted in 2007
(t1), 2011 (t2) and 2015 (t3). The fact that 2003 (t0) is before the first measuring point
is not necessarily an issue, since value change happens over a long period of time.
With the presentation and motivation of the research design of the thesis concluded, is
focus shifted towards the data used in the next chapter.

3.2 Data
The cross-sectional data of Böhnke et al. (2017) enables a statistical analysis to answer
the research question. Esaiasson et al. (2012, 346-391) describe this research design in
detail. Statistical methodology enables the analysis of large amounts of data, e.g.
through descriptive or regression analysis, utilizing statistical measurements such as
means and levels of correlation. The statistical analysis of the data in this thesis is
twofold. First, the levels of internal reliability of the operationalizations are measured
using Cronbach’s alpha to ensure that they measure the same type of legitimacy.
Afterwards, a descriptive analysis to give an insight into the levels and trends of
different sources of legitimacy.
Next follows some words about the data used in the analysis. Some essentials
regarding the sample of the five repeated cross-sectional studies are summarized below
in table 4.

Table 4 above gives an overview of the data collected and used by Böhnke et al.
(2017). The data was gathered though a repeated cross-sectional survey, during the
springs of 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015. An in-depth report on the methodological
approach of the cross-sectional data can be found in Böhnke et al. (2013). The surveys
were conducted through interviews with the heads of households in a total of 80
different villages in the two provinces of Kunduz and Takhar in northeast Afghanistan.
The survey consisted out of 66 questions on the subjects of the performance of
different actors (government, international, military, traditional) and the experienced
threat levels towards the community. The response rate was high throughout the crosssectional study, always exceeding 90 %. The focus of the surveys was on household
and community level, not on individuals, because of the communal culture of
Afghanistan. To attain higher external validity were 50 % of the communities chosen
through randomization and the remaining 50 % through five different diversity criteria:
size, remoteness, estimated natural resource base, estimated vulnerability to natural
disasters, and ethnic and religious composition (Bryman, 2018, chapter 8; Böhnke et
al., 2013 & 2017). The households within the communities were in turn chosen through
randomization. The confidence intervals of individual waves and between questions
varies. At a 95 % confidence interval, Böhnke et al. (2017) recommends using ± 2.0
% for questions using simple percentages and ± 2.6 % when using questions with
percentages from multiple category answers. The implementation of the data gathering
was carried out by the Organization for Sustainable Development and Research,
formerly Coordination of Afghan Relief, along with one of the authors of the article.
Using survey data, the experiences of the respondents are in focus. Even tough
subjective views do not necessarily correlate with the de facto situation, this potential
deviation is not a problem in the case of this thesis. The reason being, when dealing
with legitimacy, the views and experiences of the population are exactly what is
interesting. However, it is still important to reflect on the realistic possibilities of what
the survey data can accomplish. Since the data is not original, but collected and used
within another survey, are questions regarding reliability and results validity hard to
affect. Reliability deals with problems stemming from chance and negligence when
collecting the data, while results validity deals with systematic errors, e.g. unclear
questions leading to misunderstandings or some form of wrongful handling of the data

48

Kim Backström
(Esaiasson, 2012, 63; Bryman, 2018, 253-255). There is no realistic way to review the
data gathering process.
Some limitations to be considered regarding generalizations when dealing with survey
data is presented by Bryman (2018, 252-253). Generalizations can only be made in
relation to the population from which the sample is collected. What type of
geographical area this infer and for how long of a time needs to be discussed and
considered. Data from a sample located in in Afghanistan is in several way expedient
to answer the research question. Afghanistan has during the 21th century experienced
all the stages relating to counterinsurgency: conventional warfare in the wake of the
9/11-attacks, which was followed by the evolvement into an insurgency battling the
multinational counterinsurgency force ISAF which assisted the state-building efforts
of the Afghan national government. The data collected by Böhnke et al. (2017), while
concentrated to a specific timeframe and region of Afghanistan, is still a prudent
solution to trying to see the relationship of the population towards legitimacy in the
context of a counterinsurgency operation. The population where Böhnke et al. (2017)
collected the data consist of a heterogeneous population – regarding ethnicity – and
the counterinsurgent force of the region was under German command with several
other nationalities also being represented.
The diverse circumstances create interesting but also demanding circumstances from
a research point of view. It is also important to keep in mind is the underlying will and
representativity of having the head of the household answering the survey. The sample
consists out of almost exclusively male heads of households, with varying levels of
literacy and deriving from multiple ethnic groupings are circumstances which need to
be considered. As mentioned above are reservations needed when conducting
generalizations to a larger population. One way to counter this threat is to use other
data sources to relate the regional data indicators to the national level, e.g. by using
the Quality of Government Institute’s QoG Standard Dataset, which includes several
other databases which among other issues looks at security levels, transparency,
repression and factionalism. However, the strength of using one single measuring tool
at several points in time should also not be understated. Even if the repeated survey
would suffer from some unexpected fault in reliability, continuous over- and
underestimations tend to even out each other and the long-term trend is still valid
(Esaisasson et al, 2012, 64).
49

Kim Backström
This concludes the deliberation on the data to be used in the analysis. Next follows a
discussion regarding the operationalization of the data material, which enables a
systematic analysis.

3.3 Operationalization
According to Esaiasson et al. (2012, 55-56), the operationalizations of the relevant
theoretical definitions are important, since they have an elemental impact on the
validity of the results. To conduct a systematic analysis with the end goal of answering
a research question, two types of concept definitions are needed: a theoretical and an
operational. The Theoretical definitions have already been motivated and established
in the theoretical framework regarding the different sources of legitimacy. However,
a theoretical definition does not necessarily enable systematic measurements of the
phenomenon in question. This creates the need for operational definitions, which are
engineered to enable the measurement of the phenomenon in question. How exactly
the operationalization is conducted might have a severe impact on the results of the
research, this in turn creates the need for grounded motivations as to why one
operationalization is more suitable than another. It is a twofold matter of validity. Is
there an accordance between the theoretical definition and the operational definition?
Does the operationalization actually measure what the research aims to measure?
These two questions need to be answered thoroughly before conducting the analysis.
Furthermore, is there a need to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of the research,
regarding the data and operationalizations.
As mentioned above, the theoretical definitions of the different sources of legitimacy
– summarized in chapter 2.5 – will be assigned operationalizations. In this thesis, will
this process be implemented by assigning a number of survey questions from the data
collected by Böhnke et al. (2017) to each of the different sources of legitimacy. The
categorization can be seen below in table 5.

The categorization seen above in table 5 is intended to be used in the analysis to answer
the research question. The coding can be studied in detail in Appendix A. The
Cronbach’s alpha test was done on the operationalizations to determine the reliability
of the study. Cronbach’s alpha measures the internal reliability – or internal
consistency – of the answers of different respondents on several questions (Bryman,
2018, 208-209). The results of the test can vary between 0 (no internal reliability) and
1 (perfect internal reliability). A Cronbach’s alpha level of around 0.7 is considered to
be acceptable. However, the scaling of the items and the number of items analyzed can
have an inflating or deflating effect on the final value, meaning that the test results
should not be seen as definite on their own. The Cronbach’s alpha test scores of the
operationalizations varied between 0.411 and 0.701. These relatively low test scores
create the need for further motivations regarding concept validity to establish the
choice of operationalization to every source of legitimacy.
Input legitimacy derives from decisions being made in accordance to the views of the
population, and in the context of a democratic system this also includes transparency
and ability to conduct active citizenship. The question q32 is the shura involved in the
identification of development projects? investigates suitably the characteristics of
input legitimacy. Since the shura is a grass-roots level semi-formalized institution and
considerably close to the people affected by decisions, the results of this question can
be used to determine if the views of the population are met when choosing
development projects. Some words about the nature of different institutions in
Afghanistan, also mentioned by Böhnke et al. (2017). There is no simple line between
governmental and societal institutions in Afghanistan as in e.g. modern rational-legal
states. Societal institutions are to differing levels recognized by the central
government. The categorization used when gathering the data and in this study goes
as follows. Societal institutions include the shura (traditional village and district
councils) and a number of different local influential people with the titles of jirga,
elders, arbob/malik/khan/, mullah and commander. Governmental institutions include
the wolliswol (the district administration or district governor), qazi (a local judge),
huquq (the justice department), and the Community Development Council which later
became the District Development Assembly (a state run and democratically elected
institution of community representatives). Continuing with the survey questions, the
question q20 Suppose that you think that a decision by the district government is not
53

Kim Backström
correct. To whom of the following would you most likely turn for help? indicate how
exactly active citizenship is conducted. Who do you consider to be the “right” – i.e.
legitimate – authority to solve a conflict? The question q31 Is the shura involved in the
identification of development projects? indicate if grassroots-level institutions are
involved in the decision-making process. How close to the people affected are the
decisions done? Even when dealing with a social institution with a semi-formalized
relationship to the central government.
Output legitimacy derives from the quality and quantity of services provided by the
institution towards the population. The question q10 has security increased or
decreased over the past two years in your village? describes output legitimacy in a
suitable manner. Furthermore, is providing a sense of stability and safety the most
basic of needs both regarding the hierarchy of human needs and in counterinsurgency
doctrine. Question q11 did the following actors contribute to these changes? adds to
the previous question in that the relationships between different actors are revealed,
which has been mentioned to be essential in conflict-torn spaces. Finally, the question
q44_b in the last two years the government has helped to: takes a more in-depth look
at the achievements in legitimacy of the Afghan government.
Throughput legitimacy derives from the process between input and output, meaning
effectiveness and levels of transparency. The question q21 parties to a conflict may
use various means to influence the outcome of the conflict in their favor. How often do
you think that the following means are applied? includes the characteristics of
throughput legitimacy. How different actors lobby on different levels can indicate
levels of corruption and views regarding what is considered corrupt behavior or simply
patronage. The next question q27_2 if only some households of your community attend
the shura, these are usually households that... looks at views and occurrences of
corruption on grassroots levels. The shura is a traditional societal institution which
have been semi-formalized by the Afghan government, how decision-making is done
in the shura and changes over time can indicate changes in what is perceived
legitimate. Finally, the question q18 if you were involved in a conflict about natural
resources, which are the first institutions you would turn to resolve the conflict? is
suitable for this source, since the choice of institution says something about the view
of the population regarding the different institutions and perceived levels of efficiency.

54

Kim Backström
External legitimacy derives from the relationship between the political institution and
international actors. In the case of Afghanistan includes this the multi-national
counterinsurgency force ISAF in relation to the Afghan central government, but also
foreign investors in relation to the Taliban. The question q12_a please indicate, if you
are afraid of the following groups: foreign forces indicate the views of the population
towards counterinsurgents. If the counterinsurgents are considered more of a threat
than a stabilizing actor, then there is a severe discrepancy regarding legitimacy in the
context of counterinsurgency doctrine. The question q44_a in the last two years,
international development organizations have helped to and the question q44_e in the
last two years international forces have helped to both indicate the actual output of
counterinsurgents and international NGO:s. This data can then in turn be analyzed in
relationship to the level towards foreign forces, indicated by q12.
Traditional legitimacy derives from the beliefs in norms and traditions of the
population. This source should prove essential in the context of Afghanistan,
considering the strong survival and traditional values of the Islamic region, according
to the cultural map of the WVS (2010). The question q39 If you or members of your
family were asked to participate in a hasher or similar obligations, and nobody
participated in it tough everybody knew that someone from your family could have
done it, what would be possible consequences of that for your family? continues to
build on the previous question regarding the legitimacy and the influence of the shura
and how strong traditional values are in the community. The same can be said about
the final question q55 I will read six statements to you. Please indicate the degree to
which you disagree or agree to each of them with sub-questions regarding the effect
on culture by schooling of boys, schooling of girls, wage-labor, state-schooling,
foreign aid and foreign troops.
Charismatic legitimacy derives from the beliefs of the population in individual
characters, affected by characteristics and charisma. The level the population values
the views and abilities of individuals can be discerned through questions regarding the
influence of individual characters. The question q23 whom do you consider the most
powerful person in your village? and question q24 why do you think this person is
powerful says something of what level of legitimacy individuals possesses, and on
which grounds. For example, societal characters on traditional grounds and officials
through either legitimate power or patronage. The underlying reasons as to the level
55

Kim Backström
of legitimacy influential persons possess can be discerned by the question q44_c in the
last two years an influential person has helped to.
The survey material was recoded to enable analysis using the previously mentioned
operationalizations, and also to avoid issues with a between waves varying
composition of answer alternatives. The following four categories were recoded:
governmental, societal, external and patronage. The governmental category includes
different governmental institutions such as provincial administration, police, the courts
and the district development council. The category societal includes grassroots level
institutions like the shura or local militias. The category patronage includes individuals
who in themselves hold a significant level of influence, e.g. the mullah, village elders,
or a security commander. The category external includes both international NGO:s and
international counterinsurgency forces. The categories follow the same logic as the
different sources of legitimacy and institutional categorization of societal and political
institutions. This enables a deeper analysis of change over time.
However, no matter how expedient the survey questions would be in relation to the
aims of this thesis, the fact remains that only using data of one type and from one
source creates a number of difficulties. As mentioned above, the backsides of crosssectional surveys are the fact that they are conducted at specific points in time,
involving different people when doing repeated studies, and suffering from losses
within the sample. This leads to a decrease in internal validity, no matter the quality
of the operationalizations. One way to counter this would be to involve other types of
data, as Böhnke et al. (2017) did by also conducting semi-structured interviews.
Unfortunately this data has not been attainable. Another way to weigh up the
downsides of cross-sectional data which was considered is to use national level data
from other sources. However, this instead requires other considerations regarding
generalizations and is not used in the analysis.
It seems as if from the current standpoint, that the data and operationalizations
available will be sufficient to answer the research question. With motivations
regarding operationalizations and validity presented, follows next a summary of the
entire methodology.

3.4 Summary of the methodology
This chapter has motivated the methodological approach of this study in relation to the
specified research question, looking at the views of the population on legitimacy in a
conflict-torn societal context. Different research designs have different strengths and
weaknesses, which are needed to take into account when deciding on how to answer a
research question. Alternative designs such as experimental and qualitative
comparative design have been presented. Experimental design has the strong suit of
being the closest possible option to turning back time and observing relationships
regarding cause and effect, providing a high internal validity. However, experimental
design has the disadvantage of suffering from low external validity since recreating
the circumstances to accurately represent the “real-life” situation is close to
impossible. Qualitive comparative design has the strength of describing causality in a
profound manner regarding a few cases. This however has the disadvantage when
trying to generalize the results in a wider context, since the same causality might not
be relevant outside of the few cases studied using comparative design. The research
design finally chosen for this thesis is a case study design using repeated crosssectional data, which enables statistical analysis. Case study design is chosen partially
since finding suitable data to conduct a comparative study proved challenging. The
deep focus of the case study enables research into complex phenomena, while the
repeated cross-sectional data enables generalizations to the entire relevant population.
However, reservations are needed regarding generalizations pertaining from the low
external validity of the design, while questions regarding reliability is also needed to
be considered concerning the data-gathering process.
The data used in the analysis is the repeated cross-sectional data of Böhnke et al.
(2017). The data (N = 12,428) was collected through interviews with heads of families
in the provinces of Kunduz and Takhar in northeast Afghanistan. The communities
and households involved were chosen through both representativity and
randomization. The respondents are almost entirely male with a mean age of 46 years.
A significant number of ethnic groups are represented, and the sample has a literacy
level of 21 %. The diverse societal context in combination with the international
counterinsurgent force in the region presents excellent grounds to analyze the data
within the demarcations of the study.

57

Kim Backström
To enable an analysis of the data, are operationalizations conducted on the survey
questions in relation to the theoretical definitions of the sources of legitimacy. Three
suitable survey questions are assigned per legitimacy source. The internal reliability
test Cronbach’s alpha gave results between 0.411 and 0.701, which is needed to be
considered in the analysis. Questions regarding the representation of the views of the
population in the decision-making process are assigned to the category input
legitimacy. Output legitimacy is assigned questions regarding the quality and quantity
of the decisions made by the political institution. Throughput legitimacy is assigned
questions regarding the transparency and process between input and output. External
legitimacy is assigned questions regarding the influence of international actors towards
domestic actors. Traditional legitimacy is assigned questions regarding the influence
of tradition and norms on decision-making. Charismatic legitimacy is assigned
questions regarding the influence of individual characters in a societal context.
This summary concludes the methodological chapter, providing a motivation
regarding the choices of research design, data and operationalizations. Next follows
the analysis of the data using the described methodology.

4 Results
This chapter presents the findings of the empirical analyses. Two different tests are
done on data from three waves, described in chapter 3.1, using SPSS to produce the
results later analyzed. The One-Way ANOVA test is conducted to compare variances,
more specifically by looking at the mean result using scales. The chi-square test is
conducted to describe the distribution of shares of the data. The tests are categorized
according to the earlier described sources of legitimacy. The results are then described
systematically in each sub-chapter, ending with a summary describing the overall
levels and trends of the results, finally enabling a summary discussion about the results
in relation to the research question and the theoretical framework.

4.1 Input
Input legitimacy focuses on the ability of the people to be involved in the decisionmaking affecting their everyday life. Table 6 below looks at which types of institutions
people would go to if they feel as if a decision made by the district government is not
correct.

a higher input legitimacy. See q20 in Appendix A for the phrasing of the question.

Table 6 shows that the input legitimacy of governmental institutions are consistent
over all three waves, while societal institutions on the other hand have lost a significant
amount of input legitimacy. Patronage seems to have replaced some of the legitimacy
of societal institutions over the course of the surveys. The overall trend of small
changes show that population values do not change quickly, since which institution

59

Kim Backström
people turn when wronged do not change significantly over time. Table 7 below looks
closer at the shura which is a societal grassroots institution.

χ2=1,721.510 (df=1) p<.001. Percentages shows number of respondents who agreed with the different
questions. See q31 and q32 in Appendix A for the phrasing of the question.

Table 7 paints a different picture than table 6 regarding societal institutions. While
table 6 shows a decreased importance in societal institutions, table 7 shows a consistent
strong involvement of the shura in development projects. This discrepancy most likely
derives from differences in what is expected from different institutions, e.g. conflicts
of interest are usually not associated with societal institutions. This in turn is portrayed
by the lower Cronbach’s alpha level of the input operationalization. The results of table
7 implies strong input legitimacy since the grassroots level institution is involved in
development projects, which have a direct impact on the lives of the affected
population. While the fact that the shura is involved in development projects remains
constant, the reason as to which projects are chosen vary between the waves. The
democratic choice is the most common reason in all three waves as to why a
development project is chosen. This implies a strong grassroots level input legitimacy,
especially since the influence of strong households in the decision-making is overall
low and has even decreased over time. The most radical change is that of the
involvement of international actors. They appear to have a stronger impact on which
project is chosen or not than individual powerful households. However, in 2011 a
significant increase appears in the influence of international actors. The reason for this
might derive from varying circumstances of respondents between waves, or a change
in the manner of how development projects are conducted.
60

Kim Backström
The results provide an image of satisfying input legitimacy from a COIN or statebuilding perspective. While the institutional input of governmental institutions have
remained constant and patronage appears to have become more important, the
involvement of grassroots institutions in local level decision-making has remained
strong throughout and have even become more focused on democratic decisionmaking. The next section focuses on output legitimacy.

4.2 Output
Output legitimacy focuses on the quality and quantity of the policies and services
which are being produced by the political system. One example of this is the perceived
safety of the population, do they feel safe? This is portrayed below in table 8.

Table 8 shows that almost every respondent believes that their security level increased
in 2007. The trend of increasing safety smoothed out by 2011. Now the majority felt
that the security level had remained constant, while more respondents imagined a
security decrease over a security increase. By 2015 the results are more mixed, as most
respondents still have not experienced a change in security, while over a third again
have experienced a security increase and as many as in 2011 have experienced a
security decrease. Another aspect to consider is the possible effect of the sharp increase
in 2007, which might have saturated the security level and disabled a further positive
trend. These changes create the questions as to which actors have contributed
positively or negatively to the security level. This relationship is pictured below in
table 9.

influence on security and a low amount implies a negative impact on security. See q11 in Appendix A
for the phrasing of the question.

Table 9 shows that in 2007, during the largest increase in security, external actors have
the most positive impact on the security level, while governmental actors comes
second and societal actors appears to have had a negative impact on security. In 2011
the levels even out between the actors, mirroring the stagnation in overall security
increase. The Taliban and Mujahedin are now also included in the survey and receives
the lowest grade on security increase of the actors. This changes in 2015, when the
government has the lowest grade while societal institutions and the Taliban and
Mujahedin received similar scores. Only external actors again receive a higher score,
but not as high as in 2007 during the large increase in security. However, other services
are also indicative of the level of output legitimacy, portrayed in table 10 below.

Table 10 portrays views of the respondents on the impact of the government on
essential services. The overall trend is that the government have had a positive impact
on the services mentioned. However, it is important to keep in mind that the absolute
level of quality of the services can not be observed by this data, only the changes in
perceived quality. The services which are perceived to have increased the least in
quality are income opportunities and the creation of jobs, while services relating to
schooling, health care and infrastructure have been prioritized. This is interesting
considering services that drain government spending are prioritized over services
which would long-term stimulate economic growth and produce tax revenue.
The results concerning output legitimacy show that the perceived safety of the
population increased especially in the earlier waves. The actors mostly responsible for
this positive change were of an external character, while governmental, societal or
Taliban actors had a perceived moderate or even negative impact on security. Services
provided by the government increased overall in quality, with a focus on schooling,
health care and infrastructure over economic growth. The next section focuses on
throughput legitimacy.

4.3 Throughput
Throughput legitimacy focuses on the process between input and output, e.g. the
efficiency of the bureaucracy and the occurrence of corruption. One indicator of the
level of throughput legitimacy is which institution a person turns to in the case of a
conflict regarding natural resources, this is portrayed below in table 11.

Kim Backström
Patronage has been considered an important actor regarding conflict resolution, only
in 2007 were patrons not the most important actors when societal actors instead had
the highest score. Societal actors went from being the most important actor in 2007 to
almost totally unimportant in the two other measuring points. The reason for this might
be a validity issue, since the recoded societal variable consists of the local, community
and district shura, but the alternative of answering the local shura is only present in the
2007 wave. This is also indicative in the lower Cronbach’s alpha level of the
throughput operationalization. The government has become more important over time
and is by 2015 considered to be as important as patronage. This is positive from a
throughput perspective, since patronage is a form of corruption and has a negative
impact on throughput legitimacy. External actors and the Taliban have consistently
low numbers in all waves. The results of actor importance regarding conflict resolution
creates the question how the population views different means of influence. This is
portrayed in table 12 below.

The results show that, in the long run, wealth is considered to be a more effective
means of influence than ethnicity or kinship. This is especially interesting in the
societal context of a deeply traditional society. Different means of influence is further
investigated below in table 13.

The results of table 13 mirror the results of table 7 and table 12. Democratic principles
such as voting and elections have a constantly high level of importance regarding
decision-making in the shura. This is mirrored in the fact that all statements that imply
a lower level of throughput legitimacy have experienced a decreasing trend during the
surveys. The results of table 12 are also mirrored in the fact that wealth is considered
more important than ethnicity. The influence of individuals is consistently low and
furthermore experiences a decline between the three survey waves.
The analysis provides some conflicting results regarding throughput legitimacy. On
one hand, patronage has been and continues to be an important tool when conducting
conflict resolution. On the other hand, who is represented in grassroots institutions is
mostly determined by elections. However, the democratic aspect of said elections is
unclear. Wealth appears to be the most important aspect in having influence on other
actors, with kinship and ethnical belonging being the second most important, and force
being ranked the least important aspect. The next section focuses on external
legitimacy.

4.4 External
External legitimacy focus on the relationship of international actors in relation to the
political system. The relationship of external actors both regarding the host nation and

65

Kim Backström
the population is of interest. The former relationship is investigated closer in table 14
below which portrays the level of fear of the population towards COIN forces.

The results of table 14 portray a trend of increasing fear among the population towards
foreign forces. This trend correlates with the results of table 8 and table 9 which look
at the overall change in security level and which actors have what kind on influence
regarding security change. 2007 includes a low fear towards COIN forces, a significant
increase in the overall security level, and external actors are perceived to have had the
most positive impact on this trend. The correlation continues in 2011 which has the
highest level of fear of the population towards the COIN forces. Simultaneously the
overall security level is perceived to have decreased by 20 % of respondents and the
positive impact of external forces on security change has decreased significantly
according to table 8. This trend evens out in all three tables by 2015.
While physical safety is one of the most fundamental services to be provided which
enable legitimacy, further legitimacy increase requires the affording of also other
services. This is portrayed below in table 15 in relation to services provided by
international development organizations.

Table 15 shows that international development organizations have had a positive
impact especially regarding fundamental services such as clean drinking water,
schooling and health services. Other basic services such as agricultural production,
electricity and infrastructure are also portrayed in a positive light. The services with
the least positive trends are the creation of jobs and income opportunities. Short-term
solutions are prioritized by NGO:s, while services which create self-dependency does
not have the same positive output. The continuous trend of a positive increase in
services from 2007 to 2015 with a downturn in 2011 can once more be observed.
Data regarding services provided by international forces was also analyzed. However,
the lack of data from all three waves together with a low N lead to a low level of
significance. The existing data from 2011 and 2015 indicate an almost inexistent view
that international COIN forces have had a positive impact on basic services. The most
positive results were in 2011, when 6 % (N=182) of respondents stated that
international forces had had a positive impact on schooling and 3.3 % (N=101) on
health services. All other data shows a positive view on services which never exceeds
1 % of respondents.
The results indicate that even if international COIN forces have had a positive impact
on the overall security level, they have not had a positive impact on other services
which increase living standards. However, NGO:s have instead had a positive impact
67

Kim Backström
on the most basic of services like health care and clean water, while the impact of
NGO:s on income opportunities have been moderate at the most. An overall trend of
a positive impact by external actors can be seen, however with a recession in 2011.
The next section focuses on traditional legitimacy.

4.5 Traditional
Traditional legitimacy focuses on the beliefs in norms and tradition of the population.
This also works as an indicator of the level of postmaterialism among the population.
One way to measure traditional legitimacy is by scoping how the population would
react in the case of a break from tradition. This is portrayed below in table 16 in the
context of not participating in a hasher without reason.

question.

Table 16 indicates no extreme trends in population views on a break from tradition.
Someone who would break from tradition would be most likely subjected to
censorship, while it would be almost unthinkable to be totally excluded from the
community. The almost stagnant trend supports earlier presented evidence that
population values do not change rapidly or under a short amount of time. Another
measurement of traditional legitimacy can be seen below in table 17, which looks at
the views of respondents on statements regarding tradition.

Table 17 indicates the same results as table 16. Values stay mostly the same over all
three measuring points, e.g. the trend of the views of the population on the added value
of state schooling. The education of boys is perceived to be more important than the
education of girls, indicating the traditional aspect of society. The same goes for the
inclusion of women into the workforce. However, one clear deviation can be seen in
the effect of external actors on the values of the local community. External actors are
over time viewed as more of a threat to local values, even when material benefits are
gained. COIN forces are once again portrayed in a worse light than international
NGO:s, mirroring the results of chapter 4.4.
The results indicate that traditional legitimacy have remained almost constant over all
measuring points. The views of the respondents indicate that the have a traditional
69

Kim Backström
character, e.g. there are likely some consequences from the community towards a
family in the event of a break from tradition and the education of boys is perceived to
be more important than the education of girls. Traditional legitimacy also mirrors the
characteristics of diffuse support since local values are deemed to be more important
than help from external actors, especially help from international COIN forces. The
next section focuses on charismatic legitimacy.

4.6 Charismatic
Charismatic legitimacy focus on the beliefs of the population in the abilities of an
individual, also involving levels of charisma and patronage. Table 6 indicated that
patronage is the most important tool to use when feeling wronged by the district
government. This raises the question regarding which services influential patrons
provide to the population. This is portrayed in table 18 below.

Table 18 indicates that there is a low output in services from influential persons. The
table also depicts consistently low levels regarding all listed services and a stagnated
trend over time, the exception being the provision of electricity in 2011. The
discrepancy between the perceived importance of patronage and the actual output of
patrons might be explained by the fact that patrons influence the decision-making of
other actors, while the patrons do not directly themselves provide better services.
70

Kim Backström
Another explanation might be that of diffuse support, rooted in a traditional view of
the importance of certain individuals whose objective output directly translates into a
representative output of services. However, this raises the question from where patrons
draw influence. This relationship is portrayed in table 19 below.

the reason for the influence of an influential person. See q24 in Appendix A for the phrasing of the
question.

Table 19 shows that most of the reasons for influence do not change considerably over
time, e.g. having an education, being a government or NGO official. However, the
importance of hard power – i.e. economy and military – has increased (Nye, 2004, 5).
This is mirrored in the fact that the importance of soft power – i.e. diplomacy and
culture – has decreased, which can be seen in the increased importance in being
elected, while being a spiritual or community leader has decreased in importance.
These trends indicate a deviation from political stability under both democratic and
traditional principles.
Patronage through the influence of individuals has not only remained strong but even
increased over time. The actual output of patrons is however questionable, which
might pertain from reasons such as indirect influence on services or diffuse support
from the population. The reasons that make a patron influential has changed somewhat
over time, favoring hard sources over soft sources. The next section provides a general
summary of the results presented.

4.7 Summary of the results
The results of the statistical analyses are here portrayed categorically according to the
different sources of legitimacy. This enables a structured comparison between
different sources of legitimacy and actors, while also enabling comparisons of absolute
numbers and trends over time.
Instrumental legitimacy includes rational forms of legitimacy, i.e. input, output,
throughput and external, based on human needs and services. The analysis of input
legitimacy shows a constantly strong involvement of grassroots societal institutions in
the decision-making process, indicating a positive result. However, the input levels of
governmental actors, while proportionally important, have remained stagnant over
time while patronage has increased in importance. Output legitimacy increases greatly
at the first measuring point, but later on stagnates or is even to some degree perceived
to decline. External actors have the most positive impact on security, especially at the
first measuring point when the security level increases greatly on a general level.
Services provided by the government, while initially at very low absolute levels, have
increased greatly over time. Patronage, primarily based around wealth, is an ongoing
important phenomenon indicating low throughput legitimacy. However, grassroots
institutions are consistently involved in relevant development projects. External actors
had an especially positive impact on the security level in 2007, while later on loosing
this portrayal. In the context of other services provided, COIN forces are seen in an
especially negative light, while NGO:s instead have had an especially positive impact
on the provision of basic services.
Substantive legitimacy involves the norms and values of the population, which in turn
determine the expectations of the population towards the services provided which are
included in instrumental legitimacy. Traditional legitimacy remained largely constant
throughout the study. Respondents displayed views pertaining from traditional values
revolving around the importance of following tradition and roles within the
community. The most considerable changes in values over time were an increasing
dissent towards external actors, with the motivation of protecting local values. This
value change was also portrayed in the context of potential material gain when
cooperating with external actors, indicating traditional values and perhaps also diffuse
support. Charismatic legitimacy is portrayed through the level of importance of
patronage. While the actual output of services provided by patrons is questionable, the
72

Kim Backström
support for patrons have remained strong. The underlying reasons for this might be to
this study hidden outputs of patrons. The trend of what makes a patron influential
shows that military power and economic wealth has become more important than
culture, religion and democratic elections.
This concludes the summary of the findings. The next chapter aims to answer the
research question by discussing the results in the context of the theoretical framework.

5 Discussion and conclusions
This chapter provides a summary of the thesis up to this point and presents a discussion
which aims to put the results in the context of the theoretical framework. This should
enable conclusions regarding the answering of the research question. The thesis is
concluded with a discussion regarding flaws and criticism of the thesis along with
future research opportunities and some final remarks.

5.1 Summary
The Global War on Terrorism has highlighted the need for legitimacy in state-building
when conducting counterinsurgency operations. This lesson has been received on a
theoretical level by external actors, e.g. seen through FM 3-24 (2014). However, the
implementation of the doctrine has been lacking in efficiency, portrayed through the
immense amount of resources used in fighting the insurgencies. The purpose of this
thesis was to give an insight into what affects legitimacy in conflict-torn spaces, with
a special focus on the relationship between values and services. The specified research
question is what are the views of the population on legitimacy in areas where
counterinsurgency operations have been conducted?
The theoretical framework focused on state-building through legitimacy in a conflicttorn context. Whether a political system is considered to be legitimate or not inherently
revolves around the values of the population. The values determine which services are
expected to be provided by the political system to the population. However, a hierarchy
exist following the logic presented by Maslow (1954). The most fundamental services
include physical and economic safety while secondary services include opportunities
for self-actualization. This theory is similar to other theories of human values
presented by Inglehart (1977) and Welzel (2013), who essentially claim that a higher
standard of living leads to more postmaterialist beliefs. However, value change does
not occur quickly, but slowly over a longer period of time even tough living-standards
have already increased. This creates the need for different characterizations of
legitimacy, especially in the context of a conflict-torn society which is far from
homogenous regarding values. The values and expectations towards the government
of a population living in a modern Weberian state are not the same as the values and
expectations of the population living in a hybrid state. Different sources of legitimacy
74

Kim Backström
were presented to account for the heterogeneity of the population. Instrumental types
of legitimacy described by Weber (1978) and Easton (1965) include types of
legitimacy based around the needs of the population. This is measured using the
definitions input (active citizenship), output (services provided), throughput
(efficiency and corruption) and external (international actors), presented by OECD
(2010), Scharpf (2010) and Schmidt (2013). Substantive legitimacy focus on the
values of the population, which is described though traditional and charismatic
(individuals) legitimacy also presented by Weber (1978) and Easton (1965). These
sources of legitimacy determine the overall level of legitimacy of the political system.
In the context of a conflict-torn space presents Weigand (2015) a number of variables
to also consider. Namely, multiple actors strive for dominance, discrepancies in
claimed and perceived legitimacy, the heterogeneity of the population, classifications
of support and resistance, and types of support which can be related to the
categorizations of Easton (1965) between diffuse and specific support. The
heterogeneity of the population is ever more important to consider in the context of
conflict-torn spaces and when conducting counterinsurgency operations.
Different research designs are considered, weighing their strengths and weaknesses. A
repeated cross-sectional study using case study design was chosen. This methodology
has the strength of deeply studying a complex phenomena but requires caution when
conducting generalizations. The data is collected by Böhnke et al. (2017) during the
years of 2007 to 2015 and the total number of respondents is 12 428. Survey questions
are operationalized according to the different sources of legitimacy. Cronbach’s alpha
was conducted to determine the level of internal reliability of the operationalizations.
Input legitimacy results show a strong involvement of societal institutions in decisionmaking. Input on a governmental level is on a relative level important, but the trend
has remained stagnant over time. Output legitimacy results indicate an initial sharp
improvement in security which afterwards stagnates or even declines in 2011. External
actors are perceived to be extra important initially but afterwards declines in popularity
to similar levels as societal and governmental actors. Services provided by the
government are initially at low levels, but portray a positive trend. Throughput
legitimacy indicates the importance of both patronage and societal institutions.
Patronage is based primarily around economic and military influence, which is
surprising in the context of a deeply traditional society. External legitimacy results
75

Kim Backström
indicate sharp changes. COIN forces and NGO:s are initially viewed in a very positive
light, increasing the security level and providing basic services. This changes
especially in the case of COIN forces over time, since they are viewed in a more
negative light and are to some degree viewed to have a negative impact on both the
security level and the values of the community. The values of the respondents do not
change considerably over the scope of the study. Tradition is portrayed to be an
important aspect of everyday life, and a break from tradition result in negative
consequences. Patrons are considered to be important even though the results show
them to not be a large contributor of services. However, the underlying reason to the
influence of patrons might likely stem from influencing other actors leading to gains
to clients indirectly. The concept of diffuse support is also necessary to take into
account when dealing with substantive legitimacy.
This concludes the summary of the purpose, theoretical framework, methodology and
results of this thesis. Next follows a discussion of the results in relation the theories
presented earlier in the thesis to answer the research question.

5.2 Discussion
The results of the statistical analysis portray a number of interesting trends regarding
legitimacy in the context of state-building through counterinsurgency in Afghanistan.
The complexity of both the phenomenon of legitimacy and the complex societal
situation of the respondents provide a multifaceted answer to the research question and
requires an analysis.
The majority of the types of legitimacy has not undergone considerable changes, while
output and external legitimacy are the two exceptions. One explanation to this is
grounded in the theoretical framework regarding value change. Pure types of
instrumental legitimacy are easier to manipulate in a short amount of time, while
substantive types of legitimacy together with input and throughput legitimacy are
considerably more stable since they are more closely linked to the values of the
population. For example, it is easier for actors to improve the accessibility of
healthcare, education and clean water than it is to change the views of the population
regarding their views on the legitimacy of democratic elections. In other words, the
results support the theory of Inglehart (1977) that even if the living-standards of a
76

Kim Backström
population increases does the values of the population not become more postmaterial
in the same amount of time. A deeply traditional society clings to their customs which
values societal institutions more than democratic elections and political institutions.
Behavior that would be considered corruption in a Weberian state would in the societal
context of a traditional society, e.g. Northeastern Afghanistan, be considered
legitimate patronage.
Some views on counterinsurgency regarding the results of the study. Kilcullen (2010)
proposes a metric of success where the actions of different actors are compared,
namely the population, host nation, external actors and insurgents. The actions relevant
to compare are the outputs of the different actors in comparison to the perceived effects
of the actions among the population. All of these actors and relevant actions are
portrayed in the results. The importance of the values of the population are again
highlighted. Even if the output of the host nation and external actors are largely
positive are the views of the population towards these two actors over time either
stagnant or a somewhat more negative than in the beginning of the study. The goals of
counterinsurgency operations are mirrored by Fukuyama (2004) and Acemoglu and
Robinson (2012) who both highlight the importance of institutions. The end-goal is to
transition from extractive institutions, indicative of traditional political systems with
unclear law and order, to inclusive institutions which favor pluralism and growth along
the lines of modern Weberian political systems. However, it should be underlined that
democracy promotion to create fully inclusive institutions is a long-term goal. The
reason having already been stated above; population values change only over a long
period of time. Longer involvement is needed to cement long-term economic growth
to a Weberian political system which would enable stable grounds for legitimacy.
The challenges of creating inclusive institutions are portrayed through the discrepancy
between values and legitimacy in counterinsurgency operations. Wiechnik (2012, 2930) highlights this issue and comments on COIN doctrine that “which form of
legitimacy the people will embrace […]. It was a question we [the US military] were
not previously required to ask because U.S. policy had always dictated the answer”,
democracy promotion. However, the US Department of Defense appears to have
realized the importance of the values of the population in the context of legitimacy.
This is illustrated by the highlighted importance of population values in the updated
version of FM 3-24 (2014) in comparison to the earlier version of the doctrine. True
77

Kim Backström
legitimacy requires not only output and external support, but also actions that build
substantive legitimacy. The effects of legitimacy building actions are grounded in the
values of the population, e.g. whether the implementation of democratic elections is
seen as a positive change or foreign meddling that corrupts local customs. This
concludes the discussion of the results in the context of the research question and the
theoretical framework. The next section provides some reflections on the limitations
of the study.

5.3 Limitations and future directions
One discrepancy between the findings of this thesis and the findings of Böhnke et al.
(2017, 9) worth discussing is the portrayed impact of different actors on security. This
thesis portrays the impacts of all four actors as quite equal, while Böhnke et al. (2017)
presents the impact of the government on security in a very positive aspect. This stems
from a difference in operationalizations and the type of analysis conducted. Böhnke et
al. (2017) separate the impact of different types of law-enforcement from the
government, while this thesis has all governmental institutions categorized together.
The reasoning for the operationalization used in this thesis is to categorize overhanging
actors together, which enables a consistent comparison regarding all sources of
legitimacy. This together with the usage of sum variable analysis might hide sub-level
differences within the operationalizations but instead enables a more effectively
analyzed overview when all sub-level actors are grouped together logically. However,
it would be justifiable to reconsider the strengths and weaknesses of the
operationalizations when conducting future research.
Furthermore, a deeper understanding of the societal context would be of benefit. The
line between societal and political institutions is vague in the Afghan context. A deeper
understanding would also shed some light on who of the respondents fell off from
answering the surveys, and the underlying reasons. The quantitative data used in this
thesis would benefit from supplementing qualitative data, e.g. the associated
interviews also conducted by Böhnke et al. (2017). A more multifaceted data material
would enable further generalizations and tests of the theories presented. The current
data is gathered from only a small area and this should be kept in mind when analyzing

78

Kim Backström
the results and conclusions of the thesis. Future research in this area of focus will
hopefully enable future insights, both in depth and in relation to other cases.

5.4 Concluding remarks
The difficulties of legitimacy building are highlighted throughout the thesis. Shortterm instrumental actions are not enough when trying to conduct long-term statebuilding. The values of the population also need to be considered, since they decide
on the positive and negative effects of legitimacy building actions. This thesis has
given a deeper insight into what are the views of the population on legitimacy in areas
where counterinsurgency operations have been conducted. However, more research is
needed to further demarcate the effects of different legitimacy building actions in
different contexts.

6 Summary in Swedish – Svensk sammanfattning
Avhandlingens svenska titel är Legitimitet i kris – En studie av legitimitet i
upprorsbekämpningsoperationer. Kriget mot terrorismen har understrukit hur viktigt
legitimitet är i statsbyggande under upprorsbekämpningsoperationer. Detta har externa
aktörer förstått på ett teoretiskt plan, exempelvis genom den amerikanska doktrinen
FM 3–24 (2014). Däremot har implementeringen på det praktiska planet inte uppnått
önskad verkan. Detta exemplifieras av det osäkra läget i operationsområdena i
kombination med den oerhörda mängd resurser som använts i upprorsbekämpningens
syfte. Målet med denna avhandling är att ge en inblick i vad som påverkar legitimitet
i konfliktområden. Speciellt fokus läggs på förhållandet mellan värderingar och
tjänster. Avhandlingens specificerade frågeställning är: vad är befolkningens syn på
legitimitet i områden där upprorsbekämpningsoperationer har pågått?
Huruvida ett politiskt system anses vara legitimt eller inte kretsar kring befolkningens
värderingar. Värderingarna bestämmer vilka tjänster som befolkningen förväntas få
från det politiska systemet. Tjänsterna kan enligt Maslow (1954) i sin tur kategoriseras
i olika nivåer. De mest grundläggande tjänsterna kretsar kring fysisk och ekonomisk
säkerhet, medan sekundära tjänster omfattar olika former av självförverkligande.
Denna teori anknyter till teorierna om människans värderingar som Inglehart (1977)
och Welzel (2013) presenterar, nämligen att en högre levnadsstandard på lång sikt
leder till mera postmaterialistiska värderingar (se tabell 2). Denna förändring i
värderingar sker med en fördröjning, så även om befolkningens levnadsstandard ökar
snabbt finns det inga garantier för att deras värderingar utvecklas på motsvarande vis.
Även om en befolkning är långt ifrån homogen återfinns även logiken gällande vad
som innebär legitimitet i de politiska systemens sammansättning. Befolkningen i en
modern demokratisk rättsstat har inte samma förväntningar på sin regering som
befolkningen som lever i en mera traditionell hybridstat. Se tabell 3 för skillnaden i
karaktärsdrag mellan dessa två typer av politiska system och figur 1 för normers och
värderingars inverkan på vad som anses vara legitimt. Detta skapar ett behov av en
kategorisering över vad som skapar legitimitet. Kategoriseringen är extra viktig i
kontexten av ett instabilt konfliktdrabbat område. Instrumentella former av legitimitet
beskrivs av Weber (1978) och Easton (1965). Se tabell 1 för kategoriseringen av
Eastons (1965) former av legitimitet. Det gemensamma karaktärsdraget är att
instrumentella former av legitimitet fokuserar på befolkningens behov. Följande
80

Kim Backström
underkategorisering av instrumentell legitimitet används baserat på OECD (2010),
Scharpf (2010) och Schmidt (2013): input (aktivt medborgarskap), output (tjänster
som förmedlas), throughput (effektivitet och korruption) och extern (internationella
aktörer). Den andra överordnade kategorin är substantiv legitimitet som fokuserar på
befolkningens värderingar och normer. Underkategoriseringen som tillämpas på
substantiv legitimitet baseras även på Weber (1978) och Easton (1965) enligt
kategorierna traditionell och karismatisk (tilltron till individer) legitimitet. Figur 3
beskriver den överordnade kategoriseringen av olika former av legitimitet.
Befolkningens heterogenitet är ännu viktigare att ta i beaktande i den social kontexten
av konfliktområden och under upprorsbekämpningsoperationer. Weigand (2015)
beskriver legitimitet i konfliktområden i närmare detalj, medan Kilcullen (2006 &
2010) fokuserar på upprorsbekämpning (se figur 2).
Olika möjliga forskningsdesigner presenteras och deras respektive styrkor och
svagheter vägs mot varandra. Fördelen med experimentell design är att designen har
en hög intern validitet, men har samtidigt låg extern validitet. En undersökning med
jämförande design har goda möjligheter att förklara kausalitet, men kräver lämpligt
jämförbara fall och resultatet kan inte generaliseras till en större kontext. En upprepad
tvärsnittsundersökning i form av en fallstudie valdes för denna avhandling. Styrkan
med designen är att den möjliggör en djupdykning i ett invecklat fenomen. Samtidigt
kvarstår begränsningar gällande generaliserbarhet. Enkätmaterialet är insamlat av
Böhnke med flera (2017) i nordöstra Afghanistan under åren 2007 till 2015 med totalt
12 428 respondenter. Se figur 4 för en visualisering av undersökningens data.
Lämpliga enkätfrågor ur materialet är utvalda och operationaliserade enligt de tidigare
behandlade formerna av legitimitet. Testet Cronbachs alfa utfördes för att bestämma
operationaliseringarnas interna reliabilitet. Tabell 4 beskriver enkätmaterialet medan
tabell 5 beskriver operationaliseringarna och resultatet från reliabilitetstestet. Se bilaga

Resultatredovisningen sker kategoriskt enligt de olika formerna av legitimitet.
Resultaten för input-legitimitet (tabell 6–7) tyder på en stark inblandning av
samhälleliga institutioner i relevant beslutsfattande. Input på myndighetsnivå är viktigt
i förhållande till andra aktörer, men trenden är stagnerad över tid. Resultaten för
output-legitimitet (tabell 8–10) tyder på en inledningsvis stark förbättring av det
81

Kim Backström
allmänna säkerhetsläget. Denna trend avtar däremot över tid och resultatet tyder även
på en försämring av det allmänna säkerhetsläget mot slutet av undersökningsperioden.
Externa aktörer ses inledningsvis som viktiga i förbättrandet av säkerhetsläget, men
tappar med tiden popularitet och likställs med samhälleliga aktörer och
myndighetsaktörer. De tjänster som myndigheterna erbjuder befolkningen är
inledningsvis få, men genomgår en över tid stark positiv trend. Resultaten för
throughput-legitimitet (tabell 11–13) understryker betydelsen av beskyddarskap och
samhälleliga institutioner. Beskyddarskap baseras huvudsakligen på ekonomiskt och
militärt inflytande trots den starkt traditionella samhälleliga kontexten. Resultatet för
extern legitimitet (tabell 14–15) tyder på tvära förändringar. Opinionen gällande
internationella upprorsbekämpningstrupper varierar mest. Upprorsbekämparna ses
först ha en positiv inverkan på säkerhetsläget, men med tiden anses de ha en negativ
inverkan både på säkerheten och på lokala värderingar medan synen på icke-statliga
organisationer är mera positiv. Resultaten för traditionell legitimitet (tabell 16–17)
genomgår inga kraftiga förändringar. Tradition framförs som en viktig del av
vardagen, vilket illustreras av att ett brott mot traditionen troligen resulterar i negativa
konsekvenser. Resultaten för karismatisk legitimitet (tabell 18–19) tyder på att
beskyddarskap är viktigt, samtidigt som beskyddare inte står för en betydande mängd
tjänster. Den underliggande orsaken till beskyddares inflytande kan grundas i att
påverka andra aktörer och i sin tur ha en indirekt inverkan på tjänster. Resultatet av
substantiv legitimitet tyder på att fenomenet diffust stöd som presenteras av Easton
(1965) även bör tas i beaktande.
Resultaten ger ett spretigt svar på forskningsfrågan. Majoriteten av formerna av
legitimitet har inte genomgått större förändringar, medan exempelvis output och extern
legitimitet har genomgått betydligt större kast. Förklaringen till detta grundas i att
renodlade former av instrumentell legitimitet är mera benägna att förändras på kort tid,
medan substantiva former av legitimitet samt input och throughput är mycket mera
stabila eftersom de är kopplade till befolkningens värderingar. Det är exempelvis
betydligt lättare för aktörer att tillföra hälsovård, utbildning och rent vatten än att
påverka befolkningens värderingar. Resultatet stöder Ingleharts (1977) teori om att
även om befolkningens levnadsstandard ökar snabbt blir inte befolkningens
värderingar lika snabbt mera postmaterialistiska. Ett djupt traditionellt samhälle håller
fast vid sina värderingar där samhälleliga institutioner är viktigare än demokratiska val
82

Kim Backström
och politiska institutioner. Något som skulle anses vara korruption i en västerländsk
rättsstat anses fortsättningsvis vara legitimt beskyddarskap i ett traditionellt samhälle,
exempelvis i nordöstra Afghanistan. Den diskrepans mellan mål i upprorsbekämpning
och befolkningens värderingar som resultatet antyder på är något som även Wiechnik
(2012) lyfter fram. Även USA:s försvarsmakt verkar ha tagit till sig denna lärdom
eftersom den uppdaterade versionen av FM 3–24 (2014) i förhållande till den tidigare
versionen (FM 3–24, 2006) lägger ett större fokus på befolkningens värderingar i
kontexten av legitimitet. Fortsatt forskning borde överväga förändringar av
operationaliseringarna, eftersom en viss diskrepans uppstod mellan avhandlingens
resultat och Böhnke med fleras (2017) resultat. Vidare skulle en ännu djupare
förståelse för den lokala samhälleliga kontexten vara av fördel. Gränsen mellan
samhälleliga och politiska institutioner är otydlig i den afghanska kontexten. En
komplettering av andra former av data vore även till fördel för att kunna styrka det
kvantitativa materialet som användes i denna avhandling. Data från andra liknande fall
skulle möjliggöra vidare generaliseringar gällande synen på legitimitet bland
befolkningen i områden där upprorsbekämpningsoperationer har pågått.

Appendix A – Operationalization of the data
The main data used in the analysis is collected via repeated cross-sectional surveys by
Böhnke et al. (2017). The data was then operationalized according to the different
sources of legitimacy presented in the theoretical framework. A first thinning of the
survey questions was conducted to exclude questions not at all relevant to the study.
A second thinning was conducted afterwards, eliminating questions which were only
asked at certain waves. This in turn led to the compiling of all possible usable
questions. An overview of the amount of questions and in relation to which source of
legitimacy can be seen in table A1 below, while all the relevant questions as a whole
can be viewed in table A2. Finally, were a smaller amount of expedient questions
chosen to be used in the analysis.
