Preface

This version of the master thesis is a shortened version. According to general public
disclosure guidelines of Owens Corning, the client for this thesis, most of the thesis
is business critical and cannot be published under any circumstances.

This master thesis has been done with at the Laboratory of Thermal and Flow
Engineering at the Faculty of Science and Engineering, Åbo Akademi University. The
initiative for the thesis came from the Paroc Group Oy. The company produces
insulation wool and other products, which are related to insulation. They have been
designing a new method for producing stone wool, and the thermal and flow
conditions in the new production unit was of interest for a proper design. During the
writing process, Paroc Group Oy became a part of Owens Corning, also an insulation
manufacturer.
I want to thank Professor Henrik Saxén who was my supervisor and PhD Mikko Helle
who helped me with the simulations. I also want to thank the project team for the
project, especially project leader Ismo Kuokkanen, and my supervisors Peter Solin
and Martin Slotte from Paroc Oy Ab for patience and cooperation. Finally, yet
importantly, I want to thank my friends for encouraging and believing in me.

About Paroc Group
Paroc Group is an international and leading manufacturer of energy-efficient stone
wool insulation products in the Baltic Sea region (Paroc 1, 2017). The head office is
located in Helsinki, Finland. Paroc has a few cornerstones in its operations:
sustainable development, constant innovation, profitable growth and customer and
personnel orientation (Paroc 1, 2017).
Paroc produces different types of insulation products: building insulation, marine and
offshore insulation, technical insulation and acoustic products (Paroc 1, 2017).
Building insulation and acoustic products include solutions for different types of
customers and buildings and are mainly used for sound, thermal and fire insulation.
Technical insulation offers value-added solutions for sound, thermal, fire and
condensation insulation in buildings (HVAC), ship structures, industrial equipment
(OEM), piping and industrial processes (Paroc 1, 2017).

1. The Production Process
The production processes for mineral wool vary. The biggest differences between the
processes are in the fiberisation technique. A few different techniques of producing
stone wool and glass wool are presented in section 2.3. Fiberisation. Otherwise, the
steps are similar within the processes. The production steps are raw material input,
melting, fiberisation, binding, curing, cutting, packaging and storing (Gros, 2007). The
last step is waste management, which is as important as the other steps.

1.1. Raw material

Various types of raw materials are used in mineral wool manufacturing. A few
percent’s change of components leads to products which have different features. The
main raw materials for stone wool are rock and/or recycled material and other
specific small components such as potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate
(Eurima 2, 2011). In glass wool manufacturing sand, soda ash and limestone are used
as raw materials. Also recycled materials, such as bottle glass or windows, are used
in glass wool manufacturing (Eurima 2, 2011).
In general, raw materials are produced all over the world, for example in China. Paroc
buys its raw materials from Europe. They are transported to Finland with cargo
vessels and long-distance lorries. After arrival to the factory area, the raw materials
are stored outside in huge piles or in storage buildings before they are used in the
manufacturing process. In the production process, the raw materials are mixed by a
specific formula to achieve all desired product features.

1

1.2. Melting

In the beginning of the production process, the raw materials have to be melted.
There are different types of furnaces, such as cupola furnace and electric arc furnace,
which can be used for this process. The cupola furnace has a refractory lining and a
water-cooled shell refractor. The fuel used in cupola furnaces is coke, which is a
particulate product obtained by dry distillation of coal. The electric arc furnace has
three large graphite electrodes and these electrodes use alternating current for
melting the raw material. The melt in this process is electrically charged. When the
graphite electrodes are sunk in the melt, the melt will heat the raw material and melt
it (Gros, 2007).

1.3. Fiberisation

In the traditional method for producing glass wool, the melt flows through one
spinning disc (Figure 2). The fibres are formed by the melt because of the centrifugal
force, with or without the help of stripping air (B. Sirok, 2008). After this, the fibres
are directed to a conveyor belt and are mixed with a binder. In the stone wool
production process, there are several spinning discs by which the fibres are formed,
as seen in Figure 3. In TEL-fiberisation there is a combined system of techniques
which are used both in glass and stone wool production processes.

4,058,386, 1977)

1.4. Binding and Curing

After fiberisation small amounts of binding agents are added to the fibres, which
helps to build the desired bulk density and structure of the product (Eurima 2, 2011).
To harden the product the wool is heated in a curing oven to approximately 200 °C.

1.5. Cutting, Packaging and Storing

After curing, the mineral wool is cut to appropriate shape and size, usually into
quadrangles, rolls or into a shape the customer requires. The rest of the wool which

4

is not used, such as leftovers, is recycled, if possible. It is recommended to recycle
everything to avoid extra waste and to be more environmentally friendly.
Mineral wool can be compressed while packed due to its elasticity, which saves
storing and transporting space considerably. It also lowers the storing and
transporting costs when much more mineral wool can be stored/transported at the
same time. This has also a positive effect as it lowers the carbon emissions of the
supply chain. Packed products can be stored both in storage halls and outside. If they
are stored outside, the quality of the products must be checked before delivery to
the customer. If the plastic packing material around the product is broken and the
product has become wet, it is possible that the product quality is lower than for dry
products.

1.6. Waste Management

The production process of mineral wool causes carbon emissions. The environmental
impact is reduced with filters and after-burners, which clean the process gases. The
process uses also a large amount of cooling water and to save water, costs and
environment the cooling water is realised as a closed-circuit system. It means that
the same water circulates in the process and is cooled down as needed to maintain
an optimal temperature. A closed water circuit also guarantees that the potentially
dirty and polluted water does not contaminate the environment.
Mineral wool manufacturers try to minimise all kinds of rest materials that they
cannot recycle. Often the by-products and other waste can be used in some other
field of industry and in this way make the production processes more sustainable.

2. Mineral Wool
Mineral wool is the common name for two types of insulation wool, glass and stone
wool. Mineral wool is used as an insulation material in various areas. It has excellent
thermal properties, which supports the efforts in Europe to save energy and
therefore mitigate climate change (Eurima 1, 2011). Mineral wool also has other
major advantages. Thermal insulation is one if the main aspects of mineral wool, but
it also insulates against noise and slows down, or stops, the spread of fire. The stone
wool produced with this new technology and new melt recipes must fulfil different
criteria so that it can be sold as a safe product. Currently, there is little knowledge of
the new product’s solubility in human tissues. Other products produced by Paroc
already fulfil all the EU directives. During the test runs, which are presented in
Chapter 6, it was very important for all workers to use safety equipment, including
respirator masks to avoid breathing small fibres into the lungs. The general safety
certifications of mineral wool are listed in the next section.

2.1. Safety of mineral wool

Mineral wool is used as insulation material, so it must have different kinds of
certifications. The effect of fibres produced with traditional methods on humans has
been studied extensively. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),
which is part of the World Health Organisation (WHO) has classified the mineral wool
in line with European Union Directive 97/69/EC (Paroc Group 1, 2017). The directive
sets requirements on safety and health for man-made vitreous fibres (MMVF) and
states that “mineral wool fibres can be free of any suspicion of carcinogenicity if they
are bio-soluble” (EUR-Lex, 1997). The carcinogenicity of MMWF products is classified
according to the directive 97/69/EC into four categories:

6

1. Carcinogenic to humans
-

Asbestos

2. Probably carcinogenic
-

Ceramic fibre

3. Possibly carcinogenic
-

Not investigated insulation wools, those which are in research and
development

4. Cannot be classified as carcinogenic
-

Includes PAROC stone wool products

In accordance with the EU classifications, produced mineral wool dissolves “at an
acceptable rate” in the human body and that is why it can be labelled “non-classified”
(Paroc Group 1, 2017). When the product is non-classified, it also means that it is
considered non-carcinogenic. All products of Paroc fulfil the solubility requirements
because Paroc has modified the chemical composition of the fibres according to all
the regulations (Paroc Group 1, 2017).
There are different kinds of certifications and regulations that products produced by
Paroc have to fulfil. The certifications and regulations are EUCEB certification, RAL
Quality Mark and REACH regulation. The EUCEB and the REACH regulations are
general certifications in Europe, but RAL Quality Mark is only needed in Germany.

2.1.1. EUCEB certification

The European Certification Board for Mineral Wool (EUCEB) verifies the conformity
of the fibres in accordance to the directive 97/69/EC. The fibres are tested and if they
meet all the criteria, the producer of the product will be given the right by EUCEB to
put the EUCEB label on the packaging of the product (Paroc Group 1, 2017).

7

The criteria for the EUCEB certification are following and are listed on their web site
(EUCEB, 2017):
1. Legal undertaking
2. Manufacturer’s Declaration
3. Contract with Sampling Institute on test material sampling and monitoring of
self-control
4. Exoneration certificate of the Biopersistence test
5. Short term Biopersistence test report
6. Confirmation of scientific expert that the fibre complies with EUCEBexoneration criteria
7. Report of Analysis Institute on initial conformity inspection
8. Confirmation of scientific expert that initial conformity inspection complies
with EUCEB range of exonerated fibres

2.1.2. RAL Gütezeichen (Quality Marks)

RAL Deutches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung (in English: RAL –
German Institute for Quality Assurance and Certification) is a German certification
system for technical delivery conditions (RAL 1, 2017). Word RAL comes from German
words “Reichsausschus für Lieferbedingungen” which means in English the National
Board for Delivery Conditions (RAL 1, 2017). RAL Quality Marks were invented to
identify services and products that are provided or produced so that they fulfil all
quality criteria (RAL 2, 2017).
The reason why Paroc has RAL Quality Marks in its products is that in June 2000
Germany added a ban on the production, circulation and use of “bio-persistent
artificial mineral fibres” for technical insulation and for sound and heat absorption in
buildings (Paroc Group 1, 2017). The criteria for RAL Quality Mark in mineral wool are
8

not the same as in the European Directive 97/69/EU. When comparing mineral wool
fibres produced in accordance with the European criteria and with the German
exemption criteria, mineral wool fibres complying with the German criteria are more
bio-soluble than fibres which comply the European criteria. The Gütegemeinschaft
Mineralwolle (GGM) awards producers with the RAL Quality Marks and checks
continuously that mineral wool fibres meet all the regulations. GGM is an
independent body, a third party, which ensures that mineral wool products are safe
to use, cost efficient, sustainable and healthy for human systems (GGM, 2017).

2.1.3. REACH Regulation

The REACH regulation is one the regulations and certifications which Paroc follows.
The REACH regulation was published in the end of 2006 and entered into force in
June 2007 (European Commission 2, 2016). “REACH” is an abbreviation from words
Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restrictions of Chemicals (European
Commission, 2016). REACH regulation, EC/1907/2006, was created to improve earlier
identification of different chemical substances and their relevant properties. It also
means that the REACH regulation aims to improve the protection of human health
and also “to enhance innovation and competitiveness of the EU chemicals industry”
(European Commission, 2016). The ECHA, The European Chemicals Agency, which
manages all the aspects of the implementation of the REACH regulation, is located in
Finland, in Helsinki (European Commission 2, 2016).
Consumers have the right to know what all products contain, including products that
Paroc produces. Industrial products contain many different kinds of chemicals and
the amounts of the chemicals can be very high. Also, there can be incomplete
information about the chemicals and substances and, in worst case, they can be
hazardous for the human system and health and for the environment. The idea with
REACH regulation is that every information gap could be filled and, in that way,
ensure that workers in the industry have access to get all this knowledge and
information.

3. Heat Transfer Theory
Heat is an energy transfer between two bodies or media and occurs due to a
temperature difference (Benson, 2004). The heat is usually denoted by Q and can be
expressed by how much a body with mass m is heated, i.e., the temperature increase
ΔT experienced, if a certain quantity of heat is transferred to it
𝑄 = 𝑚𝑐𝛥𝑇

(1)

where c is the specific heat capacity of the body.
As exceptions to this rule, during absorption or release of heat the substance may
undergo a phase change without a temperature change. For such cases we can write
𝑄 = 𝑚𝐿

(2)

where L is called the latent heat and it depends on the material and the type of phase
change; for instance, Lv is the latent heat of vaporization and Lf is the latent heat of
fusion.
The first law of thermodynamics says that “the internal energy U of a system can be
changed either by the input of heat Q or by work W done by the system on its
surroundings” (Benson, 2004). The formula is
𝛥𝑈 = 𝑄 − 𝑊

(3)

Work W is negative in the expression because the system is doing the work; it would
be positive if work is added to the system.
In an adiabatic process, the entire system is isolated and there is no heat exchange
between with the environment, so 𝑄 = 0 and therefore 𝛥𝑈 = −𝑊. The only change
is in the internal energy and it corresponds to the work done by the system.

10

3.1. Conduction Heat Transfer
Energy is transferred by conduction when there is an energy transfer from a body or
a region with a higher temperature to a body or a region with a lower temperature,
and a material is involved in the heat transfer (Holman, 1997). In other words,
conduction occurs due to direct molecular collision between particles with different
kinetic energy. If the body or media is cold, particles are moving slowly (lower kinetic
energy) and if the body or media is warm, particles are moving rapidly (higher kinetic
energy). The heat transfer rate through conduction,
temperature gradient,

𝑑𝑇
𝑑𝑥

𝑑𝑄
𝑑𝑡

, is proportional to the

, and to the cross-sectional area, A (Benson, 2004). The

equation for heat transfer by conduction is called Fourier’s law
𝑑𝑄
𝑑𝑡

𝑑𝑇

= −𝜅𝐴 𝑑𝑥

(4)

where 𝜅 is the thermal conductivity which depends on the material. It measures the
ability of how well a material conducts heat. 𝜅 is a positive quantity, and often
𝑑𝑇

approximated to be constant (as in equation 4). Since A is positive as well, 𝑑𝑥 must be
negative to make

𝑑𝑄
𝑑𝑡

positive.

𝑑𝑄
𝑑𝑡

can also be denoted by q, so the equation can also

be written
𝑑𝑇

𝑞 = −𝜅𝐴 𝑑𝑥

(5)

In liquids and solids, conduction occurs by vibrational energy of the atoms.
When the system, for example of a bar where the heat is transferred, goes into a
stable condition and the temperature has a linear variation with the distance along
the bar, the equation can be also written as
𝑑𝑄
𝑑𝑡

= 𝜅𝐴

𝑇𝐻 −𝑇𝐿
𝐿

(6)

𝑇𝐻 here represents the high-end temperature and 𝑇𝐿 the low-end temperature, while
𝐿 is the length of the bar. Sometimes equation can be written as
𝑑𝑄
𝑑𝑡

=𝐴

∆𝑇
𝑅

(7)

11

where the 𝑅 is the thermal resistance of the sample. For the bar, it is calculated by
dividing the length by the thermal conductivity, i.e., 𝑅 = 𝐿/𝜅.
If there are several layers, for example two, of material the total heat conduction can
be calculated from
1 𝐿

𝐿

𝑑𝑄

∆𝑇1 + ∆𝑇2 = 𝐴 (𝜅1 + 𝜅2 ) 𝑑𝑡
1

(8)

2

The difference between this and equation 7 is that here the different layers have an
individual temperature difference and thermal resistance. In this system the
resistances are connected in series, so the total thermal resistance is the sum of all
individual R values.

3.2. Radiation Heat Transfer

Radiation is a way of energy transfer without any involved medium (Benson, 2004).
Every body will radiate heat to its surroundings, so even though a hot body will
radiate more on a cold, the cold body will also radiate on the hot. The total effect will
still be that more heat will be transported from the warmer body to the colder body.
According to thermodynamic considerations, an ideal thermal radiator, or so called
black body, emits energy “at a rate proportional to the fourth power of the absolute
temperature of the body and directly proportional to its surface area” (Holman,
1997). The equation for this is
𝑞=

𝑑𝑄
𝑑𝑡

= 𝑒𝜎𝐴𝑇 4

(9)

where 𝐴 is the surface area, 𝑇 is the temperature, and 𝜎 if the The Stefan-Boltzmann
constant, which has the value of 5,669x10-8 W/m2xK4. In equation (9), 𝑒 is called the
emissivity and depends on the nature of the surface and has a value between 0 and
1. If the emissivity approaches unity, the emission is maximum and the body behaves
like a black body. For example, a deep mat black surface has an emissivity of ~0.95
while that of a shiny metallic body is about 0.1 (Holman, 1997). If the emissivity is
12

low, the body reflects a lot vice versa. If equation 9 is presented without emissivity,
it is called the Stefan-Boltzmanns law of thermal radiation (Holman, 1997) which
applies to a perfectly black body.
A body is always an emitter and absorber in radiation heat transfer. If a small (convex)
body at 𝑇1 is surrounded by a large “surface” which is considerably bigger, at at
temperature 𝑇2 , the net rate of radiated heat by the body is
𝑞=

𝑑𝑄
𝑑𝑡

= 𝜀𝜎𝐴(𝑇14 − 𝑇24 ) (10)

Equation 10 is special case and does not apply in general. For more general cases the
net heat exchange by radiation has to be derived using view factors that express how
much of the outgoing emission from one body “hits” the other.

3.3. Convection Heat Transfer

In convection, the heat transfers in a fluid, for example water or air. This kind of heat
transfer is called convection (Gonzalez, 2015). In natural convection the motion of
the fluid is induced by the heat transfer, e.g., “the fluid above a hot surface expands,
becomes less dense, and rises” (Gonzalez, 2015). In convection heat transfer, the
heat transfers firstly by conduction and secondly by fluid flow because the energy
stored in the fluid moves with the fluid.
The equation for the overall effect of convection is
𝑞=

𝑑𝑄
𝑑𝑡

= ℎ𝐴(𝑇𝑤 − 𝑇∞ )

(11)

which is the same as Newton´s law of cooling (Holman, 1997).
In equation 11, 𝑇𝑤 is the temperature of a hot body which releases heat and 𝑇∞ is the
temperature of the bulk surrounding fluid. The quantity ℎ is the convection heat
transfer coefficient, which describes the efficiency of the heat transfer. Sometimes
the heat transfer coefficient is called the film conductance because it has a relation
13

in the conduction process at the wall surface in the thin stationary layer, the film, of
the fluid. The convection heat transfer coefficient ℎ can be calculated for limiting
cases and simple systems, but for most practical systems the only way to obtain its
value is to determine it experimentally.
The viscosity of the fluid has an effect on the convection heat transfer in addition to
the fluid’s thermal properties, such as specific heat and thermal conductivity
(Holman, 1997). The reason for this is that the velocity profile of the fluid is influenced
by viscosity and it also influences the energy transfer rate in the region nearby the
wall. The flow can be turbulent or laminar and it depends on the velocity and viscosity
of the fluid. The flow is laminar when the fluid flows in parallel layers without any
mixing and the fluid has low velocity and high viscosity. In turbulent flow, there are
unpredictable pressure and velocity changes and the fluid has high velocity and low
viscosity. Also, the fluid particle movement is chaotic in turbulent flow.
There are four different types of convection heat transfer: free convection, forced
convection, boiling and condensation (Holman, 1997). Free convection is just a
natural convection, in forced convection there is a forced fluid flow; boiling and
condensation are also natural phenomena.

14

4. Simulations

4.1. COMSOL Multiphysics

The simulations for this project were done with COMSOL Multiphysics version 5.3.
COMSOL Multiphysics is “The Platform for Physics-Based Modeling and Simulation”
(COMSOL Inc., 2017). COMSOL Multiphysics is a simulation tool for chemical, fluid
flow, electrical and mechanical applications. It is based on advanced numerical
methods for modelling problems based on physics and then simulating them.
COMCOL Multiphysics allows the user account for multiphysics or coupled
phenomena.
During this project, there were many of challenges with COMSOL because it was a
totally new program for the author. Furthermore, the computer was not effective
enough, so all the simulations had to be run on another computer, which was more
effective and had larger memory. This computer was, however, used by another
person so the runs could not be freely made.

15

5. Discussion
Fiberisation in stone wool production is a complicated process. Many different kinds
of parameters must be right so that the fibre is suitable for the wool production. In
shipbuilding it is very important to have light materials because otherwise the total
weight of the ship can be too high.
Stone wool production is heavily regulated because stone wool insulation is used in
construction work and therefore in contact with humans.
All these simulations and calculations give a somehow realistic picture of the
fiberisation process. Calculations done with MATLAB showed realistic values of heat
loss with different parameters. One of the challenges will be the cooling water. The
cooling water temperature will rise during the wool manufacturing, not much, but
enough and it must be cooled down again. The manufacturing process needs a lot of
cold water and if it possible to cool down the used cooling water, it will both save
manufacturing costs and environment.
