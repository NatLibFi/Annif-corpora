Networks in Men with Varying Degree of Sexual Dysfunction During First Sexual
Intercourse

Abstract:
The aim of the present study was to examine associations between sexual
difficulties during first experience of sexual intercourse and aggressive tendencies,
psychological distress, current sexual difficulties, childhood maltreatment, current
alcohol consumption and age of first sexual experience. The study utilized the
novel method of network analysis to examine the associations between the
multiple variables included. Data was collected from a large-scale Finnish
population-based study and consisted of questionnaire responses from 1,056
Finnish men. The participants were divided into three separate groups depending
on whether they had experienced sexual difficulties during first experience of
sexual intercourse or not (NP = no problems, PnP = problems that did not persist
and PP = problems that persisted). The study was explorative in nature, and the
main aim was to generate hypotheses about male sexual dysfunctions during first
intercourse. Two hypotheses were formulated. The first stated that an increase in
connectivity was to be expected from the NP to the PP group, which would be
evident by the PnP and PP groups having more associations between the different
nodes. The second hypothesis proposed a decrease in fragmentation from the NP
group to the PP groups, which would be supported by bigger and more
interconnected communities in the problem groups. The hypotheses were based on
the network theory of psychopathology, which suggests that a network with high
connectivity and low fragmentation has an increased vulnerability and a higher
risk of becoming self-sustaining.
No increase in connectivity was found between the networks, which was contrary
to the expectations stated in hypothesis one. However, structural differences
between the NP group and the PP group were found, as was a decrease in
fragmentation, lending support to hypothesis two. Visual inspections of the
network of the group that experienced persisting sexual difficulties found a
possible association between aggressive tendencies and sexual difficulties, going
through psychological distress. Future research could focus on clarifying the
associations between sexual difficulties and aggressive tendencies. This could be
done by using longitudinal data to examine whether aggressive tendencies cause
sexual difficulties or if early failures in sexual activities cause aggressive
tendencies later in life.

Titel: En nätverksanalys om manlig sexuell funktion: jämförande av
symptomnätverk hos män som upplevt varierande grad av sexuella dysfunktioner
under första samlaget
Handledare: Patrick Jern, Sabina Nickull
Abstrakt:
Målet med föreliggande avhandling var att undersöka associationerna mellan
sexuella svårigheter under första samlaget och aggression, psykologiska problem,
nuvarande sexuella dysfunktioner, barndomstrauma, nuvarande
alkoholkonsumtion samt ålder vid första samlaget. Nätverksanalyser användes i
avhandlingen för att undersöka associationerna mellan de inkluderade variablerna.
Data samlades från en stor finsk populationsbaserad studie, och innehöll 1056
finska mäns svar på olika frågeformulär. Deltagarna delades in i tre lika stora
grupper baserat på om de hade upplevt sexuella svårigheter under första samlaget
eller inte (IP = inga problem, PFI = problem men som inte fortsatte och PF =
problem som fortsatte). Avhandlingen var explorativ till sin natur, och det
huvudsakliga målet var att generera nya hypoteser om manliga sexuella
dysfunktioner under första samlaget. Två hypoteser formulerades. Den första var
att en ökning i antalet kopplingar mellan variablerna skulle öka från IP gruppen till
PF gruppen. Den andra var att splittringen inom nätverken skulle minska från IP
gruppen till PF gruppen, vilket skulle synas genom att problemgrupperna skulle ha
större och starkare kopplade kluster inom sig än de andra grupperna. Hypoteserna
baserades på nätverksteorin om psykopatologier, som påstår att ett nätverk med
högre antal kopplingar och lägre splittring är mera sårbart, vilket innebär att
nätverket har en högre risk att bli självupprätthållande.
Ingen ökning i antalet kopplingar hittades mellan nätverken, vilket gick emot
förväntningarna från hypotes ett. En signifikant strukturell skillnad hittades dock
mellan IP gruppen och PF gruppen, och analyserna visade även på en lägre
splittring i PF gruppen än i de andra grupperna, vilket ger stöd åt hypotes två.
Visuella inspektioner av nätverken visade även på att män som hade upplevt
bestående sexuella svårigheter från det första samlaget hade associationer mellan
psykologiska problem och aggressiva tendenser samt sexuella svårigheter.
Framtida forskning kunde bygga vidare på dessa resultat genom att göra klarare
associationerna mellan sexuella dysfunktioner och aggressiva tendenser. Detta
kunde utföras genom att med longitudinellt data undersöka huruvida aggressiva
tendenser orsakar sexuella problem, eller om tidigare sexuella misslyckanden kan
orsaka aggressiva tendenser.

1 Introduction
Usually occurring in late adolescence or early adulthood, the first experience of
sexual intercourse is a formative and important experience in most people’s lives. It
signifies the beginning of a person’s sexual and reproductive life. (Heywood,
Patrick, Smith, & Pitts, 2015). Numerous studies have examined how different
variables, such as age at first intercourse, substance use, and mental health during
first intercourse impact a person’s development (Bingham & Crockett, 1996;
Crockett, Bingham, Chopak, & Vicary, 1996; Heywood et al., 2015; ZimmerGembeck & Helfand, 2008). However, few studies have tried to examine which
factors might be associated with sexual difficulties during first intercourse and how
these sexual difficulties influence an individual later in life (Rapsey, 2014).
Furthermore, not much is known about if and how sexuality-related difficulties are
associated with anger and aggressive behaviors and tendencies, even though some
studies have found an association between the two (Gebhard, Cattaneo, Tangney,
Hargrove, & Shor, 2019; Levy, 2002). Another important question concerns the
possible associations between aggressive tendencies, sexual aggression and the
experience of sexual difficulties during first sexual intercourse, an association that
the present study attempted to elucidate.

1.1 Male sexual dysfunctions
Sexual dysfunction poses a big problem for many men and is a problem that often
goes undiagnosed and untreated. The International Classification of Diseases -11
(World Health Organization, 2018) defines sexual dysfunctions as the various ways
in which an individual is unable to participate in a sexual relationship as he or she
would wish. The dysfunction must occur frequently, have been present for several
months and cause significant distress to the affected individual (World Health
Organization, 2018). Sexual dysfunction in men can, for example, be an inability to
achieve a satisfactory erection, an experience of loss of control over orgasmic
functioning, or a decrease in libido or desire. The present study focused on the two
most common male sexual dysfunctions: erectile dysfunction and premature
ejaculation (Laumann, Paik, & Rosen, 1999; Santtila, Sandnabba, & Jern, 2009).

2

Erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined by the ICD-11 as the
inability to achieve or maintain an erection long enough for sexual activity (World
Health Organization, 2018). Erectile dysfunction is more common in older
individuals; studies have shown a prevalence of 52% in a sample of 40-70-year-olds
(Feldman, Goldstein, Hatzichristou, Krane, & McKinlay, 1994). In younger
individuals, the prevalence has been shown to be around 13% – 30% (Mialon,
Berchtold, Michaud, Gmel, & Suris, 2012; Musacchio, Hartrich, & Garofalo, 2006).
Prevalence for erectile problems during the first intercourse was found to be 15%,
with a prevalence rate that was positively correlated with the age of first intercourse
(Santtila, Sandnabba, & Jern, 2009).
ED is strongly associated with aging, meaning that older men are more likely
to experience problems with ED. This correlation is likely explained by an increase
in physical health problems, such as diabetes or cardiovascular diseases, that are
more common in older men. ED in younger men is commonly associated with
lifestyle-related factors (such as being overweight), medical conditions,
pharmacological agents (Bortolotti, Parazzini, Colli, & Landoni, 1998), and is
furthermore more closely linked with different psychological factors (Jern, Gunst,
Sandnabba, & Santtila, 2012). Mental health is associated with ED in a bidirectional
way, where mental health issues causes ED and ED causes mental health issues
(Berchtold et. al., 2012; Niolu, Lisi, & Siracusano, 2018), and occurs comorbidly
with both depression and anxiety (Jern, Gunst, Sandnabba, & Santtila, 2012; Latini,
Penson, Wallace, Lubeck, & Lue, 2006; Rajkumar & Kumaran, 2015). Negative
affect during first intercourse was also found to be associated with higher rates of
ED (Santtila, Sandnabba & Jern, 2009). The same study also found that ED
correlated with intoxication, not knowing the partner, not wanting to have
intercourse and group pressure. An association between early sexual intercourse and
ED has also been reported, but this correlation seems to decrease with time and
experience for most men (Jern, Gunst, Sandnabba, & Santtila, 2012).
Premature ejaculation. Premature ejaculation (PE) is difficult to clinically define,
but is generally defined as the inability to control ejaculation long enough for the
enjoyment of both partners (World Health Organization, 2018). What seems to be
essential in most definitions of PE are the three dimensions of timing, lack of control

3
and stress (Jannini et al., 2015). Timing stands for how long after penetration
ejaculation occurs, stress represents the negative personal consequences that PE can
have, and lack of control is the sensation that the individual loses control over when
one ejaculates (Jannini et al., 2015). The prevalence of PE ranges from around 4%
(when an ejaculation latency time of under one minute during most intercourses is
included in the definition) to around 30% (when only subjective PE indicators, such
as worrying about ejaculatory function or a perception that ejaculation occurs too
quickly are measured; Althof et al., 2014). PE has negligible association with age
and, if anything, appears to get slightly worse with increasing age (Porst et al.,
2006).
PE is associated with decrements in mental health, and comorbidities with
anxiety and depression are common (Berchtold et. al., 2012). However, a
longitudinal study only found weak associations between PE and indicators of
psychopathology, and these did not seem to be stable over time (Ventus, Gunst,
Kärnä, & Jern, 2017). Additionally, strong positive affect during intercourse have
been shown to increase PE, possibly because positive affects raise the level of
excitement, which increases the possibility of PE (Santtila, Sandnabba & Jern,
2009).

1.2 The first sexual intercourse
The first experience of sexual intercourse stands as a formative part of an
individual’s development, and for men in Finland, it usually occurs around the age of
17 (Johansson et al., 2013). Why is the sexual debut of special importance? The life
course perspective, introduced by Elder (1998), suggests that the timing of special
milestones, such as first intercourse, are essential for the trajectory of the person’s
development. Milestones that occur off-timing can therefore have ramifications for
future development. Another theory, sexual self-schema (Andersen, Cyranowski &
Espindle, 1999), proposes that sexual self-schemas are developed prior to and during
the first sexual experiences, and influence how, when and why one has sex in the
future. Different factors, such as age of first intercourse, friends’ and family’s
attitude towards sexuality, and the context and quality of the sexual experience, can
therefore influence the schemas that a person develops regarding sex and sexuality.

4
Zimmer-Gembeck and Helfand (2008) conducted a systematic review where
they studied how physical development, problem behaviors, school-related behaviors
and attitudes, sex-related attitudes, religious behavior and attitudes, mental health,
and family and peer factors, including status and qualities of relationships predated
and correlated with the age of sexual debut. They found a correlation between
having made one’s sexual debut under the age of 15 and aggression, alcohol use, and
poorer academic results in boys (Bingham & Crockett, 1996; Kinsman, Romer,
Furstenberg, & Schwarz, 1998; Whitbeck, Yoder, Hoyt, & Conger, 1999). Studies
have also found that younger initiators of first sex are more likely to experience a
more diverse sexual life, with more sexual partners and different sexual practices
(Heywood et.al., 2015; Zimmer-Gembeck & Helfand, 2008). Another systematic
review found a relationship between a young age of first intercourse and increased
likelihood of psychological problems (Mota, Cox, Katz, & Sareen, 2010). The
authors hypothesized that sexual intercourse might be more mentally distressing to
younger individuals due to high expectations, peer pressure, the increased likelihood
of involvement of alcohol and less stable relationship with the sexual partner. Due to
the associations between age of first sexual intercourse and problem behaviors, an
adolescent who has sex earlier when compared to peers is more likely to have more
developmental and current problems when compared with peers who initiate sex at
an older age (Jessor & Jessor, 1977; Zimmer-Gembeck & Helfand, 2008).
First intercourse and sexual dysfunctions. Research has shown that sexual
dysfunctions have a myriad of correlates, for example psychological problems,
substance use, somatic health and relationship quality. However, less is known about
the association between specifically first sexual experience of intercourse and sexual
difficulties later in life. A study by Sandfort, Orr, Hirsch, and Santelli (2008) found
an association between the timing of the sexual debut and sexual difficulties. They
found that men who initiate sexual intercourse later or earlier than peers were at an
increased risk for sexual difficulties. However, they concluded that the relationship
could be due to other variables, such as alcohol consumption during first intercourse
or anxiety over late debut. Studies by Else-Quest, Hyde and DeLamater (2005) and
Rapsey (2014) examining sexual dysfunctions during first sexual experience in both
men and women gave support to this theory. No direct association between age of
first intercourse and sexual difficulties was found, instead they found that the

5
emotional quality of first sex (how well known the sexual partner was) and how well
communication worked between the partners, seemed to be of greater importance.
As previously stated, sexual debut at a younger age is related to higher alcohol
consumption and less stable relationships, all factors that can affect the emotional
quality of sexual intercourse negatively (Else-Quest, Hyde, & DeLamater, 2005;
Rapsey, 2014). Other studies have, however, found an association between higher
age at first intercourse and erectile dysfunction, possibly due to more relaxed
attitudes towards sexuality and less sexual guilt in men who have an earlier age of
sexual debut (Else-Quest, Hyde & DeLamater. 2005; Santtila, Sandnabba, & Jern,
2009).
The previously mentioned sexual self-schema theory, proposed by Andersen,
Cyranowski and Espindle (1999), might give an insight into how sexual dysfunctions
experienced during first intercourse might persist. Andersen and colleagues (1999)
defined the sexual self-schema as something that is created during earlier
experiences and that manifests in present experiences. The schemas help the
processing of sexually relevant social information, and give a framework for sexual
responses, affects and behavior. To clarify, the sexual self-schemas, created during
early sexual experiences, influence later sexual experiences and may be the reason
for sexual difficulties, especially if the schemas are based on negative experiences.
Negative self-schemas might instigate a negative loop of self-fulfilling prophecies,
where a person, based on previous experiences, expect to have negative experiences
during sexual intercourse, which worsens the experience (Rowland, Kostelyk, &
Tempel, 2016).

1.3 Sexual aggression, aggressive tendencies and links to sexual dysfunctions
Fite, Richey, Dipierro, Brown, and Bortolato (2016) found that proactively
aggressive men were more inclined to risky sexual behavior, including having a
higher number of sexual partners and less frequent use of contraception. Men who
were more inclined to reactive aggression were more likely to have a lower number
of lifetime partners. Men with reactive aggressive tendencies also had a higher
tendency to experience shame over their aggressive behavior. Gebhard, Cattaneo,
Tangney, Hargrove, and Shor (2019) further examined how shame-related responses

6
based on threatened masculinity related to physical aggression. They found that men
who responded with expressions of shame when confronted with situations
perceived as threatening to their masculinity had a higher tendency to physically
aggressive behavior.
Feiring, Simon, and Cleland (2009) found that individuals who suffer from
internalizing problems (e.g., post-traumatic stress syndrome and depressive
symptoms) following childhood sexual abuse displayed more aggressive behaviors
when dating. Another study, focusing on men specifically, found a similar link
between suffering childhood sexual abuse and sexually aggressive behavior in
adulthood (King, Kuhn, Strege, Russell, & Kolander, 2019). Participants with
experiences of childhood sexual abuse were found to be more likely to have tried or
succeeded in either coercing someone into having sex or rape. King and colleagues
(2019) also found associations between other forms of childhood maltreatment,
physical or emotional, and sexually aggressive behavior.
Aggressive tendencies and sexual dysfunctions. Most of the research on sexual
aggression has been performed on male samples, since sexually aggressive acts are
mainly committed by men (Ybarra & Mitchell, 2013). Studies have shown ED to be
related to increasing anger in men who suffer from it (Levy, 2002). Men with high
tendencies for anger suppression or anger expression were more likely to suffer from
erectile problems. The same study also found that a low desire for dominance (i.e., a
desire to influence and control people around them) was associated with more
erectile problems (Feldman, Goldstein, Hatzichristou, Krane, & McKinlay, 1994).

1.4 Network perspective on psychopathology
The network perspective on psychopathology is a theoretical framework that aims to
give a new way of looking at psychological problems. It conceptualizes
psychological problems as a dynamic system of symptoms interacting with each
other. Instead of searching for the underlying “common cause” behind psychological
disorders, the network perspective proposes that psychological disorders emerge
from causal interactions of symptoms in a network (Borsboom, 2017).

7
Consider Jake, a hypothetical man suffering from ED with loss of sexual
desire and problems maintaining an erection, a low tolerance for stress, a habit of
drinking too much alcohol, and a habit of reacting with anger to sexual
disappointment. Jake might be doing fine when he can keep the stress he experiences
to a minimum, but prolonged experiences of stress increases his symptoms of ED
and his propensity to drinking. A network conceptualization of Jake’s problems
might give more insight into the difficulties he experiences. Through the network
perspective, Jake’s problems are not caused by underlying biological factors, but by
the interplay of the variables in the network.
In a symptom network, the different symptoms and other relevant variables
are called nodes. Nodes that affect each other are connected by edges (i.e., statistical
associations, typically partial correlations) that indicate the associations between the
nodes. Events not in the network can also influence nodes in the network, which in
turn may “activate” the rest of the network (Borsboom, 2017). The conceptualization
of Jake’s symptom network would involve nodes representing loss of sexual desire,
problems maintaining an erection, alcohol consumption and aggressive tendencies.
The nodes in his network do not affect each other when stress levels are low, but do
so when levels of experienced stress increase. For example, an external factor, such
as stress experienced from a high workload, might activate nodes in the network,
which in turn activates the other symptoms in the network, causing Jake to suffer the
symptoms of ED, drink more and react more aggressively to difficulties (Cramer,
van Borkulo, Giltay, van der Maas, Han, Kendler, Scheffer, & Borsboom, 2016).
When sexual dysfunctions are not organic in etiology, one questions become
especially vital; what is maintaining the sexual dysfunction? Sexual self-schemas
and self-fulfilling prophecies are examples of ideas that propose negative feedback
loops and cognitive schemas that help instigate and uphold the dysfunctions
(Andersen et. al., 1999). The network perspective on psychopathology is also
centered on the idea of self-sustaining feedback loops. Networks vary in connectivity
(i.e., the strength of the correlations between nodes), and networks with strong
connectivity risk becoming self-sustaining more easily (Borsboom, 2017; Cramer et
al., 2016). Jake’s difficulties are highly dependent on the amount of stress he
experiences, so that the nodes only affect each other when levels of stress are high,
but do not affect each other when stress decreases. Such is a network with weak
connectivity. Another hypothetical person, Charles, might experience the same

8
problems as Jake, but, due to increased vulnerability, in this case caused by
childhood maltreatment, have a higher connectivity in his network. For Charles,
decreased levels of stress would not help because other variables, once activated,
maintain the activation of the network and increase stress, for example, so that ED
symptoms increase the amount of stress he experiences. Nodes that strongly interact
with each other can gather in communities inside the network. Due to the high
connectivity found in communities of nodes, it is theorized that a higher likelihood
of system activation is present inside the community. Nodes also vary in centrality,
which indicates how important a single node is in the network. Central nodes
influence the network more than nodes with low centrality (Borsboom, 2017).
The etiology behind most male sexual dysfunctions is unclear. A myriad of
organic, biological, social and psychological factors functions together to generate
sexual dysfunction. By studying what variables factor into the development and
sustaining of sexual dysfunctions with the help of networks, new insight might be
gained about how to help people that are stuck in a loop of network activation.
Network analysis can be performed on a single individual with data gathered from
several different times, or as a cross-sectional analysis of a phenomenon. The present
study will utilize the latter method.

1.5 Aims and hypotheses
The aim of the present study was to examine the associations between problems
during first experience of sexual intercourse and aggression, sexual difficulties and
psychological difficulties in males by using network analysis. The participants,
amassed from a large population-based sample, were divided into three different
groups based on their retrospectively self-reported experiences during their first
sexual intercourse. The three groups consisted of:
1) men who reported no occurrence of sexual dysfunctions or problems
2) men who reported experiencing sexual dysfunction or problems that did
not persist over time
3) men who reported experiencing sexual dysfunctions or problems, which
persisted over time

9
Variables measuring sexual dysfunctions in men and variables relevant to sexual
difficulties, such as depression and anxiety, sexual distress, age of first intercourse,
alcohol consumption and childhood maltreatment, were included in the study. The
study also included variables measuring aggression, anger and sexual aggression, in
order to examine whether the relationships between these variables differed between
the groups.
The present study was exploratory in nature, since so few studies have
studied the relationship between problems during first sexual experience of
intercourse, aggressive tendencies and the other variables relevant to sexual
dysfunction. A main aim of this study was to develop hypotheses for scrutiny of
male sexual dysfunctions during first intercourse by examining the central variables
and their connections to other variables. The information gained could also help
highlight central symptoms that might sustain problems developed during first
sexual intercourse and give insight into possible ways of stopping the self-fulfilling
prophecies of people stuck in bad loops.
Because sexual difficulties have been linked to a number of other difficulties,
such as mental health problems and alcohol consumption, the first main hypothesis
of the present study was that the connectivity of the networks would be increased in
the group of people experiencing persisting problems. This would mean that the
group with persisting problems would have more associations, or stronger edges,
between different variables in the network. This hypothesis is also in line with the
network theory of psychopathology, which states that more strongly connected
networks have a higher risk to develop prolonged symptom activation. The second
hypothesis concerned the fragmentation of the networks. Network theory states that
symptoms that are closely related can form communities, where symptoms more
easily activate each other. It was thus hypothesized that networks of people with
more sexual difficulties would have less fragmented networks (i.e., the nodes in the
networks with sexual difficulties would form bigger and more interconnected
communities).

2 Methods
2.1 Participants
The network analyses in the present study were performed on a sample of 1,056 men
between the ages of 18 and 46 years (M = 26.5, SD = 4.5). Questionnaire responses
from men, who had taken part in a large-scale Finnish population-based study (the
Genetics of Sexuality and Aggression study; see Johansson et al., 2013), composed
the basis for the sample. In the Genetics of Sexuality and Aggression study (GSA),
conducted at Åbo Akademi in Finland 2006, a questionnaire was sent out to all
Finnish speaking twins between the ages of 18 and 33 and living in Finland, and to
their siblings above the age of 18. An ethical research permit was obtained for the
original data collection from the Ethics Committee of Åbo Akademi University, in
accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. The purpose of the study was clearly
described, and the voluntary and anonymous nature of the participation emphasized.
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
The focus of the present study was on male sexual dysfunctions; therefore, all
female respondents were excluded from the analysis. The sample originally
consisted of 3,331 men (see flowchart in Figure 1). One individual per family was
selected randomly to avoid statistical bias resulting from genetical relatedness.
Additionally, network analysis requires full data from all participants, so individuals
with quantitative variables with missing data were either deleted or imputed,
depending on the amount of missing data (this process is more thoroughly described
in chapter 2.3.1). An essential aspect when comparing differences between networks
is that the sample size for each subgroup is of equal size. Different sample sizes
would affect the estimated network structures, potentially leading to biased
estimations. (Epskamp & Fried, 2018). To avoid this, we randomly selected 352
participants (based on the smallest group) from all three subgroups, giving us a final
sample of 1,056.

2.2 Measures
The variables included in the present study were premature ejaculation, erectile
dysfunction and sexual distress to measure sexual function; experienced childhood
maltreatment; sexual aggression and aggressive tendencies; depression and anxiety
symptoms; alcohol consumption; and age of first sexual intercourse. These were
chosen based on relevance to the field of male sexual dysfunctions and first sexual
experience of intercourse, as described in the introduction.
Premature ejaculation. The Multiple Indicators of Premature Ejaculation, or MIPE,
was used to measure the participants’ subjective experience of premature ejaculation
(Jern, Piha, & Santtila, 2013). The MIPE consists of seven items that measure the
three central themes for PE: the sense of control over when to ejaculate, self-reported
ejaculation latency time and worrying over premature ejaculation. The items on the
MIPE scale was computed into a composite score that ranged from 7 to 28, with

12
higher values meaning more pronounced PE symptoms. Previous studies have
shown this test to have good reliability and good ability to distinguish between
patients with PE and control groups (Jern et al., 2009; Jern et al., 2013). The internal
consistency of MIPE for the sample of the present study was low (α = .59).
Erectile dysfunction. The 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile
Function (IIEF-5; Rosen, Cappelleri, Smith, Lipsky, & Peña, 1999; IIEF; Rosen,
Riley, Wagner, Osterloh, Kirkpatrick, & Mishra, 1997) was used to measure erectile
dysfunction. The five items chosen from the original IIEF focus on erectile
dysfunction and intercourse satisfaction and was selected based on capacity to
distinguish between the presence or absence of ED. The items measure confidence in
maintaining erection, ability to maintain erection, frequency in ability to maintain
erection, the firmness of the erection and satisfaction with intercourse (Rosen et al.,
1999). The IIEF-5 consists of 5 Likert-type questions with a range from 1-5, where
lower scores means more problems. The items were calculated into a composite
variable that had a range from 1-25, and to facilitate interpretations of the network
analysis, higher scores were calculated to represent more problems. The IIEF-5 has
shown good psychometric properties, with high specificity, sensitivity and inter-rater
reliability (Rosen et al., 1999). The internal consistency of the IIEF-5 scale was
excellent in the present sample (α = .90).
Sexual distress. The Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS; Derogatis, Rosen,
Leiblum, Burnett, & Heiman, 2002), made gender neutral and named Sexual Distress
Scale (SDS; Santos-Iglesias, Mohamed, Danko, & Walker, 2018) was used as a
measurement of sexual distress. The items included in the analysis measured if the
participants, during the last four weeks, had felt stressed, anxious, guilty,
embarrassed or dissatisfied with their sex life, and if they had felt sexually
inadequate or if they had had regrets about their sexuality. The original questionnaire
contained 12 items, a shortened version with seven gender-neutral items (items 1, 3,
5, 8, 9, 10 and 11) was used in the present analysis. Responses were given on a
Likert-scale ranging from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more sexual distress,
and a composite variable with a range of 0 to 28 was created by summing the items
together. Studies have shown SDS to have good psychometric properties on both
male and female samples (Santos‐Iglesias et al., 2018; DeRogatis, Clayton, Lewis-

13
D'Agostino, Wunderlich, & Fu, 2008; Derogatis et al., 2002). The internal
consistency of the SDS was good (α = .88).
Psychological distress. The participants’ levels of anxiety and depression were
measured with the subscales from the Brief Symptoms Inventory-18 (BSI-18;
Derogatis & Melisaratos, 1979). The subscales consist of six items that measure
symptoms of depression and six items that measure symptoms of anxiety in the last
seven days. The items were rated on a Likert-scale that ranged from 0 (not at all) to
4 (extremely), and were summed into two separate composite variables, one
measuring depression and one measuring anxiety, both ranging from 0 to 24 were a
higher score means more symptoms. The subscale measuring depression showed a
good internal consistency (α = .85), as did the subscale for anxiety (α = .85).
Alcohol consumption. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test for
Consumption (AUDIT-C; Bush, Kivlahan, McDonell, Fihn, & Bradley, 1998) was
used to measures the participants’ alcohol consumption. AUDIT-C is the subscale of
AUDIT that measure consumption and consists of three Likert-style questions
measuring amount and frequency of alcohol intake. These three questions were
summed into one composite variable that ranged from 1 to 12, were a higher score
indicated a higher consumption. The AUDIT has been shown to be a reliable and
valid measure of problematic alcohol use (Allen, Litten, Fertig, & Babor, 1997;
Reinert & Allen, 2002), and the AUDIT-C has shown to be equally good as the
AUDIT at detection heavy drinking (Bush et al.,1998). In the present sample,
AUDIT-C had a low internal consistency (α = .42), which is perhaps unsurprising
given that the composite variable contained only three items.
Aggressive behavior. The verbal and physical aggression subscales from Buss’ and
Perry’s (1992) Aggression Questionnaire (AQ) was used to measure self-evaluated
aggressive tendencies. The AQ originally contains 29 items that measure verbal (5
items) and physical (9 items) aggression, anger (7 items) and hostility (8 items). The
14 items from the physical and verbal aggression subscales used in the analysis were
on a Likert-style scale ranging from 1 (extremely uncharacteristic of me) to 5
(extremely characteristic of me). A composite variable for aggressive behavior was
calculated by summing the items together, with a range from 14 to 70, were a higher

14
score equaled more aggressive behavior. The AQ has shown to have a good
reliability for both test-retest correlations and internal consistency and has also
shown good construct validity by relating to other self-evaluated aggression scales
(Buss & Perry, 1992; Harris, 1997). The internal consistency in the present sample
was good (α = .83).
Trait anger. The Trait Anger scale from the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory
second version (STAXI-2; Spielberger, 1999) was used to measure the participants’
trait anger. The Trait Anger scale is a self-report questionnaire that involves 10
questions on a Likert-style scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always).
The questions measure how a person generally feels or reacts, with a focus on
aggression and anger. A composite variable, ranging from 10 to 40, where a higher
value meant higher trait anger, was created by summing together the items. The
STAXI-2 Trait Anger scale has previously shown to have good psychometric
properties (Deffenbacher, Oetting, Lynch, & Morris, 1996; Spielberger, 1999). In the
present study, the scale had a good internal consistency (α = .82).
Sexual aggression. Sexual aggression was measured with a scale that was developed
by Malamuth (1989) and modified by Johansson and colleagues (2013) for the GSA
study. The scale, called Male Interest in Coercion scale (MIC) in the present study,
was based on the short version of the Attraction to Sexual Aggression Scale (ASA;
Malamuth, 1989) and included nine items that measured male’s interest in and
fantasies about sexually coercive behavior. The MIC questionnaire was made
gender-neutral and included more forms of sexual penetrative activities than the
original scale. Three items (items 3, 4 and 8) had scales ranging from 0% to 100% in
increments of 10%, four items (items 5, 6, 7 and 9) had Likert-style scales ranging
from 1 (very unlikely) to 7 (very likely), one item had a Likert-style scale ranging
from 0 (never) to 2 (often) and one had a Likert-style scale ranging from 1 (very
repulsing) to 4 (very tempting). These were all summed together to create a
composite variable with a range of 5 to 64 for MIC, where a higher score meant
more interest in coercion. The ASA was found to have good psychometric
properties, with good measures of internal consistency, construct validity and testretest reliability (Malamuth, 1989; Voller, Long, & Aosved, 2009). The MIC scale
had a good internal consistency (α = .83).

15

Childhood maltreatment. To measure the participants self-evaluated experiences of
childhood maltreatment I used the short version of the Childhood Trauma
Questionnaire (CTQ-SF; Bernstein et al., 2003). The CTQ-SF is comprised of 28
items, grouped into six different subscales. Each subscale contains five items, except
for a minimizing/denial subscale that contains three items. The minimizing/denial
has been shown to be of questionable relevance for research purpose and was for
such reasons excluded from the analysis (Gerdner & Allgulander, 2009; MacDonald,
Thomas, MacDonald, & Sciolla, 2015). The five subscales of the CTQ-SF included
in the analysis were physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional abuse, emotional
neglect and sexual abuse, each with five Likert-style questions ranging from 1 (not
at all) to 5 (very often). Items where lower scores indicated more problems were
reversed (in total seven items), and five separate composite variables were
calculated, each one ranging from 5 to 25, where higher scores indicated more
childhood maltreatment. The CTQ-SF has shown good psychometric properties, with
good validity in clinical samples and good internal consistency (Gerdner &
Allgulander, 2009). The construct validity of the CTQ-SF subscales has also shown
to be good, except for physical neglect, which has shown to be more questionable
(Gerdner & Allgulander, 2009). The internal consistency was good for emotional
neglect and sexual abuse (α = .84 and α = .80 respectively), acceptable for emotional
abuse (α = .77), questionable for physical abuse (α = .65) and poor for physical
neglect (α = .56).
Other variables. Age of first intercourse was asked for from the participants and
included in the analysis.

2.3 Statistical analyses
2.3.1 Data preparation
IBM SPSS statistics 25 for Mac was used to impute missing data, compute
descriptive statistics and to prepare the data set for the network analysis. Quantitative
variables with missing data were imputed based on intra-scale information using the
Expectation Maximization procedure of the Missing Value Analysis module in

16
SPSS. By using imputation based on intra-scale information, participants with more
than 50% of missing data on a single scale were excluded before imputation (this
was done to avoid biases in the imputation due to lack of sufficient amount of data).
No imputation was done for the grouping variable or the variable “age of first
intercourse”, as these variables were not part of any scale; participants with missing
data for these variables were excluded from statistical analyses.
The participants were subsequently asked if they had experienced any
difficulties or problems during their first experience of sexual intercourse and were
then divided into three separate groups depending on their answers on the question
“did any of these problems persist?”. The response options for this question were
“the problems did not persist”, “the problems continued”, “there were no problems”
and “have not had sex again”. Those who answered that they had not had sex again
were excluded from the analysis (n = 9), and the rest were arranged, based on their
answers, into three groups. To aid with the readability of the text, the groups will
henceforward be called NP (no problems), PnP (problems did not persist), and PP
(problems persisted). The groups were subsequently made equal in size to allow for
quantitative comparisons, and 352 (based on the PP-group, which was the group
with least participants in it) participants per group were selected randomly.
Correlations were calculated between the grouping variable and the rest of
the sample. This was done to identify possible strong correlations between the
grouping variable and the other variables used in the network analyses, since such
correlations could produce biases and uncontrolled dependencies in the analyses.
Finally, descriptive statistics for each group were calculated.

2.3.2 Network analysis
The network analyses were performed with the free software environment R 3.6.1,
using R Studio version 1.2.335 (R Core Team, 2018). Additionally, four free-to-use
statistical packages where used for the analysis: bootnet (Epskamp, Borsboom, &
Fried, 2018), qgraph (Epskamp, Cramer, Waldorp, Schmittmann, & Borsboom,
2012), igraph (Csárdi & Nepusz, 2014) and NetworkComparisonTest (NCT; van
Borkulo et al., 2016). All R code to replicate the analyses performed in the present
study, and their associated outputs, can be found in the Appendices section.

17
Network estimation and visualization. The networks for each problem group were
estimated using the bootnet-package according to the instructions given in the
tutorial by Epskamp and Fried (2018). Three Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM),
one for each of the problem groups, where fitted to the data to visualize partial
correlation networks. In the GGMs, variables are represented by nodes, the partial
correlations between variables are represented by edges and the partial correlation
coefficients are represented by edge weights. If the partial correlation coefficient
between two nodes is exactly zero, no edge will be drawn between them, indicating
that they are independent from each other when controlling for all the other variables
in the network. That means that if an edge is drawn between two nodes, one can
assume a relationship between these nodes that is not explained by any other variable
in the network (Epskamp & Fried, 2018).
Due to sampling variation, the partial correlations found in the network
analysis are never exactly zero. Variables that are conditionally independent in the
true network still exhibit weak partial correlation, so called spurious or false positive
edges. To combat these type 1 errors, and to make the networks more interpretable,
we used the “Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator” regularization
technique (LASSO; Tibshirani, 2011). The LASSO limits the sum of the partial
correlation coefficient, so that all coefficient shrinks, and some become exactly zero.
This creates a sparse network, where probable spurious edges are removed
(Epskamp, Kruis, & Marsman, 2017). The aim of the sparse network is to minimize
problems of specificity, in other words false positives, but is in the process of doing
so more vulnerable to problems of sensitivity, in other words false negatives. A
tuning parameter, λ (lambda), was used to determine the level of sparsity of the
network. A higher λ equals more edges removed and a sparser network. The LASSO
generates several networks for different values of λ, and subsequently Extended
Bayesian Information Criterion model selection (EBIC; Foygel & Drton, 2010) was
used to choose the model with the best fit for the data, with as few problems of
sensitivity and specificity as possible. The EBIC uses a hyperparameter γ (gamma)
that controls for the simplicity (amount of edges) of the model the EBIC chooses. As
with the λ, a higher value on γ lead to a model with less edges. The γ was set to 0.5
in the present analysis, as by the recommendations of others to stay on the side of
caution and favor excluding true edges than including spurious ones (Epskamp &
Fried, 2018; Foygel & Drton, 2010). The present analysis used the glasso (graphical

18
LASSO) in combination with the EBIC model selection as described by Foygel and
Drton (2010), called via the bootnet-package.
Partial correlation networks must meet the assumption of multivariate
normality. The assumption of normality can however be relaxed, if one can make the
assumption that the observed data are a transformation of a latent multivariate
normally distributed system. As the present study was based on ordinal data from
non-normal questionnaire responses, I used the bootnet-package function “cor_auto”
for polychoric and polyserial correlations to detect and transform the ordinal
variables to adjust for the assumptions of multivariate normality.
The three networks in the present analysis were visualized using the
qgraph-package, and the layouts were determined by the the Fruchterman-Reingold
algorithm. This algorithm organizes the data so that nodes that are connected attract
each other and nodes that are not connected reject each other. An average layout was
used for all three networks, to facilitate visual interpretation of the networks.
Network centrality and accuracy. After estimating and visualizing the networks,
the qgraph-package was used to produce centrality indices, which were used to
further analyze the different aspects of the networks. Node centrality aids in
exploring and analyzing how individual nodes influence the network. Nodes with
high centrality have a lot of predictive power in the network (Epskamp et al., 2018).
The most common centrality measures are strength (the sum of absolute edge
weights connected to a node), closeness (the inverse of the sum of distances from
one node to all other nodes in the network) and betweenness (measures how often a
node is in the shortest paths between other nodes). However, as argued by
Bringmann and colleagues (2019), the centrality measures closeness and
betweenness seem to lack relevance in networks estimated on psychological
variables. Therefore, I came to the conclusion to only include the strength
measurement of centrality in the analyses.
The strength of the nodes was calculated and then compared within the
groups. A non-parametric case-dropping subset bootstrapping test was performed
before analyzing the strength estimates. This was done to measure the stability of the
strength estimates. The case-dropping bootstrap was performed by re-evaluating the
centrality parameters several times by dropping cases (participants) from the data
and correlating these subsets of the data with the original, full data set. If the

19
correlations in the centrality parameters would drop drastically between the subsets
of the data and the original data, it would indicate that the strength measurement was
unstable and prone to error. The stability was quantified by calculating the
correlation stability coefficient (CS-coefficient; Epskamp et al., 2018), which
represents the maximum amount of cases that can be dropped before the 95%
confidence interval drops below 0.7. The CS-coefficient should preferably be above
0.5, but at least above 0.25 (Epskamp, Borsboom, & Fried, 2018). The significance
of the difference in node strengths between the three networks was also tested for.
Following the centrality analyses, the accuracy and stability of the edge
weights were tested. To visualize the accuracy of the edge weights, the bootnetpackage was used to compute an edge stability plot for each group. The edge
stability plots were calculated with 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals (CI), and
in the plots, wide CI: s indicates an unstable network, where the estimated edge
weight magnitudes varied a lot across the bootstrapped samples, and narrow CI: s
indicates a more stable network with less variation. Bootstrapped difference tests
were also performed and visualized through edge significance plots, to analyze and
detect differences between edge weights inside the separate networks. The test was
not able to infer if an edge significantly differed from zero. However, as earlier
described, the regularization process included in the estimation of the networks does
this automatically, as it shrinks low edges towards zero. Edges included after the
regularization process were therefore automatically assumed to differ from zero.
Network comparison test. To compare entire networks with each other I used the
Network Comparison Test (NCT), developed by van Borkulo and colleagues (2016).
The test is a permutation test developed to test differences between two networks,
and tests four separate hypotheses: differences in overall connectivity, differences in
the structures of the networks, differences in centrality between the networks, and, if
structural differences are detected, difference in the strength of specific edges
between the networks. The NCT permutation test was used with 1000 iterations, and
the Holm-Bonferroni correction was used to account for familywise errors when
testing for hypothesis 3 and 4. Hypothesis one was tested by measuring the
difference in global strength (M = the weighted absolute sum of all edges in the
networks). Hypothesis two was tested by analyzing if the networks are structurally
different by examining the present edges and their positive or negative values (S).

20
Hypothesis three was tested by examining if the centrality of the nodes significantly
differed between the networks. Hypothesis four was tested by examining which
specific edges showed significant differences between the groups. In the present
analysis, NCT was performed three times: 1) comparing the NP group with the PP
group, 2) comparing NP group with the PnP group, and 3) comparing the PnP group
with the PP group.
Network communities. Additionally, I wanted to know if the networks featured any
communities. To do this, community analyses were performed to determine the level
of fragmentation, or the way nodes form sub-networks in the networks. The
communities might also indicate the existence of a latent variable causing the
covariance in the community (Epskamp & Fried, 2018). Visual and descriptive
analysis of the communities where performed, and the Walktrap algorithm from the
igraph-package (Csárdi & Nepusz, 2005) was used to explore the levels of
fragmentation across networks. This algorithm tries to find communities by making
short random walks inside the network (Pons & Latapy, 2006). After running several
estimations with increasing number of steps, I chose to apply 200 steps in the
community analysis, as it was the first number of steps which resulted in a stable
amount of communities.

3 Results
3.1 Descriptive statistics and correlations
No strong correlations were found for the problem during first sex grouping variable
(see Appendix for more information). The two strongest correlations found were
between the grouping variable and sexual distress (r = .28) and the grouping variable
and PE (r = .25). This was beneficial, as the absence of strong correlations between
the grouping variable and the rest of the variables indicated that no confounding
variable were likely to affect the estimations of the networks. Next follows
descriptive data for all three networks (n = 352 for all groups) in Table 1.

3.2 Network comparison test
The network comparison test (NCT) was used to test for differences between the
networks. The NCT found a significant difference in the structures of the networks
between the NP group and the PP group (M = .30, p < .05). No other significant
differences were found either in global strength or in the overall structure of the
networks. The global strength value of the groups was: NP = 3.56, PnP = 3.02 and
PP = 3.73. The differences in global strength between the NP group and the PnP
group (S = .54, p = .36), the PnP group and the PP group (S = .71, p = .18) and the
NP group and the PP group (S = .17, p = .75) were not significant. No differences in
the structures of the networks between the NP and the PnP group were detected (M =
.27, p = .54), and the same was true for the PnP and the PP groups (M = .24, p =
.81). Neither the individual edges nor the strength centrality estimate for the different

22
nodes differed significantly between the groups. (See the Appendix for more
information and numerical values).

3.3 Visual examination of the network structures
Upon observing the visual representation of the network, it was clear that the overall
connectivity was relatively low (Figure 2). The nodes representing alcohol
consumption and age of first intercourse lacked connections to any other node in
either of the three networks, and all three networks had nodes unconnected to the rest
of the networks. The networks did display a small difference in overall connectivity;
the NP group and the PP group had 12 edges each, whereas the PnP group only had
9 edges.
Aside from differences, observations of the networks revealed several
structural similarities between the networks. The similarities in the structural
framework found between the networks included similar connection between the
nodes depicting childhood maltreatment in the form of physical or emotional neglect
or abuse. The amount of childhood maltreatment experienced was also found to be
on comparable levels across the three networks (Table 1). Furthermore, aggression
and anger were also connected in all networks, as was depression and anxiety. No
edges were found to reverse their associations between networks. (See the Appendix
for figures with numerical values for the partial correlations found between the
nodes).
Connections between aggressive tendencies, psychological distress and sexual
difficulties. The PP group was the only group where connections were found
between psychological distress and both aggressive tendencies and sexual distress.
This indicated that sexual distress and aggressive tendencies in the PP group might
be connected through the nodes measuring psychological distress. However, since
the directions of the edges are unknown, it is unclear whether a connection between
sexual distress and aggressive tendencies exists, or if psychological distress
represents causal endpoints for both associations. The associations were positive,
indicating that more problems in one domain increased the amount of problems in
the other domains. This group was also the only group to contain an association, in

23
this case a positive one, between the aggression and anger nodes and the node
measuring interest in sexual coercion. This indicated that a higher interest in
coercion was associated with having higher aggressive tendencies, which in turn was
connected to the sexual dysfunction nodes via the nodes measuring psychological
distress.
The two other groups had no connections between aggressive tendencies and
any other included variables in the analysis. Also, they did not show any connections
between an interest in sexual coercion and aggression or trait anger. The PP group
was also the only group to have connections between sexual distress and both PE
and ED, so that more sexual distress indicated more problems with both ED and PE,
or vice versa. The PnP group had a connection between ED and sexual distress, but
no connections to PE, while the NP group had a similar connection, but only
between sexual distress and PE. Additionally, the PnP group was the only group not
to show a connection between sexual distress and psychological distress. The other
two groups showed connections between sexual distress and depression (PP) and
sexual distress and anxiety (NP).
Connections between childhood maltreatment and psychological distress and
sexual difficulties. The PP group was the only group not to exhibit any connections
between the four nodes measuring physical or emotional neglect or abuse and the
node measuring sexual abuse or with any of the other variables in the network. The
two other groups had a connection between sexual abuse and emotional abuse,
indicating that participants who had experienced more emotional abuse also had
experienced more sexual abuse, or vice versa. Sexual abuse was not found to have
any other connection in either of the networks (although it should be mentioned that
the base rate of having experienced sexual abuse was very low in the present
sample). Participants who had not experienced any problems during first intercourse
were found to have the highest number of edges connecting childhood trauma to
psychological distress and sexual difficulties. All edges were positive, showing that
more emotional neglect was associated with more sexual distress, more physical
neglect was associated with anxiety and that more emotional abuse was associated
with more depression. The network of those who had experienced PnP revealed a
connection between emotional abuse and anxiety.

24
Connection between alcohol consumption and age of fist intercourse. None of
the networks found any connections with alcohol consumption at the time when
participants answered the questionnaire and age of first sex and the rest of the
variables. The two networks of the groups of people who had experienced problems
during first intercourse did however locate a negative association between alcohol
consumption at present time and age of first sex. This indicated that if one had
experienced problems during first intercourse, a younger age of first intercourse was
correlated with more alcohol consumption in the present.

25

26
3.4 Network communities
The community analysis discovered differences between the level of fragmentation
and how the nodes cluster depending on the different networks. The number of
communities in the different networks were: seven in the NP group, eight in the PnP
group, and three in the PP group (Figure 3). This showed a decrease in fragmentation
of the networks when difficulties experienced during first sexual intercourse
persisted and indicated that the nodes in the network of those with persisting
difficulties were more densely connected. The NP group and PnP group had similar
amounts of communities, but they differed in the sizes and shapes of the
communities.
The NP group consisted of two larger communities and five smaller ones. All
five nodes measuring childhood trauma were included in the largest community, and
the nodes measuring PE and sexual distress and the two nodes measuring
psychological distress were included in the second largest community. One two node
community was also identified, containing the nodes symbolizing aggression and
anger. The rest were communities containing only a single node. Three associations
were identified between the largest and second largest communities.
The PnP group had eight communities. The largest community contained
three of the childhood trauma variables (sexual, physical and emotional abuse). Five
communities with two nodes were also identified: one containing alcohol
consumption and sexual debut age, one containing sexual desire and ED, one
containing anger and aggression, one containing anxiety and depression, and one
containing physical and emotional neglect. The remaining two communities
contained one node each, sexual aggression and PE.
The PP group had three communities, one with nine nodes, one with four
nodes and one with two nodes. The largest community included all three nodes
measuring aggressive tendencies, both nodes measuring psychological distress, all
three nodes measuring sexual function and distress and the node measuring sexual
abuse. The second largest community included the four remaining nodes measuring
childhood trauma, and the smallest community included alcohol consumption and
age of first intercourse.

sexual experience; O2 = Alcohol consumption.

3.5 Strength centrality and stability
Plots for the standardized strength centrality for the different nodes of the three
problem networks are found in Figure 4. The node representing emotional abuse was
found to have the highest strength centrality in all three networks, and all three
networks found low strength centrality for the nodes representing sexual abuse,
alcohol consumption, interest in coercion, PE, ED and age of first sex. The strength
centrality indices followed similar patterns across the three networks, with variations
that were small and, as the NCT results showed, not significant. Interesting, even
though non-significant, differences between the groups included a reversal of
importance for PE and ED in the NP group and the PnP group and a fairly large
differences between the three networks in the importance of the nodes representing
sexual distress, aggression and anger, where PP following first sex signified a higher
importance of these nodes in the network.
The node strength comparison test (see appendix for plots) found that the
node emotional abuse was significantly higher in strength than all except for two
nodes in the NP group. The difference in strength centrality was not as clear in the
two other groups. Emotional abuse was significantly higher than all but seven nodes
in the PnP group and all but six nodes in the PP group.

low in the PnP group (0.44). Figure 5 visualizes the outcome of the case-dropping
bootstrap test for the PnP group, and the plots for the two other networks can be
found in the appendix.

intervals are represented by the pink area. The plot visualizes how many cases can be
dropped before the correlation between the subset’s strength centrality 95% CI and
the original samples strength centrality 95% CI drops below 0.7.

3.6 The strength and accuracy of edge weights
The edge weight accuracy was tested by bootstrapping the confidence intervals of
the edge weight (see Figure 6 for plot of PP group). The visual inspection of the
plots revealed quite a lot of variability, with some nodes having overlapping CIs.
Interpretation of the differences in magnitude between nodes should therefore be
done with caution, as nodes with overlapping CIs indicate the size difference
between the edge weight are unclear. Some bootstrapped means uncovered edges
that had previously not existed. That indicated that the LASSO-regularization
applied to reduce type I error might have resulted in type II errors instead. This was
to be expected, as the LASSO-regularization creates a sparse network more inclined
towards type II errors. Nevertheless, as the existing edges have bootstrapped means
that are reasonably close to the edges of the original networks, it seems as though the

30
LASSO-regularization have succeeded in minimizing type I errors. Comparable
plots were obtained for all three networks (see Appendix).

Figure 6. Plot of the bootstrapped confidence intervals for the edge weight for the PP
group. The red line indicates the edges of the original sample, while the black line
represents the bootstrapped means for the edges. The grey areas are the bootstrapped
CIs.
Edge significance tests were also performed to examine if the edges
significantly differ from each other (see Appendix for plots). The edges between
anxiety and depression and aggression and anger was the strongest edges in all three
networks and differed significantly from the other edges in both the NP group and
the PnP group. The edges were strongest in the PP group as well, but their
significance was not as clear. The two groups who had experienced problems during
first intercourse displayed a negative edge between alcohol consumption and age of
first sex. This edge was significantly different than all but three other edges in the
PnP group, and all but four other edges in the PP group.

4 Discussion
The present study examined the associations between male sexual dysfunctions
during first experience of sexual intercourse and aggressive tendencies, current
sexual dysfunctions, psychological distress, childhood maltreatment and other
relevant variables, using network analysis. The population-based sample was divided
into three equally sized groups based on whether they had experienced sexual
difficulties during first intercourse or not, and if the experienced difficulties had
persisted (NP = no problems; PnP = problems did not persist; PP = problems
persisted). The aim of the study was mainly explorative, with the hopes that new
insights and hypotheses could be generated regarding male sexual dysfunctions
during first sexual intercourse. The first hypothesis of the study related to the overall
connectivity of the networks. I expected that persisting sexual dysfunctions would
result in a higher network connectivity. However, the NCT found no significant
differences in the sum of all edges between the networks. The second hypothesis
concerned the fragmentation of the networks and stated that more sexual difficulties
would lead to a less fragmented network. This hypothesis was supported by the
community analysis, which showed that the PP group had the fewest amount of
communities. Additionally, the NCT test found a significant structural difference
between the NP group and the PP group. Further visual inspections of the two
networks found that the PP group was the only group where aggressive behavior,
psychological distress and sexual dysfunctions were connected. The PP group was
also the only group with a network that displayed a community that involved both
sexual difficulties and aggressive tendencies.

4.1 Network differences
Visual inspection of the networks did reveal a small increase in number of edges
from the PnP group to the PP group, which could indicate that persisting difficulties
yield a more connected network. However, the network comparison test revealed no
significant differences in either number of edges or edge weight between any of the
three networks. These results fail to support the first hypothesis, which assumed that

32
more problems would be associated with a more densely and strongly connected
network.
The second hypothesis related to the fragmentation of the networks and was
supported by the network community analysis. The NP and PnP groups had seven
and eight communities respectively, while the PP group had three separate
communities. This indicated that the PP group was less fragmented than the other
groups. The largest community in the PP groups network was also the only
community in all of the networks to include the nodes measuring sexual difficulties
and distress, aggressive tendencies, psychological distress and the node measuring
childhood maltreatment in the form of sexual abuse. Furthermore, visual inspection
only found a connection between sexual difficulties and aggressive tendencies, going
through psychological distress, in the PP group. This difference between the
networks was supported by the significant structural differences found by the NCT
between the NP group and the PP group. According to the network theory of mental
illness, networks with larger communities and stronger connectivity increase the
likelihood of self-sustaining feedback loops. A triggering event, which could be the
initial bad sexual experience, is hypothesized to activate the nodes in the network,
which in turn would activate other strongly connected nodes, creating a negative,
self-sustaining feedback loop.
These results are in line with Andersen and colleagues (1999) theory of
sexual self-schemas. A negative experience during first experience of sexual
intercourse might help formulate negative expectations relating to sexual intercourse,
expectations that in turn increase the likelihood of further negative experiences.
Additionally, Gebhard and colleagues (2019) found that men reacting with shame
when confronted with situations that threatened their masculinity were prone to be
more physically aggressive, which gives further credence to a self-fulfilling
prophecy. A predisposition to react with aggression to difficult experiences during
first intercourse, could lead to a higher likelihood to reacting aggressively in future
encounters. This could in turn lead to more sexual problems by either directing the
anger towards new sexual partners or suppressing the anger, leading to a selffulfilling prophecy. The inclusion of the solitary childhood maltreatment factor
sexual abuse in the largest community of the PP group was also of special interest, as
it aligns with the previous findings (Feiring et al., 2009; King et al., 2019), which
have found associations between being sexually abused as a child and aggressive

33
behavior in adulthood, including sexually aggressive behavior. Since sexual
dysfunctions have been associated with increased anger (Levy, 2002), another
possible hypothesis is generated by these results; do early failures in sexual activities
cause aggression and hostility in the individual later in life?

4.2 Differences and similarities on node level
Some interesting observations were found concerning differences and similarities on
individual node level, despite the fact that no significant results were found between
the networks. First of all, examining the descriptive data reveals that childhood
maltreatment does not seem to vary between the different groups, which indicates
that the differences found between the networks were not conditioned by differences
in childhood maltreatment. Aggressive tendencies were roughly equal in all the
groups, except for interest in coercion, which was somewhat elevated in the PP and
PnP groups. The PnP and the PP groups were the only groups to feature a negative
association between alcohol consumption and age of first sexual intercourse. This
negative association indicates that a higher current alcohol consumption is linked
with earlier sexual debut, or vice versa, that a lower current alcohol consumption
indicates a higher age of first sexual intercourse. Moreover, this negative association
was only evident in males who reported that they had experienced some kind of
problem during first experience of sexual intercourse. The first option is somewhat
in line with previous studies, that have found that an earlier sexual debut often
coincides with a higher alcohol consumption (Zimmer-Gembeck & Helfand, 2008).
Examining the descriptive data also revealed a slight increase in age of sexual debut
and alcohol consumption from the NP to the PP groups. This indicated that people
who had difficulties during first sexual intercourse, and those who had difficulties
during first intercourse that persisted, have a higher current alcohol consumption and
a later sexual debut compared to people who did not experience any difficulties
during first intercourse. A slight increase in anxiety was also found in the PnP and
PP groups, which gives support to Capaldi’s, Crosby’s and Stoolmiller’s (1996)
study, that found an association between a later sexual debut and anxiety. The
increase in age and anxiety coupled with the associations between aggressive
tendencies, psychological distress and sexual difficulties, especially ED, found in the

34
PP group is in line with previous studies, which has found an older age of first
intercourse to be associated with less relaxed attitudes toward sexuality and more
sexual guilt, which in turn could result in more sexual difficulties, especially ED
(Else-Quest, Hyde & DeLamater. 2005; Santtila, Sandnabba, & Jern, 2009).
Furthermore, Levy (2002) found that ED in particular was linked with increased
anger (Levy, 2002).
Secondly, emotional abuse was the most central node in all of the networks.
This could partly be due to it sharing strong edges with most of the other childhood
maltreatment nodes. The centrality of emotional abuse was strongest in the NP group
and decreased slightly in the following groups. The centrality of anger, aggression
and ED seemed to increase slightly in the groups that had experienced problems
during first intercourse, and the centrality of sexual distress appeared to increase in
the PP group. Due to the nature of partial correlation networks, it is not possible to
determine whether these nodes were more influential in these networks, or if they
correlated highly with surrounding nodes because they were the end of different
causal sequences.

4.3 Strengths, limitations and implications for future research
A notable strength of the present study was the population-based data set, which
stands out with its large sample size and because it had numerous measures that
captured both sexual function and variables related to sexual functioning. With the
exception of a few, most of the included measures had great psychometric
properties, and was thus well fitted for a self-assessment-based sample, which this
study utilized (e.g., ED, trait anger and aggression).
A limitation of the present study is its cross-sectional nature, as the
conclusions one can draw from a network based cross-sectional data is limited.
Questions regarding direction of causality cannot be examined without information
about the temporal order of symptoms, information that a cross-sectional design is
unable to give as cross-sectional data measures a perceived symptom at a single
point in time. Time-series data, on the other hand, is based on multiple connectable
measurements from different time points and would thus be better suited to make
conclusions regarding causality. The cross-sectional design prohibits me from

35
concluding if an individual with persisting difficulties stemming from the first
experience of sexual intercourse currently experiences higher levels of aggressive
tendencies or psychological distress due to the persisting problems, or if the
persisting problems were caused by already present aggressive tendencies or
psychological distress. Cross-sectional data has also been criticized for not being
able to accurately measure centrality in networks (Bos et al., 2017). However, crosssectional data has been proposed to be useful to examine how different symptoms
co-occur in the networks.
Another possible limitation is that retrospective self-report data may be
vulnerable to biases, not least self-disclosure bias, which is the tendencies to
deliberately give false information about oneself in regard to sensitive information
such as sexual history and recall bias. (Graham, Catania, Brand, Duong, & Canchola,
2003). Recall bias is a kind of measurement bias which stems from the variability in
participants’ capacity to recall events or experiences accurately, and can be affected
by our unreliable memory, our tendencies to seek meaning in memories and past
experiences, and mood states at the time of self-assessment (Hardt & Rutter, 2004;
Reuben et al., 2016). Depression, psychological distress or chronic stress has also
shown to increase the likelihood of self-reported childhood adversity (Colman et al.,
2016). As both depression and anxiety seemed to be more prevalent in the groups
that had experienced sexual difficulty during first sexual intercourse, it could have
affected the participants’ recollection of their experience. Furthermore, as the present
study was retrospective and asked the participants to self-evaluate their sexual
difficulties, it could be influenced by the above-mentioned biases.
There were also limitations in some of the used measurements: The variable
used to measure interest in coercion was, in its current form, not validated, although
the original scale has shown good psychometric properties. The MIPE-scale, used to
measure PE, had a low internal consistency when measured in the present sample. A
reason for the low internal consistency might be that the items in the MIPE cover
currently used diagnostic criteria, and these do not necessarily have high correlations
between each other (Ventus, 2019). The measure has however been shown to have
good psychometric properties in confirmatory factor analyses, and it can reliably
distinguish between diagnosed PE patients and controls (Jern, Piha, & Santtila,
2013).

36
The main aim of the present study was to formulate new hypotheses for
scrutiny of male sexual dysfunctions during first intercourse. One hypothesis
developed from the results of this study is whether aggressive tendencies increase
the likelihood of experiencing persisting sexual difficulties later in life. Another
possible hypothesis is whether these early failures in sexual activities causally leads
to increased aggression and hostility in the future. It would be interesting to gain
more insight into how much sexual difficulties during first intercourse affect
aggressive tendencies in men, or if it is aggressive tendencies that cause increased
sexual difficulties. These are questions that future research could focus on. Future
research should also include more variables connected to sexual dysfunctions in
men. Due to the limitations accompanied with cross-sectional data, it would be of
interest to use longitudinal samples to investigate cause-and-effect relationships
between variables. However, a dataset with numerous longitudinal observational
points revolving all the relevant factors do not, to the best of my knowledge, exist.
However, to gather information from a randomly selected group of men over a span
of several years would give us a better understanding of the directions of the found
associations. As this study is unable to examine whether sexual difficulties result in
an increase in aggressive tendencies, or if aggressive tendencies increase the
likelihood of sexual difficulties, a longitudinal study would be beneficial.

4.4 Conclusions
The present study used network analysis to investigate associations between sexual
difficulties during first experience of sexual intercourse, and current sexual
difficulties, aggressive tendencies, psychological distress, experience of childhood
trauma, age of first intercourse and current alcohol consumption. No differences
were found either in the global strength between the networks, in the edges between
the nodes or in strength centrality. A significant structural difference was however
found between the NP group and the PP group. Visual inspections and community
analysis only revealed associations between aggressive tendencies, mental distress,
sexual difficulties and the experience of childhood sexual abuse in the PP group.
Network analysis provides a unique ability to control for multiple variables.
This was beneficial to the explorative nature of the present study, as it could give

37
insight into several associations of importance. As the study was explorative, future
research should try to delve deeper into the exploration of the different associations
discovered in the present study, preferably with longitudinal data, to gain more
insight into the causes for and implications of sexual difficulties during first sexual
intercourse.

5 En nätverksanalys om manlig sexuell funktion: jämförande av
symptomnätverk hos män som upplevt varierande grader av sexuella
dysfunktioner under första samlaget
5.1 Introduktion
Första erfarenheten av samlag är en formativ och central händelse för de flesta, och
symboliserar början på en persons sexuella och reproduktiva liv (Heywood et al.,
2015). Få studier har granskat vilka faktorer som är kopplade till sexuella svårigheter
under första samlaget, och hur dessa svårigheter kan påverka individen senare i livet
(Rapsey, 2014). Utöver detta finns det även få studier som undersökt hur
sexualitetsrelaterade svårigheter är kopplade till aggressiva tendenser, speciellt då
det kommer till associationen mellan sexuell aggression och sexuella svårigheter
under ens första samlag (Gebhard et al., 2019; Levy, 2002). Denna avhandling
ämnade undersöka de potentiella associationer som kan finnas mellan sexuella
dysfunktioner under första samlaget och aggressiva tendenser, sexuell aggression,
psykologiska problem och flertalet andra relevanta variabler.
Manlig sexuell dysfunktion
Den internationella klassifikationen av sjukdomar och relaterade hälsoproblem -11
(World Health Organization, 2018) definierar sexuella dysfunktioner som de olika
sätt en individ kan vara oförmögen att delta i en sexuell relation så som han eller hon
önskar. De två mest prevalenta manliga sexuella dysfunktionerna är erektil
dysfunktion (ED) och prematur ejakulation (PE) (Santtila, Sandnabba, & Jern,
2009). ED definieras som oförmågan att uppnå och upprätthålla en erektion
tillräckligt länge för sexuell aktivitet (World Health Organization, 2018), och
tenderar vara mera prevalent hos äldre individer (Feldman et al., 1994). ED är även
associerat med övervikt, diabetes och mental ohälsa (Bortolotti et al., 1998; Jern et
al., 2012). PE kan beskrivas som en oförmåga att kontrollera ejakulationen
tillräckligt länge för båda de involverade partnernas tillfredsställelse (Jannini et al.,
2015; World Health Organization, 2018). Prevalensen för PE är inte kopplat till
ålder, och studier har enbart visat på svaga korrelationer mellan PE och mental
ohälsa, korrelationer som inte verkar vara stabila över tid (Prost et al., 2006; Ventus
et al., 2017).

39

Första sexuella samlaget, sexuella dysfunktioner och aggressiva tendenser
I Finland ligger mäns medelålder för det första samlaget på 17 år (Johansson et al.,
2013). En systematisk litteraturöversikt gjord av Zimmer-Gembeck och Helfand
(2008) har påvisat associationer mellan att ha sin sexuella debut under 15 års ålder
och aggression samt alkoholanvändning. Systematiska litteraturöversikter har även
funnit att de som har sin sexuella debut i en yngre ålder har en större sannolikhet att
lida av psykologiska problem (Mota, Cox, Katz, & Sareen, 2010). Åldern vid det
första samlaget har även en central roll då kopplingar till sexuella dysfunktioner
undersöks. I sin studie konstaterade Sandfort, Orr, Hirsch, and Santelli (2008) att
män som initierade samlag tidigare eller senare än sina jämnåriga hade en ökad risk
för sexuella dysfunktioner. Författarna till studien ansåg dock att denna koppling
sannolikt kunde förklaras av andra variabler än ålder, så som alkoholkonsumtion i
samband med samlaget eller oro över sen sexuell debut. Denna förklaring stöddes av
Else-Quesst, Hydes och DeLamaters (2005) samt Rapseys (2014) studier, som inte
fann någon direkt association mellan ålder vid första samlaget och sexuella
dysfunktioner. De fann däremot att den emotionella kvaliteten av det första samlaget
var av störst vikt. Andersens, Cyranowskis och Espindles (1999) teori om sexuella
självscheman (eng. sexual self-schemas), kan ge en insikt i hur de sexuella
dysfunktioner som upplevts under första samlaget består. Sexuella självscheman
skapas före och under det första samlaget, och påverkar hur en person tänker om
sexualitet i framtiden. Negativa upplevelser som skapar negativa scheman kan alltså
leda till självuppfyllande profetior (Rowland, Kostelyk, & Tempel, 2016).
Studier har även visat på att individer som har benägenhet för att känna stark
skam i situationer då deras maskulinitet blivit hotad har en högre tendens för
aggressivt beteende (Gebhard et al., 2019). Att ha blivit utsatt för sexuell misshandel
som barn har även kopplats till aggressivt och sexuellt aggressivt beteende i vuxen
ålder. (Feiring, Simon och Cleland, 2009; King et al., 2019).
Nätverksanalys
Nätverksperspektivet på psykopatologier är ett teoretiskt ramverk som, istället för
det traditionella synsättet med underliggande psykologiska sjukdomar, beskriver
psykologiska problem som dynamiska nätverk, där symptomen samverkar med
varandra (Borsboom, 2017). I en nätverksanalys kallas de olika symptomen eller

40
variablerna för noder (eng. nodes). Noder som påverkar varandra kopplas samman
genom partiella korrelationer (eng. edges). Händelser utanför nätverket, till exempel
stress på jobbet, kan influera noder i nätverket, som sedan aktiverar resten av
nätverket (Borsboon, 2017). Noder som är starkt kopplade till varandra kan i och
med en yttre aktivering fastna och aktivera varandra trots att den initiala yttre
stimuleringen försvinner. Detta fenomen, då noder upprätthåller varandras aktivitet
utan yttre stimuli kallas på engelska ”hysteresis”, och uppkommer mera sällan i
nätverk som har svaga och få kopplingar mellan noderna. Ett nätverk med många
starka kopplingar är således mera sårbart än ett nätverk med svaga kopplingar
(Borsboom, 2017), och i starkt kopplade nätverk kan det skapas kluster (eng.
communities) av noder som starkt influerar varandra. Noderna i ett nätverk kan även
variera i centralitet, alltså hur stor betydelse den specifika noden har i nätverket.
Syfte och hypotes
Syftet med föreliggande avhandling var att använda mig av nätverksanalyser för att
undersöka associationerna mellan problem under första samlaget och aggression,
nuvarande sexuella dysfunktioner och psykologiska problem hos män. Männen i
studien togs från ett populationsbaserat sampel, och delades in i tre grupper baserat
på om de upplevt några problem under första samlaget eller inte. Eftersom få studier
undersökt sambandet mellan problem under första samlaget och aggression var
studien explorativ. Det huvudsakliga syftet var att utveckla nya hypoteser gällande
manlig sexuell dysfunktion under första samlaget. I hypotes ett antogs att
kopplingarna skulle vara starkare i nätverken hos män hade upplevt problem under
första samlaget. Hypotes två var att splittringen (eng. fragmentation) skulle vara
lägre i nätverken hos män som upplevt problem under första samlaget. Detta skulle
innebära att dessa nätverk skulle innehålla större kluster av starkt sammankopplade
noder.

5.2 Metod
Deltagare och mått
Nätverksanalyserna i den föreliggande avhandlingen utfördes på ett sampel av 1056
män mellan åldrarna 18 och 46 år. Samplet bestod av frågeformulärssvar av män

41
som deltagit i en storskalig finsk populationsbaserad datainsamling (the Genetics of
Sexuality and Aggression study; se Johansson et al., 2013). Deltagarna hade gett sitt
skriftliga samtycke till att delta i studien, och forskningsetiknämnden vid Åbo
Akademi gav tillåtelse för studien. Ursprungligen bestod samplet av 3331 män. I de
fall där flera syskon från en familj deltagit valdes ett av syskonen slumpmässigt ut
för denna studie. Respondenter som hade för mycket obesvarade frågor
exkluderades.
De inkluderade variablerna i nätverksanalyserna mätte sexuella problem,
psykologiska problem, barndomstrauma, aggressiva tendenser, alkoholkonsumtion
och ålder för första samlaget. Sexuella problem mättes med tre variabler: PE
(Multiple Indicators of Premature Ejaculation [MIPE]; Jern, Piha, & Santtila, 2013),
ED (International Index of Erectile Function -5[IIEF-5]; Rosen et al., 1999) och
sexuell ångest (Sexual Distress Scale [SDS]; Santos-Iglesias et al., 2018).
Psykologiska problem mättes med hjälp av två depressions- och ångestskalor (Brief
Symptoms Inventory-18[BSI-18]; Derogatis & Melisaratos, 1979), medan
alkoholkonsumtion mättes med hjälp av AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorders
Identification Test for Consumption; Bush et al., 1998). Tre variabler användes för
att mäta aggressiva tendenser: aggressivt beteende, mätt med den verbala och fysiska
underskalan från Buss och Perrys (1992) ”Aggression Questionnaire” (AQ), ilska
(STAXI-2; Spielberger, 1999) och sexuell aggression (Male interest in Coercion
scale [MIC]; Malamuth, 1989). För barndomstrauma inkluderades fem variabler:
fysisk misshandel, fysisk negligering, emotionell misshandel, emotionell negligering
och sexuell misshandel, alla tagna från ”Childhood Trauma Questionnaire” (CTQSF; Bernstein et al., 2003). Utöver dessa frågades även deltagarna efter ålder vid
första samlaget.
Statistiska analyser
Deltagarna delades in i tre lika stora grupper (n = 352) baserat på deras svar på en
fråga som undersökte om de upplevt problem under första samlaget, och ifall dessa
problem fortsatt eller ej. Svarsalternativen var ”inga problem”, ”problemen fortsatte
inte”, ”problemen fortsatte” och ”har inte haft sex igen”. De som svarade att de inte
haft sex igen (n = 9) exkluderades, och 352 per grupp valdes slumpmässigt ut. För
att underlätta läsande kommer grupperna hädanefter kallas för IP (inga problem),
PFI (problemen fortsatte inte) och PF (problemen fortsatte). Variablerna imputerades

42
för att hantera bortfall, och summavariabler kalkylerades av de imputerade
variablerna. Analyserna utfördes i R 3.6.1, och paketen bootnet (Epskamp,
Borsboom, & Fried, 2018), qgraph (Epskamp, Cramer, Waldorp, Schmittmann, &
Borsboom, 2012), igraph (Csárdi & Nepusz, 2014) och NetworkComparisonTest
(NCT; van Borkulo et al., 2016) användes.
De nätverk som estimerades i denna avhandling var så kallade ”Gaussian
Graphical Models” (GGM), och ett nätverk per grupp estimerades för att visualisera
de partiella korrelationerna mellan variablerna. För att göra nätverken mera
överskådliga, och för att undvika falska positiva partiella korrelationer, så användes
en strikt regulariseringsteknik (LASSO; Tibshirani, 2011). LASSO estimerar flera
olika modeller, och för att välja den modell som passade bäst in på data användes
sedan metoden ”EBIC model selection” (Foygel & Drton, 2010). Partiella
korrelationsnätverk kräver normalt fördelade kontinuerliga variabler, dock kan
bootnet paketet identifiera och automatiskt omvandla de ordinala variabler som var
inkluderade i denna avhandling så att de passar in i modellen. Fruchterman-Reingold
algoritmen användes för att bestämma nätverkens visuella utseende. Algoritmen
organiserar data så att noder som är kopplade attraherar varandra, medan icke
kopplade noder avstöter varandra. För att vidare undersöka de specifika nodernas
inflytande inom nätverken utfördes analyser av nodernas centralitet. Nodernas
centralitetsmått och partiella korrelationer undersöktes därefter vidare, och mått på
modellens precision och stabilitet kalkylerades för dessa. Nätverken jämfördes även
med varandra för att se huruvida det fanns signifikanta skillnader i endera strukturen,
den totala styrkan, dess centralitet, eller ifall skillnader hittades i strukturen,
skillnader i specifika partiella korrelationer. Avslutningsvis utfördes även
klusteranalyser (eng. communityanalyses), för att undersöka hurdana kluster som
bildades inom nätverken. En högre splittring inom nätverken tydde på att nätverket
innehöll färre kluster av starkt kopplade noder (Epskamp & Fried, 2018).

5.3 Resultat
En strukturell signifikant skillnad hittades mellan IP gruppen och PF gruppen (M =
0,30, p < 0,05), dock hittades ingen signifikant strukturell skillnad mellan vare sig IP
gruppen och PFI gruppen ((M = 0,27, p = 0,54) eller mellan PFI gruppen och PF

43
gruppen (M = 0,24, p = 0,81). Skillnaderna i total styrka mellan IP gruppen och PFI
gruppen (S = 0,54, p = 0,36), PFI gruppen och PF gruppen (S = 0,71, p = 0,18) samt
IP gruppen och PF gruppen (S = 0,17, p = 0,75) var inte signifikanta. Ingen av de
individuella kopplingarna eller styrkan i centraliteten för de olika noderna avvek sig
signifikant från varandra mellan någon av grupperna.
Observationer av de visuella representationerna av nätverken visade att
nätverken överlag hade få kopplingar (Figur 1). En liten skillnad i mängden
kopplingar kunde dock observeras mellan nätverken, där IP gruppen och PF gruppen
hade 12 kopplingar var, medan PFI gruppen enbart hade 9 kopplingar. Alla nätverk
hade noder som var utan kopplingar, dock bytte ingen koppling riktning mellan
grupperna.
PF gruppen var den enda gruppen som uppvisade en koppling mellan
noderna som mätte aggressiva tendenser och sexuella svårigheter. Kopplingen gick
genom de noder som mätte psykologisk problematik och var positiv, vilket tyder på
att mera problem i någon av dessa domäner är associerat med mera problem i de
andra domänerna. Denna grupp var även den enda gruppen som visade på en, i detta
fall positiv, koppling mellan noderna som representerar aggression och ilska och
noden som representerar sexuell aggression. PF gruppen var även den enda gruppen
som visade på en association, i detta fall en negativ sådan, mellan
alkoholkonsumtion och ålder vid första samlaget.
Klusteranalyserna visade både på skillnader i splittring och i hur noderna
ordnade sig i kluster i de olika nätverken (Figur 2). IP gruppen hade sju kluster, PFI
gruppen hade åtta kluster och PF gruppen hade tre kluster. PF gruppen hade inte
enbart det minst splittrade nätverket, utan var även det enda nätverket med ett kluster
som innehöll både aggressiva tendenser, psykologiska problem och sexuella
problem.
Figur 3 visar de standardiserade centralitetsmåtten för de tre nätverkens
noder. Emotionell misshandel hade högst centralitet i alla nätverk, och alla tre
nätverk fann låg centralitet för noderna som representerar sexuell misshandel,
alkoholkonsumtion, sexuell aggression, PE, ED och ålder vid första samlaget.
Centralitetsmåtten följde liknande mönster i alla tre grupper. Bootstrap-estimeringar
utfördes för att testa hur precis och stabil modellen var. Centralitetsmåtten var stabila
i IP och PF grupperna, men något ostabila i PFI gruppen. En del av kopplingarna

44
visade sig potentiellt vara ostabila (se kompletterande materialet för mera

5.4 Diskussion
I förevarande avhandling estimerade jag partiella korrelationsnätverk för att utforska
sambandet mellan manlig sexuell dysfunktion under det första samlaget och
aggressiva tendenser, nuvarande sexuella dysfunktioner, psykologiska problem,
barndomstrauma och andra relevanta variabler. Avhandlingen var av en explorativ
karaktär, och hade som huvudsakligt mål att bidra med nya insikter och hypoteser
gällande manliga sexuella dysfunktioner under första samlaget. I hypotes ett antogs
att antalet kopplingar inom nätverken skulle öka från IP gruppen till PF gruppen.
Resultaten från nätverksanalyserna gav dock inte stöd för denna hypotes, då inga
skillnader upptäcktes i den totala styrkan mellan någon av grupperna. Hypotes två
formulerades som att splittringen skulle minska inom nätverken från IP gruppen till
PF gruppen. Resultaten från klusteranalyserna gav stöd till denna hypotes, och
visade på att PF gruppen hade färre kluster än de andra grupperna. Utöver detta
visade även resultaten från analyserna på en signifikant skillnad i strukturen på
nätverken mellan IP gruppen och PF gruppen.
Visuella inspektioner av nätverken fann att enbart PF gruppen hade
kopplingar mellan sexuella dysfunktioner och aggressiva tendenser, kopplingar som
i detta fall var positiva och gick igenom noderna som representerade psykologiska
problem. Dessa kopplingar understöddes av de strukturella skillnader som påvisades
mellan IP gruppen och PF gruppen, och av resultaten från de klusteranalyser som
utfördes. Enligt nätverksteorin för mentala sjukdomar ökar nätverk med större
kluster och starkare kopplingar risken för självupprätthållande återkopplingskretsar
(Cramer et al., 2016). Dessa resultat är i linje med teorin om sexuella självscheman
(Andersen et al., 1999). En negativ upplevelse under första samlaget kan ha en
negativ inverkan på ens förväntningar relaterat till samlag. Dessa förväntningar ökar
därefter sannolikheten för ytterligare negativa upplevelser.
Den negativa associationen mellan alkoholkonsumtion och ålder vid första
samlaget i PF gruppen indikerar att en högre alkoholkonsumtion är relaterat med en
yngre ålder vid första samlaget, eller tvärtom, hos de som upplevt bestående problem

45
från första samlaget. Det första alternativet av denna koppling är i linje med tidigare
studier, som visat att en yngre ålder vid första samlaget är associerat med större
alkoholkonsumtion (Zimmer-Gembeck & Helfand, 2008).
Noden emotionell misshandel hade högst centralitet i alla tre nätverk. Detta
kan delvis förklaras av att noden delar starka kopplingar till de andra noderna som
stod för barndomstrauma.
Styrkor, begränsningar och sammanfattning
En noterbar styrka med föreliggande avhandling var det populationsbaserade data,
som står ut i sin sampelstorlek och i de åtskilliga mått på sexuell funktion som
inkluderats. Med några få undantag visade de använda måtten även på bra
psykometriska egenskaper, vilket var en styrka. Användningen av nätverksanalyser
var även väl lämpad för avhandlingen, då den var explorativ till sin karaktär.
Den första begränsningen med avhandlingen var användningen av
tvärsnittsdata framom longitudinellt data, då frågor gällande kausalitet inte kan
besvaras av tvärsnittsdata. En annan potentiell begränsning är det faktum att
retrospektivt självrapporterat data kan vara utsatt för skevhet. Både skevhet baserat
på en deltagares ovilja att ge ärliga svar (eng. self-disclosure bias) och skevhet på
grund av svårigheter med att korrekt utvärdera tidigare händelser och känslor (eng.
recall bias) kan påverka hur deltagarna svarat på de olika frågorna i frågeformulären
(Graham, Catania, Brand, Duong, & Canchola, 2003). Ett mål med denna avhandling
var att skapa nya hypoteser gällande manliga sexuella dysfunktioner under första
samlaget. Baserat på resultaten från denna avhandling uppstår frågorna huruvida
aggressiva tendenser leder till bestående sexuella dysfunktioner, eller om tidiga
sexualla misslyckanden kan orsaka framtida aggressiva tendenser. För att svara på
dessa frågor kunde framtida forskning estimera nätverk baserat på individuellt
longitudinellt data.
Sammanfattningsvis kan man konstatera att PF gruppen hade det minst
splittrade nätverket, alltså hade denna grupp få och stora kluster med starkt
kopplande noder i sig. Positiva kopplingar mellan sexuella problem, psykologiska
problem och aggressiva tendenser var även tydliga enbart i denna grupp, vilket tyder
på att ett samband mellan nuvarande sexuella problem och aggressiva tendenser
existerar hos de som upplevt problem under första samlaget. Signifikanta skillnader
uppvisades även i strukturen mellan PF gruppen och IP gruppen. Nätverksanalyser

46
tillhandahåller en unik förmåga att kontrollera multipla variabler, och således är de
väl anpassade för att undersöka komplexa fenomen. De olika associationer som
denna avhandling upptäckte har bidragit med ny information till ämnet, information
som framtida forskning kunde utforska djupare.

PRESSMEDDELANDE
En nätverksanalys om manlig sexuell funktion: jämförande av symptomnätverk hos
män som upplevt varierande grader av sexuella dysfunktioner under första samlaget
Pro gradu-avhandling i psykologi
Fakulteten för humaniora, psykologi och teologi, Åbo Akademi

Nätverksteorin har under de senaste åren blivit populär inom psykologin. Tanken
bakom denna teori är att psykiska sjukdomar uppstår som resultat av aktiveringar i så
kallade symptomnätverk. I nätverk där symptom är nära besläktade med varandra,
eller starkt kopplade till varandra, så ökar risken att symptom aktiverar varandra. Då
tillräckligt många symptom är aktiverade kan en psykisk sjukdom uppkomma.
Johannes Nylund tillämpade nätverksteorin i sin pro gradu-avhandling vid Åbo
Akademi för att undersöka manliga sexuella dysfunktioner under det första samlaget.
Resultaten tydde på att män som haft fortgående sexuella problem efter det första
samlaget hade starkare kopplingar mellan aggressiva tendenser, psykologiska
problem och nuvarande sexuella dysfunktioner.
Män som upplevt sexuella dysfunktioner under det första samlaget som
fortsatt hade färre och större kluster av starkt kopplade variabler. En signifikant
strukturell skillnad hittades även mellan män som upplevt fortgående problem efter
första samlaget och män som inte upplevt några problem under första samlaget.
Denna avhandling bidrog med att belysa de kopplingar som finns mellan att uppleva
sexuella dysfunktioner under första samlaget och aggressivitet, psykologiska
problem och nuvarande sexuella svårigheter.
Det data som användes i avhandlingen togs från en stor datainsamling utförd
av Åbo Akademi 2006. Frågeformulärssvar från totalt 1056 män mellan åldrarna 18
och 46 användes som sampel. Deltagarna delades in i tre lika stora grupper baserat
på om de upplevt problem under första samlaget eller ej, och huruvida problemen
blivit bestående eller ej.
