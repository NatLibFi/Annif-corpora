Abstract
Electrolyte-gated organic field-effect transistors (EGOFETs) have great potential in extremely sensitive biosensors due to their low-voltage operation and flexible design. These
devices suffer from stability issues that need to be rectified before large scale manufacture
is possible. The cause, as well as the mechanism, of the instability is poorly understood.
The objective of this thesis is to shed a light on the dominating degradation mechanisms
in poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) devices operating in an aqueous environment, in
order to improve their stability.
Several P3HT films were manufactured using different protocols. The optical absorption spectra of the films were measured and analysed by applying a weakly interacting Haggregate model. A highly regioregular (>99 %) semiconductor spin coated from a 4 mg ml−1
chlorobenzene solution was shown to form films with a microstructure optimal for transistors. Films of different thicknesses were characterised. No correlation between film thickness
and microstructure was found.
To investigate the effects of water on P3HT, identically prepared samples were stored
either in ambient air or submerged in water. Before and after storage, thin film parameters
were extracted from the absorption spectrum. After exposure to air, the film was found to
have undergone massive degradation. The samples stored in water showed little to no degradation, indicating that exposure to water alone does not cause significant microstructural
changes in P3HT.
P3HT EGOFET device degradation was monitored over a period of a month, registering
around 4,000 transfer characteristics. During this time, no consistent shift in threshold
voltage could be observed. This is in stark contrast to solid-state OFETs where a threshold
voltage shift is the main mechanism of degradation. The observed decrease in current was
instead caused by a decrease in mobility and an increase in trap density. It was shown that
device degradation is a function of electrical stress rather than exposure to water.
Using the Vissenberg-Matters model, the decrease in mobility was modelled as a widening
of an exponential trap density of states. Modelling parameters were very similar to earlier
reported values, indicating the model is valid also for water-gated devices. The increase in
trap density given by the model was in close agreement to a very simple estimation based
on the subthreshold swing.

1 INTRODUCTION

Introduction

1.1

Organic electronics

The invention of the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) in 1959
enabled a miniaturisation of logical circuits that changed the world. [1] In the 60 years
since, the size of transistors has decreased by many orders of magnitude, with switching
speeds and transistor densities increasing. This led to an exponential growth in computer
speeds and propelled the world into the information age. Today, semiconductors are found
in nearly all electrical applications, usually as part of microprocessors or electrical circuits
but also in other devices. Their photoelectric properties are utilised in sensors, solar cells
and different kinds of light sources.
Semiconducting π-conjugated polymers have the potential to provide cost effective alternatives to inorganic semiconductors in some applications; in others they may be revolutionising. [2] Organic semiconductors are solution processable, enabling fast and low-cost
large-scale manufacturing using techniques such as inkjet printing and roll to roll deposition. The temperatures during manufacturing are low, meaning the use of substrates such
as paper and plastic is possible. The use of cheap and easily recyclable substrates is a major
advantage when making environmentally friendly or disposable devices. As the polymers
themselves are mechanically flexible, bendable devices and circuits can be constructed. Organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) have already revolutionised the display industry, with
the technology being used in many high-end TVs and handheld devices. In 2019, the first
smartphone with a foldable OLED display was launched. In the energy sector, organic solar
cells have the potential to be equally disruptive, although production of competitive devices on an industrial scale is still a few years away. Low efficiency and poor environmental
stability are major issues, though progress is constantly being made. Organic field-effect
transistors (OFET) suffer from similar problems and will likely never approach either the
high charge carrier mobility, gigahertz switching frequency or nanometer scale size of the
MOSFET. Nevertheless, they have potential in large-area circuitry and in biosensors, with
a type of the latter being the focus of this work.

1 INTRODUCTION

Organic field-effect transistors

The OFET, like any other transistor, is a three-terminal device. A current flowing between
the source and drain terminals can be modulated by biasing the gate terminal. The sourceand drain terminals are connected by the organic semiconductor, while the gate terminal is
separated from the semiconductor by an insulator, here referred to as the gate dielectric.
There are many different physical configurations for the OFET, with the common top-gate
bottom-contact structure shown in figure 1.1. With increasing bias on the gate electrode,
charges in the semiconductor are accumulated in a thin layer at the dielectric interface. As
the gate bias exceeds the threshold voltage, the charge concentration is high enough for a
conductive channel to form, greatly reducing the resistance between the source- and drain
electrodes and enabling a current to flow. This process switches the transistor from the
off-state to the on-state.

Figure 1.1: Basic structure of a top-gate bottom-contact OFET.
Ideally, a transistor should deliver a high ratio between on- and off-current at low voltages.
This can be achieved by increasing the capacitance of the dielectric and thus the charge
accumulation in the semiconductor. As shown by
Cd =

κϵ0
,
d

(1.1)

where Cd is the capacitance per unit area, κ is the dielectric constant of the gate dielectric, ϵ0
is the vacuum permittivity and d is the dielectric thickness, there are two ways to achieve this
goal. Either reducing the thickness of the dielectric or increasing the dielectric constant will
lead to an increase in capacitance. One approach is to replace the solid gate dielectric with
an electrolyte, creating an electrolyte-gated organic field-effect transistor (EGOFET). The
EGOFET is of much interest in organic biosensors due to its simplicity and high sensitivity
to changes in both the semiconductor/electrolyte and gate/electrolyte interfaces. [3] In a
2

Axel Luukkonen

1 INTRODUCTION

transistor-based biosensor, bioreceptors are immobilised on either the surface of the gate or
the semiconductor. The electrolyte interface changes slightly when a target molecule binds
to the receptor, affecting the capacitance and in turn the charge accumulation layer in the
organic semiconductor, leading to a change in the source-drain current.

1.3

Purpose of the thesis

Like many other organic electronic devices, OFETs and EGOFETs suffer from degradation
and poor environmental stability. For a transistor to be usable as a sensor, the current
between source and drain needs to be stable during the sensing measurements. Stability issues typically manifest as any combination of increase in hysteresis, increase in gate leakage
current, threshold voltage shift and decrease in on-current. [4, 5] An unstable transistor can
lead to a false positive or a false negative. Major time savings and performance improvements could be facilitated by producing either more stable EGOFETs or a reliable model
for predicting device degradation behaviour. In order to achieve either goal, the degradation
mechanisms of EGOFETs needs to be well understood.
In this work I have investigated the degradation mechanisms and long-term operational
stability of a poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) based EGOFET with an aqueous gate medium.
This transistor design has been successfully used in sensors, achieving up to single-molecule
levels of sensitivity. [6, 7] While the degradation mechanisms in conventional OFETs are
well studied [8–12], few studies have been conducted on electrolyte-gated devices, especially
over longer time periods than a few hours. [5]
It is well known that semiconducting polymers in general are sensitive to oxygen and
humidity. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that submersion in water could lead to significant
environmental stress. On the other hand, studies on conventional OFETs have pointed to
gate biasing as the main reason for device degradation, as charge carriers are trapped in the
dielectric. [8, 13] For a water-gated device, some other mode of degradation can be expected
to dominate.
By conducting absorption measurements and utilising the weakly-interacting H-aggregate
model [14] it is possible to observe how important microstructural parameters are affected by
manufacturing conditions and exposure to water. Long term changes in the transistor figures
of merit are modelled using both a simplified analytical model and Vissenberg & Matters
theory of field-effect mobility in organic semiconductors. [15] Results from the absorption

Charge transport in conductive polymers
Electronic structure

In carbon chains or rings with alternating single and double bonds, carbon atoms are in a
state of sp2 hybridisation. Each carbon atom has three sp2 orbitals used to form σ-bonds
and one p orbital used to form π-bonds. Whereas binding between atoms happens with
σ-bonds, the perpendicular pz orbitals overlap and combine with neighbouring pz orbitals
over the σ-bonds. The phenomenon is known as π-conjugation. The pz orbitals can combine
either in-phase or out-of phase. The in-phase, or bonding, combination has lower energy
than the original pz -orbital, and the out-of phase, antibonding, combination has a higher
energy. The electrons in the pz orbitals become delocalised across all neighbouring orbitals.
The delocalised electrons do not belong to any single atom but rather to a larger group of
atoms. In π-conjugated polymers the conjugated system can extend across the whole carbon
backbone of the molecule. In materials like graphene, the π-conjugated system can be as
large as the lattice. On a larger scale, the combinations of low-energy bonding states and
high-energy antibonding states form an energy system similar to the valence and conduction
bands in inorganic crystals. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is similar
to the valence band and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is similar to
the conduction band. The HOMO and LUMO levels are separated by a band gap which
generally is > 2 eV. Electrons can be excited from a state in the HOMO-level to a state in the
LUMO-level, leaving behind a hole which can be seen as a quasiparticle with the charge +e.
Depending on the semiconductor and electrode material energy levels, one charge carrier will
usually have better injection into the semiconductor and thus a much higher conductivity.
A semiconductor where electron transport dominates is labelled n-channel and one where
hole transport dominates is called p-channel. P3HT, the semiconductor used in this work,
is a p-channel semiconductor.
2.1.2

Variable-range hopping model

The HOMO- and LUMO- levels are concepts reminiscent of the valence- and conductionbands in crystalline semiconductors, however the transport mechanism in organic semiconductors is substantially different. In crystalline solids the transport is intramolecular, as the
5

delocalised electron system extends through the whole material. Although electrons in a
π-conjugated system are delocalised, the disorder in organic semiconductors prevent delocalization over longer distances than a molecule or a segment of a polymer. Charges instead
move via intermolecular hopping transport between localised states. [16] This leads to a
much lower mobility compared to inorganic semiconductors.
In order to transition from one localised state to another, the electron must tunnel
through the potential barrier separating the states. When the tunnelling is thermally assisted
it is referred to as hopping. In the variable-range hopping model, charges can either hop
short distance through a high potential barrier, or a longer distance through a lower potential
barrier. In other words, the probability of hopping between two states is dependent on both
the spatial R and energy separation ∆E of the states. [16] The probability has the form
∆E
P ∼ exp −2αR −
,
kB T

(︄

where α− 1 is the hydrogen-like wavefunction attenuation length. [17] The conductivity
predicted by the variable range hopping model in a constant density of states (DOS) is
σ = σ0 e−T1 /T

1/4

(2.2)

at low temperatures in three dimensions. The conductivity increases with temperature as
charges acquire more energy, enabling longer jumps and leading to higher mobilities. In
reality, the density of states consists of a gaussian tail extending into the band gap. Since
the charges are localised inside the band gap, the localised state DOS is commonly referred
to as the trap DOS.

2.2

The weakly interacting H-aggregate model for absorption

During absorption or emission in organic semiconductors, vibronic transitions take place.
Vibronic transitions change both the electronic and vibrational energy levels of a molecule.
The Franck-Condon principle explains the intensities of the different vibronic transitions
and has been formulated both classically and quantum mechanically. [18] The classical
approximation states that in a molecule undergoing an electronic transition, such as an
absorption of a photon, the atomic nuclei experience no change. They are much more
massive than the electrons and the transition takes place too quickly to significantly affect
them. When the nucleus then "notices" the new electronic configuration, it is realigned by the
6

Axel Luukkonen

2 THEORY

emission of phonons. In a polymer, this corresponds to deformation of the carbon backbone.
For any molecule, there are several available vibronic states. A transition from the ground
state to the lowest excited vibronic state is denoted 0 − 0, a transition to the second lowest
0 − 1 and so on. Each vibronic state can be thought of as consisting of a single vibrational
state and many possible electronic states. The principle states that vibronic transitions will
occur in a way that minimises the molecular vibrations.
Quantum mechanically, the transition is approximated as a dipole transition. The probability amplitude for transition between the initial and final states is then
P = ⟨ψ ′ | µ |ψ⟩ ,

(2.3)

where ψ and ψ ′ are the wavefunctions for the initial and final states. The Frack-Condon principle separates the electronic and nuclear wavefunctions by utilising the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation. The overall wavefunction of the initial state can then be expressed as
ψ = ψe ψv ,

(2.4)

where ψe is the electronic wavefunction and ψv is the vibrational wavefunction. Correspondingly the final state waveform is
ψ ′ = ψe′ ψv′ .

(2.5)

The spin component of the wavefunction has been left out for simplicity. The dipole transition operator µ depends only on the electronic component and the transition probability
integral can be separated into
P = ⟨ψ ′ | µ |ψ⟩ = ⟨ψv′ | ⟨ψe′ | µ |ψe ⟩ |ψv ⟩ = ⟨ψv′ |ψv ⟩ ⟨ψe′ | µ |ψe ⟩ .

(2.6)

The term ⟨ψv′ |ψv ⟩ is the nuclear wavefunction overlap integral. If the integral is zero for a
transition, it is not allowed. For each allowed electronic transition, there are a large number
of vibrational transitions possible. The Franck-Condon principle does not massively affect
the intensity of transitions, but rather creates a progression of vibronic peaks corresponding
to the many different electrical transitions available for each vibrational transition. In an
absorption spectrum, vibrational transitions can be thought of as infinitely narrow lines,
enclosed by gaussian distributions of electronic transitions.
When organic semiconductor films are formed, the packing arrangement of the polymers strongly influence the intermolecular interactions and transport. [19, 20] Films can be
7

Axel Luukkonen

2 THEORY

crystalline, amorphous or have both crystalline aggregate regions and amorphous regions.
Manufacturing conditions can influence the crystallinity of the film, but some polymers form
only amorphous films. In aggregates, activation energies for the hopping transport can be
very low, facilitating high mobilities. The molecular aggregates can be of two different forms
depending on which kind of molecular stacking is present in the material. When two identical molecules interact, there is a shift in the electronic ground state and a splitting of the
excited state. If the molecules are arranged in a head-to-tail configuration, the transition
moment to the higher lying excited state becomes zero and that transition is forbidden. A
polymer aggregate where such stacking dominates is called a J-aggregate. A configuration
where molecules stack side-by-side, like a stack of cards, is called an H-aggregate. In an
H-aggregate, transition to the lower excited state is forbidden. Thus, the absorption spectrum of H-aggregates will be blueshifted compared to the isolated molecule, while absorption
will be redshifted for a J-aggregate. While the H- and J-aggregate descriptions are useful,
absorption in many organic semiconductors, for instance P3HT, is not perfectly described
by either model.

and has become something of a benchmark molecule for p-channel organic semiconductors. When manufactured into thin films, P3HT chains spontaneously arrange into twodimensional lamellar stacks, illustrated in figure 2.1b. [14, 21] The stacks are in turn separated by regions filled by more disordered chains. The polymers inside the stacks are packed
closely, whereas the stacks are separated from each other by greater distances. The mix of
aggregate and amorphous regions in P3HT films and the lamellar stacking means it is not
possible to fit the absorption spectrum with a simple Franck-Condon progression. Neither
does the aggregates fit a H-aggregate description as they are separated by the amorphous
regions. To properly describe the optical absorption and emission spectrum of polymers
behaving like P3HT, a weakly interacting H-aggregate model was developed by Spano et
al.. [14] The lamellar structures are considered H-aggregates, but they are only allowed to
interact weakly due to the energetic disorder in the material. The P3HT absorption spectrum, figure 2.2, is made up of a lower energy part from weakly interacting H-aggregate
states and a higher energy part from disordered intrachain states. Using the model, it is
possible to estimate film parameters from the absorption spectrum. The parameters are the
amount of aggregation and the degree of excitonic coupling within the aggregates, related to
the average conjugation length and crystalline quality. These parameters greatly influence
OFET performance.
In a weakly interacting H-aggregate the 0 − 1 and higher transitions are less intense
compared to their single molecule values. The 0 − 0 transition that is forbidden in pure
H-aggregates becomes allowed due to the energetic disorder. Within the model, the ratio of
the 0 − 0 and 0 − 1 peaks can be related to the exciton bandwidth, W , of the aggregates by
the following estimate: [22]

⎛

⎞

A0−0 ⎝ 1 − 0.24W/Ep ⎠
≈
A0−1
1 − 0.073W/Ep

(2.7)

Here, Ep is the energy of the dominating vibrational mode, usually the carbon double bond
stretch at Ep = 0.179 eV. For the expression to be valid, the Huang-Rhys factor is assumed
to be 1. It is a measure of the coupling between the electronic transition and a vibrational
mode and is close to unity in polythiophenes such as P3HT. The exciton bandwidth W is a
measure of interchain coupling, where a smaller value indicates longer conjugation lengths
and a higher degree of order within the aggregate region. It is thus a useful parameter for
determining the quality of the crystalline parts of the film. The absorption in the ordered

Current-voltage characteristics of the OFET
Analytical description of a field-effect transistor

The work considers a p-type device, but the theory can be applied to an n-type device
by changing the sign of voltages and charge carriers. The basic analytical description of
OFET current-voltage characteristics is derived from the inorganic MOSFET device, with
the terminology being somewhat different. The analytical description is valid when dealing
with low trap density and contact resistance. The transport is assumed to be band transport,
and not variable range hopping.
The OFET can operate in three different modes depending on the magnitudes of the
source (VS ), drain (VD ) and gate (VG ) voltages. For simplicity, VS = 0 V and VD < 0 V. For
a p-type device, the majority carriers are positively charged holes, and thus a negative gate
bias is needed to create the conducting hole accumulation layer. An example of a transfer
characteristic, the drain current ID plotted against gate voltage VG , is shown in figure 2.3

the transistor is turned off. Due to thermal excitations and the disordered nature of OFETs,
there will still be some conduction between source and drain causing a leakage current. In
the subthreshold region, the current has an exponential dependence on the gate voltage such
that
d(logID ) =

d(VG )
,
SS

(2.10)

where SS is called the subthreshold swing. The subthreshold swing is a measure of how
quickly the transistor turns on and is affected by the gate capacitance and the amount of
charge trapped in the semiconductor. Assuming that the trap density of states is independent
of energy, the subthreshold swing may be expressed as [24, 25]
⎡

⎤

kB T ln 10 ⎣
e2
SS =
1 + Nef f ⎦.
e
Ci

(2.11)

Here, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and Nef f is the effective semiconductor/insulator interface trap density expressed per unit energy and unit area. With
increasing gate voltage, more charges accumulate at the insulator interface. As the gate
voltage increases past the threshold voltage the conductive channel forms and the device
turns on. When
|VG | > |Vth | and |VD | ≤ |VG − Vth |,
the device is in the linear region. The source-drain current can be modelled as
ID =

W
µCi (VG − Vth )VD ,
L

(2.12)

where Ci is the capacitance per unit area, W is the channel width, L is the channel length
and µ is the mobility. The transconductance g is a measure of the sensitivity of the drain
current to changes in the gate voltage. It is calculated simply as the derivative of the current:
W
∂ID
=
µCi VD
∂VG
L

(2.13)

As shown in equation 2.12, the drain current is linearly dependent on the effective gate voltage, ID ∝ (VG −Vth ). By fitting a straight line to the linear part of the transfer characteristic,
the drain current ID plotted against gate voltage VG , it is possible to extract the mobility µ
and threshold voltage Vth .
The current is also dependent on the drain voltage, VD . In the saturation region,
|VD | ≥ |VG − Vth |,
12

Axel Luukkonen

2 THEORY

the VD dependence disappears. The drain current is quadratically dependent on the gate
voltage according to
ID =

W µCi
(VG − Vth )2 .
L 2

(2.14)

A linear regression of the square root of the transfer characteristic thus yields the mobility
µ and threshold voltage Tth . The analytical model for deriving the mobility and threshold
voltage works well in OFETs if the transfer characteristics show the predicted behaviour.
However, the trap density estimate from the SS is very rough. It is known that the trap
DOS is not constant in energy, but more resembles a gaussian distribution extending into
the bandgap.
2.3.2

The Vissenberg-Matters model

An analytical model for the field-effect mobility in amorphous organic semiconductors was
developed in 1998 by Vissenberg and Matters. [15] It has since been shown to work well
in semi-crystalline polymers such as P3HT. [26] The theory considers the variable range
hopping transport and the shape of the DOS and explains the observed field-dependence of
the mobility. As a gate voltage is applied and charge is accumulated near the semiconductor/insulator interface, charge carriers first occupy the states with the lowest energy. With
increasing gate voltage, accumulated charge carriers start occupying higher-lying states from
where less energy is needed to hop. The model is based around an exponential DOS; it is a
good approximation of a gaussian but much easier to work with. The DOS is taken as zero
for positive energy. For −∞ < E ≤ 0 it is described by

kB T0
kB T0

(2.15)

where Nt is the number of states per unit volume, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T0 is
the characteristic temperature of the distribution, determining the width of the DOS. The
derivation of the Vissenberg and Matter’s model consists of three parts. First, the carrier
occupancy as a function of temperature and density of states is derived. Secondly, the
conductivity for variable-range hopping transport in an exponential DOS is derived. Finally,
the two are combined to yield an expression for the field-effect mobility.
The carrier occupancy of a system in equilibrium is given by the Fermi-Dirac distribution.
The density of charge carriers is given by

The expression for sij is very similar to the basic variable-range hopping expression, equation
2.1, with α−1 also here representing the wavefunction attenuation length. As jumping to
higher lying states is the rate-limiting factor in this model, the conductivity of the whole
system can be described with percolation theory. To understand the critical percolation
conductance Gc = G0 e−sc , it is useful to make a comparison to the sea. A reference conductance G will serve as the sea level, with clusters where Gij > G forming islands. With
decreasing G, lowering the sea level, the islands grow larger until an infinite cluster forms
when G = Gc . The critical percolation conductance Gc determines the conductivity for the
macroscopic system as
σ = σ0 e−sc ,

(2.19)

where sc is the exponent of the critical percolation conductance and σ0 is an unknown
prefactor. The number of bonds B (conductances with Gij > G) per site increases with
decreasing G until a critical number, Bc , is reached at the onset of percolation. For a
three-dimensional system Bc ≈ 2.8. [27] The percolation criterion can be written as
Bc =

Ns

where Ns is the density of sites and Nb is the density of bonds in the percolating system.

The temperature dependence in equation 2.24 is σ ∼ exp[−Ea /(kB T )], where Ea is a weakly

The electrolyte-gated field-effect transistor
Principle and operation mechanism

In an EGOFET, the solid gate dielectric is replaced by an electrolyte that can be either
solid or liquid; polymers, ionic gels and ionic liquids have been used. This work is limited to
the case of a liquid electrolyte, meaning the devices presented here are strictly speaking ionmodulated field-effect transistors. The main advantage of the EGOFET is its much-increased
gate capacitance compared to its solid dielectric-gated counterpart. A high capacitance
leads to a larger charge carrier concentration, enabling operation below 1 V compared to
> 10 V for conventional OFETs. [28] The large capacitance stems from the electric double
layers (EDL) formed at the semiconductor/electrolyte and electrolyte/gate interfaces. In
a conventional OFET, the gate dielectric is a polarizable solid. In an electrolyte gated
16

Axel Luukkonen

2 THEORY

transistor, ions in the dielectric are free to move. An applied negative gate bias will drive
anions to the negative gate electrode surface and cations to the semiconductor surface,
creating double layers at the interfaces. The electric field inside the electrolyte is zero,
making the capacitance independent of dielectric thickness and enabling geometries where
the gate surface is not parallel to the semiconductor channel. The EGOFET is compared to
a conventional OFET in figure 2.4.

Figure 2.4: Illustration of the OFET and EGOFET gating mechanisms under a negative
gate bias. In a solid dielectric, the molecules are polarisable and stationary, while the ions
in an electrolyte gated device are free to move.
The Helmholtz equation can be used to estimate the EDL capacitance as
CEDL ≈ κϵ0 /λD ,

(2.33)

where κ is the effective dielectric constant and λD is the Debye screening length, which can
be interpreted as the EDL thickness. With κ on the order of 10 and λD on the order of 1 nm,
a capacitance of 1-10 µF cm−2 is obtainable, compared to at best a few tens of nF cm−2 for
conventional OFETs. The gate capacitance is the sum of the EDL capacitances, given by
Ci =

CEDL1 × CEDL2
.
CEDL1 + CEDL2

(2.34)

If the counter ions are of equal size and mobility, CEDL1 = CEDL2 and Ci = CEDL1 /2.
In reality, the semiconductor/electrolyte interface will have a lower capacitance than the
17

Axel Luukkonen

2 THEORY

electrolyte/gate interface and dominate Ci . For P3HT transistors using ultrapure water as
an electrolyte, gate capacitances of 3 − 10 µF cm−2 have been measured. [28–30]
The operational voltage range of an EGOFET is limited. In water-gated devices, hydrolysis will take place if the gate voltage exceeds ±1.37 V and many electrochemical reactions can
occur at lower voltages. It is thus important to keep the electrolyte free from contaminants
that can induce electrochemical effects.
2.4.2

EGOFET-based biosensor

A biosensor combines biological recognition elements with a transducer that turns the analyte
interaction into a measurable signal. [31] The EGOFETs low-voltage capabilities and high
sensitivity to interfacial changes, combined with a very flexible device architecture, makes it
an ideal candidate for organic biosensors. In an EGOFET-based biosensor, either the gate
or the semiconductor is functionalised by immobilising biological receptors on its surface.
When a biological marker binds to the receptor, the capacitance or the threshold voltage
changes depending on the specific geometry, leading to a change in the current. [6, 32]
Since water is a natural environment for clinically relevant biomarkers, the EGOFET
is particularly suitable as a biosensor device. If the electrolyte is directly exposed to the
analyte, the risk of electrochemical doping of the device increases considerably. Another
approach is to incubate the gate in analyte separate from the electrolyte. After incubation,
the gate, now with a modified surface from the bound biological markers, is reinserted into
the electrolyte for measurement. This way, no analyte or other electrochemically active
species can contaminate the gate electrolyte and the device lifetime is improved.

Sample fabrication

Substrates with Source and Drain (S-D) contacts were acquired from the Technical Research
Centre of Finland for use in an earlier OFET project, and as they were already available they
were used for this one as well. The substrates consist of silicon covered by thermally grown
SiO2. A 5 nm thick Chromium adhesion layer followed by the 50 nm thick Gold S-D contacts
is deposited on top of the SiO2. The Source-Drain contacts are interdigitated, shown in figure
3.1, enabling a much higher W/L ratio than otherwise would be possible. The substrates
are squared with a side of 15 mm and each substrate houses 16 S-D structures, or channels,
divided into two rows near the centre of the substrate with contact pads for probes along two
sides. One side houses channels with W/L values ranging from 2,063 to 26,933, while the
other has channels alternating between W/L ratios of 8,180 and 16,160, with four of each.
Only the channels with W/L = 16160 were used. For these, the channel length and width
are 5 µm and 80 800 µm, respectively. The substrates used for optical measurements were
standard microscope slides that were cut in half, resulting in pieces approximately 37 mm
by 26 mm in size.
The preparation and deposition process for the P3HT was identical for both the resistors
and glass slides. P3HT was dissolved in chlorobenzene under ambient conditions (air, 2023 ◦C). The solution was sonicated for 20 min in darkness before filtering through a 0.2 µm
PFTE filter. The substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone and isopropanol, 10 min
in each, before rinsing with ultrapure water and drying with nitrogen. The semiconductor
was deposited onto the substrates by spin coating in ambient air, followed by annealing at
90 ◦C for 60 min in darkness. The samples were then stored in vacuum until use.

Electrical measurements

In preparation for the electrical measurements, a 3D printed polymer water well with a
volume of approximately 1 ml was fitted to the resistor using PDMS. The well was filled
with HPLC-grade water to be used as gate dielectric. A rectangular piece of gold approx.
25 mm long, 5 mm wide and 1 mm thick was used as gate electrode. After securing the
resistor in the probe station, the gate electrode was inserted vertically into the well and
held in place with a clamp, completing the transistor. The setup is shown in figure 3.2,
with the source and drain probes visible to the left and the gate clamp in the middle.
The submerged part of the gate was approximately 7 mm long, 5 mm wide and 1 mm thick.
Tungsten probes were used to contact the source and drain terminals. The measurements
were conducted in a dark probe station under ambient atmosphere (air, 20 − 23 ◦C). A
Keithly 4200A-SCS parameter analyser, figure 3.3a, was used with the built-in software.
Transfer measurements were performed with VS = 0 V and VD = −0.4 V while sweeping VG
in the interval 0.2 V → −0.4 V and back at a rate of 20 mV s−1 . A schematic picture of the

4.1

The influence of manufacturing protocol on film microstructure

The structure of a P3HT film is influenced greatly by the molecular weight and degree of
regioregularity (RR) of the polymer. A perfectly regioregular polymer would be one where
all the repeat units are one particular isomer of the monomer. A 95 % RR polymer would
have 95 % of its repeat units being a certain isomer, with the other 5 % made up by other
isomers. The molecular weight for a polymer sample is not an absolute value but rather
a distribution, where either weight average molecular weight (M W ) or number average
molecular weight (M n) can be used. It has been shown that P3HT with high regioregularity
and high molecular weights forms more crystalline films and produces transistors with better
performance. [14] A film with a higher degree of crystallinity will also be less penetrable by
ions in solution. [33] As biosensors anyhow benefit from greater performing devices, there
is an incentive to work with as highly crystalline P3HT as possible. To that end, a highly
regioregular polymer was acquired and its thin film parameters were compared to those of
a polymer already available at the department. The new polymer was sourced from TCI
and was the highest RR P3HT available (RR > 99 % and M n = 27,000 to 45,000). Ossila
batch M103 was already available and has low regioregularity (RR = 94.2 %) and medium
molecular weight (M n = 23,600). The same concentration, spin coating speed and annealing
temperature and duration was used for both semiconductors.
The absorption spectrums were fitted with the weakly interacting H-aggregate model,
similar to equation 2.9 but with a scaling factor A0 included as a fitting parameter:

The built-in curve fitting app was used to fit the function to the data in the region 1.9-2.3 eV.

The absorption of the two different polymers as a function of energy is shown in figure
4.1 in both absolute scale (a) and as a normalised comparison (b), with the fitted spectrums
visible in figures 4.1c and 4.1d. From figure 4.1a, it is clear that the Ossila P3HT forms
a thicker film than the semiconductor from TCI. The difference in maximum absorption
intensity is around 20 %. Comparing the shape of the absorption spectrums in figure 4.1bb
shows a greater intensity of the 0 − 0 vibronic transition at ∼ 2.05 eV for the TCI film, with
absorption shifted more to higher vibronic states in the Ossila film.
The fitted data is presented in figures 4.1c and 4.1d with fitting parameters in table 4.1.
The film thickness was approximated using the Beer-Lambert law
d ≈ 2.303 ∗ Amax /α,

(4.2)

where d is the film thickness, Amax is the maximum absorption and α is the absorption
coefficient, approximately 2 × 105 cm−1 for P3HT. [34] The values of the other parameters
are in line with earlier reports for P3HT films, confirming that the fitting program works
well.
The exciton bandwidth, W , differs significantly, being around 20 % lower for the TCI
semiconductor. This indicates that the TCI semiconductor forms crystalline structures of
higher quality. The degree of aggregation in the film was estimated by comparing the area
under the fitted function, corresponding to the absorption in the aggregates, to the area
under the whole spectrum. As the absorption from the amorphous region of the film extends
to higher energies than can be probed with the measurement setup, the estimate may only
be used as a qualitative comparison between different films. For a quantitative estimate,
the different oscillator strengths in the aggregate and amorphous regions would also need
to be considered. The results agree with earlier studies showing that a more regioregular
semiconductor forms more crystalline films with higher quality aggregates. However, the
difference in the degree of aggregation is small and as the Ossila semiconductor was a few
years old it is possible that a fresh batch would perform better. Nonetheless it was decided to
24

go ahead with the TCI P3HT for the rest of the work and abandon the Ossila semiconductor.

Next the effect of concentration on the film microstructure was investigated using the
same methods. TCI P3HT was spin-coated using a solution with a concentration of 4.0 mg ml−1
and the absorption was compared to the 2.6 mg ml−1 film previously used. The absorption
spectrums are presented in figure 4.2 and the fit parameters are presented in table 4.2. The
absolute-scale spectrums in figure 4.2a shows that the solution with higher concentration
forms a thicker film, as is very much expected. The shape of the spectrums in figure 4.2b
hints at better aggregation in the lower-concentration film, with a slightly lower intensity
0 − 0 peak and a shift towards higher vibrational states for the 4.0 mg ml−1 film. The fitting parameters confirm this, with the excitonic bandwidth W being ∼ 8 % smaller in the
2.6 mg ml−1 film. Although the lower concentration yields higher quality aggregates, the
amount of aggregation is the same in both films. Thus, the degree of aggregation in the film
seems to be controlled mainly by the regioregularity and molecular weight of the P3HT and
not by manufacturing conditions.

visibly uneven in some places; the speed was probably too low to spread the P3HT perfectly.
The absorption spectrums are presented in figure 4.3. The absolute-scale graph in figure
4.3a confirms that the samples indeed have very different thicknesses. When normalised to
the intensity of the 0 − 1 peak, figure 4.3b, it is obvious that the shape of the spectrums and
the microstructure of the film is nearly identical for all three samples. This is confirmed by
the fitting parameters in table 4.3 where only the maximum absorption significantly differs
between the films. While W is smaller for thinner films, the difference is marginal. It can be
concluded that the thickness of the film has no major effect on its microstructure, at least
for thicknesses on the order of 10 − 20 nm. However, it is important that the film is thick
enough to contact the source and drain contacts well. A thicker film can be achieved by
either spin-coating at slower speeds or by using a higher concentration of the semiconductor.
If spin-coating is performed at a too low speed, as was the case for the 1000 rpm film, the
film surface can be uneven. While this does not seem to affect the film microstructure, it
can be detrimental in a transistor. For these reasons, it was decided to move forward with
the 4.0 mg ml−1 concentration and 2000 rpm spin speed for subsequent measurements and
transistor manufacturing.

Environmental effects on the film

P3HT is known to be sensitive to oxygen and humidity, but very stable and high-performing
P3HT EGOFETs have been constructed using water as a gate medium. [5, 35] To better
understand the factors affecting EGOFET degradation, the effects of water and air on the
film were studied. P3HT films were produced from a 4.0 mg ml−1 chlorobenzene solution by
spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The samples were stored either in ambient air or submerged
in HPLC-grade water between UV-Vis absorption measurements. The absorption spectrums

14 days and the time in water being 6 days. The film stored in air, figure 4.4a, underwent
massive bleaching, with the overall intensity reducing by around 40 %. The 0 − 0 peak was
reduced more than the overall spectrum, shifting the Franck-Condon progression to higher
states. It thus evident that the exposure to air leads to a destruction of aggregates and
a more disordered film. The film stored in water, figure 4.4b, shows very little change.
The shape of the spectrum remains the same and only a slight change in intensity can be

observed. As evident by the fitting parameters in table 4.4, the degree of aggregation in the
film is not affected. The exciton bandwidth, however, sees an increase. The change in W
after the first day in water is of the same magnitude as the change during the following five
days. It thus seems likely that the degradation occurs as the sample is subjected to air while
measuring, but more studies need to be conducted to confirm this. It can still be concluded
that submersion in water has very little effect on the microstructure of the film. The result
enables water as a simple and cheap storage medium for P3HT-based EGOFETs. This is
potentially of great importance for future industrial development of the devices.

4.3

Assessment of device figures of merit over one-month operation

During early 2020, sensing measurements were performed by Dr. Amit Tewari and Amirmohammad Ghafarihashjin. For the measurements, a transistor made from 4.0 mg ml−1 TCI
P3HT spin coated at 2000 rpm was used with HPLC grade water as gate medium. The pristine transistor is measured with a bare gold reference gate until the current is stable enough
to start sensing measurements. The cycling consists of measuring transfer characteristics at
set time intervals. As a measurement starts, the current in the transistor changes significantly between cycles. This behaviour, while not the focus of this work, is likely in part due
to surface changes and energy level re-alignment in the gold electrode and P3HT. [36] The
water in the well slowly evaporates, necessitating a water refill around every 13-15 h. After a
refill, the current will again shift for a period of time, usually around an hour, as an area on
the gate that was previously exposed to air will again be submerged in water and undergo
surface changes. After the initial sharp change in current, the transistor will degrade more
slowly.
Before sensing measurements, the device is stabilised and monitored by cycling with a
30 min delay between cycles overnight. In the morning, water is refilled, and the device is
cycled with a 5 min delay until it is stable enough to start sensing measurements. A change
in the transfer current of around 1 % h−1 is required.
For the sensing, the reference gate electrode is replaced with a functionalised gate, where
recognition elements have been immobilised on the gate surface. The functionalised gate is
exposed to the analyte, after which the transistor is cycled 20 times with 30 s delay. This
process is repeated for a series of analyte solutions of increasing concentrations to complete a

sensing measurement. One sensing measurements takes around one working day to complete
and results in a minimum of 250 cycles of usage on the device. Once the sensing measurement
is completed, the device is either cycled again overnight before sensing measurements the
next day or stored in darkness with water in the reservoir over the weekend. The process is
illustrated in figure 4.5.
While the biosensing assay is outside the scope of this thesis, the systematic measurement
protocol also resulted in other data that is extremely useful for this work. The measurements
were performed over a period of a month, resulting in several thousand usage cycles on the
device as well as a long period of water exposure. Until now, EGOFET device degradation
has not been studied on a time scale longer than hours and a few hundred cycles. It was
decided to use the 20th cycle of the morning stabilisation series, represented by the second
arrow in figure 4.5, as data points for the analysis. If another cycle is chosen for reference,

say cycle number one for the overnight measurements, the results of the analysis will likely
be different. However, the 20th cycle of the morning stabilisation was deemed the most
sensible choice for several reasons. Firstly, the water level, and thus the submerged area of
the gate, will be the same for all data points as a water refill took place only around two
hours earlier. Secondly, it provides the longest possible common history for the data points;
the preceding 16 h of morning and overnight cycling was identical for all data, no matter if
the previous day saw heavy usage on the device or just storage in water. And finally, it was
decided to use the 20th cycle of the series as the earlier mentioned sharp change in current
after a water refill is no longer present at that point. In fact, the average of the 15th to 20th
cycles was used, but the standard deviation is too small to be visible as an error bar in any
graph.
The transfer curves are shown in figure 4.6a. The current is very high, with the maximum
ranging from 15-53 µA. It is common that EGOFET devices operate in the hundreds of
nanoampere and up to a few microampere. [6, 28] The ten times higher current can be
attributed to a ten times larger W/L ratio, with the current density still being similar to other
devices. The measurements started on February 5th, with the day before only consisting
of cycling with a delay of 30min. The two first curves show some degree of hysteresis,
disappearing in later measurements. The source - gate current (IG ), or gate leakage, in figure
4.6b is monitored to confirm the device is working without any electrochemical reactions,
which would be visible as a great increase in the gate current. The gate current should be
around three orders of magnitude smaller than the transfer current, a condition that the
device easily fulfils. Three of the data points are extracted in figures 4.6c and 4.6d to better
show the change in the transfer characteristic and hysteresis. In figure 4.6e, the hysteresis
has been calculated by integrating the area between the forward and reverse sweeps. The
hysteresis is significant in the beginning but decreases to almost zero after the first sensing
measurement and remains there throughout the rest of the measurements. The on/off ratio,
figure 4.6f, is simply the maximum of the transfer current divided by the minimum. It
decreases steadily, as the maximum current decreases while the off-current increases by
around 15 %. The evolution of the maximum current can be displayed in two different ways.
The x-axis can be either the time or the electrical stress on the device. In figure 4.7a, the
maximum current is displayed as a function of device age. In figure 4.7b, the x-axis is the
number of cycles on the device. When plotted against usage, the change in current shown

a more physical behaviour than when plotted against device age. This is an indication that
electrical stress may contribute more to device degradation than environmental effects.
A more complete picture can be attained by extracting the mobility and threshold voltage
from the transfer curves. The output characteristic from an identically prepared device is
shown in figure 4.8a. As VD = −0.4 V, the drain current is saturated at VG = −0.2 V. In
figure 4.8b, the square root of the transfer current from February 13 is shown as an example.
The curve is linear at around VG = −0.2 V. As the device operates in the saturation region
at this point, the threshold voltage and mobility can be extracted from the linear regression
of the form

The gate capacitance was estimated as Ci = 7.5 µF cm−2 as it sits between results from
earlier studies. [28, 29]
The evolution of the threshold voltage is shown if figure 4.9a as a function of time and in
figure 4.9b as a function of electrical stress. No systematic change in the threshold voltage
can be seen, irrespective of the x-axis used. This completely contradicts studies performed
on conventional OFET devices, where a shift in the threshold voltage is a important factor
in device degradation. However, in the case of the conventional, solid dielectric gated, OFET
it has been shown that threshold voltage shift is caused by charge trapping in the dielectric.
The trapped charges screen the gate induced electric field, leading to less charge accumulation

in the semiconductor and a shift in VT . As the gate dielectric in this case is liquid, charge
trapping seems unlikely to occur. Instead, the observed change in current is caused by a
decrease in mobility. The mobility is plotted against the time and electrical stress in figures
4.9c and 4.9d. The values of 1.5 to 4.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 are in line with reported values for
P3HT. [29, 37–39] Comparing the figures, it becomes even more clear that electrical stress
is the major driver of device degradation. The graph in figure 4.9c is not very smooth, while
the graph in figure 4.9d displays the functional behaviour one would expect from a physical
quantity.

the same method. [40] The low mobility and high trap density can maybe be attributed
to manufacturing under ambient conditions rather than in a nitrogen atmosphere, allowing
some oxidation of the semiconductor. The connection between mobility and trap density
was further investigated by plotting the inverse mobility as a function of estimated trap
density, figure 4.10c. This shows a linear behaviour, something that has also been reported
in a recent paper by Cielecki et al., researching optical degradation of OFET devices. [12]
The results from comparing the different x-axes in figures 4.9 and 4.10 echo the conclusions drawn from the optical measurements, namely that exposure to water has a minimal
effect on device degradation. In fact, using a liquid gate dielectric seems to prevent the
threshold voltage from shifting over a long period of time, since no charge trapping can
occur. Gate bias stress is considered the main cause of degradation in conventional OFET
devices, as it drives charge carriers to be trapped in the dielectric. In the EGOFET, however,
the current flowing through the device may play a larger role as is the case in OLEDs. [41,
42] The usage on the device can not only be expressed in terms of cycles, which is directly
proportional to the gate bias stress, but also as the amount of charge passed through the
device.
The charge was estimated by integrating the transfer curve for a data point and extrapolating this value for all cycles between the data point and the next data point. This leads
to a slight overestimate of the charge. Comparing the mobility as a function of cycle, figure
4.11a, and as a function of charge passed through the device, figure 4.11b, the second graph
shows a slightly more linear behaviour, but it is not immediately clear which x-axis is more
appropriate. The same can be said when looking at the trap density, figures 4.11c and 4.11d,
but the difference is small here as well. The linear fit is slightly better when plotted as a
function of charge, but the difference is marginal. While it is likely that the current passed
through the device that is driving the degradation, more studies need to be conducted to
confirm this. A straightforward approach would be to conduct measurements with different
drain voltages, yielding different magnitudes of current without changing the gate bias. If
it indeed is the charge passed through the device that is responsible for increasing the number of traps, lowering the maximum current by a magnitude of 2-3 should see measurable
differences in trap density after a few hundred cycles.
For the sensing measurements, stabilisation times could possibly be reduced by the realisation that time spent in water influences device parameters very little. Instead of stabilising

a pristine device with a delay of 30 min for several days, a more intensive protocol with for
instance 5 min delay cycling could be investigated.
As shown in the absorption measurements, exposure to oxygen is very detrimental to the
device microstructure. While submersion in water largely eliminates this problem, oxygen
still dissolves in water and may harm the device over a long period of time. To further reduce
oxygen exposure, the possibility of purging the well with nitrogen between cycles could be
investigated. The practice is well established in cyclic voltammetry, where oxygen is very
detrimental to the experiments. [43]

Modelling device degradation as a widening of the trap DOS

Estimating the trap density from the subthreshold voltage is very straightforward but yields
only a very rough estimate by assuming a constant trap density of states (DOS). The
Vissenberg-Matters theory is a much more powerful tool for investigating the trap DOS
as well as its connection to the mobility. It shows that an increase in the density of trap
states leads to a decrease in field-effect mobility. It was thus decided to attempt to model
the observed decrease in mobility as the widening of an exponential density of states using
the Vissenberg-Matters theory. The theory has been extensively used to calculate the trap
density of states in a variety of organic semiconductors for a wide range of temperatures.
This application of the theory, to model device degradation as a widening of the DOS, is
entirely novel. The exponential density of states, equation 2.15, can also be written as

where N0 is the number of states per unit volume and unit energy at the band edge. The
tail of the exponential extends from the HOMO level into the bandgap and width of the
distribution is determined by the characteristic temperature T0 . Using the property
Γ(1 − z)Γ(z) =

voltage was set as VG = −0.2 V since the mobility was calculated in the same region. The
modelling was done using a Microsoft Excel script and Origin and yielded T0 values in the
range 1420 − 1560 K, considerably higher than the 425 K earlier reported for conventional
P3HT OFETs. [26, 44] The charge carrier density, the second part of equation 4.6, was found
to change from 2.16 cm−3 to 1.97 × 1020 cm−3 . These values are also higher than the up to
2.9 × 1019 cm−3 investigated in the earlier studies. The relationship between mobility and
charge density is very similar to the result from these same studies. Some of the difference
in T0 is due to the higher charge carrier density achieved in the electrolyte gated device.
Manually setting the charge density to a constant 1 × 1019 cm−3 gives T0 in the range 750
- 790 K, which is closer to earlier studies. The rest of the difference may be ascribable to
manufacturing in air introducing a higher trap density to begin with. The calculated, higher,
values for the carrier density and T0 were used.

In the DOS, equation 4.5, a value of Nt = 1 × 1021 cm−3 was set. For the first data point
with T0 = 1420 K, this yielded a state density at the band edge of N0 = 8.2 × 1021 cm−3 eV−1 .
The DOS was then calculated for subsequent data points keeping N0 constant, only changing
the width of the exponential. In figure 4.12, the constant DOS from the subthreshold slope
(SS) estimate is compared to the exponential DOS from the Vissenberg-Matters model
for the first data point. The surface trap density given by the SS method was converted
into a volume density by assuming an accumulation layer thickness of 7.5 nm. [40] While
the linear scale graph, figure 4.12a, is difficult to interpret, it is clear that the SS method
greatly underestimates the magnitude of the DOS. Indeed, integrating over the trap density
of states show the methods differ by a factor of around 25. The integration limits of the

SS-estimate had to be decided, as integrating from infinity like for the exponential DOS
would yield an infinite number of states. It was decided to integrate over 1 eV, which is a
reasonable value corresponding to around half the bandgap. The log-scale graph in figure
4.12b closely resembles results from an earlier paper by Kalb et al. comparing different
methods for calculating the density of states in pentacene. [40]
The widening of the exponential DOS in the V-M model is shown in figure 4.13 alongside
the change in the constant DOS calculated using the subthreshold slope method. The total
number of states in the exponential DOS is still around 25 times greater than in the constant
DOS approximation for all data points. However, this work is more focused on the change
in parameters rather than their absolute values. The change in the total number of states,
compared to the first data point from February 4th, is shown in figure 4.14 for different
values of Nt . With Nt = 9 × 1020 cm−3 , and thus N0 = 7.4 × 1021 cm−3 eV−1 , the two
methods produce very similar results. Earlier studies utilising an exponential DOS have
used Nt ranging from 3 × 1020 cm−3 to 1 × 1021 cm−3 . [26, 40, 46]
The Vissenberg-Matters model is here limited by the fact that Nt can not be fitted to the
mobility. Measurements are usually conducted over a range of temperatures to determine
this factor, something that is problematic with an EGOFET as the electrolyte is also affected
by changes in temperature. Here, the value of Nt was instead chosen to get a good agreement
between the change in number of states from the SS estimate and that from the Vissenberg-

Matters model. Agreement can always be found when looking at the change in the number
of states, as seen in figure 4.14, but there is a relatively narrow range of Nt for which the
methods agree well. If for instance Nt = 1 × 1020 cm−3 or Nt = 8 × 1022 cm−3 was used, the
models would produce very different results. As the value that gives the best fit is in the
range of earlier reported values, there is merit to the simple SS estimate as a very quick
and simple tool to somewhat accurately gauge the change in trap density in a degrading
EGOFET.

5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

Conclusions and future work

In this work, optical and electrical measurements were used to assess the stability of a
poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) based electrolyte-gated field effect transistor. It could be
shown that P3HT films submerged in water does not undergo significant microstructural
changes. EGOFET measurements confirmed that electrical stress is the major driver of
device degradation also in water-gated devices. Furthermore the long-term changes in device
performance can be attributed exclusively to a drop in the field-effect mobility, with no
consistent shift in threshold voltage. The decrease in mobility was modelled as a widening of
the localised state DOS using the Vissenberg-Matters model. The modelled increase in trap
density agreed well with a very simple calculation based on the subthreshold slope swing.
Linear absorption measurements were conducted on P3HT films of varying thicknesses
and manufacturing protocols. The absorption spectra were fitted with a weakly interacting
H-aggregate model. Microstructural film parameters were extracted from the fit and results
were shown to agree well with earlier studies. Films created using a highly regioregular
P3HT were thinner and showed the best characteristics in optical measurements. Using a
lower concentration lead to thinner films with higher quality aggregates but the same degree
of aggregation. However, no significant correlation could be seen between film thickness and
microstructure when making films of different thicknesses from the same semiconductor at
the same concentration. This shows that the degree of aggregation is dependent more on
the regioregularity and/or molecular weight of the semiconductor than the manufacturing
protocol. However, the effects of different solvents was not investigated here and is expected
to play a role. A higher boiling point solvent should lead to higher quality aggregates.
Repeating the measurements using for instance chloroform instead of chlorobenzene would
be a good base for further studies to improve P3HT thin films for use in EGOFETs.
Film degradation in air and water was compared using absorption measurements. Films
stored in air rapidly deteriorated. Absorption intensity was reduced by ≈ 40 % and the
film appeared much more disordered. The 0 − 0 peak was reduced more than the overall
absorption and the Franck-Condon progression shifted to higher energies. Combined with a
measured increase in the exciton bandwidth W , this indicated breakdown of the aggregate
part of the film. Degradation in the presence of air is to be expected as P3HT is known
to be sensitive to oxygen and humidity. Films submerged completely in water showed very
little change in the absorption spectrum after six days in water. It is even plausible that the
44

Axel Luukkonen

5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

majority of the change was caused by exposure to air during the optical measurements and
that the effect of submersion in water is completely negligible. This indicates that water can
be used as a cheap and simple storage medium for EGOFET devices, a major advantage in
the eventual industrial scale deployment of the technology. Similar trials could be conducted
over a time-scale of several weeks or even months to gain more insight. Storage in water
that has been purged with nitrogen can also be investigated, which would clarify whether
oxygen dissolved in water plays any role in the degradation.
Data gathered between sensing measurements was used to monitor the degradation of a
P3HT EGOFET device over a month of operation. The hysteresis was small and the on/off
ratio stayed good throughout the measurements. The gate leakage showed no evidence of
any electrochemical reactions, as the voltages were kept within a safe operating window. The
decrease in on-current could be ascribed entirely to a decrease in mobility. The threshold
voltage was shown to vary, but did not shift in the consistent manner that is well documented
in conventional OFETs. Using a simple estimate based on the subthreshold swing, an increase
in trap density could be seen during the measurements. By plotting the change in mobility
and trap density against both time and electrical stress, it became clear that electrical stress
is the main reason for device degradation. As charge trapping in the liquid dielectric is
unlikely to occur, the charge passed through the device is more likely to affect the device
than the gate bias. Purging the electrolyte with nitrogen can be investigated as a way to
improve device stability, as dissolved oxygen possibly can lead to electrochemical reactions.
To compensate for a varying threshold voltage, it may be possible to use a feedback loop to
keep the transfer characteristic more constant by varying the gate- or drain voltages. Similar
electrical compensation is used in OLEDs and could be investigated for use in EGOFET
biosensors. [42]
The increase in trap density given by the very simple subthreshold slope estimate was
compared to the much more rigorous Vissenberg-Matters model. While the DOS differed
greatly between the methods, they yielded very similar results for change in number of
states while using literature values for all parameters. Thus, the subthreshold model may
be used to quickly estimate the change in trap density with some degree of accuracy. The
calculations could possibly be incorporated directly into the software of the semiconductor
parameter analyser along with mobility calculations. To give more credibility to the results,
the factor Nt in the exponential DOS should be better investigated for EGOFET devices.

45

Axel Luukkonen

5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

The same is true for the carrier concentration, as the Vissenberg-Matters method predicts a
charge carrier density that is around one order of magnitude greater than for conventional
OFETs, affecting the free parameter T0 in the fit.
Finally, a mobility edge model, such as the one presented by Salleo et al. [47], could
be investigated as an alternative to the Vissenberg-Matters model. In such a model, states
below a certain energy are regarded as delocalised.

Summary in Swedish - Svensk sammanfattning

Analys och modellering av stabilitetsproblem i jonmodulerade organiska transistorer
Introduktion
Organiska fälteffekttranistorer (OFET) har stor potential som biosensorer. En särskilt intressant version är den jonmodulerade OFET:en. [3] I en organisk fälteffektransistor förenas source- och drain-terminalerna av en tunn organisk halvledare. Halvledaren och gateelektroden separeras av ett elektriskt isolerande lager. Då en spänning appliceras på gateelektroden förmedlas elfältet kapacitivt genom isolatorn. Laddningsbärare i halvledaren
börjar samlas vid gränsytan till isolatorn och bildar en strömförande kanal. I en jonmodulerad transistor ersätts isolatorn med en elektrolyt, i vilken joner kan röra sig fritt. Detta
ger en mycket högre kapacitans vilket leder till mer ansamling av laddning och möjliggör
drift vid lägre spänning, ett krav för integrering av biologiska komponenter. I figur 6.1
jämförs en konventionell organisk fälteffekttransistor med en jonmodulerad. I en biosensor baserad på en jonmodulerad transistor immobiliseras organiska receptorer på ytan av
antingen gate-elektroden eller halvledaren. Receptorerna binder till specifika molekyler i
analyten, vilket leder till en liten förändring i ytans kapacitans. Kapacitansförändringen
tar sig uttryck som en mätbar ökning eller minskning i strömmen mellan source och gate.
Teknologin lider av stabilitetsproblem som behöver åtgärdas före den kan användas inom
medicinsk diagnostik. Variationen i strömmen i en instabil transistor kan antingen maskera
en detektion eller ge upphov till en falsk signal. Orsakerna till instabilitet och degradering i
konventionella OFET:ar har varit mål för många studier. [9–12] Jonmodulerade transistorer
har inte studerats på en tidskala längre än timmar. [5]
Denna magisteruppsats ämnar att bättre förklara orsakerna till instabilitet och degradering i en jonmodulerad organisk fälteffekttransistor baserad på den halvledande polymern
P3HT. Ultrarent vatten har använts som elektrolyt. Absorptionsspektrum av P3HT-filmer
har analyserats med en modell för svagt växelverkande H-aggregat [14] och omgivningens
påverkan på filmerna har fastställts. Degraderingen i transistorns elektriska egenskaper har
förklarats med en analytisk modell som kan vara grund till flera studier på området.

genom hopp mellan isolerade tillstånd. [16] Detta leder dels till mycket lägre mobiliteter
än i kisel, men också till att en halvledarfilms elektriska egenskaper är beroende av dess
morfologi. Då P3HT formar filmer ordar sig polymerkedjorna i tvådimensionella staplar,
ungefär som kort i en kortlek. [14, 21] Organiska material med sådan uppbyggnad kallas Haggregat och har särskilda optiska egenskaper; övergångar till och från den lägsta exciterade
nivån är förbjudna. Regionerna med aggregat separeras av regioner med större energetisk
och fysisk oordning. Aggregaten har hög kristallinitet och god ledningsförmåga medan de
mer amorfa regionerna har sämre egenskaper. Optisk absorption och emission i P3HT förklaras utgående från en modell för ett svagt växelverkande H-aggregat. De H-aggregerade
regionerna separeras av energetiskt oordnade regioner, vilket gör att de annars förbjudna
övergångarna tillåts. Följande formel kan anpassas till absorptionen från de aggregerade

I formel 6.1 modelleras absorptionen som en serie gaussiska toppar. Den viktigaste faktorn
i formeln är W , den excitoniska bandbredden. Det är ett mått på hur stark den elektriska kopplingen i aggregaten är, och ett lägre värde indikerar bättre aggregat. Genom att
anpassa formeln till ett absorptionsspektrum kan man också avgöra andelen aggregation i
filmen genom att jämföra intensiteten i anpassningen, motsvarande aggregaten, med intensiteten i det totala spektrumet. Tjockleken på en film kan uppskattas från den maximala
absorptionen med Beer-Lamberts lag

isolatorns kapacitans per ytenhet. VG är den applicerade spänningen på gate-elektroden
och Vth är tröskelspänningen. Genom att göra en linjär anpassning till kvadratroten av
strömmen kan man räkna ut mobiliteten och tröskelspänningen då man känner till de andra
faktorerna. Undertröskelsvängningen (eng. subthreshold swing) betecknas SS och är ett
mått på hur snabbt transistorn går från av-läget till på-läget och kan användas för att göra
en grov uppskattning på mängen lokaliserade tillstånd:

I formel 6.4 är kB Boltzmanns konstant, T temperaturen, e elementärladdningen och Nef f

En modell konstruerad av Vissenberg och Matters knyter mobiliteten direkt till en exponentiell tillståndstäthet och har visat sig fungera bra, både för P3HT och andra organiska
halvledare. [15, 26] Tillståndstätheten är av formen

Resultat och diskussion
P3HT filmer tillverkades med en rad olika protokoll för spinnbeläggning och absorptionen
mättes med en Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 spektrometer. Formel 6.1 anpassades till spektrumen och W samt andelen aggregation extraherades för alla filmer. Två olika halvledare, en
från Ossila och en från TCI, med olika molekylvikt och regioregularitet (ett mått på hur stor
andel av monomererna som är identiska) jämfördes. Anpassningen presenteras i figur 6.2.
och parametrarna redovisas i tabell 6.1. Halvledaren från Ossila uppvisade sämre egenskaper
med både högre W , vilket indikerar sämre kvalité på aggregaten och lägre andel aggregation.
Filmerna var också olika tjocka. Filmer av olika tjocklekar tillverkades av halvledaren från

För att undersöka omgivningens påverkan på filmerna tillverkades identiska prov och
lagrades antingen i luft eller i vatten. Absorptionen mättes före och efter lagring. Absorptionsspektrumen syns i figur 6.3. Filmerna som lagrades i luft var förstörda efter två veckor.
Exponeringen till luft förstörde effektivt aggregaten och den totala absorptionen sjönk med
40 %. Proven som lagrats i luft uppvisade ingen mätbar skillnad, varken i absorptionsspektrumets form eller intensitet. Det kan alltså konstateras att enbart exponering till vatten
inte orsakar degradering i P3HT filmer. Faktorerna som driver degraderingen i en jonmodulerad fälteffekttransistor måste därför vara de applicerade spänningarna eller strömmen
som flödar genom den. Detta betyder att P3HT-baserade jonmodulerade transistorer enkelt

En P3HT baserad jonmodulerad transistor användes för sensormätningar under en månad
och förändringen i mobilitet och tröskelspänning under perioden iakttogs. Mätinstrumentet
var en Keithley 4200A-SCS. I mätningarna användes VS = 0 V, VD = −0.4 V och VG sveptes
från 0.2 V till −0.4 V och tillbaka. Förändringen i tröskelspänning visas i figur 6.3a och
6.3b som funktion av tid och användning medan mobiliteten syns i figur 6.3c och 6.3d på
motsvarande sätt. Tröskelspänningen ändrade inte, vilket är motsatt det som rapporterats
för konventionella OFET:ar. Orsaken till förändringen har där tillskrivits laddningar som
fastnar i isolatorn. [8, 13] Det är alltså rimligt att samma beteende inte syns i en jonmodulerad transistor, då laddningar inte kan fastna i elektrolyten. All förändring i strömmen kommer istället från förändringen i mobilitet, som sjönk från 0.0040 cm2 V−1 s−1 till
52

0.0015 cm2 V−1 s−1 , i sin tur orsakad av ett ökat antal lokaliserade tillstånd. Från utseendet
på graferna i figur 6.3c och 6.3d kan man dra slutsatsen att degradering orsakas främst
genom användning, alltså elektrisk påfrestning. Grafen i 6.3d har ett mycket mer fysikaliskt
utseende istället för de skarpa förändringar som syns i figur 6.3c. Antalet lokaliserade tillstånd uppskattades med ekvation 6.4 och resultaten visas i figur 6.4a och 6.4b. Även här
syns det tydligt att elektrisk påfrestning är den huvudsakliga orsaken till degradering.

Genom att applicera Vissenberg och Matters modell för fälteffektmobilitet i organiska
halvledare kan förändringen i mobilitet modelleras som en breddning av tillståndstätheten
i halvledaren. Ekvation 6.6 användes för att modellera förändringen i fälteffektmobilitet
genom att variera endast T0 , bredden på den exponentiella tillståndstätheten i ekvation
6.5. För de andra parametrarna, tabell 6.3, användes värden som är kända från tidigare
studier. Den exponentiella tillståndstätheten ger ett mycket högre värde på det totala antalet
tillstånd, vilket är väntat då en enkla metoden baserad på undertröskellsvängningen ger en
väldigt grov uppskattning. Om man däremot ser på förändringen i antalet tillstånd, figur 6.5,
ger metoderna väldigt liknande resultat. Faktorn Nt i tillståndstätheten kan inte anpassas
till mobiliteten, men värdet Nt = 9 × 1020 cm−3 som här ger goda resultat är i linje med
resultat från tidigare studier. [26, 40, 46] Resultaten visar att den enklare metoden kan
användas för att få en snabb och relativt pålitlig uppskattning av förändringen i lokaliserade
tillstånd. Metoden kan eventuellt tillämpas direkt i mätinstrumentet för att kunna följa
degraderingen i realtid.
