Title: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective - A
Case Study
Supervisor: Shahrokh Nikou

Abstract:
Knowledge management has been described as systems and processes that enable
organizations to create, share and utilize knowledge and information. With the rapid
development of technology, organizations need to manage increasingly more
knowledge and data. However, with effective knowledge management, organizations
are able to make even better decisions and act more productively and innovatively.
Technology has also enabled the development of various information systems in
support of knowledge management and the intranet is one of these.
This thesis studied the implementation of the intranet as part of an organization’s
knowledge management. The study was conducted as a case study to determine how
the case company intranet should be implemented to support the company’s knowledge
management initiatives as efficiently as possible.
Data for this thesis were collected using a questionnaire, as well as interviews as the
mixed method. All data were collected from the staff of the case company. The
theoretical framework of this study followed the theory of needs and gap analysis and
knowledge audit, which provided a comprehensive picture of the current situation of
the case company, mirrored to the desired situation. Solutions to differences between
the current and desired situation were sought through interviews.
The study resulted in a comprehensive picture of the case company’s needs for the
intranet to be implemented. As a tangible result, this thesis provided a site map for the
intranet, which the case company will plan to implement. In addition, the study found
substantial number of reasons as to how the intranet can act as a support for knowledge
management in the organizations. Although the results of the study are detailed and
precisely reflecting to the case company, other organizations would be able to use the
framework used in this thesis to examine their own situation should they have the
intranet implementation needs and desire to implement it as a knowledge management
supporter.

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

1 INTRODUCTION
In today’s world, companies across the world demand knowledge significantly more that
they can operate efficiently and thrive in the market. At the same time, the world is
undergoing a digital transformation in almost every aspect of human life. People receive
knowledge about everything with the help of technology daily and are able to utilize it in
their actions. In the same way, companies are able to take advantage of the benefits that
technology brings in their operations (Vitez, 2019). Companies should also manage its
knowledge in order to gain the full benefits from it. The intranet, made possible by
technology, is often one of a company's means of managing knowledge. This thesis
explores the implementation of an intranet for a case company from the knowledge
management perspective. This chapter will first present the background of the study. In
the following paragraph, the aims and objectives of this study are proposed. In addition,
the main research question and supporting questions are introduced.
Knowledge management (KM) is often described as the systems and processes that
organizations have in place to publish, manage, share, and capitalize on knowledge and
expertise. This definition refers to the external and internal sources of knowledge. The
development of technology has forced companies to deal with large amounts of data and
information that require management. Knowledge management provides companies with
better and more efficient decision-making capabilities. In addition, it helps companies to
be more productive and innovative (Buniyamin & Barber, 2004).
The development of the Internet, e-business, as well as enterprise information systems
has increased interest in research related to the technical side of knowledge management,
the way it is considered to see knowledge as a resource that can be exploited using
technology (Lönnqvist, 2007). One of the most significant challenges of exploiting data
is that information in digital forms is located in many different places. The normal
situation in companies today is that by far, most of the data held by a company are stored
on different users' computers, and no one other than a computer user has access to use
data. One of the essentials of making a better business is to be able to recover information
in such a way that it can be accessed without delay and without any extra storage
(Tiirikäinen, 2010, pp. 122-124).

According to previous research, conducting a knowledge management strategy for an
organization is proven to better its productivity and decision-making. While starting to
conduct a knowledge management strategy, the first step is usually implementing an
intranet for the organization. With intranet all the knowledge and data of the company
can be stored in one easily accessible place which is effortless to use. Intranet as a
knowledge management tool is also a practical way to share knowledge within the
organization and create new knowledge that the company and its employees can benefit
from (Buniyamin & Barber, 2004).
Over the past 10 years, the intranet has become one of the most broadly distributed
organizational technologies and, at the same time, it has emerged as a new research site.
A common topic is how to build a working intranet into an organization (Lintilä, 2001).
Studies related to the design and deployment of the intranet within the organization have
been conducted by Wachter and Gupta (1997), Bhattacherjee (1998), Damsgaard and
Scheepers (1999), Bansler et al. (2000), Stenmark (2002), and Pedley (2003). Intranet
research can have different perspectives. Intranet has been studied as a knowledge
management tool (Curry & Stancich, 2000) (Edenius & Borgerson, 2003) and concerning
organizational culture (Ruppel & Harrington 2001, Stenmark 2004). Studies depict that
the intranet can add value to organizational information distribution, preservation, and
management of information, and overall development of organizational communication
and unity. Studies have generally focused on positive effects.

1.1 Objectives and purpose
The aim of this study is to implement an intranet for the case company. To reach the goal
of implementation of an intranet, this thesis will research what kind of knowledge and
information should be included there. The intranet is usually a crucial knowledge
management tool for organizations. Currently, the case company’s information and data
are dispersed across in different locations. The aim is to collect and share the data and
information that are important and necessary for daily working tasks, in one place that all
employees have easy access to.

This research examines what kind of information and knowledge a small and mediumsized (SME) accounting company should include in its intranet in order to be as useful as
possible to its end-users and improve the efficiency and knowledge management of the
company. Additionally, this study aims to determine which characteristics the intranet
should contain in order to increase information sharing and cooperation between
employees. In addition, this study aims to investigate how all the necessary information
will be organized on the intranet to make it accessible and easy to retrieve.
This thesis contains main research question and four supporting research questions. By
answering the supporting research questions, the main research question is answered. The
main research question is as follows:
What are the qualities and information that the intranet should contain to make
knowledge management as efficient as possible?
The supporting research questions are:
What kind of information do employees need in their daily working tasks?
Which characteristics of the intranet would serve best the collaboration and knowledge
sharing among the employees?
How can intranet be a part of knowledge management?
How should information be organized into an intranet to best serve the needs of the
company?
These research questions will enable the investigation to establish how an intranet should
be implemented for the case company. Even though this study focuses on how the intranet
distributes the knowledge management of the company, information systems and
information architecture perspectives should also be considered as part of the
implementation project. The information systems and information architecture
perspectives will be introduced in this study quite briefly, even though they are quite a
large part of the implementation of the intranet in general. As previously mentioned, the
main focus of the research is to study the intranet from a knowledge management
perspective, which is why information systems and information architecture objectives
are limited in this study.

2 LITERATURE REVIEW
This chapter is a presentation of the academic literature and existing research was done
regarding intranets, knowledge management as well as information architecture. It covers
the definitions of the main concepts of this study and presents the observations and
findings made from previous research.

2.1 Intranet
The Cambridge Dictionary (Cambridge, 2020) defines Intranet as “a system of connected
computers that works like the internet and allows people within an organization to
communicate with each other and share information”. Sayed, Jabeur, and Aref (2008)
state that in a technical sense, an intranet is a branch of the internet that shares many
common functionalities with the internet. Furthermore, only people from within their
company are organizationally connected and accessible to the intranet. Intranet provides
a powerful networking and coordination tool that provides information and data and the
means that produces and exchanges knowledge, all in one conveniently accessible
location (Sayed et al., 2008).
Intranet can be defined by three key properties. Firstly, intranet is a network whose
operation is based on the intranet protocol TCP/IP, and it uses general applications that
are already familiar from the internet. Secondly, and intranet is a private network to which
access can only be limited within the organization. Thirdly, intranets do not address a
specially defined need, like many other organizational information systems. Intranet as a
term also covers various mobile and remote working environments. The intranet can be
considered both a tool for knowledge management and a strategic management tool.
Large amounts of information can be stored in an intranet in a short period of time,
including news, statistics, business plans, contacts, forms etc. Generally, intranet connects
employees of an organization through its ICT into a single entity that generates and
integrates knowledge (Edenius & Borgerson, 2003).
Stenmark (2002) defines four distinctive characteristics for intranet in his doctoral
dissemination that are quite similar to Edenius and Borgerson. Firstly, the intranet is
hyperlinked. Hyperlinks are familiar from the internet, which allows to create hyperlinks
7

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

to other resources, through which users gain access to a huge amount of information that
is readily available. Hyperlinks allow individuals and large organizations in the intranet
to share information easily. Secondly, the intranet is networked. The client/server
architecture and the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) provide the possibility that
information can be placed on any network and thus the physical whereabouts of the data
are transparent to its user. Moreover, the network differs, for example, from the library
model in that the web does not have a central wire or a predefined hierarchy structure of
what can be published there, but anyone can publish anything. The users of the web are
therefore not limited to consumers of information but might as well be equally informants.
Thirdly, the intranet is open. The web leverages bottom-up technology based on
completely open and accessible standards. Using the HTTP protocol, you can also use
proprietary formats without standardization. Websites are not just limited to specific data
types or the amount of information. Transparency also provides adaptability and access
to formats and types not yet available, which therefore improves knowledge richness.
Data can be displayed regardless of network or server topology, for which a standard web
browser as well as a TCP/IP connection is sufficient. Lastly, the intranet is
organizationally delineated. In addition to the third first characteristics shared by the
intranet and the internet, the intranets have users only from their own organization or
company. Intranet allows an organization to share more freely information that should
not end up with competitors, so this feature is also important from a KM perspective
(Stenmark, 2002).
Kuivalahti and Luukkonen (2003, pp. 23–24) divide the development of the intranet into
five different stages. The first stage was defined as “unit-specific pioneers”. The first
intranets arose as a handprint of enthusiastic individuals in different organizational units.
An upgrade of the initial intranets occurred by a few employees. The second stage was
“a group-level static implementation”. For the first time group-level intranets, layout and
structural design were ordered from an external supplier. The content update was made
by few content equivalents. The third stage was “a content management system deployed”
that allowed content production to be decentralized more broadly into the organization.
In this stage, topics such as content management responsibilities, rights specifications and
acceptance practices were raised. During this stage, the content structure quickly began
to sprawl, and information retrieval became progressively more difficult. The fourth stage
was defined as “personalization and processes”. As a result of the sprawling of content,
8

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

personalization of intranet, became important. Descriptions of work processes and
accompanying instructions were introduced into the intranet. As the final stage,
Kuivalahti and Luukkonen (2003, pp. 23–24) define the intranet as being “the dashboard
of the company”. This stage involves integrating intranets into operational systems that
the key measures of company activity could be seen up to date via the intranet. Business
management should engage closely with the digitalization process, as at this stage it is
about enhancing the work of the organization through the intranet (Kuivalahti &
Luukkonen, 2003, pp. 23–24).
From the early days, intranets have expanded from a few standard pages and few bulletins
to increasingly diversified channels of in-house information distribution. Today’s
intranets can include multiple types of discussion boards, blogs, and solutions for
managing the operational operations of the company. New solutions that have rapidly
expanded on the Internet, such as user-kept encyclopedia Wikipedia, social networks e.g.,
Facebook, as well as various blogs, are rapidly emerging as in-house solutions as well. A
key goal with these solutions is to share the knowledge, know-how and insights held by
the company’s employees to be utilized by the entire enterprise through continuous
interactive content production (Tiirikäinen, 2010, pp. 53–56).
For organizations, intranets provide a platform in which they can grow their business and
develop knowledge management initiatives by incorporating information stored in emails
or discussion forums so that it can be viewed, compiled, and built into a knowledge store
via the intranet (Kalman, 2003). Intranets can allow employees to cooperate on business
processes such as the development of products or order fulfilment and generate value for
the organization and its clients. Precisely, the intranets centralize the corporate process in
a readily available, platform-independent web-based environment. Effective intranets
enable staff from several divisions to apply their diverse expertise to a specific process
(Kalman, 2003). Intranet also provides organizations with the ability to create knowledge.
Employees in different departments are able to use the intranet to work in one common
platform and create new commodity for the company. Intranet provides the organization
with collaborative tools such as discussion boards as well as shared knowledge
repositories. Intranet also helps the organization gain full efficiency from its own
specialists and departments, despite where they are located (Scott, 1998).

2.1.1 Benefits of an intranet
According to Denner and Diaz (2013), the most significant benefit of intranets is that it
keeps employees updated and help them make better and more informed decisions, which
supports the increased knowledge within the organization. Other benefits include savings
in costs, better time management, better production, and performance (Denner & Diaz
2013). There are many advantages of the usage of intranet systems, e.g. employees to
locate important knowledge and up-to-date documents and offer access to other peers and
sources of expertise There are three key reasons that organizations find appealing about
intranets: access to a global corporate system regardless of location, sharing information
and knowledge easily and connect easily with resources, colleagues and expertise within
the organization (Hustd & Vikstol, 2014).
An intranet has many benefits and offers a wide range of solutions to support the
operational activities of the organization. The key goal of the intranet is to share
knowledge, insights and expertise to the whole organization and contribute to interactivity
and documentation of informal interactions. It collects fragile information in one channel
and is well designed to clarify knowledge management. Different tools provide
opportunities for communication, document sharing and finding the origin of the
knowledge as well as for finding persons behind it. (Tiirikainen 2011, p. 54, Fichter
2005). Intranet also helps transfer the quiet information within the organization to the
electronic network. It helps bring out relevant documentation, allows for easy
communication and feedback in two ways and makes the skills of the staff visible
(Stenmark 2001). Researchers have widely documented many benefits of intranets, such
as fast and efficient data transmission, efficient knowledge storage and retrieval,
interactive collaboration, cost-effective communication and technical combability. These
are also reasoning how businesses can overcome some problems that are related to
communication, with the help of intranet (Lehmuskallio, 2006).
When examining the benefits of intranet from an IT business perspective, it can be noted
that intranet reduces the cost of a company when the company can move into “paperless
office” with the help of intranet. In addition, intranet shortens systems development
cycles, as it allows many systems combined into one. Intranet has also been studied to
improve company efficiency, reducing costs, and speeding up processes. Moreover, with

10

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

the intranet, improved efficiency also yields intangible benefits such as more efficient
communication and collaboration. Intranet also eliminated geographical boundaries, as it
can be exploited in multinational companies from anywhere in the world. Employees can
cooperate independently of location using intranet (Scott, 1998). From a management
perspective, a successful intranet implementation means higher return on invested capital,
low risk, short payback, more business opportunities, and lower training costs. However,
these benefits of the intranet may be difficult to look at, as their effects may take a longer
time for an organization to be seen (Leung, 2001).

2.1.2 Social aspects of intranet
According to Gillis (2011 p. 195), from an internal communications point of view,
organizations exist for one reason which is that people can accomplish more when they
are working together as a team, compared to what they can as individuals. The future of
the workforce is evolving all the time, and most of the new employees entering the
workforce today have been grown up in a digital world (Gillis, 2011, p. 203). This group,
also known as digital natives, are raised surrounded by technology and are inherently fast
and good at using and exploiting the opportunities that technology offers (Boddie,
Contardo & Childs, 2008). Digital natives are comfortable sharing information with
friends through different social media platforms and staying connected at all times (Gillis,
2011). Subsequently, they expect the availability and use of networking technology and
skills in the workplace to improve their competitiveness and fit their lifestyles (Boddie,
Contardo & Childs, 2008). Digital natives expect the organization’s IT infrastructure to
be as gradual as the platforms they are using outside of work. Today’s employee demands
access to knowledge and information about the business and industry and communicates
comfortably to be able to succeed in the job, which is changing the whole formula of
communications in organizations (Gillis 2011 p. 203).
The communication of the organization has changed greatly with the advent of digital
natives, social media, as well as Web 2.0. These factors are allowing organizations to be
more interactive and conversational if the organization can take advantage of the tools.
Small and large businesses are beginning to take advantage of their intranets to do more
two-way contact, create culture, and allow employees to connect. They also use digital
platforms to inform, educate, and amuse their employees. These kinds of features and

11

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

functions are will able an organization to develop a social intranet (Gillis 2011 p 219).
Ward (2012) describes the term social intranet as “an intranet that features multiple
social media tools for most employees to use as collaboration vehicles for sharing
knowledge with other employees” (Ward, 2012).
Web 2.0 is primarily a concept that brings together a series of new successful ways and
models of the internet. It does not offer a single model for success and change, but a set
of traits that each operator can adopt as appropriate and combine them into a new business
or diversify their existing operations. One of the main directions of Web 2.0 is the
development, production, and sharing of user content and services on a communal basis.
From this perspective, Web 2.0 can be utilized in the development of the social intranet
(Hintikka, 2007).
Early intranets and social intranets have the same goal to improve organizational
performance and efficiency. Both aim to facilitate internal communication, collaboration,
and information and knowledge sharing. However, social intranet, instead of centrally
aggregating and disseminating knowledge, aims to engage users with Web 2.0 resources
that allow employees to openly communicate with each other and to add content to an
intranet (Kim, 2009). Kim presented that it is important to notice that the Web 2.0 tools
are social by its nature. Web 2.0 tools can enhance the social relationships between
employees and that facilitate and improve their communication, knowledge sharing and
collaboration at the organizational level. Kim researched the organizational and social
factors in the adoption of a social intranet as a case study. In the study, he found that while
Web 2.0 tools were intended to facilitate internal communication and reduce information
sharing by email, employees were not able to adapt to change in their organization;
instead, employees continued to use email in information sharing. In conclusion, Kim
stated that Web 2.0 tools in themselves, however, do not create or improve social
relationships in a work environment. At the organizational level, it is necessary to
encourage interaction and active participation between users in order to get the most out
of those tools (Kim, 2009).
Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of communication within the
working community has become more pronounced. In the spring of 2020, much of the
workforce moved to remote work and that became the new normal. In remote work and
12

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

in a change situation, the importance of communication is further stressed. In the context
of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been important for companies to ensure that digital
operating modes and channels are in order. The company’s use of its own internal social
media provides greater transparency within the working community, enhances knowledge
sharing, and improves networking and collaboration. In this exceptional situation, the
importance of social intranet has also been greatly emphasized (Niemi, 2020).

2.1.3 Available technologies
An intranet is usually a section of a public web page that is limited only to the use of the
organization’s employees. The most straightforward way is to implement the intranet to
be a part of the organizations internet pages and protect the intranet part with a password.
This way it can be delivered to the desired persons only. Often the intranet can be divided
into even smaller parts and user groups can be used to determine which groups of staff
are eligible to see what content (KWD, 2020).
In 2016 North Patrol ltd. conducted a survey of intranet services in Finland. According to
the survey there are several different platforms that organizations use for the intranet
implementations. According to the results companies use services such as SharePoint
2013, Office 365, Yammer, SharePoint 2010 or older, Atlassian Confluence, Liferay,
Episerver, WordPress, Drupal, Google Apps for Work or other services. SharePoint
remains by far the most popular intranet platform in Finland. Over 70% of organizations
that responded the survey, use one version of SharePoint as a platform for their intranet.
In particular, the cloud version of SharePoint (as part of Office365) has grown in
popularity as assumed. In addition, the survey shows that individual mentions of exotic
platforms and implementors’ own CMS products have dropped considerably.
Organizations have moved predominantly into the world of SharePoint, but the movement
towards Confluence can be seen as Atlassian’s Confluence has doubled its market share
from 2014 (Korhonen, 2016).
Microsoft SharePoint is a collaborative platform that creates different markets through
multiple users and partners (Weldon, 2012 p. 23). SharePoint platform enables easy
management of teams, information storage and allows the use and management of
business processes. SharePoint has many capabilities, including the ability to trace
13

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

content generated by other users, and the application allows other users to be monitored
within a company, in relation to the content they produce (Terek, 2013 p. 5). SharePoint
provides consistent and simple interfaces for user experience, which is the main benefit
of the platform (Suganya & Tamije, 2016 p. 176). SharePoint has the potential to
strengthen an organization’s information sharing and cooperation, which will enable an
organization to successfully complete its projects (Khumalo & Mearns, 2019). SharePoint
can be used for various purposes such as content management, communication,
knowledge sharing, and collaboration. SharePoint platform creates a variety of Internet
or intranet sites on which the above operations can be performed. SharePoint’s
functionality can also be extended through programming, allowing SharePoint to be
considered a software platform as well (McKenna, Laahs & Vanamo, 2011).
No wonder SharePoint has maintained its popularity as the most popular intranet platform
among Finnish organizations. SharePoint, due to its customizability, is bent to many
different needs of different organizations (Korhonen, 2016). On a general level, the best
intranet platform is almost impossible to determine, as the need of organizations vary so
much. Therefore, it is important for each organization to accurately define its own needs,
after which the choice of the intranet platform is easier to do. However, it can be noted
that SharePoint is a fairly safe choice for a wide range of different needs due to the ease
of customizing the platform. SharePoint is also a truly diverse platform that gives many
opportunities for business. (McKenna et al., 2011).

2.2 Knowledge management
The Cambridge dictionary (Cambridge, 2020) defines knowledge management (KM) as
follows “the way in which knowledge is organized and used within a company, or the
study of how to effectively organize and use it.” Lönnqvist (2007) advises to look at
knowledge management as a term, thus it can be defined more objectively. The term is
formed from two words “knowledge” and “management”. After these terms are defined,
a rough understanding of the content of knowledge management is obtained (Lönnqvist,
2007). Knowledge is, by the traditional definition of knowledge theory in philosophy, a
well-founded true belief. The definition is derived from Theaetetus dialogue of Plato.
According to the alleged weak definition, a claim is a knowledge if it is true (Goldman,
1999). Management means managing and organizing things. With management, a bunch
14

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

of people does things more efficiently, more result is generated, resources become
efficiently deployed and workloads are evenly distributed. According to these definitions,
knowledge management is therefore related to the management of knowledge and the
utilization of knowledge in management (Lönnqvist, 2007). However, there is still no
clear established definition for knowledge management, as it is still a relatively new
discipline. The term knowledge alone can be defined in many different ways when viewed
from different angles. Because of the complexity involved in the definition of knowledge,
the definition of knowledge management is difficult. (Al-Hawamdeh, 2003, p. 18–21).
Knowledge is quite extensive as a concept, but it can be structured in different ways. One
method of classification common in the field of KM is to use three different concepts to
describe different levels of knowledge. The concepts describing these levels are data,
information, and knowledge. Data can be defined as unstructured facts, information as
structural data that can be used in analysis and knowledge as human knowledge that is
often based on experience (Laihonen et al, 2013, pp. 17–18). The complexity of the
definition of modern KM can be seen as a result of the relationship of knowledge to
information and data. Obviously, the change from data to information is clear, but the
transition of information into knowledge is more difficult to explain (Al-Hawamdeh,
2003, pp. 18–21). This transition refers to the refining of knowledge which is made
through KM processes that enables the transition from one level of knowledge to another.
For example, data can be turned into information as it has been created a structure.
Turning information into knowledge is more complex, but it can be created as one
interprets the information (Laihonen et al., 2013, p. 18).
Karl Wiig (1999) defined knowledge management as “the systematic, explicit, and
deliberate building, renewal, and application of knowledge to maximize an enterprise’s
knowledge-related effectiveness and returns from its knowledge assets.” However, the
definition of KM is affected in what context it is considered. Different interpretations of
KM can emerge from the context in which the term is defined. The definition may differ
when dealing with KM as a discipline, research area, business management assignment,
education program or major subject, or as research trends in business economics. All
definitions are valid when looking at it from a particular point of view (Lönnqvist, 2007).
Käpylä and Salonius (2013) describes that knowledge management refers both
conducting knowledge and conducting with knowledge. Conducting knowledge means
15

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

conducting human knowledge and knowledge. This involves sharing, learning, new
dissolution and creation of new knowledge, as well as the managing different information
flows. Conducting with knowledge refers to using knowledge appropriately in decisionmaking, i.e., making conscious and reasoned choices. The effort is to lead the process in
which knowledge is created and refined to meet decision-making needs and applied in
decision-making (Käpylä & Salonius, 2013, p. 7). An understanding of knowledge-based
value creation logic is a key challenge in KM and the actual starting point for development
of management functions. Therefore, it is a question of how to create value from
information. It arises when information is intelligently exploited in both operational work
and operational development. Based on knowledge-based value creation logic,
approaches to developing data resource management and the actual value creation
process, as well as related management functions and tools. Data management is a
comprehensive function to support the organization’s value creation process. Knowledge
is needed to understand things, make decisions, and create information (Laihonen et al.,
2013).
As previously stated, knowledge can be defined in many ways and similarly there are
many taxonomies to different kinds of knowledge. The greatest distinction in the
classification of knowledge is between tacit and explicit knowledge. Tacit knowledge
refers to knowledge, by Polanyi’s (1966) definition, which is in the minds of people, and
it is difficult if not impossible to articulate. Explicit knowledge can be defined as existing
in some form, such as words, phrases, documents, organized data, or other clear forms.
One of the fundamental problems in KM is how to transform tacit knowledge into explicit
knowledge so that is can also, be used by others (King, 2009).
For centuries, scientists and philosophers have been interested in everything we in the
present-day call knowledge management. Despite this, as a discipline, KM has only
begun to develop in the last 15–20 years (King, 2009). Knowledge management is a new
aspect of management, driven by the idea of the significant role that knowledge plays in
the success of organizations. The rapid development of ICT has been central to the
development of the field, which has provided new opportunities for the storage, analysis
and transmission of data and information. But at the same time, technology has also
created new challenges, such as the flood of information experienced by experts.
Concepts related to knowledge management are still unestablished to some extent.
16

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

Scientists and practical applicants, use different and sometimes mutually contradictory
concepts. Moreover, the phenomena of knowledge management, as a rule, are intangible,
which is why simple and clear concepts are needed to understand them (Laihonen et al.,
2013, p. 6). In the early days, knowledge management was more focused on generating
and sharing information. In that case, KMs position within the organization was paralleled
with other traditional functions of the company, such as marketing, accounting, or human
resources management. Information was collected in databases and reports were
produced on it. Efforts were also made to ensure that information stored in databases
would be available to staff. Since then, the focus has shifted from knowledge production
to more utilizing knowledge. With the development of the knowledge society, knowledge
has emerged as one major factor alongside traditional production factors.
Competitiveness is now being sought more by information (Laihonen et al., 2013, p. 10–
12)
The connection between KM and the intranet is logical and natural. Intranet technology
can be utilized within an organization as an enabler of KM initiative. Intranet alone is not
capable of defining the company’s KM initiative, but it is specifically an enabler. A few
key components used in the intranet, such as LAN, user interfaces, communications
services, electronic data warehouses can be used to support the organization KM. Intranet
is precisely the ideal tool for many KM processes that supports the KM in general in
organizations (Gee & Holmes, 2001).

2.2.1 Knowledge management processes
The purpose of KM processes is to improve the organization’s business. KM processes
have been studied by different scientists substantially and many parts of the processes
have been identified, depending on the researcher’s own orientations and preferences.
However, the purpose of KM processes is to benefit the organization in its activities and
to identify how knowledge can be utilized, for example, in company decision-making
(Devi Ramachandran, Choy Chong & Ismail, 2009). Most commonly KM processes
include knowledge creation, sharing, use and management of knowledge (Girard &
Girard, 2015).

17

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

Zack (1999) argues that organizations should efficiently create, capture, organize, share
and apply the organization’s knowledge and expertise (Zack, 1999). Gupta et al. (2002)
states that KM is a process that deals with the development, storage, retrieval, and
dissemination of knowledge and expertise within an organization to improve its business
(Gupta et al., 2002). Alavi and Leidner (2001) recognize four different KM processes that
are generation, codification, transfer, and application of knowledge (Alavi & Leidner,
2001). According to Gottschalk (2002), KM processes are implementation, sharing,
distribution, creation and understanding of knowledge (Gottschalk, 2002). Alders and
Brewer (2003) states that KM processes are knowledge creation, acquisition, equation,
allocation, and application (Alders & Brewer, 2003). According to Kayworth and Leidner
(2003) there are four KM processes that are knowledge creation, storage, transfer, and
application (Kayworth & Leidner, 2003). As stated, there are no clearly defined KM
processes, instead researchers have identified processes according to their own
preferences. According to the literature, there are about three to eight processes identified
depending on the researcher. Common to the processes identified by all these researchers
is that everything relates to creation, use and application of knowledge (Devi
Ramachandran et al., 2009). For this study the most important KM processes are creation,
storing, sharing, and utilizing and using of knowledge while examining KM processes
related to organization’s intranet.
Important to the organization for the success of KM processes is also the organizational
culture. Organizational culture should encourage its members that knowledge is created,
shared, and applied within an organization through its culture. It is important that
organizational culture encourages the creation, storage, transfer, and application of
knowledge to get the most out of the knowledge within an organization and benefit its
business (Chang & Lin, 2015).
In addition to organizational culture, portals support the organizations KM processes
(Coakes, 2006). The Cambridge Dictionary (Cambridge, 2021) defines portals as “a page
on the internet that allows people to get useful information, such as news and weather,
and to find other websites” (Cambridge, 2021). The portal should provide its user with
the ability to use tools for collaboration, research, and personal productivity. In the design
of portals, it should be considered that it should be scalable, integrated with old
technologies and compatible with the system. KM initiatives are not entirely dependent
18

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

on technology, but technology nevertheless allows the reach and speed of knowledge
transfer to be extended, which also helps in the retrieval and utilization of information
and knowledge. Organizations leverage data repositories to preserve knowledge and seek
to capture every possible information in an organization easily accessible throughout the
organization. However, often all information is impossible to store, own and transfer.
Still, ICT helps with the transfer of knowledge within the organization. In addition, more
than explicit knowledge can be stored in databases. Databases also contain implicit
knowledge, which is tacit knowledge that can be exploited as explicit knowledge (Coakes,
2006). By means of this, portals such as intranets are vital to organizations in order for
KM processes to succeed.

2.2.2 Intranet for knowledge creation
Knowledge creation as an organizational process that can amplify the knowledge created
by individuals and takes a form as part of the organizations knowledge system. Therefore,
organization is not able to create knowledge without its individuals. Organization is
source that provides a context and supports its individual to create knowledge (Nonaka
& Takeuchi, 1996). Creating knowledge in organization often involves developing new
content or replacing pre-existing content with tacit or explicit knowledge. New
knowledge is necessary for organizations to use it to develop new innovations and create
new knowledge. When a company begins to develop new products or services, or if its
knowledge is outdated or inadequate, the company should create new knowledge through
organizational learning (Shen & Tsai, 2008).
Knowledge creation is commonly defined as the first step in KM. Knowledge in an
organization is not static but is constantly changing in the form of knowledge, that is, the
existing tacit knowledge in an organization can be changed to explicit or transform
subjective knowledge into objective knowledge. The process by which the form of
knowledge can be changed was developed by Nonaka & Takeuchi. The model is named
SECI-model, as it is based on four elements. In SECI-model, the overall general and
remote knowledge base of the organization grows to a new knowledge base
(Wickramasinghe, 2008). According to Nonaka and Takeuchi (1996), tacit and explicit
knowledge is not completely separate from each other but complement each other. Tacit
and explicit knowledge is constantly interacting with each other and switching to each
19

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

other along with the actions of people. In the SECI-model, knowledge is generated
through the interaction between tacit and explicit knowledge and is divided into four
different

‘modes’

1996).

Figure 1: SECI-model (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1996).

The first ‘mode’ is socialization, where knowledge is created from tacit knowledge to
tacit knowledge. In this mode knowledge is created through the sharing of experiences.
A great example of this is the master-journeyman setup, where the journeyman receives
knowledge from the master through observation, imitation, and practice. In corporate
culture, the same can be seen in on-the-job training, using the same methods.
Socialization also appears between product developers and end-users, which can be
considered an endless process. Customers share their experience with products, from
which product developers are informed and can benefit from it (Nonaka & Takeuchi,
1996).
Second mode is externalization, where knowledge is created from tacit to explicit
knowledge. At the easiest, externalization is explainable by the fact that when a person
tries to conceptualize some kind of image, he/she uses language to do so. Subsequently,
writing, tacit knowledge yields modified articulable knowledge. However, the
inconsistency of the expressions helps foster interaction and reflection among individuals.
An example of externalization is when business world seeks to conceptualize i.e., a new
20

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

service or product. The process of creating a concept is often triggered precisely by
dialogue or collective reflection. Externalization can be seen as a key factor in the creation
of knowledge, as it enables new knowledge to be created from tacit to explicit. Once
explicit concepts have been created, the development of those can be continued by
modelling. Thus, a logical model arises where there should be no contradictions, as all
concepts and propositions are expressed in systematic language and coherent logic
(Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1996).
The third mode is a combination where knowledge is created from explicit to explicit. In
this process, systematic concepts are created as part of the knowledge system. In this
mode, different types of explicit data are combined. Individuals exchange and connect
knowledge through documents, meetings, telephone conversations or emails, among
other things. When existing explicit knowledge is sorted, combined, added, and classified,
new knowledge can be created. Widespread creative use of databases is often required for
a successful conversion of knowledge (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1996).
The fourth ‘mode’ is internalization, where knowledge is created from explicit to tacit.
Internalization can be described so to speak through “learning by doing”. Once the
experience has been through the first three modes, it is possible to internalize individuals
into a broad knowledge base that becomes valuable property. Transforming explicit
knowledge into tacit knowledge internalized by the individual, documentation helps, as
it enables individuals to internalize what they experience, enriching tacit knowledge.
Documentation also aids the transfer of explicit knowledge to others, which helps them
experience their experiences indirectly, as internalization can occur without having to
directly experience other people’s experiences. For example, reading a success story
might help an individual know the realism and essence, an experience in the past may
turn into a tacit mental model. When this model is distributed to multiple members of an
organization, tacit knowledge also become part of the organizational culture (Nonaka &
Takeuchi, 1996).
In his dissertation, Stenmark (2002) has explored the benefits of intranets as an enabler
of knowledge creation and innovation. Innovation cannot often be designed and
controlled in the traditional sense but should be ‘cultivated’. A traction-based access
mechanism for intranets is well suited to this. Intranets should promote internal
21

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

communication, but to succeed in doing so, relevant ‘people management’ and
organizational practices are also needed. In his dissertation, Stenmark (2002) has studied
the circumstances under which intranets can help and when to hamper innovation and
knowledge creation. According to him, information depends more on networking and to
support the creation of knowledge, care should be taken to ensure that intranets also
support social networking. In order to facilitate the publication of information formation,
the four knowledge-creating processes proposed by Nonaka in the SECI-model should be
combined with other intranet use modes (Stenmark, 2002).

2.2.3 Intranet for knowledge storing
Knowledge storing as a KM process refers to the organizational memory generation
process where existing knowledge is stored in physical memory systems (Gonzales &
Martins, 2017). Alavi and Leidner (2001) define organizational memory as “stored
knowledge about the history of an organization that can be utilizes to carry current
decisions”. The physical location of the organization’s knowledge repository therefore
supports the knowledge creation and development of the company and its individuals
(Gonzales & Martins, 2017). Previous empirical studies suggest that when organizations
create knowledge, they learn, but tend to also forget, do not remember, or lose acquires
knowledge. Therefore, storing, organizing, and retrieving information is critical to
organizational KM. Organizational memory includes, among other things, written
documentation of the organization, structured information stored in electronic databases,
human data stored in systems, documented procedures and processes and tacit knowledge
obtained by members of the organization, and their network. However, the organization’s
memory becomes beyond the individual’s memory and includes components such as
production processes, working methods, organizational culture, organizational hierarchy,
and data repositories, both internal and external (Alavi & Leidner, 2001).
Organizational memory has prevalent positive effects on the functioning of an
organization such as its behaviour and performance. Memory allows an organization to
store and apply already existing functioning processes, which contributes to the fact that
resources are not wasted on replicating previous work. Powerful storage technology held
by computers, as well as advanced search functions, are compelling tools when working
with knowledge storing. Those functions increase speed to how memory can be accessed
22

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

and utilized at work. In addition, it helps to implement change, as past experiences exist
in the organization’s memory (Alavi & Leidner, 2001).
Knowledge storing should also consider the proportion of older workers in the workforce.
The ageing workforce possess an abundant amount of knowledge and expertise, and it is
important that the organization can recognize the kind of knowledge that older workers
have in their possession and what should be preserved for younger workers in the future
of the organization. As employees retire, many organizations risk continually losing
valuable knowledge along with these employees if the process of knowledge storing is
not supported within the organization (Joe, Yoong & Patel, 2013).
Intranet is a great tool for organizational memory creation and knowledge storing. Intranet
provides a platform where each member of an organization can request a file they need
or use intranet search tools to find the file for themselves. Intranet enables seamless and
efficient storage of knowledge, and the information is stored on a platform in a concrete
format from which it is easy to retrieve and share with everyone who needs it (LS intranet,
2020). Intranet has been studied for knowledge storing and retrieval. Its development has
developed along two roads. The intranet can be described as an unstructured knowledge
base, or in other way as a means of free flow and exchange of information. Often the
intranet is studied from the perspective of information flow and cooperation. Researchers
who stress the intranet as an unstructured knowledge base are addressing the basic
concepts of KM based on how those can be combined with the intranet technology. Often
the intranet can be seen as a universal information system that benefits the organizational
memory (Stenmark & Lindgren, 2003). Intranet’s cross-platform, as well as open
standards, allow organizational knowledge integration. Intranet allows data to be accessed
from many different sources, including legacy databases and user interfaces. In addition,
converting paper delivery systems to electronic files in the intranet system will bring
considerable cost saving to the organization (Scott, 1998).

2.2.4 Intranet for knowledge sharing
As one important KM process, knowledge sharing is a fundamental means enabling
members of an organization to promote the application, innovation of knowledge, and
ultimately the competitive advantage of the organization as a whole. Knowledge sharing

23

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

is the sharing of mission knowledge and know-how to others to help them and collaborate
with others in order to develop new ideas, policies, or procedures. Knowledge sharing
can take place in various forms, such as in writing, face-to-face conversation,
documenting, organizing, or networking with other experts (Ruppel & Harrington, 2010).
At an organizational level, knowledge sharing depends heavily on the kind of people there
are in the organization who create, share, and use knowledge. The rationale for sharing
knowledge is that knowledge is also made available to others within the organization.
Between individual, knowledge sharing is the process of changing information held by
an individual to a form understood to another individuals, so that is can also be used by
another. However, the individual does not relinquish ownership of knowledge; instead,
when sharing knowledge, knowledge changes into the shared ownership of individuals.
However, sharing knowledge is now compulsory between individuals; sharing implies a
conscious act (Ipe, 2003).
It is important to distinguish between knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer.
Knowledge transfer is mostly used to describe how information moves within an
organization, such as between departments or other organizations (Ruppel & Harrington,
2010). However, knowledge sharing is also important for the organization, as it provides
a connection between the individual and the organization, thus making knowledge with
the individual’s own also available to the organizational level. Interaction between an
organization and individuals who possess much different knowledge, improves
organization’s chances of innovation far beyond what an individual alone would be able
to accomplish, and this delivers economic and competitive value to the organization (Ipe,
2003). Therefore, if there is a major deficiency knowledge sharing within an organization,
and individuals are not consenting to share their knowledge, it has proved to be a
significant obstacle to the effective management of expertise withing an organization
(Davenport & Prusak, 1998).
Nonaka and Takeuchi’s SECI-model used to knowledge creation can also be utilized in
knowledge sharing (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1996). However, Stenmark (2002) has
criticized the model in ignoring the fact that knowledge is a competitive asset for the
organization as well as for the individual (Stenmark, 2002). As Ipe (2003) noted, an
individual is not compelled to share the knowledge if he/she does not want to do it (Ipe,
2003). Stenmark (2002) has also stated that people do not share knowledge unless they
24

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

themselves have the motivation to personally share it. People do not want to give away
knowledge if they do not actually accomplish something with it or if they are afraid of
losing something. According to Stenmark, Nonaka and Takeuchi’s model does not take
this into account and has proposed a new approach in his research where knowledge does
not need to be outsourced. In Stenmark’s proposal, the whereabouts of the knowledge can
be identified and reported within the organization. Consequently, the value of individuals
increases, as they have certain knowledge within themselves that can be exploited by the
organization. By means of this, the value of the organization increases as well. This will
not allow individuals to risk eavesdropping and substituting their knowledge into a
database and their willingness to participate in sharing knowledge increases (Stenmark,
2002).
According to previous studies, knowledge sharing has been linked to positive effects on
production costs, product development, team performance, sales growth by increasing
innovation capabilities and completing projects more quickly. As a combination of all
these, new products and services deliver sales growth. As a result of these benefits, many
organizations have invested time and money in KM initiatives, as the sharing of
knowledge can be studied to improve the efficiency of the company. As a result,
companies also want to invest in knowledge management systems (KMS), as they can
use technology to effectively operate KM processes (Ruppel & Harrington, 2001).
The nature of the intranet allows for many KM initiatives, as its basic elements include
the browser base, search functions, and abilities to share knowledge. It enables
communication and interaction within the organization. Intranet supports knowledge
sharing at least three ways. First, it provides time and space among its users. Secondly, it
provides flexibility for exchanging knowledge. Thirdly, it supports knowledge transfer
and organization networking, as it is independent of direct connections, such as face-toface conversation, between users (Ruppel & Harrington, 2001). According to Ruggles
(1998), KM is “an approach that adds or creates value by more actively utilizing
competence, highness and judgement that reside within and even outside the
organization”. In this perspective, knowledge is seen as a KM process perspective rather
than an asset. From this perspective, the creation of an appropriate environment that
allows and facilitates the flow of information is important (Ruggles, 1998). The intranet

25

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

can be considered such an important environment that facilitates the flow of information.
Intranet is even critical to that environment (Ruppel & Harrington, 2001).
For knowledge sharing to be effective organizational culture plays a significant role.
Ruppel and Harrington (2001) studied the role of organizational culture in sharing
knowledge through an intranet. Because of the study, it was discovered that is an ethical
and confident culture that also promotes the knowledge sharing of tacit knowledge
through an intranet. It is the sharing of tacit knowledge that delivers an important
competitive advantage for the organization that each organization aims to promote in
order to make KM effective (Ruppel & Harrington, 2001). As Ipe (2003) and Stenmark
(2002) have noted in the previous research about people’s willingness to share knowledge
(Ipe, 2003, Stenmark, 2002), an ethical and confident organizational culture promotes,
precisely, this willingness in knowledge sharing, allowing both the individual and the
organization to benefit (Ruppel & Harrington, 2001).

2.2.5 Intranet for utilizing and using of knowledge
Taking advantage of knowledge on a large scale within an organization is commonly
challenging. The use of knowledge may consider the ambiguous nature of knowledge,
differences in human aspects and various management and organizational constraints.
Organizations collect information for their business promotion, such as information about
markets, customers, production processes and innovation over long periods of time. This
knowledge base benefits the organization’s key production factors and, with high
probability, also creates a competitive advantage. Organizational knowledge is an
important asset used and managed just like traditional assets (Law & Chang, 2016).
However, the exploitation of information assets differs considerably from the use of other
assets in the organization. For example, the value of a data asset cannot be determined,
and its value is often unknown. The exception is if the information property is used to
generate performance. Furthermore, ownership of the knowledge property is unclear,
although the knowledge may be “owned” and managed by the organization.
Organizations do not want to leak knowledge they own to outside competitors in which
case it might lose its own value. Utilizing knowledge in an organization effectively might
therefore be complex. Among the greatest challenges are the introduction of information

26

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

within the organization, as well as the ability of members of the organization to apply the
received information. These two challenges can be analysed from three different
perspectives, which are the information communication technology perspective, the
human (in this case the employee) perspective, and the organizational perspective, i.e.,
the supervisor perspective (Law & Chang, 2016).
The term “knowledge reuse” is used often in KM literature, which can be found in the
information management literature to be synonymous with “information retrieval” (IR).
Knowledge reuse is often described through four phases, which are knowledge capture,
knowledge storing, knowledge sharing and knowledge utilization (Chua, 2004). The
knowledge available to members of the organization, such as employees in companies,
has grown enormously with the use of intranets. With the increase in the amount of
information, the accessibility of knowledge has also become more difficult as the
importance of information retrieval has become important. The organization’s members
are increasingly required to have better information retrieval skills so that the right search
words are used in order to able to search for the right kind of information and get it used
effectively. Quantitative growth in information also contributes to the facts that the search
engine should operate efficiently and make useful information available to its users easily
and quickly (Kietz, Maedche & Volz, 2002). Most of the information retrieval tools just
like search engines and directories are designed to make it easier to find information. The
functionality of the search engine on the intranet is also particularly important.
Knowledge work often requires reuse, integration, as well as retrieval of new information.
For example, to compounding a presentation, an employee should take advantage of
earlier documents, web search, spreadsheets, as well as email messages. Here the reuse
of information is concreted well, and new knowledge is created by integrating information
from different sources (Dumais at al., 2003).
Knowledge reuse includes both recalls, and recognition. Recalls refers to the fact that the
knowledge is stored in what location, what index or classification system. Recognition
means that the data that are stored, meets the needs of the users and effectively the
application of the knowledge. When expertise is desired to be used effectively within an
organization, for knowledge reuse, the use of knowledge involves both identifying
experts on the subject and selecting the most qualified expert for a particular query. In
addition, it includes the query, response, and application of the knowledge. Information

mining is called knowledge reuse involving systematic secondary analysis of information.
This consist of four different stages. The first is the definition of search queries, which is
necessary for successful reuse. It has often been found that one feature separates
beginners from experts; experts know how to ask questions. The next step is the search
and location of experts and expertise. The third step is the selection of the appropriate
expert or expert opinion among the results. The final step is to apply the knowledge to
the sought information described in previous stages (Markus, 2001).
The reuse of information utilizes a wide range of repositories for information. The
fundamental difference comes between document archives and data repositories.
Applying information as text-shaped documents is different from retrieving data from
data warehouses. Thus, indexing and storing data in these repositories is also different
(Markus, 2001). According to Davenport and colleagues (1998), the archives can be
separated into two different categories. One is archives that store external information
(e.g., demographic data) and the other that store informal information such as group
discussions, email discussions, etc. (Davenport et al., 1998).

2.2.6 Community of practice
The term Community of Practice (CoP) first appeared in 1991 that was used by Jean Lave
and Etienne Wenger (de Lima, de Carvalho & Ambrosio, 2010). CoP as a term was
crucial to the field of research utilizing a practical method of research. Behind the origin
of the term was the idea that the community should replace the individual as a subject of
learning. From an organizational perspective, it was though that CoP combines the ideas
that communities learn, thus making the organization a community of communities
(Gherardi, 2009).
It is important to understand that CoP is everywhere, as in working communities, schools
and universities, and hobbies. From an organizational perspective, CoP is an important
asset, as it forms the future of the entire organization. CoP can be defined as a set of
people who share a common interest, problem or issue and deepen their knowledge in this
matter by communicating with each other. CoP can share its knowledge through
storytelling, mentoring, and discussions, allowing tacit knowledge to be transferred
effectively within the people. By looking at KM processes, knowledge creation and
28

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

transferring are important activities for CoP. As stated, CoP often arises from common
interest or problem. In an organization CoP might arise naturally, rather than as defined
by management. Through conversations, knowledge sharing, participation, and sharing
ideas, individuals help each other to solve a common problem (Al-Hawamdeh, 2003, pp.
121–122). For organizations, CoPs are of great use. It helps management understand KM
processes. CoP delivers value to the organization in many ways such as, help promote
strategy, can solve problems effectively, start new business lines, transfer best practices,
develop professionalism, and help companies recruit and keep the talented ones
(Gehrardi, 2009).
There is also a term Virtual Communities of Practice (VCoPs). VCoPs works like CoP,
but groups of people come together to discuss and share their knowledge in a common
virtual environment. Members may look to the community for an answer to their own
problem and share solutions among the community, and thus the community builds up
their own knowledge. The important thing for VCoPs is that the knowledge that is
generated among the community should be stored in such form and place that it can be
easily retrieved later. VCoPs can work through e-mails, chats, wikis and technologies
provided by websites. These provide an environment in which experts from a particular
group can share best practices on a common platform (de Lima et al., 2011).
Intranet, especially social intranet benefits VCoPs in the organization. Intranet provides
VCoPs a platform to engage conversations and helps its members with problem solving.
VCoPs can also take advantage of phone calls as well as video conferences to interact and
create knowledge, but conversations through those can be difficult to store, thus
transitioning knowledge between members only and not being available to the entire
organization. Because of this, intranet is also in terms of VCoPs a useful channel.
Conversations via intranet are automatically stored in the company’s internal network and
solutions achieved in the conversation can be effectively retrieved later (Dubé, Bourhis
& Jacob, 2005, p. 148).

2.3 Information architecture
Wurman (1996) was the first to define the term information architecture (IA). He defines
information architecture firstly as individual to organize information inherently, making
29

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

the complex clear and secondly as a person creating a structure or map of information
that allows others to find their own paths to knowledge. Wurman sees architecture as a
science and art that creates “teaching organized space”. This includes the design of
organizational, annotation, navigation, and search systems that enable the person to find
and manage the information he or she need more easily. The IA is therefore used to
describe the structure by which the data is grouped (Wurman, 1996). Carter (1999)
defines information architecture as a collective term used to describe the various
components of a general information infrastructure that consider the business processes
of the business model and components and, through these, produce information systems
that support and produce it. These main components are data architecture, systems
architecture, and computer architecture. When innovations related to information are
developed, all decisions will be reviewed holistically in the business environment and
within these different architectures. In such a case, the company’s business strategy and
its long-term objectives can be considered, while also noting the importance of the
technological environment and the external environment in the overall picture (Carter,
1999).
Due to the rapid growth of the internet, the amount of online information has grown
blaringly. When people face massive amounts of information, difficulties arise as well as
how to choose and obtain effective information. To this problem IA helps. On the internet,
IA is a combination of organizing site content into categories and creating an interface to
support these categories. This consist of four parts. First up is an organizational system
that distributes information into different categories based on content characteristics (Nie
& Hao, 2007). According to Wurman, there are five ways how information can be
organized; location, alphabetical order, chronologically, by categories, or by hierarchical
relation (Wurman, 1996). The second part is the notation system, in which case a uniform
notation program should be created for each data group. Third is a navigation system that
helps map user’s necessary information. Last one is a search system that helps people
develop documents matching search queries to meet user’s data requirements. The
purpose of IA is to achieve the best search results through web construction (Nie & Hao,
2007).

30

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

2.3.1 Information architecture for intranet
As previously stated, in the KM perspective, intranets contain a huge amount of
information that should be readily available to members of the organization. In order to
achieve this goal and ensure a good user experience, intranet should be implemented with
the right kind of IA. What makes the IA of intranets difficult, is that IA designers often
have only a limited number of opportunities to see how information is structured in other
intranets. Also, essential to implementing the intranet is the use of suitable navigation
elements so that information can be easily found (McCloskey, 2014).
Nielsen Norman Group has studied the implementation of the IA of intranets a lot.
According to the study, ambiguous naming of navigation menus is one of the greatest
challenges regarding the intranet when looking at the IA of the intranet. All menus should
be named descriptively, accurately, and exclude each other so that users can move
between menus easily. Organizing the intranet also plays an important role in IA terms.
The intranet can be organized by task or subject matter. A task-based intranet refers to
the fact that a content organization is independent of who created or owns the content.
Often, task-based structures held up better, according to research, if, for example, an
organizational change is implemented in the company. However, according to
organizational structure, organized intranets are more easily serviceable, as in this case
each department takes care of its own section in the intranet. However, in this case, the
intranet will also have to be reorganized if the company faces organizational change.
Nevertheless, according to the study, by 2014 86% of new intranets were implemented
on a task-based basis. However, naming menus for task-based intranets is often more
challenging and time-consuming (McCloskey, 2014).
Nielsen Norman Group also examined the number of main navigation items in its study.
The study involved 77 intranets with an average of 7.6 main navigation items. At its
lowest level, there were 3 main navigation items and 31 at highest. According to median,
there were 7 main navigation items. The maximum number of main navigation items was
reduced from previous research, which is a good direction, as too wide a structure
immediately shows its user too wide range of available content, which also makes it
difficult for the user to navigate and search for information, as many menu items might
overlap. For the majority of intranets, company information (66%), human resources data

31

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

(64%) and news (56%) were selected for the selection of items on the main menu. In
addition to more general topics, different solution for main menus could be found from
companies in different fields, such as products related menus by production companies.
The study also found that, increasingly, the navigation of the intranet was generally
wanted to be improved, such as adding a feature that highlights to its user his or her
current location on the site. Clear and continuous navigation demonstrated to its user how
information can be found and helps them to better understand the overall structure and
what sites they have already discovered (McCloskey, 2014).
In addition to navigation, many intranets offered quick links, namely navigation shortcuts
to the site’s most popular destinations, according to the study. Quick links allow the user
to find the information they need more easily and faster. Social filters can also be added
to quick links, which allows links to be recommended depending on what other users
have been used. Social filters may include items such as “most viewed”, “most popular
documents”, “frequently asked questions” or “commonly used forms” etc. With the use
of social filters, the intranet will become more useful and interesting when the necessary
information is found faster (McCloskey, 2014).

3 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
In the following chapter, the theoretical background of the study is provided. This chapter
introduces the main concepts used in this study and how theoretical framework is
conducted to support the research.

3.1 Theoretical model and framework
The focus of this research is set around three main concepts, which are the implementation
of the intranet or, in general, information system, knowledge management, and
information architecture. The main research question is “what are the qualities and
information that the intranet should contain to make knowledge management as efficient
as possible”. The research model is formulated in such way that the main research
question is answered as clearly as possible.

3.1.1 Needs analysis
The needs analysis can be used to define deficiencies or problems in the matter being
investigated, as well as identify their causes and find solutions. Needs analysis can be
described as a process designed to identify gaps between the current and the desired
situation. The purpose of this is to systematically identify flaws between situations
(Berkley Lab Training, 2020).

Figure 2: Needs analysis process (Berkley Lab Training, 2020).

The needs analysis is important that useful and usable systems can be developed. In
development, it is important to identify and understand user needs and contexts, and these
should be considered throughout the whole development cycle. User needs refer precisely
to the difference between user’s current and desired situations. This difference manifests

33

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

itself as problems and opportunities for users. User requirements describe the functions,
constraints or other features that should be considered in the development of the system
in order to meet the user’s needs (Kujala, Kauppinen & Rekola, 2001).
The first step in implementing the needs analysis is to set specific business objectives for
the matter under investigation. This is usually done through a review of the organization’s
mission statements, strategic objectives and improvement goals. When the objectives are
set, the next step is to analyse the current situation of the organization’s business
processes by collecting relevant data on the level of performance and how resources are
currently being allocated to these processes under investigation. Data can be collected
from multiple sources and through different methods such as looking at documentation,
conducting interviews, brainstorming, and observation. Once a company has set itself a
target and studied its current situation, it will identify the gaps between these situations.
A gap analysis is often used here, where gaps are identified, and solutions are sought. The
intention is to outline a plan describing concrete steps to achieve the business objectives
(Sales, 2019).

3.1.2 Gap analysis
Gap analysis is a method often used to asses’ differences in performance of a company’s
information systems or software applications, which can determine whether business
objectives are met and what steps should be taken in order to meet them. Gap refers to
the space between the current situation and the desired state. The gap analysis is often
referred to needs analysis and is often part of it. In gap analysis, gaps are identified, and
solutions are sought to be found. It is therefore intended those solutions could be found
in the gap analysis to achieve the business objectives set out in the needs analysis (Sales,
2019).
In information technology, small companies in particular may benefit from gap analysis
as a company seeks to figure out resource allocation. Software development can
determine which services or functions have been omitted and which have been
deliberately omitted that still need to be developed. The gap analysis can be used to
determine what settings needs to be used in order to meet the company requirements and
business objectives (Sales, 2019).

34

3.1.3 Knowledge Audit
Knowledge audit is the first step in the organization’s desire to take a knowledge sharing
initiative. The purpose of the knowledge audit is to explore what information an
organization has, how it stores it, and how it is maintained. The knowledge audit examines
the strengths and weaknesses of the information and what it is used for (Mankin, 2017).
In addition, the knowledge audit assesses the information needs of the organization as
well as the behaviour of members of the organization in sharing and creating knowledge.
Knowledge audit should be accomplished in order to transform the organization into
learning organizations and ensure its effective knowledge management strategy.
Knowledge audit provides an organization with knowledge of the current state of its
competence and direction of where and how to develop this capability in order to
strengthen competitiveness (Chowdhury, n.d.).
Typically, the purpose of the knowledge audit is to ensure that the goals of the
organization are met. Knowledge audit can also be done when knowledge is intended to
support and not replace experts in the organization. In this case, knowledge process
analyses can be accomplished at the knowledge audit to best support experts. Thus, the
goal is to understand the processes that make up the activity of the skills worker and see
how these respond to the objectives of the organization. The knowledge audit competency
assessment is therefore an assessment of how well different information processes are
used to achieve knowledge goals. Audit is often internal to the organization, auditing is
usually regular, but often driven by external need. The results of the knowledge audit can
be used in an organization to make possible changes in knowledge management
objectives or actions in information processes (Lauer & Tanniru, 2001).

3.2 Research model
Through the discussions with the case company’s management, three main organizational
goals for the intranet are identified and the framework is structured to follow these
themes. The first organizational goal is to streamline and store data, which refers to
knowledge storing. The second one is to unite and collaborate employees with the
intranet. In the KM perspective, this refers to knowledge sharing. The third goal is to
increase productivity, which refers to knowledge utilization and knowledge use.

35

Figure 3: Research model of the thesis

Figure 3 presents the research model of this study. The research model follows the three
main organizational goals of the company. Initially, needs analysis has been utilized to
determine the case company’s current and desired situation through these three themes.
Both situations are clarified through questionnaire research. Based on responses from the
questionnaire, efforts are made to identify gaps between the current and desired situation.
Once the gaps have been identified, interviews are used as a research method to help fill
the gaps identified. Interviews provide increasingly more detailed information about the
possibilities of how to reach the desired situation with the regard to the intranet. Once
solution for identifying gaps are identified, intranet information architecture can be
designed to serve as best as possible precisely the needs of the case company and its
organizational goals within the intranet.

4 METHODOLOGY
This chapter presents the research methods used in this study as well as the research
strategy. The section also presents data collection methods, as well as what method has
been used to analyze the collected data. At the end of this chapter, there is a brief
presentation of the case company.

4.1 Qualitative methods
The premise of qualitative research is the depiction of real life. The idea is that reality is
manifold, which should be considered in the study. That reality cannot be fragmented into
parts any way. Thus, qualitative research seeks to study the subject as holistically as
possible. Many characteristic features can be described for qualitative research. First, as
mentioned above, qualitative research is by its nature, a holistic acquisition of knowledge,
and the data are assembled in natural, real situations. Furthermore, qualitative research
favours humans as an instrument for information collection, as the view is that a human
is flexible enough to adapt to varying situations. Inductive analysis is also used in the
study. The scientist quest is to uncover unexpected facts. The starting point is therefore
not to test theory or hypotheses, but to examine the material in a complex and detailed
way. In qualitative research, the target set is chosen appropriately, not using the random
sample method. In addition, the research treats cases as unique, which is why the material
is also interpreted accordingly (Hirsjärvi, Remes & Sajavaara, 2010, pp. 161–164).
The word qualitative refers to the emphasis on properties of entities, as well as processes
and meaning that have not been experimentally studied or measured in terms of quantity,
intensity or frequency. As mentioned, qualitative research examines real situations and
qualitative researchers emphasize the socially constructed nature of reality and the
intimate relationship between the researcher and the subject matter. In addition, the
situational constraints that shape the study, are considered. In qualitative research,
researchers emphasize the authoritative nature of intelligence, which seeks answers to
questions to highlight how social experiences arises and is given meaning (University of
Southern California, 2020).

37

4.2 Chosen method
Case study is a typical and traditional research strategy. In terms of features, a case study
is detailed, intensive information about an individual case or a small number of
interrelated cases. Typically, a case study selects an individual case, situation, or set of
cases where an individual, group, or entity is targeted. The aim of the case study is more
typically the description of phenomena, and the data are collected in connection with their
environment, i.e., in natural situations (Hirsjärvi et al., 2010, pp. 134–135). The case
study seeks to extrapolate key themes and outcomes of the study to help predict future
trends or find previously hidden things that can be applied to practice. Furthermore, this
can provide a means by which the research problem can be more clearly understood. The
methods used to investigate the case may be in a quantitative, qualitative, or a
combination of these in the investigative paradigm (University of Southern California,
2020). The case study was selected as a research strategy for this study, as the study
examines the needs of one particular company with regard to the development of an
intranet. Data in the study were collected in connection with the environment and in a
natural situation, and data were collected from members of the organization which is
typical for case study.

4.3 Data collection
In this study, the data was collected by questionnaire and interviews. Study used the
survey method. Survey research considered one of the most important research methods
in applied social research. Survey refers to all measurement methods that involve asking
respondents’ questions (Trochim, 2020). Survey refers to forms of questionnaire,
interview and observation in which data are collected on a standardized basis and in which
the target persons form a sample. Standardization means that questions should be asked
to all respondents in exactly the same way (Hirsjärvi et al., 2010, p. 193). Roughly
divided, survey research can be divided into two different areas: questionnaires and
interviews (Trochim, 2020). Both methods were used in this study, both a questionnaire,
and an interview, to provide the broadest possible understanding of the subject.

38

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

4.3.1 Questionnaire
The advantage of questionnaires is usually considered to be that those can be used to
collect a wide range of research data. Substantial number of individuals can be obtained
for research and many things can also be asked. However, there are also weaknesses in
the questionnaires. Most commonly, material is considered superficial and studies
theoretically modest. In addition, it may also be considered that it is not possible to
ascertain how seriously respondents have taken the investigation and it is not clear how
successful the response options given have been from the respondents’ point of view,
making it difficult to control misunderstandings (Hirsjärvi et al., 2010, p. 195). Because
of these disadvantages, this study used additional interviews to provide the most accurate
information on the subject.
Questions in the questionnaire were conducted in such a way as to comply with the
research model. First, the questionnaire examined respondents’ demographic data using
multiple choice questions. The questionnaire was otherwise conducted anonymously. The
topic of the study is the main factor affecting the response, in which the formulation of
the form and the precise design of the questions can enhance the success of the research
(Hirsjärvi et al., 2010, p. 198). The questionnaire first examined the current situation of
the company in three different categories, which were knowledge storing, knowledge
sharing and knowledge utilization and use. The questions were used to try to get the
broadest possible picture of the situation of the whole company regarding these topics.
Subsequently, the questionnaire examined the desired situation of the company for the
same topics. The questions were formed in such a way that they could easily be compared
with the questions that examined the current situation. The creation of the questions
utilized the knowledge audit and used as a basis for the questionnaire to examine what
information the case company has, how it is stored and maintained. In addition, the
questionnaire explored wishes for a future intranet. The questionnaire was implemented
with Microsoft Forms.
In addition to multiple choice questions, the questionnaire used open questions as well as
scales-based questions. Open questions are questions that ask only a question and leave a
blank space for answer. Questions based on scales make claims and the respondent
chooses from them how strongly he or she agrees or disagrees with the argument

39

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

presented. The questionnaire used the 7-point Likert scale (from strongly disagree to
strongly agree), where options formed an ascending scale (Hirsjärvi et al., 2010 pp. 199–
200) asking respondents to rate their perception or opinions to the claim. The respondents
were also asked to indicate how often event in the claim occurred (several times a day to
I do not use it).
The questionnaire was chosen as a research method for this study, as the storing, sharing
and use of knowledge of the case company was desired to obtain the broadest possible
picture, which the entire company staff have the opportunity to respond to. In addition,
the intranet was desired to implement to best serve the needs of the company’s staff
precisely from the point of view of their work duties. As a result, it was important for all
staff to be able to influence the implementation of the intranet through the questionnaire,
also providing their own views on the subject. Although the questionnaire is often
methods of quantitative research, in this study it was initially utilized to examine the
general situation, after which the study subject was further examined through interviews.

4.3.2 Interviews
Interview is a unique method of data collection in relation to direct linguistic interaction
with the subject. The main advantage here is usually considered to be the flexibility of
collecting the material. In qualitative research, the interview has been considered the main
method (Hirsjärvi et al., 2010, pp. 204–205). Interviews are a much more personal form
of research method than questionnaires. In the interview, the investigator works directly
with the interviewee. Unlike the questionnaire, the interviewer has the opportunity to ask
follow-up questions as well. Interviews are also often easier for the respondent, especially
if opinions or impressions are sought (Trochim, 2020).
Hirsjärvi et al. (2010) lists reasons why an interview is often chosen as a research method.
Firstly, why an interview can be chosen is because the research area is quite unknown,
where it is difficult for the researcher to know in advance the directions of the answers.
Secondly, the fact that it is pre-known that the subject of research produces answers in a
complex and many directions. Lastly, the interview would like to clarify the answer that
are being received and to deepen the information that can be obtained (Hirsjärvi et al.,
2010, p. 205).

40

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

Interviews were selected as a data collection method for this study for precisely these
reasons. Since the study used needs analysis, a method aimed at finding solutions to
identified gap was needed in addition to the questionnaire. Interview is also a frequent
research method used in needs analysis, which is why it was selected for this study as
well. Through interviews, a larger and more common picture of the case company’s
situation was provided for the implementation of the intranet from the KM perspective.

4.4 Qualitative data analysis
Descriptive statistics are used to describe the basic characteristics of the data collected
for the study. It can be used to provide a simple summary of the sample and measures.
Descriptive statistics, together with the sample graphics, form the basis for almost every
quantitative analysis of data (Trochim, 2020).
Descriptive statistics refer to what the data is and what the data show. Simply, descriptive
statistics are used to describe what is happening in our data. Descriptive statistics can
simplify large amounts of data on any metric, and also help to simplify these large
amounts of data in a rational way (Trochim, 2020). Using descriptive statistic, raw data
can be presented rationally and in such a way that their interpretation is simple. When
using descriptive statistics, it is useful to summarize data into groups using tables,
graphical descriptions, and a combination of statistical commentary, i.e., discussion of
results (Leard Statistic, 2018).
The descriptive analysis was selected for this study as the data collected from the survey
was simplest to present using descriptive analysis. Various tables were formed from the
results of the survey, as well as diagrams, to describe the results, in addition to combining
the discussion of the results to open up significantly more. The results of the interviews
combined with the results of the survey are analysed in more detail in the discussion
section of this research.

4.5 Introduction of the case company
The case company is a small financial accounting firm owned by the city and
municipalities. The company is thus an inhouse limited liability company created due to

41

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

the outsourcing of financial divisions in 2019. The company specializes in finance and
human resource management. In addition to the city and municipalities, the company also
provides its services to communities owned by them. The company aims to provide all
its customers with consistent and automated processes to ensure operational efficiency.
The staff of the company is made up of experts in the field of municipalities.
On the financial management, the company provides services in terms of accounting,
accounts receivable and payable, among other things. Furthermore, services include the
maintenance of the financial planning system and reporting system, consolidated
statements, VAT calculations and declarations to the taxman and the production of
statistics. In the case of payroll management, the company provides in addition to payroll,
maintenance of a reporting system, self-issuing electronic forms, making accounts,
declarations and applications and producing statistics.

5 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
In this chapter the results of the questionnaire and interviews are presented. The
questionnaire results are analysed, and interviews are widely presented. Interview results
are later analysed in the discussion chapter.

5.1 Questionnaire analysis
The results of the questionnaire were analysed through descriptive analysis, which is
often an essential means of analysis in qualitative research. The questionnaire was
conducted to follow the research model and needs analysis. The questionnaire consisted
of four categories, which were knowledge storing, knowledge sharing, knowledge use,
and intranet properties. Knowledge storing, knowledge sharing, and knowledge use were
all divided into two further sections, detailing the current situation of these matters, as
well as the desired situation, so that the gaps can be identified, Identification of gaps is
characteristics of needs analysis. Analysis of the questionnaire was intended to identify
gaps between the current and desired situation, which permits forming interview
questions. Through the interview, the gaps are intended to find solutions in order to reach
the desired situation.
The questionnaire was sent to a total of 38 people within the company. The questionnaire
was distributed using email and the reminder message was sent twice in addition to the
original message. A total of 26 replies to the questionnaire were received and therefore
the response rate was 68%. The questionnaire was implemented with Microsoft Forms.

Table 1 presents demographic data for respondents. The majority of respondents
(57.69%) work on the payroll. The majority of respondents were over 55 years of age,
which was 46.15%. 76.92% of respondents were over 45 years old, while only 23,08%
were under 45 years of age. This also indicates about the age structure of the case
company in general. The respondents had been working in their current position evenly
for different periods of time. The majority, 34.62%, however, had worked in their own
position for 1–2 years. The majority, 84.62% of respondents had previous experience in
similar positions in the field. Only 15.38% did not own previous experience in similar
tasks.

5.1.1 Knowledge storing
The current situation of knowledge storing examined using eight questions. It was desired
to clarify the desired situation by paraphrasing the issues of the current situation in such
a way that those could easily be compared with each other.

Figure 4: Knowledge storing in different locations

As a first question, how information is stored, was examined. 46.15% respondents
strongly agreed that information is currently stored in many different places. In addition,
38.46% agreed that information could be found in many different places. The results

depict that the company’s information is stored in many different locations, in which case
the search for it may produce challenges.

In addition, table 2 shows that respondents were asked whether they had information
stored on their own computer only. 65.39% of respondents agreed in some level that
information is only on their own computer. In addition, it was examined how respondents
feel about whether information is stored only by certain individuals. More than half of
respondents. 57.69% also agreed in some level that information is only available to certain
individuals. These results also reinforce the first question of information being stored in
many different locations within the company.

Similarly, questionnaire participants were asked about the desired situation if they
wanted the information to be stored in the same place. 42.31% of respondents strongly
agreed that the information should be stored in one place. 96.15% of respondents agreed
in some level that the information should be stored in one place.

Respondents were also asked whether the information should be available to all staff
(Table 3). 65.38% strongly agreed that the information should be available to all staff. A
total of 96.14% of respondents agreed in some level. Based on these five questions
presented, gaps can be identified between the current and desired situation. Currently,
information is stored in many different places, including on people’s own computers only
for their own use. Based on the questionnaire, it can be clearly stated that the desired
situation would be that the information is stored in one place available to all staff. In order
to find a solution, the interview should examine what are the options for making
information found in all different channels into a common intranet and how to motivate
people to map information found on their own computer to be used as common.

Knowledge storing was also clarified as to the form in which information was stored
(Figure 6). 61.53% of respondents agreed in some level that information is stored in both
paper and digital. However, 61.53% also felt at some level that it is not important to find
information in paper, indicating that more than half wish to eliminate the paper files.
88.46% of respondents agreed to some degree that it is important to them that the
information can be found in digital format. This indicates that important paper
information would also be good to be stored in an intranet in a digital format.

In the questionnaire, there were also matters about where information should be stored.
Some dispersal between respondents may be noted here. 42.32% disagreed at some level
that they do not fully know where information should be stored. 46.15% of respondents
agreed on some level that they know how and where information should be stored.
64.54% strongly agreed that they want clear instructions for storing information. 92.31%
agreed on some level that they wish for clear instructions. Based on these responses, it
should be necessary for the company to create clear instructions to ensure that information
storing is clear for all staff.

The questionnaire also examined whether stored information was in clear order. Based
on the questionnaire, it was noted that 69.23% of respondents felt at some level that the
information is not currently in clear order. However, 96.15% attaches importance to the
fact that the information should be stored in a clear order. In addition, the questionnaire
examined whether respondents themselves have trouble keeping information in order,
with 42.31% somewhat agreeing that it is challenging to keep it in order. A gap can be
identified based on these results. The interview should be used to determine how the
information could be arranged in such an order that it would be easy to use and exploit.

Based on the questionnaire, it can be noted that the information stored currently is
applicable to the respondents’ own work. In addition, the respondents considered it
important to permit the information stored to be directly applied to their own work.
Based on the questionnaire results, the fact that information and data is stored is relevant,
but it is stored in many different locations and is not in a clear order. The interview is
used to try to calculate solution to these problems. Furthermore, based on the
questionnaire results, when implementing the intranet, it should be considered the fact
that paper information should be stored digitally in the intranet and clear instruction
should be created for the storing of the information.

5.1.2 Knowledge sharing
The questionnaire examined knowledge sharing among staff. As with the knowledge
storing, the current and desired situation was sought to clarify also in knowledge sharing.
As well as sharing information, it was explored how respondents cooperate among other
staff.

Figure 10: How often knowledge is shared

Figure 10 shows how often and through what staff share information with each other.
Personnel share the most information with each other daily through Microsoft Teams, but
email is also an important information-sharing channel several times a day. Discussions
with colleagues is also a popular method of information sharing. However, due to Covid19 pandemic, the company’s staff mostly work remotely, which explains the fact that
Teams and email are currently the most important tools for information sharing. The
proportion of information shared through conversations with co-workers would probably
be higher if the majority of staff worked at the office. However, for Teams and email, the
problem in terms of sharing information may prove to be the fact that information is
shared between a small group or even two people, e.g., in Teams discussions. In this case,
the information does not reach the entire staff, but remains only between two people. It
may be difficult for staff to assess what information would be important to share with all
staff. The interview may be used to ascertain how often the staff share information only,
e.g., through discussions between two people discussions, and how to assess what
information would be good to reach the entire staff.

Figure 11: Receiving information through different channels

Figure 11 shows via what channel the staff receive information. The same trend is also
noticeable here as in Figure 10. Among the most popular information channels are Teams
as well as email. In addition, information about current affairs is obtained through
discussions. The questionnaire also had an alternative to answer “other what?” and as an
open response, one crucial comment appeared: “Important information that directly
applies to my work is not always shared. Now, within a month, two important things that
affect my work, I was not informed”. This problematic situation may be precisely because
information is shared through two intermediate discussions and therefore do not end up
with the knowledge of others.

The questionnaire also explored how often staff would like to see current affairs informed,
with 61.54% of respondents wishing things to be informed once a week, while 26.92%
would like to see things informed daily. In addition, more information sharing was desired
from the management of the company. 80.77% of respondents agreed on some level that
management should share more information with staff.

Figure 12: Knowledge sharing with others

The results of the questionnaire depict that, 57.69 % respondents agreed in some level,
that they are encouraged to share information in their work. 26.92% had neither agreed
nor disagreed. However, 92.31% agreed on some level that they want to share information
with others. In addition, 92.31% felt at some level, that it is easy to ask co-workers for
help and 76.92% of respondents agreed on some level that sharing information is easy
among other staff. From this, it can be concluded that organizational culture is easily
approachable, as it is easy to seek advice from co-workers. While a large percentage of
respondents felt that information sharing is encouraged, want to share information
themselves and information sharing among others is easy, 84.61% of respondents agreed
at some level, that they would wish their co-workers to share more information with them.

52

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

In addition, 96.15% agreed at some level, that they would like other staff to share
information for common use. Based on the responses, there are some degree of problems
with sharing information, as staff are prepared to share information, but feel that not
enough information is being shared. This gap is something that should be examined in
the interview. Interview should explore what is the reason how staff feels like that. In
addition, the interview should determine when the staff feels that they are receiving
enough information about current work issues and can they name solutions what should
be done, that receiving information would be at good level.

The questionnaire also examined the capabilities of people to use different software to
share information. 30.77% somewhat agreed that they experienced difficulties using
different software to share information. 57.69% of respondents agreed on some level that
they hope that better tools for sharing information and cooperation would be provided.
Generally, intranet helps with this problem is the intranet is implemented as a social
intranet, where cooperation and knowledge sharing are easy. It is important to provide
training for staff to use the upcoming intranet so that they do not feel it is difficult to use.

The majority of respondents indicated that they are sharing information between
departments too. The majority also felt that it is important to share information across
departments. Information sharing between different departments seems to be at decent
level, but there is room for improvement in this matter also.

The questionnaire also examined challenges of sharing information, as well as possible
solutions to those, via open answers. Open responses were categorized by theme those
were related to. The majority of respondents did not quite know how to name challenges
to sharing information or were of the opinion that there were no challenges. Many also
responded that ambiguous processes posed a major challenge to sharing information.
Answers such as “There is no clear division of labour as to who should share
information” and “unclear processes”. Many also felt the deficiency a common channel,
for which 23.08% had also proposed a clear common channel/intranet. In terms of
information, problems also arose. Responses told such things, as “Knowledge does not
always reach the right person. The turnover of persons is a problem and is not always
informed” as well as “Changes in work assignments are made in the account, which are
not always reported. I really don’t always know who’s doing what and who’s in charge
of which”. The last one also related to the ambiguity of processes. A few responses were
also related to heavy rush at work. As a solution for sharing information, 23.08% hoped
for more meetings, both across the staff and among their own teams. Clear processes and
a common channel were also hoped for to improve the sharing of knowledge: “It would
be decided what the medium in which knowledge is. Now it is in different places, and you

55

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

always do not know when you are looking for information whether it is the latest, updated
information. Email groups should be inspected/refine”.
When it comes to sharing information, the main problems were how to clarify the fact
that the staff knows what type of information they would have to share with others.
Cooperation between staff seemed to be fine. In the interview, it is important to determine
how often information is shared between two persons discussions, as well as how to
define information that would be good to share among the entire staff. In addition, the
interview explores why many have a feeling that not enough information is being shared,
even though many are willing to share information themselves and what is behind this
problem.

5.1.3 Knowledge use and utilization
The questionnaire was also used to examine the use of knowledge at work and how easily
the information can be found across the company’s different channels. In addition, the
questionnaire explored what kind of information staff most often look for and need, which
are important things to consider when implementing an intranet. The intention was to get
a full picture of what kind of information staff find it difficult to search, and what kind of
information they would like to be more accessible.

Figure 16: Information retrieval

The questionnaire examined whether staff feel the information was easily available. There
was quite much dispersion about whether staff felt the information they were looking for
was easily accessible. 57.69% of respondents agreed at some level that the information is
easily accessible and 38.47% disagreed in some level. However, half of respondents
agreed, on some level, that they find the search for information difficult. Increasingly
more scatter was found as to whether staff experience that they know exactly where to
find the information they need; 50% of respondents disagreed at some level that they do
not know exactly, while 34.62% agreed at some level that they know exactly. However,
no one strongly agreed or disagreed. In any case, all respondents agreed at some level that
it is important that information is easily accessible, and that information is easy to find.
In addition, the majority of respondents considered the search function important to make
information easy to find. From these results, at least it should be borne in mind when
implementing the intranet that the search function is good, and the information is easily
accessible. In addition to these factors, the questionnaire explored whether staff knew
where they can find paper as well as digital documents. In both, the distribution was
precisely flat, with about half agreeing by some level and disagreeing by some level.
However, no significant findings on this issue were found beyond the search for normal
information.
57

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

In addition, the questionnaire examined where staff find the information most often.
Clearly most often, the information was obtained by asking a co-worker. Information was
also found on the M disk, which is the place where most of the company’s files are
currently stored. 38.46% of respondents searched for information daily in files located on
the M disk, and 11.54% even several times a day. In addition, via email, information was
often found as well as with Teams. Email and Teams may also be used to communicate
with a co-worker, which supports information found from co-workers.

whether they could trust the information to be up to date. However, all respondents
considered it important at some level that the information would be reliable and timely.
A gap can be noted in the timeliness of information. The interview should ascertain where
the staff feel they cannot rely on the information to be relevant.

The questionnaire was also used to determine whether staff spend an abundant amount of
time searching for information, with 50% of respondents broadly agreeing that it takes a
great extent of time to find information. Furthermore, 3.85% strongly agreed that a lot of
time goes by. However, for the vast majority of respondents, it was not to take too much
time from other job tasks to seek out information. A clearer data repository can be
experienced as a solution to this problem, which can integrate into the intranet, so that the
search for information may be accelerated if the repository is implemented for easy use.

The questionnaire also examined how staff feel to use current software in terms of
information retrieval. The responses here were split evenly, with 34.61% agreeing in
some level and 42.3% disagreeing. 23.08% neither agreeing nor disagreeing. However,
all respondents considered it important at some level, that the software should be easy to
use.

The questionnaire examined what kind of information staff look for and need most often
and how often they seek it. Most often, there was a search for information related to
collective agreements, which was searched daily and few times a week. The findings may
also be because the majority of respondents worked in payroll, where exploiting collective
agreements is an important part of the job. The least need was for information about
recreational activities, lunch lists, and Netvisor instructions. This information provides,

60

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

assistance in the way in which information is worth organizing in the intranet. These
results are useful when implementing the information architecture of the intranet.
In addition, as an open response, the questionnaire was used to determine what kind of
information search staff find troublesome. 19.23% of respondents felt it difficult to search
for software instructions. Searching for M-disk was also perceived as difficult, based on
the open responses: “It is sometimes a little difficult to find the file you want, because
they have now been stored a little here and there”. In addition, the open responses
mentioned the timeliness of information; “Knowing it is difficult, whether the information
I found is still valid, or whether it is obsolete or corrected later” and “current affairs”.
In addition, the rush was also the reason why searching for information is inconvenient.
As with information sharing, ambiguous processes were also mentioned regarding the use
of information; “It is difficult to perceive internal policies and processes of the
company.” Regarding the desired situation, most of the responses were also related to
software guidelines, which were hoped to be more easily accessible. There was also much
hope for policy guidelines and timely guidelines. Once again, based on open responses,
clearer processes and alignments were hoped for, e.g., whether the matter belongs to the
company or to the municipality; “It has been unclear between what is the function of the
municipality and what the function of the company, even though they have been clarified.
There will always be some new thing and then one wonders whose task it is”. In addition,
one common place where information can be found was mentioned; “All the data in one
place, so that you don’t have to spend time retrieving where you can find the
information”. Intranet may be a good solution for this problem.

5.1.4 Intranet
The final part of the questionnaire was intended to determine the wishes of staff regarding
the upcoming intranet. In addition, the types of features the staff deem important in the
intranet was charted. Finally, respondents were also allowed to issue their own
suggestions regarding the intranet.

Figure 20: Main tasks of the intranet

The main task of the intranet was considered to improve communication within the
working community. Improving access and flow of information was also considered
important. All options named as alternatives were considered important. In particular, it
is important for communication, cooperation and knowledge sharing to create a social
intranet so that these features can actually be implemented within the company. Since the
flow of information and access to various data is also important based on a questionnaire,
it is also important to create a clear and easy to use directory of documents in the intranet.
The questionnaire also examined what qualities staff consider important in the intranet.
Clearly based on the results, the main characteristics were the directory of documents and
the timely information of the company. A contact directory, useful links, a collaborative
platform, and a recreational activity bulletin board were also considered important. Less
important was the customization of own profile, moving email to the intranet, and the
marketplace. These results are also important factors when planning an information
architecture of the intranet.

Moderately important

Figure 21: Qualities of the intranet

The staff’s previous experience with intranets, and what they consider important in them
were examined through an open response. Most of respondents mentioned clarity, ease
of use and timely information, which came up in more than half of responses. Although
customizing own profile was not very important to many respondents, it was hoped to
clarify the processes; “possibility to update your profile with own contact information
and job description, and therefore providing information to others. Finding important
instructions and work processes in the intranet. Possible important links to other
authorities’ pages.” As can be noted from this answer, useful links also came up many
times in open responses; “The links needed at work (outtake, reel, tax) all in same place.”
An important comment also occurred in the open responses; “That it is easy to use and is
constantly maintained. Lest it be left as an information channel but is active to everyone.”
There is currently no obvious level of timely information and reliable information because
it has been much hoped for in the questionnaire. The interview should ascertain to ensure
that the information on the intranet remains current and reliable.
Right at the end of the questionnaire, there was a free comments section, where in most
of the responses, the intranet was already highly expected. In addition, it was also raised

63

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

many times in a part that there was much hope for ease of use and clarity. In addition, a
version that work on mobile was also hoped. However, based on the comments, there is
a great need for the intranet in the company; “With interest, I expect the intranet!”,
“Hopefully a working intranet will be enabled soon” and “Great if we get an intranet in
our company”.

5.2 Interview analysis
The interviews were intended to find solution to the gaps identified in the questionnaire.
There was a total of seven interviewees, four of whom work on the payroll and three in
financial management, to bring perspective of both departments into the study.

Table 7 depicts the interviewees codes referred to in the following section where
interview material is extracted. All interviews were conducted via Microsoft Teams and
interviews were recorded and later transcribed. Interview questions were also divided into
four categories following the research model. Interview questions were formed based on
the insights gain from the questionnaire results and there was a total of six interview
questions, see Table 8.

When do you think receiving information would be at a good level? How do you define
good level of receiving information and how often? Can you name solutions what should
be done, that receiving information would be perceived as good?
What do you believe is that information is not perceived as current? Do you feel this is an
internal problem or a problem arising from outside factors e.g., software instructions?
How do you think it can be verified that the information on the intranet remains reliable
and up to date? Who should take care of updating the intranet?

Table 8 presents interview questions and questions codes refer questions in the following
section. Next, finding from interviews are presented to provide answers to the gaps that
emerged from the questionnaire.

5.2.1 Knowledge storing
Questions Q1 and Q2 dealt with the storing of knowledge and information. Based on the
questionnaire results, gaps between the current and desired situation were the main
questions, and in particular, respondents were asked to describe “how all information is
found to be collected to the intranet (Q1)” and “how the information should be organized
there (Q2)”. All interviewees felt that Q1 was a difficult and a challenging question.
However, the following are the responses mentioned by the interviewees on how
information should be collected. For instance, interviewee one mentioned that:
“As far as I’m concerned, the information has to be built by subject area”. (Y1)
Another interviewee indicated that:
“It should somehow be broken down in that way by subject areas and what knowledge is
needed and what knowledge everyone has”. (Y2) or “We need to determine what we want
there. You have to start with what you want and where everyone has their own data
stored”. (Y6)
As to how to collect all the knowledge and information and motivate people to search for
their own recordings, answers were also obtained through interview. For example,
interviewee one mentioned that:
“One person should organize whatever is put in there, that way it can be ensured that all
the knowledge can be found there”. (Y1) or interviewee four was concerned about how
to store information and indicated that:
“All the information should be moved in one place. Would it be an M-disk then? Do they
make each one with their own folder? Who is going through them, that what is

65

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

appropriate and what is not? Everyone must have named their files in a mixed manner,
and you can’t get any sense about them. Yes, there is a challenge”. (Y4) and another
mentioned that:
“I am sure that Teams and M-disk are, at least, where we can find files made by us”. (Y5)
Interviewee seven gave some practical solutions how to collect information from
everyone’s own computer and mentioned that:
“Everyone should go through their own files, what is out there, what anyone else might
need. For example, I have a personal list of my own employees, and if someone is filling
in for me, they might need it. I should also clean up my own files, there can be something
that others can benefit from. For example, it would be worthwhile to have a conversation
in your own team, that everyone should go through their own files. Then there should also
be one place to move those files”. (Y7)
In Q2 were inserted in exploring how information should be organized into an intranet in
terms of information architecture in order to make information easy to find and exploit.
Everyone agreed that payroll and financial management should at least be separated into
the intranet. The most degradation came between interviewees as to whether the
information should be arranged directly by municipalities in the intranet. For example,
one interviewee mentioned that:
“Of course, municipalities have some local contracts and those should be the
individually. I wouldn’t necessarily immediately divide the municipalities as categories.
Firstly, there should be broadly payroll and financial management, and then in addition,
the local contracts and local guidelines under them”. (Y2)
Another interviewee was concerned about the division of municipalities and mentioned
that:
“As far as I am concerned, a division between municipalities would be good. If you need
to look for a specific municipality, you know immediately where to look for it. It is easier
to put the information on a municipality basis than for example on a monthly basis.
However, there are some minor differences between municipalities, although there are
also common instructions”. (Y3) Another interviewee gave suggestions of the division
between departments and mentioned that:
“At least it would be good to have the financial management and payroll, and then those
are divided into further subsections, e.g., the financial management has accounting and
accounting payable and receivable. I have to wonder if it still needs to be broken down
66

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

by municipality. If there are information related to the software, then those are the same
instructions for everyone. But otherwise in every municipality, for example, there are
different practices.” (Y4) and another mentioned that:
“It would be good if there was at least such a general place where all the common
knowledge could be found. After that, the financial management and payroll separately
and those would probably still need to be distributed separately. One option for dividing,
is by municipalities, if the intention is for each of us to be able to work and filling in for
anyone. Pretty much practices vary by municipality, not in big things, but there are
different accounts and cost locations.” (Y5)
Yet interviewee six was in opinion that the division between municipalities would be the
right choice and mentioned that:
“There should be division between municipalities first, and downward accounting,
payroll and accounts ledger.” (Y6)
Interviewee seven suggested different divisions alongside with departments and
mentioned that:
“If the whole company is considered, there should be division between payroll, financial
management, leisure, rules and guidelines and occupational health by headlines. Yes,
there is one method of grouping by municipalities, because there are different local
agreements, but then there are probably general ones too.” (Y7).
Q2 also examined for what does easy to use mean for interviewees. Everyone replied that
it should be clear and arranged such way that one knows right away where to retrieve
information. It was also mentioned that headlines and search features are precisely
important.
“Headlining is the most important of all. In addition, the search function should be
logical for search word to immediately find the necessary information”. (Y4) and another
mentioned

that:

“It would be good to be able to put in a search word and then find the needed knowledge.
In a similar way how Google works”. (Y7)
In addition to these, Q2 examined when interviewees feel that there is too much
information and what kind of information, they feel is irrelevant. Most of the interviewees
felt the outdated information is irrelevant. However, several agreed that there may not be
67

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

irrelevant information, as everyone perceives it differently. Interviewee two felt that there
are no such thing as irrelevant information and mentioned that:
“I don’t know if there can be any unnecessary information. But at least the same thing
shouldn’t be stored many times in the same place. Of course, there can be a lot of
information, but every piece of information is important, as long as it’s in the way that it
is not there many times, that many places have the same things.” (Y2)
Another interviewee mentioned reports from the software as partly irrelevant and
mentioned that:
“On the financial management, the software might create three different reports from the
same point, and you don’t really know which one is the important one. It’s been a bit
difficult, which one is the irrelevant part and what’s the most important report. Those
reports can’t be packed into a small space, so there will be a mass of irrelevant
information, if every report is stored. That is maybe a problem.” (Y3)
Interviewee six felt that old information is irrelevant and told that:
“If we consider our instructions at the moment, then old information is irrelevant. You
can’t really know what is the latest instruction. We should find out what’s the latest.”
(Y6)
Another interviewee felt that accurate information is important and mentioned that:
“Irrelevant information is the one, that you can also get directly from the software. It
must also be accurate that information, e.g. annual changes, remains up to date.” (Y7)

5.2.2 Knowledge sharing
Both questions Q3 and Q4 dealt with knowledge sharing within the company. For
example, in Q3 we aimed to explore how often knowledge is shared in one-on-one
discussions and how to define information that should be shared with everyone within the
department or company. Through the responses it became clear that everyone shared
information daily in Teams in one-on-one discussions, but it was more difficult to define
what should be shared among the rest of the staff. Many of interviewees felt that
information should be shared among the entire staff and at a lower threshold. Interviewee
one believed every work-related issue should be shared and mentioned that:
“All work issue should be shared among everyone. But you always kind of assume that
everyone already knows, even if you don’t necessarily know if they know. I’m sure that’s
the biggest problem.” (Y1) and another interviewee mentioned that:

68

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

“I share information daily, that is, a lot. It should be encouraged by everyone, when there
is a situation that no one would dare to share it when they assume that other know it
already, but if more information is shared in general, then that threshold would be lower.
Some discussion platform in the intranet would be good, where you can ask questions.”
(Y2)
Interviewee six was concerned that there are some people that would not want to receive
new insights and mentioned that:
“What we mainly have is that is someone insights something new, then there are people
who don’t receive that new information because there are people who have always done
things in a certain way, and this is what they will continue to do and thus don’t want to
hear new insights from anyone. That’s the biggest problem. Some people have been doing
things in a certain way for 20 years and don’t want to change those modes of action.”
(Y4)
Another interviewee felt that problem is assuming the knowledge of others and mentioned
that:
The biggest problem is when you assume other people to know some things. There could
be some channel for this matter in the intranet. Some software related tips -channel might
be good where you can specifically share that practical work. People should not think
that certain things are so simple that those are not worth of sharing, the threshold should
be really low. Even if others already knew it, it wouldn’t hurt, because if new people come
in, then that historical knowledge would be good to be there anyway. Then, in a few years,
the channel can be cleaned, if it begins to be too full of tips.” (Y6)
Interviewee seven gave solutions for the problem and mentioned that:
“As far as I am concerned, it would be good to have a section in the intranet, where you
can put your own problems and concerns about the work. The kind of FAQ that many
websites have.” (Y7)
Q4 also surveyed about receiving information. When the level of receiving information
would be at good level and how often it should be. There was also desired to determine
interviewees solutions to fix the problem that the receiving of information would be good.
All the interviewees mentioned meetings, which should be held weekly. Informing was
also perceived as an eternity problem. Interviewee three wanted to receive information
from every change and mentioned that:

69

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

“Yes, as far as I am concerned, whenever there are changes, those should be informed.
Yes, something happens here every week. It would be good to report and tell everyone
about things and what happens.” (Y3) another interviewee felt that email is not the right
channel and mentioned that:
“It is important, in what form the information is informed. At least for now, there is so
much email that it often goes unread. We in the accounts ledger introduced a 15-minute
quick review once a week, which goes through, if there is something new, it has been a
really good way of informing.” (Y4)
Interviewee six felt that the situation has been improved and mentioned that:
“The situation has been greatly improved by the fact that there are now reagreed
meetings every week. At weekly level, twice is good to inform and, of course, you need to
have memos of the meetings that can be read afterwards.” (Y6) and another interviewee
had concerns about informing in general and told that:
“I didn’t think it was a good habit before, when there were work issues discussed in the
coffee room and half of the employees were missing. In its own way this covid situation
has been a good thing, but has that informing completely missed? The meetings and
memos of those are really good.” (Y7).
Q4 also examined solutions to improve informing. Especially email was mentioned
several times as a bad informing channel. Interviewees were many in the opinion that
bulletin boards and meetings are great:
“In the intranet, for example, there could be just a column where information would
appear a bit like news; “current” and things can be informed there. Minutes of the
meetings are also good, but it feels like no one reads them afterwards, if they have been
away. It would be good if they were more accessible. The main points about the meeting
could be assembled in the intranet on the bulletin board.” (Y2) and another mentioned
that:
“As far as I’m concerned, there should not be informing by email, when that mass comes
in anyway and there’s a lot of that information lost there. Meetings are good, but there
could be some place where you could inform, and then see all the current issues easily
from there.” (Y3) Yet another interviewee suggested bulletin boards and mentioned that:
“The bulletin board could be good on the intranet. We have really good service channel
in the financial management software, where you can see everyone’s questions and
70

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

answers, and that way find the information easily. Before that, everyone put the questions
by email and they immediately disappeared into email, now those are thankfully left in
that service channel.” (Y4) and another mentioned that:
“It would be good if there was some place on the intranet to inform, and the information
would sort of jump on the eye. If you’ve been absent, you’d see at once what’s happening
and what’s current. Maybe even with bullet points, not too broadly, from the meetings,
would be good to assemble in some quick place.” (Y5)

5.2.3 Knowledge use and utilization
Regarding Q5, the aim was to assess and investigate why staff are not experiencing
information as current and up to date and where they believe the problem is caused. Some
of the interviewees agreed that the information is a matter of fact up to date and do not
experience it as a problem. A large number of interviewees felt that the problem stems
from both internal, and external factors. However, majority gave software instructions as
an example. Few interviewees felt that this was not a problem and mentioned that:
“I can’t answer. Who’s thought that. Yes, all instructions can be returned when those are
current for your own situation.” (Y1) and another mentioned that:
“Oh really, is not perceived as relevant? I don’t feel that the information it’s not
relevant.” (Y7)
Another interviewee stated that there are a great number of old information:
“For example, I have a lot of data from my predecessor, e.g., from 2006. The problem is
that she has not updated those herself. She has saved all of those old records but hasn’t
deleted the outdated information.” (Y2)
Interviewee three had concerns about instructions and mentioned that:
“As far as I’m concerned, it’s 50–50 internal and external issue. Last year, when a new
software came, and all instructions were received in relation to it and acted by them.
Along the way, not everything worked out the way it was advised and there were a lot of
new things that haven’t been updated to the instructions that are stored. A lot of people
have written down those new things for their own use, but there will be probably problems
when a new person starts and only the original base for those instructions is saved. We
always try to tell the new employee all the changes, but it would be good to have them
stored somewhere for common use.” (Y3) and another stated that:

71

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

“I’m guessing that because everyone is in such a hurry now, that they can’t really get
acquainted with all the instructions properly.” (Y4)

5.2.4 Intranet
Finally, in Q6, we examined things related to updating the intranet, that it can be ensured
that the information there remains up to date. All the interviewees suggested that one or
more people should be named responsible for updating. The payroll and financial
management departments should name their own people. In addition, the responses
showed that it would be good to have ones one data updated in the intranet to keep
personal contact information up to date. All the interviewees had quite similar answers
regarding to updating and interviewee one mentioned that:
“In principle, it would be good for anyone to get the access to update, it would be
everyone’s responsibility to have up to date information, but in practice it will not be so
successful. However, it would be good for everyone to be able to update their own contact
and work information, that at least those would always remain up to date.” (Y1)
Another interviewee suggested that there should be specific persons named for the
updating and mentioned that:
“One or two people should be named for it. It clearly needs to be someone’s job to go
through it. Perhaps in such a way that the payroll and financial management departments
would have their own individuals. I don’t care if it’s one or two or three or even five
people, as long as it’s clear whose responsibility it is.” (Y2) and another mentioned that:
“This is a difficult one. Yes, there should be at least one on the payroll and one on the
financial management department who would announce what’s going on here.” (Y3)
One interviewee was concerned about the information retrieval and mentioned that:
“Somehow you should centralize that at least, not everyone should have access to put
information there. Now everyone can make changes in M-disk and there is no logic on
that, and you can’t find anything on there. There should be some admin of the intranet.
There should be people on the payroll and the financial management departments who
run it.” (Y4)
Yet all the other interviewees mentioned that there should be specific persons that are
choose for updating:

72

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

“There should be some person in charge in that. It won’t be good if everyone has the
right to update it. There has to be an individual on the payroll and on the financial
management.” (Y5) and another told:
There’s got to be a responsible person. What matters is that we all know who that person
is who maintains it. Absolutely good thing is the departments common calendar, which
all the members of the team are able to update themselves, however. (Y6) and another
mentioned that:
“Yes, to that one person should be named as an updater. Then, for all sections, there
would be the responsible people who inform the updater. There should be people from
both departments, from payroll and financial management. “(Y7)

6 DISCUSSION
In this chapter, the results obtained in the study will be discussed and elaborated. Initially,
the results of the questionnaire and interview will be combined into a rational whole and
the most important findings will be presented.

6.1 Main findings
The findings from this thesis have been divided into four categories which are knowledge
storing, sharing and use and utilization, in accordance with the structure of the thesis to
make it easier to follow the discussion of the results.

6.1.1 Knowledge storing
As Alavi & Leidner (2001) stated, storing, organizing, and retrieving information is
critical to organizational KM and therefore this manner was also crucial according to the
research of implementation of the intranet to the case company. In terms of knowledge
storing, there were two larger gaps between the current and desired situation according to
the empirical results. The main problem was that information has either been stored in
many different locations or employees also stored information on their own computers.
Many felt that the desired situation would be when all information is stored in one place,
so that it will be easier for everyone to use them. The gap was formed by how all
information is assembled in the same place, which in this case would be a common
intranet. It is crucial for organization to support the process of knowledge storing and to
store its knowledge in same place so the risk of losing valuable knowledge is avoided
(Joe et al., 2013). This was evaluated through interviews. As mentioned above, the
interviewees felt this as a difficult question to answer. However, for the most part,
solutions were found that data should be collected from each employee systematically by
subject area. In addition, for the most part, company files and instructions can be currently
found in M-disk, from where those are easy to transfer to the intranet. The interview
results also indicate that it would be important for each employee to clean up the files on
their own computer in order to ensure that all information is collected in the intranet for
the collective use of everyone. This should definitely be accomplished at the initiative of
both departments, i.e., financial management and payroll managers, so that every

74

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

employee actually examines his/her files. In addition, the company would do well to
assemble a folder for common use, into which useful files can also be compiled.
Therefore, it is easy to add material to the intranet from that folder.
Another gap in the storing knowledge was found in the organizing of information, which
referred to knowledge storing as well as information architecture of the intranet. As the
research about intranet IA determined, the intranet should be implemented with the right
kind of IA in order information to be readily available to members of the organization.
(McCloskey, 2014). The interviewees were used to ascertain how the information should
be arranged in the intranet to make it easy as possible to organize and exploit it. Since the
company’s clients are the cities and municipalities, the most dispersal came in the
responses as to whether the information should be organized into the intranet on a
municipal basis.
In addition, interviewees were concerned whether the intranet should be built on a taskbased or subject matter basis. For the most part, however, the interviewees responded that
the intranet should be built in accordance with the organizational structure, allowing
financial management and payroll to have their own sections that may have been further
divided into subsections. As Nie and Hao (2007) stated intranet IA is combination of
organizing site content into categories and distribute the information into those categories
based on content characteristics (Nie & Hao, 2007). The results of the questionnaire and
interview were also discussed with the company’s management team, with whom it was
concluded that the intranet should be build according to the organizational structure, but
the municipality-specific classifications are distributed separately under departments to
allow different local contracts and guidelines get incorporated into the intranet.
In addition, the interview question explored what easy to use means for respondents and
when they feel that there is too much information and what kind of information is
irrelevant. In terms of easy to use, clear headlining and good search features emerged,
which have also surfaced in the Intranet Information Architecture research conducted by
Norman Nielsen Group that was presented in the literature review (McCloskey, 2014).
Alavi and Leidner (2001) also stated that advanced search function is a compelling tool
when working with knowledge storing (Alavi & Leidner, 2001). For irrelevant
information, obsolete information was perceived. However, regarding the intranet, this
75

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

problem is avoided by regular updating, which was also examined in this research.
Moreover, discussions with the management team concluded that the intranet should not
be made an archive, instead the archive will be held separately elsewhere, and intranet
will focus more on the preservation and utilization of instructions within the various work
processes.

6.1.2 Knowledge sharing
Intranet is broadly recognized as a great platform for knowledge sharing as, for example,
Tiirikainen (2011) states that the key goal of the intranet is to share knowledge, insights
and expertise to the whole organization (Tiirikainen, 2011, p. 54) and Ruppel and
Harrington (2001) recognize at least three ways how intranet supports knowledge sharing
as it provides a space, flexibility for exchanging knowledge and supports knowledge
transfer and organization networking (Ruppel & Harrington, 2001). Therefore, the
knowledge sharing within the company was examined and two larger gaps arose in this
area as regards the current and desired situation. Generally, staff agreed that there was an
abundant amount of information shared among co-workers and each information shared
multiple times. However, the problem arose, that many times, the information is shared
only between one-on-one discussions and therefore the information does not reach the
entire staff. This problem was clarified in the interview. Interview was also used to
determine what kind of information would be good to share among all staff. In the
interview, it was revealed that almost daily, information was shared through one-on-one
Microsoft Teams discussions. However, the interviewees were asked for solutions on how
to defuse this problem. Many respondents think the general tips channel to the intranet
would be good solution, where everyone can share their own work-related problems and
issued at a low threshold. Previous challenging issues or questions would also be easily
stored on the channel, which also allows new employees to find solutions on the intranet
easily. As previously mentioned, Web 2.0 tools, such as discussion channels, allow
employees to openly communicate with each other and add content to an intranet,
improves the knowledge sharing and aims to engage users with the intranet (Kim, 2009).
Therefore, such a discussion section should be implemented in the intranet by subject area
under different departments, so that it is also easier to retrieve information in the right
place and the intranet remains systematic.

76

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

In addition, informing and receiving information were clarified, as the staff felt that
enough information is not shared on work-related matters. As Denner and Diaz (2013)
stated, the most significant benefit of intranets is that it keeps employees updated (Denner
& Diaz, 2013) and according to Gillis (2011) companies use their digital platforms to
inform, educate and amuse their employees (Gillis, 2011, p. 219). Therefore, interview
examined when informing would be at good level and whether staff have solutions to this.
As the most popular solution to this problem, the news channel of the intranet that would
be located immediately to the front page, arose. From this news channel, all employees
of the company will immediately see the latest work-related changes and information.
While, this research has been accomplished, informing within the company has already
improved, between questionnaire results and interviews. The company has introduced
regular meetings among teams on a weekly basis, where the most important work-related
things are going through under the direction of a team manager. It was also mentioned in
the interview that the main issues of the meetings would be good to assemble in the
intranet news section, so that those who could not attend the meeting can easily inspect
current affairs. Accordingly, the news section should also be implemented in the intranet
under both departments, as well as collectively on the front page for the whole company
to be reported. Those elements are important qualities on the intranet considering
knowledge sharing as Tiirikäinen (2010) stated that key goal with these solutions is to
share knowledge throughout the organization (Tiirikäinen, 2010, pp. 53–56).

6.1.3 Knowledge use and utilization
The study also explored the use of information, where the most important finding was
that information retrieval should be easy. It is recognized by Kietz et al. (2002) that with
the increase in the amount of information, the accessibility of knowledge and information
retrieval has become more important in many organizations (Kietz et al. 2002). At the
moment, information retrieval is not so easy, because the knowledge storing of the
company is not at a good level and needs an improvement for which solutions were
mentioned above. It is also important that the search features of the intranet are important
and should be implemented to the intranet to make information retrieval efficient. Most
of the information retrieval tools just like search engines and directories are designed to
help the information retrieval to be easy (Dumais et al., 2003). The main problem in
terms of the use of information which was found through the analysis of the survey data

77

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

reveal that the information available is not perceived to be current, the interview results
also showed the similar pattern, as many interviewees also indicated that they wanted
such problems to be solved. The interview also examined whether the problem was
caused by external or internal factors. The interview did not find a clear answer to this,
either, where the problem might come from. Two of the interviewees told that they were
not aware that this was being experienced. While interviewees reported the problem
caused by both internal and external factors, gave the majority, software instructions as
an example, which are external factors. The intranet built into Microsoft SharePoint helps
with this problem in a way that the files stored there indicate the latest modification date
in the file folder as it has the ability to trace content generated by other users (Terek, 2013
p. 5). There are also different tools in the intranet that provides the finding the origin of
the knowledge as well as for finding the person behind it (Fichter, 2005). Consequently,
when people use the information, they can easily inspect when the file has been edited,
in this case they will also see if the information is updated in a timely manner. In addition,
the updating of the intranet in the future plays also an important role in this case, for
which the study also sought solutions, which have been outlined later in the next
paragraph.

6.1.4 Intranet
The questionnaire was used to determine the desired qualities of the intranet and results
obtained allowed us to locate many great ideas for the implementation project. For
example, directory for rules and guidelines were hoped for as well as bulletin boards to
inform the important affairs of the company. Hopes for various message boards were also
evident in the interviews regarding communicating and sharing knowledge. All of these
wishes are easy to execute with Microsoft SharePoint, as it is truly a diverse platform that
gives many opportunities as it is customizable for various needs (McKenna et al., 2011).
As mentioned above, the intranet is aimed at collecting all the rules and guidelines relating
to work, so the staff’s wishes regarding of directory, are fulfilled. The greatest worry for
the intranet rose about who will be maintaining and updating the intranet. This was also
examined in the interview and the following solutions were found to the problem. Each
of the interviewees told that the people responsible for the updating should be appointed
and for both, financial management and payroll, should have their own updaters. On this
issue, the management team of the company also agreed with the results, and the updaters
78

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

initially selected team leaders from both departments. When updaters are selected among
employees, it can be ensured that information on the intranet remains such that employees
genuinely benefit from it in their everyday work. In addition, they are best aware of the
problem encountered in their own work most frequently. Therefore, they can assemble
exactly the right kind of information on the intranet better than, for example, the
management team who do not work in these tasks, for which information gathered for the
intranet are for. This allows intranet also work as a platform for knowledge creation as
creating knowledge involves developing new content (Shen & Tsai, 2008). However, it
is important to provide extensive training of selected updaters once the intranet is
completed so that the update can be done without effort and the intranet will remain an
active and useful tool for the entire working community in the future.

6.2 Research questions
The first and most important research questions in this thesis was: What are the qualities
and information that the intranet should contain to make knowledge management as
efficient as possible? There were many answers to this question through the
questionnaire, as well as interviews that have been presented above. The results from the
thesis are also consistent with the previous studies of the benefits of the intranet as KM
support. For example, according to Edenius and Borgerson (2003) the intranet can be
considered a both a tool for KM and a strategic management tool, which connects
employees of an organization through its ICT into a single entity that generates and
integrates knowledge (Edenius & Borgerson, 2003). Especially the social elements of the
intranet such as discussion channels and collaboration platforms support knowledge
sharing greatly as Kim (2009) found on his research, which is in terms of KM, a precisely
essential process. Kim (2009) stated that these kinds of tools facilitate and improve
communication between employees and therefore improve knowledge sharing and
collaboration at the organizational level (Kim, 200). As a platform, SharePoint also
supports KM, as the platform works in the clous and files can be edited in collaboration
up to date, avoiding separate storage and intermediate steps, allowing KM to be efficient.
SharePoint as a platform has the potential to strengthen an organization’s knowledge
sharing and cooperation, which will enable an organization to be efficient in their KM
processes (Khumalo & Mearns, 2019). The supporting questions that are presented below,
to complement the main question. In addition to the main question, the study had four
79

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

supporting research questions, the first being: What kind of information do employees
need in their daily working tasks? This question was well answered with the help of
questionnaire results. The questionnaire was answered almost all the staff. In addition,
the survey results found what information is used by staff the least, which may not
therefore be so relevant to the intranet. The results made it easy to bring together the most
important information used in the daily working tasks. This question would have been
able to be studied even more widely, for example, with observation, but since it was a
supporting question in this thesis, it was not too widely explored.
The next supporting question was: What characteristics of the intranet would serve best
the collaboration and knowledge sharing among the employees? Answers to this question
were received both from the literature review and research results. Based on the results
of the research, the employees of the company were quite happy with the current situation
in terms of cooperation. According to Kalman (2003) intranets allow employees to
cooperate on business processes and by that generate value for the organization and that
is why intranet itself is a great tool for collaboration (Kalman, 2003). When it comes to
characteristics of intranet, the Web 2.0 tools precisely improves and facilitates
communication, collaboration and knowledge sharing among employees (Kim, 2009).
Especially in the result of the thesis, the desired channels of discussion that will be
implemented in the intranet, will serve greatly the cooperation of employees of the
company as well as in knowledge sharing. As the intranet will be implemented in
SharePoint, it has the variety of features that can be used for communication,
collaboration, and knowledge sharing (McKenna et al., 2011). Since the intranet will also
work along with the Microsoft Teams that is currently in great use, it will be easier to
share information and collaborate.
The next supporting question was: How can intranet be a part of knowledge
management? A comprehensive answer to this question was obtained through the
literature review, which also itemized the effect of the intranet in KM for various KM
processes. According to Buniyamin and Barber (2004), intranet is often the first step when
an organization begins to implement KM initiatives. Intranet as a knowledge management
tool is also a practical was to create and share knowledge within the organization, that the
members can benefit from (Buniyamin & Barber, 2004). Also, according to Coakes
(2006) portals, such as intranets, support the organizations KM processes (Coakes, 2006).
80

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

Intranet can be seen as an enabler of KM initiatives and provides a platform and a place
for the implementation of many KM processes within the organization (Gee & Holmes,
2001). Finally, the research question: How should information be organized into an
intranet to best serve the needs of the company? This question was answered in the
information architecture section of the literature review, but these were reinforced by the
detailed need of a case company through the research results. Information should be
organized inherently, making the complex clear and to make sure that users of
information can find their paths to knowledge easily (Wurman, 1996). According to
Wurman (1996) there are five ways to organize information and one of them is by
categories (Wurman, 1996), which is also used in organizing the case company’s intranet.
Suitable navigation elements are also essential when implementing the intranet, that all
the information can be easily found (McCloskey, 2014). The results of the thesis provided
a comprehensive understanding of how an enterprise intranet should be implemented
from an information architecture perspective. The interviews were used to provide an
even more detailed picture of what is the best way to organize the information of the case
company into the intranet. The result of this study provided the site map for the upcoming
intranet.

7 CONCLUSIONS
In this section, the conclusions will be made and answers to the research questions will
be presented. Finally, the limitations of this thesis are presented, and future research ideas
are proposed. In this thesis, the core aim was to understand the current situation of the
intranet of the company under investigation and examine what future situation is expected
from the employees. As such, through a mix-method approach, utilizing both survey
questionnaire and semi-structured interviews, this thesis contributes to the literature
through the following.
The main finding was that the intranet would not be made a company-wide archive in
which all the data are stored, as therefore it could become extremely confusing, and the
information would be difficult to exploit. The employees indicated that they want the
intranet to be a directory for the instructions and processes required by company
employees in their daily work duties. It was also an important subject, that the intranet
will be implemented as a social intranet to support collaboration and knowledge sharing.
Therefore, Microsoft SharePoint has already selected as a platform. SharePoint is a
collaborative platform (Weldon, 2012) that enables easy management of teams,
information storage and the use of management of business processes (Terek, 2013 p. 5).
SharePoint is also used for various purposes such as content management,
communication, knowledge sharing, and collaboration. It is also a fairly safe choice for
almost every organization because of it is customizable platform for different kinds of
needs (McKenna et al., 2011). The company operates Microsoft Teams already, which
is a social communication application. SharePoint and Teams are complementary for each
other, making the intranet a social entity that serves the needs of the company in all
aspects. In addition, due to the characteristics of SharePoint, the intranet built there also
serves the company’s KM processes. Absolutely important for the study as well as the
implementation of the intranet was that the outcome, the intranet, serves the processes of
company’s KM. This goal was reached through the choices made through the results of
the research and the future intranet will support the KM processes of the company.
In addition, the thesis received many solutions and ideas on what features to include in
the intranet so that it best serves the needs of the employees of the company. Moreover,

82

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

to implement the intranet, the thesis results yielded a great deal of information and tips in
general for storing information within the company that a company can take advantage
of. For example, when planning to archive for files that would not be included in the
intranet. Consequently, the results will also be increasingly more able to decode the
problem of storing the data in confusing order.
In terms of information architecture, the intranet was decided to implement by subject
matter, which follows the organizational structure of the company. Currently, Microsoft
Teams have already teams created that can easily be combined into a SharePoint intranet.
This allows files already shared in Teams to be incorporated into the intranet. The study
resulted in a sitemap for the intranet, see the Figure 22.

Figure 22: Site map for the intranet

Site map for the intranet was entirely constructed based on the findings raised in this
thesis. However, the navigation was desired to be kept simple, due to which the
information was divided into four sub-sites. Within these, however, information was
shared by topic area with a little more detail, which also facilitates information retrieval,
but not a confusing main menu. Under each of the four subsites, features that were

83

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

desirable, such as message boards, useful links etc. will be added. Give the current
situation of the company, where the information is in considerable disarray, the
navigation was desired to be kept simple in order to move this situation closer to the
desired situation. Based on the results of the study, the municipal division was not the
best possible, but it was nevertheless included in the intranet in order to bring in local
agreements as well. Under accounting, accounts payable and receivable, breakdown by
municipality will also be implemented. The structure of the site map was going through
with the management team, who unanimously agreed that with such a structure the
intranet will be implemented.
Considering theoretical contributions, this research provided a broad picture of how
intranet can function as part of the organizations KM processes. In itself, the results
obtained in this study may not be useful to other organizations, as this was a case study
in which the needs of the case company were examined in quite detail. That is why the
result may not be precisely generalizable. If the subject had been studied more widely
with a larger sample involving many organizations, the results could be increasingly
generalizable. However, each company’s own intranet need should be explored
individually since there are no general way to implement an intranet to organization.
However, for other organizations, this research may be useful in terms of practical
implication, as the framework and theories used in this thesis can be reproduced to meet
the needs of another company. Consequently, other organizations can utilize research
theories and framework of this study to explore their own organization’s situation on the
subject. However, practical benefits from this thesis arose for the case company.

7.1 Limitations and future research
This thesis was limited to the implementation of the intranet from a KM perspective,
which is why information systems and information architecture were dealt narrowly. Both
are important elements for the implementation of the intranet, but the thesis would have
become too broad if both had been thoroughly studied in this research. Regarding
information systems, only available technologies were briefly discussed in the study, as
the implementation platform of the intranet had been chosen to be Microsoft SharePoint
in the early stages of the research by the case company. As a result, it was not worthwhile
to incorporate different technologies too broadly into this study. However, various
84

Ida Pentikäinen: Implementation of the Intranet from a Knowledge Management Perspective – A Case Study

options were wanted to be mentioned briefly since the research might provide advice to
other implementors of the intranet in the future. The information architecture was studied
a little more in this research, although it bordered quite narrow too. Although one of the
outcomes of the research was aimed at obtaining a site map for the intranet, there were
quite a few of theory about information architecture. However, the subject was important
in terms of the implementation of the intranet, for which is why it was briefly included in
this study. In terms of KM, the study limited some of the KM processes outside of this
research. Only the KM processes that were essential to the intranet and were essential to
the organizational objective of the case company were included in the study. Knowledge
management is an established discipline, as such information was also found on more
processes than that was presented in this thesis. However, it made sense for this thesis to
narrow the subject down to specific processes, that the study would not become too broad.
The KM processes delimited outside of this study, may also benefit from the intranet, but
are not as relevant as those discussed in this study.
As a future research proposal, it would be good to look at how the intranet has been
deployed in the case company and whether it has improved the processes of the
organization’s KM and whether it has been helpful in the main problems of the company.
When intranet has been in use for an extended period, it would be interesting to
reimplement a similar questionnaire to compare the situation and see if the introduction
of the intranet has been beneficial to the company from a KM perspective. As another
further research proposal, one might suggest comparing the use and benefits of the
intranet of different companies from the KM perspective. Thus, the best possible solutions
for the implementation of the intranet could be found and collected to make the best
benefit it in terms of KM.

2. Appendix: Interview questions
1. How to find information from all the different channels to be assembled into an intranet
and how to motivate staff to transfer information e.g. from their own computer for
common use?
2. How should the information be arranged into an intranet to make it easy to find and
exploit? What does easy to use mean for you? When do you feel that there is too much
information and what is irrelevant information?
3. How often do you share information in discussions between two people e.g. in Teams?
How would you define information that would be good for sharing among all staff?
4. When do you think receiving information would be at a good level? How do you define
good level of receiving information and how often? Can you name solutions what should
be done, that receiving information would be perceived as good?
5. What do you believe is that information is not perceived as current? Do you feel this is
an internal problem or a problem arising from outside factors e.g. software instructions?
6. How do you think it can be verified that the information on the intranet remains reliable
and up-to-date? Who should take care of updating the intranet?
