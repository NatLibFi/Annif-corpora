Abstract
Acid sulfate soils (a.s. soils) are responsible for deteriorating water quality and invertebrate communities in
many rivers and small streams across Western Finland. Drainage of a.s. soils for both agriculture and forestry
is the main reason why many Finnish streams fail to achieve good status as stated in the European Water
Framework Directive (WFD). Many of the streams show signs of chronical acidity with low pH values, high
metal concentrations and low species richness. Especially sensitive species from the orders Ephemeroptera,
Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) are absent in acidic and highly metal-polluted streams. Individuals from the
genus Hydropsychidae (Trichoptera) often show stress symptoms of gill-, anal papillae- and catch-net
anomalies when subjected to circumstances with sublethal concentrations of metals and acidity. These
responses make invertebrates good bioindicators for pollution derived from a.s. soils. Eleven streams close
by or within the river Perhonjoki basin in Central-Western Finland were studied. These streams were mainly
low order (1st to 3rd order) small-sized streams. The aim of this study was to identify a.s. soil impact on small
streams across the river Perhonjoki catchment area, which included identification of chemical receptors and
the use of bioindicators in recipient waters. The hypothesis was that (1) streams below the highest Littorina
Sea level (8000 – 4000 BP) show physiochemical symptoms of a.s. soil pollution (2) which results in species
composition differences between polluted and non-polluted streams and (3) the frequency of
Hydropsychidae abnormalities is higher in polluted than non-polluted streams. Lowland (coastal) streams
differed from highland (above highest sea level) streams as having higher concentrations of sulfate and
aluminum, higher electric conductivity and often lower pH values. This proved that streams below the highest
Littorina Sea level show symptoms of pollution derived from a.s. soils. Species composition differed
significantly between a.s. soil-affected and non-affected streams, proving the hypothesis that a.s. soils alter
benthic invertebrate communities. The difference in species composition between lowland and highland
streams was apparent especially within Ephemeroptera species composition. Low- and highland streams did
not differ in Hydropsyche individual gill abnormality frequencies nor Hydropsychidae species composition.
Individuals of the genus Hydropsyche showed symptoms of gill abnormalities in both a.s. soil-polluted and
non-polluted streams. This result was unexpected and rejected the hypothesis that gill abnormalities occur
more often in a.s. soil-polluted streams.

Abstrakt
Urlakningen av syra och metaller från sura sulfatjordar (SSJ) orsakar försämrad vattenkvalitet samt problem

orsaken till att vattendragen i västra Finland inte uppnått god ekologisk status enligt Europeiska unionens

dessa till utmärkta bioindikatorer i drabbade vattendrag. I denna avhandling undersöktes elva vattendrag
både inom och i nära anslutning till Perho ås avrinningsområde i mellersta Österbotten. Största delen av
vattendragen var småvattendrag (första till tredje ordningens vattendrag). Målsättningen med
undersökningen var att identifiera hur SSJ påverkar vattendrag inom Perho ås avrinningsområde.
Identifieringen utfördes genom att undersöka kemiska receptorer i vattendragen samt genom att tillämpa
bottendjur som bioindikatorer. Hypoteserna för undersökningen var (1) att vattendragen under
Littorinahavets högsta kustlinje (8 000 – 4 000 år sedan) visar symptom av påverkan från SSJ, vilket (2) syns
som skillnader i bottendjurssammansättningen mellan påverkade och opåverkade vattendrag och (3) att
frekvensen av gälskador hos Hydropsyche-nattsländor är högre hos individer i påverkade vattendrag.
Resultaten av undersökningen förstärkte hypotesen att vattendrag nedanom den högsta kustlinjen är
påverkade av SSJ. Halten av sulfat och aluminium var högre, konduktiviteten var högre samt minimi-pH var
oftast lägre i kustnära vattendrag. Artsammansättningen i de påverkade vattendragen skilde sig signifikant
från opåverkade vattendrags, vilket förstärkte hypotesen om skillnaderna i bottendjurssammansättningen.

Sammanfattning
Sulfidbärande sediment samt problem med sura sulfatjordar finns runtom i världen. Största utbredningen av
sura sulfatjordar i Europa finns i Finland. I Finland finns största delen av sura sulfatjordar runt Österbottens
kustområde, där den intensiva landhöjningen har höjt upp järnsulfider (FeS och FeS2), som ursprungligen
sedimenterats i forna havsmiljöer. I naturliga förhållanden är sura sulfatjordar vattenmättade under
grundvattennivån, men torrläggningen av sura sulfatjordar för jord- och skogsbruk sänker grundvattennivån,
vilket orsakar oxidation av sedimentets järnsulfider. Oxidationen av järnsulfider sänker markens pH-värden
och mängder med skadliga metaller frigörs från markens mineraler. Urlakningen av syra och metaller från
sura sulfatjordar orsakar försämrad vattenkvalitet samt problem hos vattendragens organismer. Urlakningen
av syra och metaller är största orsaken till att vattendragen i västra Finland inte uppnått god ekologisk status
enligt Europeiska unionens vattenramdirektiv. Många drabbade vattendrag visar tecken på kronisk
försurning, med låga pH-värden, höga metallhalter och försämrad mångfald bland evertebrater. Speciellt
känsliga arter från ordningarna Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera och Trichoptera saknas i svårt drabbade
vattendrag. Individerna i familjen Hydropsychidae (Trichoptera) visar ofta symptom på gälskador, anomalier
i analpapiller samt anomalier i fångstnät vid exponering till höga metallhalter och lågt pH. Effekterna av
metallexponering på bottendjur gör dessa till utmärkta bioindikatorer i drabbade vattendrag.
I denna avhandling undersöktes elva vattendrag både inom och i nära anslutning till Perho ås
avrinningsområde i mellersta Österbotten. Vattendragen som undersöktes inom Perho ås avrinningsområde
är Åivobäcken, Hömossadiket, Kainobäcken, Tastulanoja, Saarivedenoja, Lammasoja, Kaihianoja, Kivioja,
Puro och Penninkijoki. Korplaxbäcken (finska Korpilahdenoja) rinner bredvid Perho å, men dess vatten
mynnar rakt ut till Bottenviken norr om Perho å. Korplaxbäcken är en av de största bäckarna i området, vilket
är orsaken till att bäcken blev vald med i undersökningen. Vattendragen i undersökningen är i huvudsak
småvattendrag med mindre än 100 km2 stora avrinningsområden. Penninkijoki skilde sig från andra
vattendrag genom att dess avrinningsområde är större än 100 km2. Penninkijoki blev vald med i
undersökningen på grund av dess stora orörda myrområden utför bra referens för områden med liten
mänsklig påverkan.
Målsättningen med undersökningen var att identifiera hur sura sulfatjordar påverkar vattendrag inom Perho
ås avrinningsområde och samtidigt undersöka om Hydropsyche-nattsländelarver är lämpliga bioindikatorer
för påverkan av sura sulfatjordar i småvattendrag runt Perho ås avrinningsområde. Hypoteserna för
undersökningen var (1) att vattendragen under Littorinahavets högsta kustlinje (8 000 – 4 000 år sedan) visar
symptom av påverkan från sura sulfatjordar, vilket (2) syns som skillnader i bottendjurssammansättningen
mellan påverkade och opåverkade vattendrag och (3) att frekvensen av gälskador hos Hydropsychenattsländor är högre hos individer i påverkade vattendrag.

Mats Willner
Identifieringen av påverkan från sura sulfatjordar utfördes genom att undersöka kemiska receptorer i
vattendragen samt genom att tillämpa bottendjur som bioindikatorer. Vattenprovtagning utfördes på hösten
2018 och våren 2019. Från proven analyserades pH, konduktivitet, aciditet, halten metaller, halten sulfat och
totala halten organiskt kol. Bottendjursprovtagningen utfördes hösten 2018 med sparkhåvsmetoden.
Provtagningen utfördes genom att kombinera tre parallella 30 sekunders prov från varje provplats. I mån av
möjlighet bestämdes arterna ned till art- eller släktnivå, men vidare jämförelser av totala
artsammansättningar mellan provplatserna utfördes på familjenivå.
Resultaten av undersökningen förstärkte hypotesen att vattendrag nedanom den högsta kustlinjen är
påverkade av sura sulfatjordar. Konduktiviteten samt halten av sulfat och aluminium korrelerade signifikant
med höjden över havet. Konduktiviteten samt halten sulfat och aluminium var signifikant högre i kustnära
vattendrag. Minimi-pH var oftast lägre i kustnära vattendrag, vilket bevisades med en svag men signifikant
korrelationen mellan pH och höjden över havet. Artsammansättningen i de påverkade vattendragen skilde
sig signifikant från opåverkade

vattendrags, vilket

förstärkte

hypotesen om

skillnaderna i

bottendjurssammansättningen. Skillnaderna i bottendjurssammansättningen var speciellt synliga inom
Ephemeroptera-artsammansättningen. Sura sulfatjordspåverkade vattendrag innehöll flera individer från
familjen Beatidae. Opåverkade vattendrag hade däremot mindre individer från familjen Beatidae och flera
individer från familjen Leptophlebiidae. Det förekom inga skillnader i Hydropsyche-arters artsammansättning
och gälskador hos Hydropsyche-individer framkom både i påverkade och opåverkade vattendrag. Således
förkastades hypotesen om skillnaderna i frekvensen av gälskador hos påverkade och opåverkade vattendrag.
Hydropsyche-arter kan anses som bra bioindikatorer i småvattendragen inom avrinningsområdet för Perho
å. Arterna är känsliga för metaller och sura förhållanden, vilka är typiska för sura sulfatjordspåverkade
vattendrag i nedre delen av Perho å. Hydropsyche-arter saknades i många opåverkade och påverkade
vattendrag, vilket

försvårade

jämförelsen

av vattendragen. Det vore

intressant

att

utföra

exponeringsexperiment med Hydropsyche-arter i vattendragen där arten saknades i undersökningen.
Exponeringsexperimenten skulle ge oss mera information om faktorer som påverkar Hydropsyche-arters
utbredning och känslighet för metaller.
Problemen från sura sulfatjordar, med höga metallhalter samt låga pH-värden, korrelerar normalt med högt
vattenflöde i vattendragen. Hela år 2018 och våren 2019 var extremt torra i området, vilket orsakade torka
och lågvattenflöde i många av de undersökta vattendragen. Bristen av högvattenflöde i de undersökta
vattendragen ledde till situationer där metallhalter och pH-värden var bättre än normalt i vattendrag
påverkade av sura sulfatjordar. Dessa onormala förhållanden minskade skillnader mellan påverkade och
opåverkade vattendrag. Förhållanden under år 2018 och våren 2019 har varit optimala för oxidationen av
sedimentets sulfider. Därmed är sannolikheten mycket stor för en metall- och surhetschock under nästa

Mats Willner
högvattenflöde. Det är viktigt att repetera undersökningen efter följande surhetschock. Resultatet från
denna undersökning fungerar som en bra referens för förhållanden före den förväntade surhetschocken.

1 Introduction
Acid sulphate soils (a.s. soils), largely found around coastal areas in western Finland, are highly responsible
for deteriorating water quality in many Ostrobothnian streams. Oxidation of iron sulfides (FeS and FeS 2)
through human activities (for example drainage of forest- and farmland) has caused raised metal
concentrations, raised electric conductivity (EC), raised sulfate concentrations and lowered pH values in
recipient streams (e.g. Åström & Åström 1997; Åström & Björklund 1995). Deteriorating water quality has
led to poor hydro-chemical conditions for in-stream biota. A combination of high metal concentrations and
low pH values has caused problems for many sensitive species. Many Ostrobothnian rivers suffered from
severe acidity between the years 2006 and 2007. This was due to a warm and dry summer in 2006, which
was followed by heavy rainfall in the autumn. Severe acidity led to large fish deaths in many rivers. The extent
of the events was so huge that it caught the attention of mainstream media and showed the urge for new
practices within water and acid sulfate soil management.
In Finland, leaching of metals from acid sulfate soils is calculated to be a larger source of metal pollution to
water courses than that of industries combined (e.g. Sundström et al. 2002). The extent of metal loads and
acidity from a.s. soils is the main reason to why streams in western Finland have not reached the goals stated
in the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Some of the affected rivers and lakes are well
documented and there are many studies that describe the fluctuation in their water quality (e.g. Toivonen &
Österholm 2011). However, it is problematic to assess the status of streams solely by monitoring
physiochemical water quality data. Impacts of contaminants are better shown by combining physiochemical
water quality monitoring with toxicological tests and observations on the in-stream biota.
High concentrations of iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) combined with low pH values have proved to be lethal
for many stream organisms. High concentrations of Fe combined with low pH (5–6) have proved to cause
damage to brown trout (Salmo trutta) gills and heighten blood glucose values (Peuranen et al. 1994). Lestijoki
river water, a river north of river Perhonjoki in Central Ostrobothnia, has shown to have a negative impact
on S. trutta osmoregulatory ability at their smolt-stage, lowering the fitness of individual trout (Soivio et al.
1998). Malte and Weber (1988) showed that rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) suffered from severe
respiratory stress and died subjected to artificially created soft water with low pH value (5.0) and high Al
concentration. These values are typically found in Ostrobothnian streams, which suggests that sensitive
salmonid species are absent in many rivers. Vuorinen et al. (1993) studied the combined effects of Al and pH
values on pike (Esox Lucius), whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus pallasi), pike perch (Stizostedion luciperca) and
roach (Rutilus rutilus). In their studies, they noticed that the higher the Al concentrations were, the more
toxic the water was at every pH value (ranging from 4 to 6). Their studies showed a direct correlation between
Al concentration and mortality. Their results indicated that pike is the most tolerant species and roach seems

1

Mats Willner
to be the most sensitive out of the four species in their study. Their results indicate that some of the rivers
in Ostrobothnia, which suffer from chronic acidity, might be completely empty of fish. However, compared
to highly mobile fish species, the less mobile stream invertebrates are even more sensitive to changing water
qualities. That is why they are perfect bioindicators and indicate differences in water quality not only
between streams, but also between different parts of a stream. Especially the abundance or absence of
different species of the caddisfly Hydropsyche is known to be good bioindicators for stream water quality
(e.g. Tolkamp & Highler 1983; Basaguren & Orive 1990; Vuori & Parkko 1996). Mayflies from the
Heptageniidae and Ephmerellidae orders are also shown to be sensitive to deteriorating water quality (e.g.
Rainbow et al. 2012; Awrahman et al. 2016). Invertebrates are important for benthic ecosystems. They
maintain ecosystem energy flows by converting organic material to prey items for larger consumers (Covich
et al. 1999). Absence of important key species can change energy flows, which can have devastating effects
on the whole ecosystem. This makes studies on invertebrate communities in polluted streams important.
Many studies focus on larger rivers and less is known about the smaller streams around the Perhonjoki river
catchment area, where the fluctuation in water quality is even larger than in recipient rivers. Especially
sensitive are the smaller streams whose entire catchment area is situated below the highest Littorina Sea
level (HSL). Many of these streams lack either water quality data, biological data or even both.
The aim of this thesis was to (1) gain more knowledge about water chemistry from the smaller streams
around the river Perhonjoki catchment area, (2) identify the extent of a.s. soil impact on these streams, (3)
obtain data of species composition especially with emphasis on the composition of EPT-species
(Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera & Trichoptera-species) and (4) identify the suitability to use Hydropsychidae
(Trichoptera) larvae as bioindicators in these small streams.
The hypothesis for this study was (1) streams below HSL (approximately 100 m above sea level to date) suffer
from pollution, derived from drainage of a.s. soils. This should be noticeable from high EC values, high metal
concentrations, low pH-values and high sulfur concentrations in lowland (below HSL) streams. The difference
in water quality between lowland and highland (above HSL) streams should result in (2) differences in species
composition. Sensitive species from the orders Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera should be more abundant in
non-polluted streams compared to polluted streams. Lowland streams should also show (3) a higher
frequency of tracheal gill abnormalities on Hydropsychidae larvae compared to streams higher up in the
system.

2 Background
2.1.1. The formation of sulfide-bearing sediments
Rickard (2012) comprehensively describes the formation of sulfide-bearing soil sediments, which are formed
under anaerobic conditions, where sulfate-reducing microbes (SRM) metabolize organic material from sea
water in the presence of iron-containing minerals. Sulfate is an easily soluble salt that commonly occurs in
seawater. Sulfate-reducing microbes use sulfur (S) from sulfate (SO4) instead of oxygen (O) as their electron
acceptor in their metabolism. For example, lactate is oxidized in SRM by the following reaction:
2 CH3CHOHCOO- + 3 SO42- = 6 HCO3- + 3 HS- + H+
The reduction of sulfate to sulfide, through SRM activity, can be expressed by the reaction:
SO42- + 10 H+ + 8 e- = H2S + 4 H2O.
As shown above, the metabolic activity of anaerobic sulfur-reducing microbes makes the formation of
sulfides possible in marine environments. The produced sulfides (H2S or HS-) react with iron to produce
precipitates of iron sulfides. Metastable FeS is commonly Mackinawite (FeSm), which is a widespread mineral
in low-temperature aqueous environments. FeS does not precipitate easily in average seawater nanomolar
total dissolved Fe concentrations. Precipitants are usually found in environments where the total
concentration of dissolved Fe(II) is higher than normal. The formation of FeSm can be described with the
following simplified reaction between Fe(II) and S(-II):
Fe2+ + H2S -> FeSm + 2H+
This reaction is also influenced by iron-reducing prokaryotes in the sediment column, which resemble SRM
in their microbial activity, but use Fe(III) as their electron acceptor. The most common sulfide mineral on the
earth’s surface is the stable mineral Pyrite (FeS2), which is also known as fool’s gold. The solubility of the
cubical pyrite mineral is very low in neutral pH conditions. Precipitation of pyrite is a complex series of
possible pathways, due to which precipitation of pyrite minerals can occur. Pyrite can precipitate through
e.g. these reactions with FeSm:
Reaction 1
FeSm + H+ -> Fe (II) + HS- (step 1)
Fe(II) + S2(-II) -> FeS2 (step 2)
FeSm + H+ + S2(-II) -> FeS2 +HS-

3

Mats Willner
Reaction 2
FeS + H2S -> FeS2 + H2

In reaction 1, the metastable iron sulfide fully dissolves to Fe(II) and HS-, when reacting with H+. The formed
iron-ion react with the sulfide ion to produce pyrite and sulfide. In reaction 2, the metastable iron sulfide
reacts with hydrogen sulfide to produce pyrite and hydrogen gas. Both reactions eventually give rise to pyrite
iron sulfide (FeS2)

2.1.2. Sulfide-bearing sediments in Finland
The formation of sulfide sediments was intensive at the Littorina Baltic sea phase (8000–4000 BP). In that
period, the sea went through a phase of post-glacial relatively organic-rich brackish water. This is seen from
black iron sulfide deposits around the Finnish coast. Sulfide-bearing sediments in Central-Western Finland
are composed of silts, clay and sand, with silts being the most common sediment size (e.g. Åström &
Björklund 1997). Clay sediments are composed of the minerals of weathering rocks in the region. Deng et al.
(1998) showed that phyllosilicates from acid sulfate soils around Petalax in Ostrobothnia consisted mainly of
micas, kaolinites, chlorites and vermiculites. K-feldspars, quarts and amphiboles were also present in the
samples. The majority of metals increase in concentration, when moving from coarser material (sand and
silt) to clay. Many toxic metals (e.g. Al) are bound in their mineral structures in various types of phyllosilicates.
Åström and Björklund (1997) also showed that Al, Fe, K, Mg and Zn are the most abundant metals associated
with acid sulfate soils. The concentration of metals was twice as high in their samples compared to finefraction non-acid sulfate soil sediments in the same area.

2.1.3. From sulfide sediment to acid sulfate soil
Iron sulfide sediments are neutral in their natural waterlogged state, but they do possess the ability to
become acid, because of their sulfide concentration. These unoxidized sediments are usually called potential
acid sulfate soils. Pyrite (FeS2) is a stable molecule under reduced conditions submerged below the
groundwater table. Human activities, such as drainage of farmlands and peatland forests, lowers the
groundwater table, which enables atmospheric oxygen to react with sulfidic sediments. This reaction starts
a complex weathering process. Weathering of pyrite is slow in pH neutral conditions, and it takes some time
for the process to accelerate. The process is often catalyzed by acidophilic bacteria, which Wu et al. (2013)
found in Risöfladan a.s. soil area close to Vaasa, suggesting that the temperature is high enough for

4

Mats Willner
acidophilic bacterial growth in Ostrobothnian soils during summer. The oxidation of pyrite and monosulfides
leads, finally, to the formation of iron hydroxides (Fe(OH)3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Simplified oxidation
reaction for hydrolysis of iron, monosulfides and pyrite are (van Breemen 1973 in Österholm 2005):
Fe3+ + 3 H2O -> Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ (at low pH)
4 FeS + 9 O2 + 10 H2O -> 4 Fe(OH)3 + 4 H2SO4
4 FeS2 + 15 O2 + 14 H2O -> 4 Fe(OH)3 + 8 H2SO4

The formation of these severe acids lowers the pH value in poorly buffered oxidized soil horizons. pH values
drop from neutral (7–8) to less than 5 in the oxidized zone and rise back to neutral in the unoxidized parent
material. Low pH values have been measured in a.s. soils all around Central-Western Finland (e.g. Wu et al.
2013; Åström & Björklund 1997; Åström 1998; Palko & Yli-Halla 1990; Joukainen & Yli-Halla 2003).
Acidification of the soil increases the solubility of metals such as Al, Cu and Zn from soil minerals (e.g. Palko
& Yli-Halla 1990). The produced cocktail of acidity and soluble metals is washed out with drainage water and
effect water quality in recipient streams. Acid sulfate soil drainage water has been shown to have high
concentration of sulfate, low pH, high electric conductivity and high concentrations of metals (e.g. Bärlund
et al. 2005). Nystrand et al. (2012) showed that there is a difference in metal composition between low order
a.s. soil-affected streams and non-affected streams in South-Western Finland. Metals, such as aluminum
were mainly found dissolved in stream water, whereas non-affected rivers and streams had aluminum bound
in particle or colloidal form, which were derived from erosion of clay soils. Even if metal concentrations were
high in non-affected streams, the metals were in particle form, which are less bioavailable and harmful for
stream biota. The fact that metals are mainly found in dissolved form in a.s. soil-impacted streams together
with low pH values is what makes a.s. soil drainage extremely toxic.

2.1.4. Acid sulfate soils in Finland
The largest areas of acid sulfate soils in Europe are found in Finland. Palko (1994) estimated that there are
around 336 000 ha of acid sulfate soils in Finland, of which most of them are found around the Gulf of
Bothnia. Some estimates only calculate the extent of acid sulfate soils on agricultural land and uses different
international criteria of soil taxonomy (e.g. Yli-Halla et al. 1999). The total area of acid sulfate soils in Finland
is much greater than those estimates, which was also suggested by Beucher et al. (2015). Their studies
showed that the previous estimates of acid sulfate soil occurrence were wrong, and a more detailed mapping
was necessary. New knowledge about acid sulfate soil sediments has changed our understanding of the
problems occurring in different sediment types. Traditionally, acid sulfate soils have been categorized as fine5

Mats Willner
grained sediments of sulfide-bearing silt and clay, but recent studies show that also coarse sand sediments,
with bad buffering capacities, might be potential acid sulfate soils (e.g. Mattbäck et al. 2017).
Åström and Björklund (1997) analyzed 317 samples from the Quark area in Ostrobothnia and found that the
median sulfur concentration was 0.54% and the maximum concentration found was 1.78%. However, they
pointed out that some of the sites were heavily oxidized, which means that some of the sulfur might have
leached from the sediment, lowering the concentration of sulfur in their study. Åström (1998) showed that
the sulfur concentration greatly changed between the oxidized and reduced zone. The oxidized zones had
sulfur concentrations between 0.04% and 0.46%, whereas the transition zones (between oxidized and
reduced zone) had sulfur concentrations between 0.6% and 2.1%. Even if the sulfur concentration in
Ostrobothnian acid sulfate soils is quite low compared to tropical areas, they have the potential of causing
serious acidity, due to poorly buffered soils in the region.
Due to rapid post-glacier land uplift (approximately 8 mm/year) in Ostrobothnia, Central-Western Finland,
these sulfide-bearing sediments can be found far away inland, below the highest Littorina Sea level
(approximately 100 m above sea level to date). Due to flat topography around the Gulf of Bothnia, these
sediments have been covered with peat, which has naturally raised the ground water level and prevented
sulfide oxidation. These sulfide-bearing sediments are naturally neutral (pH around 7), when left in their
natural waterlogged state. Extensive land use after the Second World War started the massive acidification
of streams in Central-Western Finland (Åström et al. 2005). It began with intensive drainage of peatland for
forestry in the 1950s, when ditches where dug through the peat layer down to the mineral soils, exposing
sulfide-bearing sediments for atmospheric oxygen. The soil profile from a drained peat-covered forest in
Central-Western Finland has typically a thin peat layer, followed by an oxidized (grey) layer of acid sulfate
soil, ending in the unoxidized dark monosulfide-bearing sediment (Fig. 1). The drainage of forest was most
intense between the 1950s and the 1970s and only small new areas are drained at present, but maintenance
ditching is common in the area even to date.

peat layer (approximately 0.5 m), followed by an oxidized a.s. soil layer (grey). New maintenance ditching has revealed
unoxidized sulfide-bearing parent sediment (black) underneath the oxidized layer. Picture from Kiimakorpi at
Hömossadiket catchment area, Nedervetil, Finland.

Farmlands were traditionally drained by open ditches in small patches. These patches were badly suitable for
large modern equipment, which led to the use of subsurface drainage pipes. Installation of subsurface
drainage pipes started to intensify in the 1960s and many formerly open ditch farmlands were transformed
to subsurface drainage. This trend has continued to the present day. Subsurface drainage pipes are more
effective at draining farmlands compared to the traditional open ditch system and the effects of drainage
pipes have shown to exceed down to depths of 2 m (Joukainen & Yli-Halla 2003). Lowering of the ground
water table, due to both open ditch and subsurface drainage, has enabled atmospheric oxygen to penetrate
down to deeper sulfidic layers, starting the oxidization process of sulfides in the sediments. Österholm and
Åström (2002) showed that Rintala area in Southern Ostrobothnia had agricultural acid sulfate soils with
distinctive zones in soil profiles. The uppermost zone was the plough layer (depth 0–35 cm), followed by the
acidic zone (depth 35–140 cm), which was followed by the weakly acidic transition zone (depth 140–170 cm)
and ending in the parent material (depth > 170 cm). The soil profile was divided into different zones according
to changes in pH values. The pH value dropped from > 4.5 in the limed plough layer to < 4.5 and rose again
slowly in the transition zone. The pH value rose again to above 6 in the parent sediment. Using old redox
potential and pH measurement data Virtanen et al. (2017) showed that also soil type affect oxidation depth.

Coarser silt and sandy soils enable atmospheric oxygen to penetrate more easily to deeper depths compared
to finer clay soils.

2.2.1. Perhonjoki river in C-W Finland
The river Perhonjoki has its sources in the highlands of Suomenselkä area between the regions of Central
Ostrobothnia and Central Finland, in the municipalities of Perho, Kyyjärvi and Kivijärvi, where it collects its
waters from small headwater lakes. These lakes are situated approximately 200 m above sea level. The river
has a catchment area of 2524 km2 and a length of 160 km from headwater lakes out to the Baltic Sea a few
km north of the town of Kokkola. The topography is flat, which is typical for Ostrobothnia. The flat river
valleys are covered with layers of peat and the waters are normally dark colored and slightly acidic from
humic acids.

2.2.2. Water quality in river Perhonjoki
Water quality in the lower parts of the river shows seasonal and annual variations. Water acidity and metal
concentrations fluctuate heavily. The cause of these fluctuations in the lower parts of the river (especially
below 40 m above sea level) is heavy land use on areas with acid sulfate soils. As a result, sulfur
concentrations are low in the upper river system around the municipalities of Kaustinen and Veteli,
whereafter they rise towards the estuary. Periods of severe acidity has been a problem in the lower parts of
the Perhonjoki river. The years 2006 and 2007 were especially problematic. A warm dry summer, followed
by heavy rainfall, led to a sudden drop in pH values in the autumn of 2006. pH values fell below 5.0 and the
lowest measured pH value was 4.4 in the Perhonjoki river. At the same time, the pH value dropped in nearby
Såkabäcken (a 105 km2 large stream in the lower part of the Perhonjoki river catchment area) to even as low
as below 4.0 for three months in a row. This severe period of acidity led to a widespread fish death and it
took several years for the river to recover. Similar drops in pH values for lower parts of the river have been
measured in the years 1974, 1976, 1996 and 1997, when pH values fell below 5.0 (e.g. Airiola et al. 2016).
Acid sulfate soils divide the river into two distinctive halves. Vuori monitored the water quality of the lower
and upper parts of the river in 1997. The average pH value for the lower part of the river was 6.0 (n = 8) and
the minimum measured pH value was 4.8. The pH value dropped even lower a bit upstream below a wellknown acid stream called Hömossadiket. The measured pH value was as low as 4.5. The average pH value
higher up in Karjalankoski (Veteli) was 6.4 (n = 8) with a lowest pH value of 6.1 (Fig. 2). Aluminum
concentration was on average 358 µg/l (n = 8) in Karjalankoski and 837 µg/l in the lower part of the river.
Maximum aluminum concentration was 1980 µg/l close to the estuary and even higher below Hömossadiket
8

Mats Willner
(4190 µg/l). The highest measured aluminum concentration was only 470 µg/l at Karjalankoski. Similar
differences between the upper and lower parts of the river can be seen also with other metal concentrations
(Vuori 2002).

Fig. 2. pH values at three sites in the Perhonjoki river from July to November 1997. The sites are estuary (below
Hongabäcken), lower reaches in Kokkola (below Hömossadiket) and Karjalankoski (Veteli). pH values (y-axis) dropped
at the estuary and the lower parts of the river to below 5.0, whereas Karjalankoski remained above 6.0 through the
entire monitoring period. Graph made from data obtained by Vuori (2002).

Data from Vuori (2002) show a distinctive pattern regarding water quality in the Perhonjoki river. pH values
fluctuate more in the lower part of the river compared with Karjalankoski, where the fluctuation in 1997 was
minimal. Acid streams affect the water quality by lowering pH values and raising metal concentrations in the
river. Low pH values and high metal concentrations occurred in autumn, when heavy rainfall raised water
levels, flushing acid water to the river from smaller streams. The effect of smaller streams on the Perhonjoki
river water quality is enormous, which make studies of these small streams important. Better knowledge of
these acidic small streams will give us more knowledge about the hazards that affect the lower parts of the
river.

2.3.1. Invertebrates as bioindicators
Invertebrates are considered excellent bioindicators because of their sedentary life, which makes them
vulnerable to changes in water quality through their lifecycle. They dwell in the bottom of streams and
9

Mats Willner
seldom move for a long distance. However, some species have been reported to drift downstream when the
water quality has changed for the worse (e.g. Ormerod et al. 1987; Raddum & Fjellheim 1987). McLay (1968)
studied streams at the South Island of New Zealand. Results from his studies showed that drifting of
invertebrates peaked usually after floods and at nighttime. This means that invertebrates can colonize and
disperse to a new area close by their original site.
Invertebrates are often used to assess impact of metals on in-stream biota in laboratory experiments, in situ
toxicity experiments and field collections from locations using standardized methods of invertebrate
sampling. Laboratory experiments usually consist of aquariums with manipulated stream water (e.g.
Awrahman et al. 2015; Ruuth 2017). In situ toxicity tests involve transportation of target species from
unpolluted streams to polluted streams, where individuals are usually put in constructed cages and anchored
to the bottom substrate. They are then left exposed to the polluted stream water for a short time period.
Examples of in situ toxicity tests are found in e.g. Lepori & Ormerod (2005) and Kowalik & Ormerod (2006).
Field collection is usually carried out with a semi-quantitative kick-net method at stream rifles. This method
is commonly used in e.g. assessing stream ecological status in the European Water Framework Directive.
More information on the methodology for using kick-net sampling can be found in e.g. Heino et al. (2002)
and Mykrä et al. (2006). Qualitative invertebrate sampling has also been used in some instances to collect
invertebrates from streams (e.g. Lenat 1988). In both cases the caught individuals are counted, and the
species composition gives a good indication of the stream quality at the target location. Other field collection
experiments are focused on one or few specific target species, where collected individuals are for instance
analyzed for their bioaccumulated metals (e.g. Awrahman et al. 2016). The targeted species are often chosen
from the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera or Trichoptera. These so-called EPT-species are good
bioindicators and their abundancy and composition are often used in assessing e.g. the impact of land use
on stream ecology (e.g. dos Reis Oliveira et al. 2019 article in press).

2.3.2. Hydropsychidae ecology
Caddisflies from the family Hydropsychidae live their larval stage in the stony bottom of rivers and streams,
where many of them build a silken net to filter food particles from the water surface. Because of this netspinning habit, they are also called net-spinners (Badcock 1976). They ingest fine particulate organic matter
(FPOM) as their primary food, which they filter from the water. FPOM is a broad variety of different food
sources that consist e.g. of algae, particles derived from breakdown of larger particles (e.g. leaf and
branches), feces, bacteria etc. (e.g. Allan & Castillo 2007; Hutchens Jr. et al. 2017).
Hydropsyche larvae go through five instar stages, before they go through a pupae stage and emerge as adults.
Andersen & Klubnes (1983) studied the life history of two Hydropsyche larvae (Hydropsyche siltalai and
10

Mats Willner
Hydropsyche pellucidula) in a West Norwegian river. Their results indicated that both species completed their
life cycle within a year. However, the species differed in both timing of the pupae stage and their instar stage
under the winter months. Hydropsyche siltalai went through the winter as fourth instar larvae, whereas H.
pellucidula went through the winter months as fifth instar larvae. Hydropsyche pellucidula emerged as pupae
from May to end of July, whereas H. siltalai emerged as pupae in July and August. Their findings indicate that
H. pellucidula individuals are larger in autumn and winter months compared to H. siltalai individuals. Similar
results with differences in larvae sizes between overwintering Hydropsychidae species has been reported in
e.g. Hildrew and Edington (1979).
Hydropsychidae species are nearly identical in their feeding habit and lifecycle, indicating heavy competition
between species. Even though their niche seem identical, different species have been observed coexisting in
streams. Malas and Wallace (1977) showed that different species of net-spinning Trichopteran larvae
coexisted in different parts within a stream. Some species are more abundant on the upper side of stones,
whereas some thrive underneath the stones. Their results also indicated that species differed in their stream
water velocity preferences. Hildrew and Edington (1979) showed that H. pellucidula and H. siltalai coexist in
the river Usk in Wales. However, there was a significant difference in current velocity preferences between
species. Hydropsyche siltalai was mainly found at faster flowing rapids, whereas H. pellucidula was also found
in pools with calmer water.
Hildrew and Edington (1979) also showed that H. pellucidula and H. siltalai diets consisted of higher plant
material, filamentous algae and bryophyte fragments. However, H. pellucidula differed from H. siltalai by
having also ingested larger animal parts. Hildrew and Edington suggested that this difference in dietary
composition was due to size difference between these two species in autumn months. Larger individuals
construct larger nets, which are capable of catching larger food particles. Wallace (1975) reported that there
was a difference in capture-net mesh opening size and ingested food-particle type and size between three
North American Hydropsychidae species. Food particle size correlated with the sizes of capture-net mesh
sizes.
These small but significant differences between species make it possible for different species to coexist.
However, these small differences can give rise to different species thriving at different locations, which can
result in a zonation of Hydropsychidae species within a stream system. It has been shown that different
stretches of small streams and larger rivers have their own characteristic species. Different species thrive in
different locations depending on stream width, velocity and bottom substrate. For instance, H. saxonica
thrives in smaller faster running waters of the first-order and H. siltalai is predominantly found in larger
streams and rivers in areas with hilly topography. Hydropsyche pellucidula is found in many types of streams
and rivers. Hydropsyche pellucidula often occur together with other Hydrospyche species, such as H. siltalai,

11

Mats Willner
but H. pellucidula is often found further downstream, because of its capability to tolerate slower current
velocities. Hydropsyche angustipennis is often found in different sized lowland streams. Hydropsyche
angustipennis is resilient to low oxygen values and pollution, and is sometimes found also in stagnant water.
Hydropsyche angustipennis is sometimes found together with other Hydropsyche species, such as H.
pellucidula and H. siltalai. However, H. angustipennis is a more typical lowland species and is seldom found
in streams higher up in the river system (e.g. Tolkamp & Higler 1983; Basaguren & Orive 1990; Badcock 1976).

3.3.3 Hydropsychidae as bioindicator for metal pollution
Trichopteran caddisfly larvae of the taxonomic family Hydropsychidae can be found in all types of running
waters. Hydropsychidae larvae have tracheal gills on their abdomen, which eases the identification of these
species. Easily visible gills make Hydropsychidae caddisflies interesting species for biomonitoring acid and
aluminum rich waters. Hydropsyche larvae have been used to assess pollution levels in metal polluted
streams around the world. Poor water quality has shown to induce abnormalities in larval tracheal gills (e.g.
Vuori & Parkko 1996), abnormal anal papillae (e.g. Vuori 1996) and abnormalities in larval constructed nets
(e.g. Vuori 2002). Laboratory studies (e.g. Awrahman et al. 2015) and field studies (e.g. Rainbow et al. 2012)
conducted on Hydropsyche species show accumulation of metals in larval tissues, which cause stress and
abnormalities in sub-lethal concentrations (e.g. Ruuth 2017; Vuori & Kukkonen 1996). Hydropsyche tissue
metal concentrations have shown to correlate negatively with Ephemeroptera species abundancies (e.g.
Rainbow et al. 2012; Awrahman et al. 2016). Vuori (1993) showed that Al and Fe concentration in
Hydropsyche larval tissue correlated with stream metal concentrations. Vuori and Kukkonen (1996) showed
that the Al concentration was significantly higher in individuals with gill abnormalities compared to healthy
individuals.
Accumulation of metals on and in Hydropsychidae larvae follows various ways. Vuori (1993) reported that
iron flakes coated aquatic moss and larvae in acidic streams. Vuori and Kukkonen (1996) showed that Fe
accumulated on larvae, but molting led to lowered larval Fe concentrations. Lower larval Fe concentrations
after molting proved that most of the Fe accumulated on the larval surface. Vuori (1996) pointed out that Al
might have caused darkening of anal papillae through an increase in accumulation of Al3+-ions in anal papillae
epithelial cells and that Al usually form milky aluminum hydroxides on gill tuffs, which was also noticeable in
his study. Vuori (1993) showed that larval Fe and Al concentrations correlated positively with water metal
concentration. The same correlation was not observed for other metals such as Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd. This
difference could be achieved by different ways of accumulation. Differences in accumulation between Fe and
Al compared to other metals could be caused by the fact that Fe and Al react with tissues on the larval surface.
Other metals could accumulate e.g. through ingestion. Ingestion of metal-contaminated food have shown to
12

Mats Willner
raise Hydropsyche larval metal concentrations. Awrahman et al. (2015) showed that Hydropsyche larval As
and Ag concentrations rose when ingesting labeled As and Ag food particles. Vuori and Kukkonen (1996) also
reported that levels of Cd and Cu concentrations were in fact higher after molting than before molting. This
means that Cd and Cu are most likely bound to tissues in the larvae after ingestion of metal particles.

3 Materials and methods
3.1 Study area
Fifteen locations in eleven different streams were studied in this thesis (Table 1). Streams were scattered
across or close by the river Perhonjoki catchment area in Central Ostrobothnia, Finland (Fig. 3). All except
one stream were located within the river Perhonjoki catchment area. Korpilahdenoja is a small stream
running near river Perhonjoki draining its waters straight to the Baltic Sea north of the town of Kokkola.
Korpilahdenoja is, however, considered part of the same Perhonjoki/Kälviänjoki river system, situated
between river Perhonjoki and river Kälviänjoki. Korpilahdenoja is one of the largest lowland brooks in the

area and that is why it was chosen for this study. All except one of the streams chosen are small (low order
streams with catchment areas ≤ ~100 km2). The exception is river Penninkijoki, which is located at the higher
reaches of the river Perhonjoki catchment area. Penninkijoki was chosen for comparison because it runs high

13

Mats Willner
up in the system above the highest sea level in a fairly pristine environment. Higher reaches of river
Penninkijoki is also quite small and the river size resembles some of the smaller streams studied in this thesis.

altitude, situation towards HSL and approximate coordinates (ETRS-TM35FIN). *Kainobäcken
and Viitavesibäcken are part of the same stream but the name changes midstream from Kainoto Viitavesibäcken. **Tastulanoja and Kalavedenoja are part of the same stream but the name
changes to Kalavedenoja above lake Tastulanjärvi.

Sites 1–11 were situated within the limits of HSL and sites 12–15 were situated above HSL. The sites ranged
in altitude from < 5 m to approximately 165 m. The distance between the lowest site (site 1: Korpilahdenoja)
and the highest site (site 15: Penninkijoki) was approximately 80 km. A straight cross-section of the
topography in the study area shows a steady rise in altitude from coast (site 1) to inland areas (site 15; Fig.
4)

3.2 Water quality data
Water samples were collected on three occasions (twice in autumn 2018 and once in spring 2019) from all
fifteen sites. pH-values and conductivity were measured from all sites at all occasions. Metals, sulfate and
total organic carbon (TOC) were analyzed from all sites twice in autumn 2018. Metals were also analyzed
from ten selected sites in spring 2019. pH values and conductivity were analyzed in laboratory with handheld
pH/conductivity meter. Metals were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Sulphur concentrations were
analyzed at Åbo Akademi University Department of Organic Chemistry with ion chromatography (IC). TOC
was analyzed using Shimadzu TOC-V CSN.

3.3 Invertebrate sampling
Invertebrate sampling was conducted between 25th and 27th September 2018 in all the fifteen sites with a
kick-net sampler with a mesh size of 0.5 mm. Three parallel samples were collected from all sites. Normally,
the number of parallel samples should be four, but the streams were small, and it was difficult to find four
similar and intercomparable sites from all the study sites. For that reason, only three parallel samples were
collected from all sites consisting of two samples from areas with small to medium-sized substrate and one
from areas with larger substrate and boulders.
Samples were collected by kicking the substrate in front of the kick-net for thirty seconds and moving
approximately 1 m upstream during that time. Collected material was sieved through a sieve with the mesh
size of 0.5 mm and transferred to a sealed plastic container with the volume of 0.5 L. All larger branches and
pebbles were thoroughly washed in the sieve before thrown away to ensure that as many invertebrates as
possible where collected in the sample. The samples were then preserved in 70% ethanol for further analyses.
The species in the samples were analyzed, and individuals were counted under a microscope. Individuals
were determined down to species level, if possible, using taxonomical literature. However, many of the
species were difficult to determine with certainty, because of insufficient identification literature and time.
Therefore, individuals are determined to family levels in this thesis. Individuals from the classes Oligochaeta
and Nematoda were left out of the analyses. Individuals of the caddisfly Hydopsychidae were determined to
species level using identification keys from Vuori (2002). Small and difficult-to-determine individuals were
determined as juvenile Hydropsyche and were left out from further analyses.

3.4 Trichoptera Hydropsychidae analyses
Different caddisfly species from the family Hydropsychidae were given values according to their tolerance
toward pollutants (Table 2). Values ranged from one (1) to four (4), where one was the value for tolerant
species and four the value for sensitive species. Values for the species were taken from Vuori (2002).
Table 2. Different sensitivity values for different Hydropsyche species ranging from 1 to 4. H. angustipennis is the least
sensitive species with the lowest value (1). H. pellucidula is more sensitive with a value of 2. H. saxonica and H. siltalai
are the most sensitive species and both are ordered sensitivity value 4. Values collected from Vuori (2002).

A sensitivity value was given by calculating the mean value of the sum of all individuals and species for all the
sites.

𝑛(𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑠 ∗ 1) + 𝑛(𝑝𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑢𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑎 ∗ 2) + 𝑛(𝑠𝑎𝑥𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑐𝑎 ∗ 4) + 𝑛(𝑠𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑖 ∗ 4)

Sites with mainly tolerant species were given a low value, whereas sites with mainly sensitive species had a
higher value. Values from each site were used in further analyses to compare stream Hydropsychidae
communities.
Gill abnormalities were studied from every Hydropsychidae individual under microscope (Fig. 5). All
individuals were classified according to healthy (no gill abnormalities), slightly abnormal (at least one of the
gills reduced or damage in gill tuffs) and abnormal (severe darkening/reduction of gills and gill tuffs). Only
individuals with severe darkening were used in further analyses and calculations. The Hydropsychidae gill
abnormality value was determined by calculating the percentage of individuals with severe abnormalities in
the sample.

abnormalities with darkened and reduced gill tuffs. The individual to the left was categorized as
“healthy”, whereas the individual to the right was categorized as “abnormal”.

3.5 Statistical analyses
Water quality and taxonomical data showed non-normal distribution with some outliers. The data was
analyzed statistically using Spearman’s rank correlation test, NMDS with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity test and
Mann-Whitney U-test (Wilcoxon in R). Due to small sample size, only maximum and minimum concentrations
were used in the analyses. The study sites were divided into two groups according to their maximum sulfate
concentration. The sites grouped within “Low” sulfate group had maximum sulfate concentrations of
approximately < 3.5 mg/l. The sites grouped within “High” sulfate group had all maximum sulfate
concentrations > 10 mg/l. The median sulfate concentration in Finnish streams is 3.5 mg/l (Lahermo et al.
1995). That is why the maximum sulfate concentration of approximately 3.5 mg/l was chosen as a divider
between these two groups.
The species composition was compared between high- and low sulfur concentration stream sites. The stress
of NMDS models was checked and kept under 0.1. An ANOVA was used on the NMDS model variances to
ensure that the model plots represented real data. The ANOVA of model variances compared with actual
obtained data variances had a p-value > 0.05 indicating that model plots did not differ significantly from real
data. The species composition was illustrated by conducting a Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA)
over found species for each site. DCA is often used in ecology to illustrate patterns or differences between
species composition at different sites or habitats. More information about the use of DCA is found in e.g.
Parnell and Waldren (1996) and Garono et al. (1996). All the analyses except DCA were performed with R
(version 3.6.1.).

4 Results
4.1 Water quality
Water quality in the study area remained decent at most of the sites through the entire study period.
However, there was a small drop in pH values and a rise in metal concentrations and EC in spring 2019,
especially at the lowland streams. Minimum pH values ranged from 4.1 to 6.5, maximum EC ranged from 31
to 328 µS/cm, maximum Al concentration ranged from 65 to 3617 µg/l, maximum TOC ranged from 11 to 42
mg/l and maximum sulfate concentration ranged from 0.72 to 23.32 mg/l in the studied streams. The lowest
sulfate concentrations were measured at sites above HSL, whereas the highest sulfate concentrations
occurred at sites close to the coast. The highest aluminum concentrations were also found at lowland streams
below HSL. The lowest minimum pH values were measured at sites below HSL, but sites such as
Viitavesibäcken, Kainobäcken and Tastulanoja had minimum pH values > 6.0, even though they are situated
below HSL. Maximum sulfate concentration showed a clear divide between high altitude (above ~ 90 m) and
low altitude (under ~ 90 m) streams and the sites are divided into low or high sulfate concentration according
to their maximum sulfate concentration. TOC values did not show any pattern between altitude, and the
concentration varied both below and above HSL (Table 3).

Table 3. The results from water quality analyses. Results are shown in maximum (SO4, EC, Al and
TOC) and minimum (pH) values. Site grouping (high or low) according to sulfate concentration is
also shown in the table.

Water quality analyses showed a strong correlation (p < 0.001, rS = -0.81) between altitude and maximum
sulfate concentration (Fig. 6) and with altitude and maximum aluminum concentration (p < 0.001, rS = -0.87).
Both sulfate- and aluminum concentrations dropped with increasing altitude. There was a significant
18

Mats Willner
correlation (p < 0.001, rS = -0.89) with the maximum EC value increasing with decreasing altitude and a weak
but significant correlation (p = 0.024, rS = 0.58) between rising altitude and increasing minimum pH value.
There was a strong correlation with maximum sulfate concentration and maximum aluminum concentration
(p = 0.001, rS = 0.76) and with maximum sulfate concentration and EC (p < 0.001, rS = 0.861). Both maximum
aluminum concentration and EC rise with a rising maximum sulfate concentration. However, there was no
significant correlation (p = 0.228, rS = -0.33) between maximum sulfate concentration and minimum pH value.

meters (x-axis). The sulfate concentration decrease with increasing altitude (p < 0.001***, r S = 0.81).

4.2 Species composition and Hydropsyche abnormalities
Stream riffles are inhabited with a varying range of different invertebrates. These invertebrates are divided
into different classes of taxonomical levels ranging from species to families and from families to orders etc.
Caddisflies e.g. could be ranked at different taxonomical levels from species to kingdom: species =
Hydropsyche siltalai, genus = Hydropsyche, subfamily = Hydropsychinae, family = Hydropsychidae,
superfamily = Hydropsychoidea, order = Trichoptera, class = Insecta, phylum = Arthropoda and finally
kingdom = Animalia. This study shows species at species level (only from the genus Hydropsyche), family level
and on order level.
Thirteen different taxonomical orders (Table 4) were obtained from the sites in this study (excluding
individuals from the classes Oligochaeta and Nematoda). The counted individuals were from the orders
Arhynchobdellida, Coleoptera, Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera, Hygrophila, Isopoda, Littorinimorpha,

19

Mats Willner
Megaloptera, Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Veneroida. The most diverse order was Diptera which
included individuals from nine different families. These families were Athericidae, Ceratopogonidae,
Chaboridae, Chironomidae, Empididae, Pediciidae, Simuliidae, Tabanidaea and Tipulidae. The order
Trichoptera was almost as diverse as Diptera with individuals found from eight different families. These
Trichoptera families included individuals from Hydropsychidae, Hydroptilidae, Leptoceridae, Limnephilidae,
Phryganeidae, Polycentropodidae, Psychomyiidae and Rhyacophilidae. Other orders had individuals from
only one or a few families.
Chironomidae (Diptera) was the most abundant family, with 5484 counted individuals. Chironomidae larvae
dominated the species composition at six locations. These locations were Penninkijoki, Kivioja, Puro,
Lammasoja, Tastulanoja and Åivobäcken. Nemouridae (Plecoptera) was the second most abundant family in
this study with 4467 counted individuals. Nemouridae larvae dominated the species composition at seven
locations. These locations were Kaihianoja, Korpilahdenoja site 1 and site 2, Viitavesibäcken, Hömossadiket
site 1 and site 2 and Kainobäcken. Polycentropodidae (Trichoptera) larvae dominated the species
composition at Kalavedenoja and Simuliidae (Diptera) were the most abundant species family in
Saarivedenoja. Viitavesibäcken had the most counted individuals, whereas Åivobäcken had the fewest
counted individuals in this study. Hydropsychidae larvae were found only at seven locations. These were
Penninkijoki, Kalavedenoja, Korpilahdenoja site 1 and site 2, Tastulanoja, Viitavesibäcken and Kainobäcken.
NMDS (Nonmetric Multi-Dimensional Scaling) showed that there was a significant (F = 2.904, Df = 14, p =
0.029) difference in species composition on order level between streams with low sulfate concentration
compared to streams with high sulfate concentration (Fig. 7a). Further analyses of EPT taxonomical groups
showed that there was a significant (F = 16.271, Df = 14, p = 0.004) difference in Ephemeroptera species
composition between high- and low maximum sulfate concentration streams (Fig. 7b). However, there was
no significant difference in Trichoptera and Plecoptera species composition between the grouped streams.
The results indicated that Ephemeroptera communities differed significantly within Beatidae (Z = 78.947, W
= 42, p = 0.010) and Lepthophlebiidae (Z = -78.947, W = 3, p = 0.010) species composition (Fig. 8). The streams
with high sulfate concentration had a significantly higher abundancy of Beatidae individuals compared to low
sulfate streams, whereas low sulfate streams had more abundant Lepthoplebiidae populations.
The detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) show a distinctive grouping of sites corresponding with
altitude (Fig. 9). The eigenvalue for AX1 was 0.414 and 0.120 for AX2 meaning that AX1 and AX2 combined
explains more than 50 % of the variance between sites. The streams with high sulfate concentration tend to
group to the left side of the graph, the streams just below and above 100 m altitude group in the middle,
whereas Penninkijoki is situated far to the right. Taxa such as Heptageniidae, Perlodidae, Leptophlebiidae and
Hydroptilidae are found far to the right in the graph, whereas Nemouridae, Beatida and Simuliidae are found

20

at the opposite side. The result from DCA suggest that these taxa do not thrive in the same locations because
of differences in environmental preferences.

Hydropsyche larvae were found only at seven locations with only one individual found at Viitavesibäcken
brook. The Hydropsyche species consisted of H. angustipennis, H. pellucidula, H.saxonica and H. siltalai. Small
and hard-to-identify young larvae were placed under juvenile Hydropsyche larvae (13 individuals in total).
The most common species was H. pellucidula (128 observed individuals), which was found at all locations
except Kalavedenoja. Hydropsyche pellucidula was the most common species of Hydropsyche at
Korpilahdenoja (site 1 and site 2), Kainobäcken, Viitavesibäcken and Penninkijoki. Hydropsyche siltalai was
observed at four locations and was the second most counted species with 75 individuals. Most of H. siltalai
individuals were found at Kalavedenoja, where the species was the only Hydropsyche species identified.
Hydropsyche angustipennis was found at all locations except Viitavesibäcken and Kalavedenoja. It was the
third most counted Hydropsyche species with a total of 65 individuals. Hydropsyche saxonica was the scarcest
Hydropsyche species with only 11 counted individuals found at Korpilahdenoja, Kainobäcken and Penninkijoki
(Table 5).
The frequency of gill abnormalities varied between 0 and 13% of the counted individuals at different sites.
The highest frequency of individuals with abnormal gills was found at Korpilahdenoja, whereas all the
individuals at Viitavesibäcken, Tastulanoja and Penninkijoki were healthy. The difference in gill abnormality
frequencies between sites with low sulfate concentration compared to sites with high sulfate concentration

was non-significant. Hydropsyche species sensitivity values ranged between 1.5 and 4.0 within sites. The
difference in sensitivity values was small and non-significant between sites. There was also no significant
difference between Hydropsyche species composition at high- and low sulfate concentration streams.

5. Discussion
Year 2018 was exceptionally dry in the area, which led to drought especially in the higher reaches of the river
Perhonjoki catchment area. Spring 2018 (March, April and May) was especially dry with only an average of
27.2 mm precipitation per month in Halsua and 19.7 mm precipitation per month in Kaustinen. The average
monthly precipitation in spring between the years 2010 and 2017 has been 56.7 mm for Halsua and 53.7 mm
for Kaustinen. The same trend continued through the summer of 2018, with Halsua receiving approximately
10 mm less precipitation per month than normal. Precipitation for Kaustinen was lower than normal in the
months of June and July, but the area was hit by heavy thunderstorms in August, raising the precipitation to
above average for the summer months of 2018. Autumn (September, October and November) continued
exceptionally dry in the region. The average precipitation in Halsua was 46.4 mm per month and only 39.1
mm per month in Kaustinen. These are much lower compared to the average autumn precipitation between
the years 2010 and 2017. The average monthly autumn precipitation in Kaustinen has been 52.3 mm and
55.7 mm in Halsua (FMI 2019).

5.1 Water quality
The drought led to situations were only a low baseflow was noticeable, especially in streams around the
Halsua area. This led to problems with water quality monitoring and one of the planned samplings for autumn
2018 was conducted in the following spring 2019. Problems with water quality in acid sulfate soil-affected
streams are usually noticeable under high flows, when leached metals and sulfuric acid wash out to the
streams (e.g. Toivonen et al. 2019). Acid sulfate soil-affected streams in Central-Western Finland usually
show signs of severe chronical or seasonal acidity (pH often below 5.5), high EC, and high metal

25

Mats Willner
concentrations (e.g. Roos & Åström 2005; Åström & Björklund 1996; Åström 2001; Saarinen et al. 2010). The
lack of high flow occasions during the monitoring period made identification of acid sulfate soil impact on
streams more difficult. The water quality in acid sulfate soil-affected streams was unusually good with lower
metal concentrations and higher pH values in autumn 2018 than expected. This was due to the lack of high
runoff episodes that usually occur in spring and after autumn rainfall. However, there was a significant
correlation with sulfate concentration, aluminum concentration and EC rising towards the coast. The EC value
increased from ≤ 50 µS/cm at locations with altitude above 85 m to ≥ 100 µS/cm at locations below the
altitude of 85 m. These EC values are low compared to e.g. Åström & Björklund (1996), who measured median
EC values as high as 490 µS/cm (n = 130) under high autumn water flow in small streams draining the Munsala
river basin. Even if the EC values are lower in this study, they do differ between high and low altitude streams,
indicating a shift in acid sulfate soil occurrence at the altitude of approximately 85 m above sea level.
Sulfate is a highly soluble and conservative ion in water, which makes sulfate concentration a good indicator
of acid sulfate soil-impact on stream water quality. Lahermo et al. (1995) monitored 1167 sampling sites and
concluded that the median sulfate concentration in Finnish streams was 3.5 mg/l. The shift in sulfate
concentration correlated well with the highest sea level of the Littorina Baltic Sea phase. All the locations
with high sulfate concentration (above 3.5 mg/l) were situated below the highest shoreline, which indicates
that sulfate has leached from acid sulfate soils, raising maximum sulfate concentration in coastal streams.
This is especially apparent in streams that have a larger proportion of acid sulfate soils within their catchment
area. Similar results have been obtained in earlier studies, where sulfate concentration rose with rising
proportion of acid sulfate soils within stream catchment area (e.g. Beucher et al. 2015). Because of its
persistent nature, sulfate concentration tends to increase also downstream within streams. This was
noticeable in this study, where maximum sulfate concentration rose downstream within e.g. Kaino- and
Viitavesibäcken stream.
Metals, such as aluminum, are highly enriched in streams affected by acid sulfate soils (e.g. Lahermo et al.
1995). A maximum aluminum concentration >1000 µg/l was only measured in Åivobäcken and Hömossadiket
(site 2). High metal concentrations in these two small streams are well reported from earlier studies. Tolonen
(2002) measured extremely high concentrations of aluminum in both Åivobäcken and Hömossadiket.
Åivobäcken had an aluminum concentration of 12 300 µg/l (autumn 1997) and the aluminum concentration
at Hömossadiket was 4 960 µg/l (autumn 1997). In this study, aluminum correlated significantly with the
maximum sulfate concentration and with decreasing altitude. However, there were streams that had low
concentration of aluminum, even if the sulfate concentration was high. The difference between
Viitavesibäcken and Hömossadiket is a good example. The maximum aluminum concentration was 236 µg/l
and maximum sulfate concentration was 15.17 mg/l at Viitavesibäcken. Hömossadiket (site 2) had a
maximum aluminum concentration of 1116 µg/l and a maximum sulfate concentration of 15.25 mg/l. Even if
26

Mats Willner
the sulfate concentrations are almost identical, there is a significant difference in aluminum concentration
between the two streams. The difference in aluminum concentration is due to differences in pH values.
Viitavesibäcken had a minimum pH value of 6.3, whereas Hömossadiket (site 2) had a minimum pH value of
5.2. The difference in pH values between these two streams is something that have been noticed in previous
studies, with pH values seldom dropping below 5.5 in Viitavesibäcken, whereas pH values drop below 5.0
every year at times with high water flow in Hömossadiket (Willner unpublished). Aluminum is known to be
pH dependent and form soluble Al3+-ions under acidic conditions. However, soluble aluminum tends to form
insoluble hydroxysulfates, when mixed with water that has a higher pH value (e.g. Bigham & Nordstrom
2000). Acidic and metal-rich drainage water may form metal precipitates when mixing with more neutral and
well-buffered water in Viitavesibäcken, keeping the metal concentration low compared to other streams in
the area. This is something that needs more investigation in the future.
The minimum pH values ranged from 5.8 to 6.5 in low sulfate concentration streams, with average combined
minimum pH being 6.0 (n = 6). The minimum pH values ranged from 4.1 to 6.3 in high sulfate concentration
streams and the average combined minimum pH value for these streams was 5.5 (n = 9). Only Åivobäcken
showed signs of severe acidity, with the pH value dropping to 4.1 in spring 2019. It is well reported that pH
values usually drop in autumn after heavy rainfall in small streams heavily affected by acid sulfate soils (e.g.
Åström & Björklund 1996). The small streams near the coast in this study are no exception, and as earlier
mentioned, the pH value usually drops below 5.0 during high flows in Hömossadiket. Tolonen (2002)
monitored e.g. Åivobäcken and Hömossadiket streams between the years 1997 and 2000. In his studies, pH
values dropped as low as 4.1 in Hömossadiket (autumn 1997) and 3.9 in Åivobäcken (autumn 1997). This
dramatic drop in pH values did not occur in autumn 2018, but did so in Åivobäcken in spring 2019.
The absence of high flow occasions during the monitoring period has surely affected the results. Water
quality was decent in the studied streams compared to e.g. acid sulfate soil-affected streams within the
Munsala river basin in Åström & Björklund (1996). However, there is a significant difference in maximum
metal concentrations, minimum pH values, maximum sulfur concentrations and electric conductivity
between lowland and highland streams. Even if the data set is small, and the pH values mostly stayed on
decent levels, annual fluctuations must have a negative impact on invertebrates in the studied streams. This
should be visible from the invertebrate data, which make invertebrates important bioindicators of acid
sulfate soil-impact especially at times without high flows. Combining invertebrate data with water quality
data should give a good picture of the most affected streams around the river Perhonjoki basin.

5.2 Effects on invertebrate communities
Small streams within the river Perhonjoki region are home to many invertebrate species. Heino et al. (2002)
showed in their studies that streams within the river Perhonjoki ecoregion are mainly dominated by
shredder- and filter-feeders (Hydropsychidae and blackflies). These are invertebrates that normally dominate
small-sized (first to third order) streams in the area. A change in species composition could be the result of
many factors that affect invertebrate communities. It is good to bear in mind that this survey covered a large
area with different stream types with complex problems due to human activity in both low sulfate (nonaffected) and high sulfate (acid sulfate soil-affected) streams. These problems are often caused by multi
stressor effects (e.g. Sundermann et al. 2013; Tolkkinen 2015). These stressors are a combination of e.g.
water quality, land use and habitat deterioration. Habitat deterioration is easily observable around lowland
areas of the Perhonjoki river catchment area, where low reliefs have resulted in deeply dug channelized
streams to enable cultivation of arable land. The upper reaches of the river system have been channelized
and drained for e.g. timber floating and drainage of peatlands for forestry. Drainage and channelization of
streams have made stream habitats more homogenous and the loss of vegetation cover has been huge. This
is especially noticeable from moss cover in lowland streams. Sites that totally lacked moss cover was
Åivobäcken, Hömossadiket (site 1 and 2), Korpilahdenoja (site 1 and 2) and Kainobäcken. All these sites were
located below 40 m above sea level. Viitavesibäcken had sparse moss cover and all the rest had varying but
significant cover of moss. Moss is an important factor shaping benthic communities. Koljonen et al. (2012)
reported that leaf retention was lowest in channelized artificial streams without moss cover. The addition of
moss significantly enhanced leaf retentiveness. Muotka and Syrjänen (2007) had similar results in their study.
Their results indicated that moss cover was an important factor influencing leaf retention in boreal streams.
Their results also indicated that channelized streams (or streams without moss cover e.g. after restoration)
have a higher abundancy of scraper- and filter-feeders compared to shredder-feeding invertebrates, that are
more abundant in more pristine streams. They implied that this difference could be because stones without
moss are readily colonized by algae, which are used as food source for scraper- and filter-feeders. However,
a low leaf retention results in scarce food resources for shredder-feeders, tilting the abundancy in the favor
of scraper- and filter-feeders. That is why the absence of especially filter-feeders such as Hydropsychidae or
Simuliidae in studied streams could indicate a change in normal species composition due to poor water
quality.
There was a significant difference in species composition comparison between high- and low sulfate streams.
A closer examination of the EPT-species showed that there was a significant difference in Ephmereoptera
species between these two groups. The lowland streams with higher sulfate- and metal concentration were
dominated by Baetidae species while Leptophlebiidae dominated in the streams with low sulfate
concentration. This result was surprising, because e.g. Baetis rhodani is well known for drastically increasing
28

Mats Willner
mortality and stress at low (< 6.0) or very low (< 5.0) pH values (e.g. Andrén & Eriksson Wiklund 2013;
Gerhardt 1990; Willoughby 1988; Ormerod et al. 1987). Willoughby (1988) suggested that B. rhodani might
tolerate acidic circumstances if the water had a high ionic load, but B. rhodani was usually absent in streams
with a pH value below 5.2. Results from Gerhardt (1990) indicate that Lepthoplebiidae would not be as
sensitive toward a change in pH value, with Leptophlebia marginata showing no significant signs of changes
in larvae survival with changing pH values and Cd stress. Gerhardt (1992a) showed that Leptophlebia
marginata endured extremely acid (pH 4.5) conditions, but a combination of high iron concentration and low
pH raised mortality rates at the end of a 30-day experiment. Leptophlebia marginata has proven to be more
tolerant to Cd stress compared to Beatis rhodani in a laboratory experiment using both static- and flowthrough systems (Gerhardt 1992b). Gerhardt (1995) reported that L. marginata individuals suffered from a
change in ion balance (loss of Cl- and K+) when exposed to Cd. This led to inactivity and eventually death.
Gerhardt also showed that Fe crusted on the larvae gill surface and in the gut membrane, leading to
decreased food consumption and to starvation. Interestingly a high Fe concentration showed to counteract
with Cd lowering the uptake of Cd in larvae. Even if Leptophlebiidae species are more tolerant to acidity,
they do however show symptoms at low pH values. Gerhardt et al. (2005) reported that Choroterpes picteti
(Leptoblebiidae) showed apparent symptoms at pH ≤ 5.0. Their results indicated that plain acid was worse
than a combination of acid and acid mine drainage (AMD). From earlier studies, one could expect that
Beatidae species would be absent or less abundant in acidic streams. It is good to remember that Beatidae
is a large family consisting of both sensitive and tolerant species. All the Beatidae species found at Åivobäcken
brook was of the species Cloeon dipterum, which is known to be one of the most tolerant Beatidae species
(e.g. Lock & Goethals 2011). However, Beatidae species did thrive in lowland streams such as Korpilahdenoja
(site 2) and Viitavesibäcken. These sites have proven to be less polluted by acid sulfate soils compared to
other sites in the area (e.g. Hömossadiket). The nutrient-rich water, open farmland areas and low moss cover
make these sites optimal for algae growth. This could be the reason to why Beatidae inhabited these sites in
such large numbers.
The Ephemeropterans Heptageniidae were only found at three locations. These findings consisted of 29
individuals at Penninkijoki (1.6% of the total abundancy), seven individuals (< 0.5% of the total abundancy)
at Korpilahdenoja (site 2) and only one individual (< 0.1% of total abundancy) at Kainobäcken. It is difficult to
draw any conclusions regarding Heptageniidae abundancy because of the small data set. The Heptageniidae
individuals were found at locations with heterogenous bottom substrate size (mixture of small pebbles and
larger rocks/boulders) and higher than average water velocity in the study area. Heptegeniidae larvae usually
live at riffles, where they scrape algae fixed on rocks or organic surfaces (e.g. Merritt et al. 2017). The DCA
showed that Heptageniidae species grouped to sites with higher pH value, lower sulfate concentration and
low aluminum concentration. Rainbow et al. (2012) reported that Heptageniidae species were absent or
29

Mats Willner
scarce where a Cu concentration in H. siltalai exceeded 170 µg Cu per g larval weight. This threshold
concentration is much lower compared to a similar threshold concentration for Beatidae species (≥ 1000 µg
Cu per g H. siltalai larval tissue in e.g. Awrahman et al. (2016)). Comparing results from this study with their
results would imply that Heptageniidae individuals were absent or scarce in many lowland streams because
of high metal bioavailability. More research is needed to rule out other factors, such as poor habitat as the
main constraining factor shaping Heptageniidae communities at lowland streams within the river Perhonjoki
catchment area.
There was no significant difference in Plecoptera species composition between the high- and low sulfate
streams in this study. Rosemond et al. (1992) studied acidic streams in the United States and showed that
there was no significant correlation between Plecoptera communities and pH nor aluminum. Findings from
this study strengthen the idea that Plecoptera species are more tolerant to low pH than many other taxa.
However, their studies did show a negative correlation with decreasing pH and a rising aluminum
concentration on Trichoptera species. Results from this study did not show any significant difference
between Trichoptera species in low- and high sulfate streams. This result was unexpected and contradict
with earlier research. However, there was a noticeable difference in Hydroptilidae species abundancy
between sites. Hydroptilidae individuals were found only at two locations (Penninkijoki and Korpilahdenoja
site 2). The abundance of Hydroptilidae was as high as 17.4% at Penninkijoki, whereas only two individuals
could be found at Korpilahdenoja (site 2). There was also a slightly noticeable pattern within Psychomyiidae
abundancies. Psychomyiidae larvae were found in both high- and low sulfate streams. Not a single
Psychomyiidae larva was found at Hömossadiket nor Åivobäcken streams. Trichoptera abundancies were low
at these two streams compared with other streams. Even though the abundancies of Trichoptera species was
low at these two sites, other streams with high sulfate concentration had many Trichopteran individuals. This
difference within group made comparison of Trichopteran assemblages difficult between high- and low
sulfate streams.
Species from the Trichopteran Hydropsychidae were found at Penninkijoki, Kalavedenoja, Tastulanoja,
Viitavesibäcken, Kainobäcken and both sites at Korpilahdenoja. Four different Hydropsyche species were
found in this study. The species H. angustipennis, H. pellucidula, H. siltalai and H. saxonica. H. angustipennis
were found at all locations except Viitavesibäcken and Kalavedenoja streams. Hydropsyche pellucidula was
found at all above-mentioned streams except Kalavedenoja. Hydropsyche siltalai was found at four locations
and it was the only Hydropsychidae species found at Kalavedenoja. Hydropsyche siltalai was also found in
Penninkijoki, where its abundancy was approximately 11% of the entire Hydropsychidae population.
Hydropsyche siltalai abundancy of Hydropsyche populations were approximately 15% at Kainobäcken and
only under 3% at Korpilahdenoja (site 2). Hydropsyche saxonica was found at Korpilahdenoja (site 2),
Kainobäcken and Penninkijoki. Hydropsyche saxonica has been found at Tastulanoja in earlier studies of the
30

Mats Willner
stream (HERTTA 2020). However, no H. saxonica could be found during this study at Tastulanoja brook.
Distribution of Hydroppsyche species followed predicted patterns. Most of the lowland Hydropsychidae
species were H. angustipennis, which has been reported to be decently tolerant towards acidity and
aluminum (e.g. Vuori 1996). Hydropsyche siltalai was mainly found higher up in the catchment area, which is
in line with earlier research, where H. siltalai has been shown to decrease in lowland streams because of e.g.
higher temperature, higher nutrient load and slower current (e.g. Basaguren & Orive 1990; Tolkamp & Higler
1983). Hildrew (1977) reported that H. siltalai thrive on stones in moss cover and that there was a significant
positive correlation with H. siltalai abundancy with moss cover. However, the same correlation could not be
found with H. pellucidula in his study. Difference in H. siltalai distribution could be a result of differences in
acidity and aluminum concentration. Vuori (1996) showed that H. siltalai larvae were less tolerant to a
heightened aluminum concentration and low pH values compared to H. angustipennis. This difference in
sensitivity could well be the reason why H. siltalai is less abundant at lowland acid sulfate soil-affected
streams.
Hydropsyche larvae were unfortunately absent at many sites above the highest sea level. This made advanced
statistical analyses difficult between streams. It is difficult to pinpoint an exact reason to why Hydropsychidae
species were absent in these streams. However, it is notable that the Halsua area was strongly affected by
drought in the same year. This could be the reason for the disappearance of these species from the area.
Their absence could also be due to errors in sampling and/or coincidence. It is also possible that the larvae
were missed when sorting the material, as the small instar larvae are difficult to notice. This idea is supported
by other studies, such as Sundermann et al. (2008), who reported that there were differences between two
sites within the same stream, even though the sites were close to each other and almost identical in water
quality and structure. However, their studies showed that differences within a stream were subtler than
differences between two random streams. This subtle but significant difference led to a different species list
and different species abundancies within stream sites. They argued that the difference between site 1 and
site 2 could be the result of errors in sampling and spatial variability within a stream reach. Similar differences
in taxa have been showed to occur due to human errors in sorting and identification (Haase et al. 2006).
Mykrä et al. (2006) showed that there was a significant difference between the number of taxa caught with
kick-net sampling and the time used for sampling. Individuals from rare taxa were often absent when
sampling was conducted for a total time of 1 min. However, a prolonged sampling helped in collecting rare
taxa, but the prolonged sampling was very time and labor consuming. The small streams in this study made
it impossible to take more than three parallel samples with a total time of 1.5 min. However, this could
explain why some taxa were absent in unexpected places.
Another factor that needs to be considered is the fact that problems with serious acidity usually occur at
times with high flow (e.g. Toivonen et al. 2019). There were no such occasions during the study period
31

Mats Willner
because of the drought. This could have led to a situation where the water quality was better than normal in
many of the lowland streams and only chronically acidic streams showed symptoms of acid sulfate soils. This
could have been especially apparent at sites which suffer only mildly from acid sulfate soils and show
symptoms only under severe acidic periods. Chronically acidic streams, such as Hömossadiket and
Åivobäcken, have lethal conditions for sensitive species almost every year. There have been no severe acidic
impulses in the area since 2006. This could have led to the fact that streams that might suffer from acidity
only after a heavy drought period (Korpilahdenoja, Kainobäcken, Viitavesibäcken and Tastulanoja) have
managed to sustain diverse invertebrate populations. These streams might have many years with good
enough water quality for in-stream biota, but extreme conditions might induce an acidic impulse that
destroys invertebrate communities. However, years with better water quality make it possible for species to
recolonize the streams. Sundermann et al. (2011) showed that species recolonize restored stream reaches if
there is a suitable population for recolonization within 0–5 km upstream. The same recolonization of an
empty reach could be achieved at streams recovering from an acidic impulse. Hömossadiket and Åivobäcken
are heavily influenced from acid sulfate soils throughout the stream, but Kainobäcken, Viitavesibäcken and
especially Tastulanoja headwaters are of better quality compared to their lower reaches. These streams
could have sanctuaries for species under acidic conditions and from where species could again recolonize the
lower reaches when the water quality improves. MacNeale et al. (2005) reported that adult stoneflies could
fly even as far as 600 m through forest from their site of emergence or even 800 m upstream following the
stream channel. This fact makes e.g. Kainobäcken and Korpilahdenoja sites even in-reach for invertebrate
colonization from the Perhonjoki river. These factors could possibly have influenced invertebrate
communities, narrowing the difference in species composition between high- and low sulfate-streams.

5.3 Hydropsyche gill abnormalities
Hydropsychidae larvae have been used in many experiments to identify effects of metals on stream
invertebrates. Vuori (1996) reported that a low pH value (5.0) and elevated aluminum concentrations lead
to darkening of individual analpapillae and problems with the individuals’ ormoregulatory processes. Ruuth
(2017) showed that elevated cadmium concentrations also induced gill abnormalities in H. pellucidula larvae.
Vuori and Parkko (1996) reported that H. pellucidula showed gill abnormalities (darkening of gill tuffs)
subjected to organic pollution at river Kymijoki.
The frequency of gill abnormalities varied between 0 and 13% in this study. Highest frequencies of gill
abnormalities were found at Korpilahdenoja and the lowest (0%) were found at Viitavesibäcken, Tastulanoja
and Penninkijoki. Two percent of the individuals at Kalavedenoja and 1% of the individuals at Kainobäcken

difficult to draw decisive conclusions about differences in gill abnormality frequencies. For example, the only
individual that was found at Viitavesibäcken and all the four individuals at Tastulanoja were healthy and
showed no signs of darkened gill tuffs. This small data set for both streams makes statistical analyses of gill
abnormalities difficult and unreliable. Classification of abnormalities is personal, and the classification can
vary greatly between persons, which makes it difficult to even compare results from different research.
Salmelin et al. (2015) studied the variation in classification of abnormalities of the Dipteran Chironomidae.
Their results showed that classification as “normal” or “abnormal” differed between experts and it was
difficult to find a common agreement in what classified as abnormal.

6 Conclusion
Results from this study confirmed the hypothesis to be correct for acid sulfate soil impact on water quality.
Sulfate concentrations, aluminum concentrations and EC values rise towards the coast and the lowest pH
values where measured in lowland streams. Results indicated that acidity below HSL are due to drainage of
acid sulfate soils. Acidity above HSL was due to humic acids from peatlands. This was noticeable from much
lower sulfate concentrations above approximately 85 m above sea level.
Results from this study confirmed the hypothesis that pollution from acid sulfate soils alters invertebrate
species composition. Acid sulfate soil-affected streams differed from non-affected streams in their species
composition, even if the lack of high flow periods narrowed the differences between streams. Effects of acid
sulfate soil pollution were especially apparent at Åivobäcken and Hömossadiket brooks. Acidity and metals
dissolved from acid sulfate soils are factors that constrain invertebrate species richness the most in these
two brooks. This was seen from low pH-values, high aluminum concentrations, absence of Hydropsychidae,
or blackflies larvae, and the fact that the total individual count was lowest from all the places at Åivobäcken,
even though these two brooks are also heavily channelized and lack moss cover. Results from e.g. Muotka
and Syrjänen (2007) suggest that these two taxa should thrive in these streams because of suitable habitats
and large surfaces for algae growth.
The difference in EPT-species composition between acid sulfate soil-affected and non-affected streams, was
apparent within Ephemeroptera species composition. However, results did not indicate any significant
difference in Trichoptera or Plecoptera species composition. Results from this study indicated that there
were no significant differences in Hydropsyche species composition nor in the frequency of gill abnormalities
between acid sulfate soil-impacted and non-impacted streams. However, even if there were no statistically
significant differences in gill abnormalities, there was a noticeable rise in gill abnormality frequencies towards
the coast. This is something that needs more research in the future.

Hydropsyche larvae could be considered as good bioindicators in small streams around the Perhonjoki
catchment area. As Heino et al. (2002) suggested, these are usually found in Perhonjoki ecoregion. However,
as this study showed, it is difficult to draw conclusions out from kick-net sampling data alone. The risk of
human error in sampling etc. is too big and there is always a risk of not catching any of the target specimens
in sampling. Therefore, it could be better to also conduct in situ toxicological tests with target species to
minimize the risk of errors.
Both the years 2018 and 2019 were extremely dry in the region. Reports from the area in autumn 2019 show
that acidic impulse from acid sulfate soils is more than likely to occur following these dry years. It is, therefore,
important to conduct new studies from the region after the next acidic episode. Results from this study serve
as a good reference and the possible absence of species at next sampling could indicate mortality due to
chock from acidity and metals. It would be important to conclude in situ experiments with Hydropsychidae,
Heptageniidae and Leptophlebiidae larvae in streams where these taxa were absent. Results from in situ
toxicity tests would give more knowledge about the impact of bad water quality on these species in heavily
polluted streams.
