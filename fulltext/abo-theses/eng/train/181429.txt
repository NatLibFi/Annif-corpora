The progress made in tissue engineering to treat damage caused by disease and traumatic injury
has been accelerated by innovations in bioengineering over the last few decades. The strategy
of repairing and revitalizing damaged tissues has advanced from the use of tissue transplants
to the use of functional scaffolds. Three-dimensional (3D) printing which utilizes hydrogel
inks, is an ideal technique used to fabricate sophisticated and biomimetic hydrogel scaffolds
capable of promoting new tissue morphogenesis via interaction with human cells.
Electroconductive hydrogels have emerged as a significant tissue engineering scaffold due to
their ability to maintain a distinct 3D structure, provide mechanical support for the cells in the
engineered tissues, and their high electrical conductivity which is needed for the regeneration
of electrically excitable tissues. However, the fabrication of electroconductive hydrogel
scaffolds of high conductivity with high-quality 3D printing resolution remains a great
challenge. In this research project, several methods were explored to fabricate high-quality 3D
printable electroconductive hydrogel inks using cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), polypyrrole
(PPy), and the photo cross-linkable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and galactoglucomannan
methacrylate (GGMMA). As revealed by the results, the hydrogel ink synthesized with CNC,
PPy, and GGMMA possessed promising properties for high-quality 3D printing. The hydrogel
ink was prepared by mixing the CNC/PPy with GGMMA. Analysis of the surface charge and
particle size of CNC/PPy showed an improvement in the colloidal stability of the CNC/PPy
composite at a CNC concentration of 1 wt% to 2 wt%. Also, after checking the conducting

properties of the CNC/PPy/GGMMA hydrogel inks with a two-point probe, a response was
obtained on the multimeter for the hydrogel ink formulated with 1 wt% CNC and 0.2 M Py
(CNC/PPy-3). Thus, the hydrogel fabricated with CNC/PPy-3 was used for further analysis.
The incorporation of PPy was confirmed by the analysis of the hydrogel using Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The electroconductivity of the
hydrogel containing PPy was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and
compared to the control hydrogel without PPy. The impedance of the hydrogel decreased from
56.9 ± 1.9 kΩ for the control hydrogel to 43.3 ± 1.5 kΩ for the hydrogel containing PPy at 1
Hz. Likewise, the impedance of the hydrogel decreased from 113.4 ± 0.6 Ω for the control
hydrogel to 79.9 ± 2.2 Ω for the hydrogel containing PPy at 1000 Hz. These results indicate
the potential suitability of the hydrogel composed of CNC, PPy, and GGMMA for high-quality
3D printing and fabrication of tissue constructs for the regeneration of electrically excitable
tissues.

1. INTRODUCTION
Disease and traumatic injury can cause damage to tissues in the human body which requires
surgical intervention to facilitate their repair, replacement, or regeneration. Classical treatment
strategies employ the transplant of tissues from one part of the patient’s body to another
(autotransplantation) or from a donor to the patient (allotransplantation). Despite the success
of both strategies, some limitations exist. Autotransplantation is associated with a wide range
of morbidity rates and various complications, such as infection, hematoma/seroma, nerve, and
vascular injuries, chronic pain, and scars, while allotransplantation is limited by the problems
of donor shortage and antibody-mediated rejection.1,2 Three-dimensional (3D) printing, an
advanced additive manufacturing technique, which can be used to fabricate complex,
sophisticated, biomimetic tissue constructs, provides an alternative for the production of tissues
to circumvent these limitations.3 The 3D scaffolds provide the necessary support for cells to
populate and function appropriately.
The 3D printing method utilizes biomaterials as bioinks for the fabrication of new scaffolds in
combination with biological cues for tissue regeneration.4 For example, natural polymers, such
as collagen and gelatin, have been widely used as bioinks because they contain the tripeptide
motif arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) which is important for cell adhesion, proliferation, and
differentiation.5,6 However, a single biomaterial in bioinks cannot usually satisfy all the
conditions which are necessary to produce biomimetic tissue constructs. For example, the use
of cytocompatible biopolymers such as gelatin is limited by their poor mechanical properties
at physiological temperatures.7 On the other hand, materials such as polyethylene glycol which
allows the control of hydrogel mechanical modulus by varying molecular weight, lack the
biological cues needed for cell adhesion and proliferation.4,8 Hence, multicomponent bioinks
composed of natural, synthetic, or hybrid biomaterials have been developed. Furthermore, the
biomaterials should be carefully chosen to interact favorably with biological systems especially
for cells of electrically excitable tissues such as neurons, fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, and
osteoblasts that require electrical stimuli to generate the necessary cellular responses.9,10
Existing research recognizes the critical role played by electrical stimulation in tissue
regeneration.11,12 Thus, in addition to providing similar structure, mechanical, and biochemical
properties to the native extracellular matrix, the successful engineering of these electrically
responsive tissues requires scaffolds to be electroactive.13

In the past, various materials such as metal nanostructures (e.g. gold nanorod) and carbonbased materials (such as carbon nanotubes) have been used either purely or incorporated with
other materials to form composites, to fabricate scaffolds.14,15 These scaffolds were able to
promote cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation when used for electrically
responsive cells. However, these materials have limitations, such as the high cost of gold that
restricts their usage on a large scale and the potential cytotoxicity of carbon-based materials
that limit their applications on implantable scaffolds.14,15 To overcome this limitation,
electrically conducting polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy),16 polyaniline,9 polythiophene,17
and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)18 have been used in biomedical applications
due to their biocompatibility, conductivity, and reversible oxidation/reduction which are
suitable properties for tissue engineering.19 PPy is one of the most extensively explored
electrically conductive polymers in tissue regeneration and it was reported that PPy-based
materials show levels of immunogenicity that are similar to other biomaterials approved by the
United States Food and Drug Administration.20 The biocompatibility and toxicity of PPy have
also been evaluated and it was reported that it did not have adverse effects on the cell cultures
and animals tested.21
Hydrogels that form 3D cross-linked hydrated fibers have become the ideal material for
developing scaffolds because of their similarity to the natural extracellular matrix of tissues
which allows for the diffusion of nutrients, growth factors, and cellular waste.22 However, they
are characteristically non-conductive, which limits their application in modulating cell function
for excitable cell types such as neurons, cardiomyocytes, and osteoblasts,12,23 hence the
emergence of electroconductive hydrogels. Electroconductive hydrogels belong to the general
class of smart materials that utilize the inherent properties of electrically conductive polymers
to design technologically relevant devices and systems.22 Extensive research has shown that
electrically conductive polymers can be used to fabricate electroconductive hydrogels. For
example, Ketabat et al. synthesized an injectable conductive hydrogel using polypyrrole,
alginate, and collagen for myocardial regeneration,16 Wu et al. reported the fabrication of a
conductive hydrogel using naturally-derived gelatin methacrylate and polyaniline which could
support cell adhesion.24 Also, Wang et al. reported the fabrication of a polypyrrole-grafted
gelatin-based hydrogel with combined conductive, self-healing, and injectable properties.25
Due to the low mechanical properties of materials such as gelatin, it is necessary to combine
them with other biomaterials to obtain multi-material hydrogel inks with improved properties.8
The low mechanical property of gelatin is due to the breakdown of its secondary bonding
2

Peter Odion Osazuwa

structure at temperatures above 35 ℃.7,8 This breakdown of the secondary bonding structure
destroys the physical network of gelatin and thus, limits its application at physiologically
relevant temperatures. Materials with good mechanical properties are important in tissue
engineering because they should be able to sustain the mechanical forces they will experience
when implanted at the defect site. Cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) is a form of nanocellulose that
has several excellent characteristics such as high aspect ratio, easy surface functionalization,
high mechanical strength, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high availability at a
relatively low cost, which makes it an ideal material for the reinforcing phase in a polymer
matrix.8,26,27 Previous studies have reported an enhancement in the mechanical properties of
composite hydrogels after the incorporation of CNC.8,28,29
In addition to enhanced mechanical property and electroconductivity, the materials used for the
synthesis of hydrogel inks need to be processed and formulated into printable inks for the
fabrication of tissue scaffolds. The printability of bioinks is evaluated by the resolution and
precision of the scaffold structures.30 One important factor in the formulation of high-quality
printable hydrogel inks is the integration of their components into a stable colloidal
dispersion.31 The behavior of particles in colloidal inks can be influenced by factors, such as
particle size and surface chemistry, the tendency of aggregation, and ionic strength of the
dispersion.31 In the study by Zhang et al.30, they reported an improved printing resolution due
to the presence of colloidal lignin particles in the hydrogel ink which helped to stabilize the
composite and prevented aggregation of particles. To meet the demands of the constantly
evolving field of tissue engineering, it is vital to develop materials that satisfy the requirements
of the hydrogel inks used for the engineering of electrically responsive tissues. This can be
achieved using biocompatible materials with appropriate mechanical and electrical properties.
Also, a suitable synthesis method aimed at good control of particle size and colloidal stability
is vital.
Consequently, this project aims to develop a biocompatible, electroconductive, and 3D
printable hybrid hydrogel for tissue engineering. The properties of the hydrogel inks are studied
with different characterization techniques to assess their colloidal stability. The
electroconductivity of the hydrogel is also characterized to evaluate its suitability for
application in tissue engineering.

2. TISSUE ENGINEERING AND BIOMATERIALS
In tissue engineering, biomaterials serve as a temporary scaffold for the delivery and
integration of cells and/or growth factors at the repair site. Scaffolds play a very crucial role in
the development of new tissue morphogenesis by guiding the growth of cells seeded within
them or helping cells migrate from surrounding tissues by communicating with them. They
deliver cells to the desired sight in the patient’s body, provide a space for new tissue formation,
and provide sufficient structure and function (e.g., mechanical support) during the remodeling
process.32 An ideal tissue engineering scaffold must be capable of replicating the structure and
function of the natural extracellular matrix of the body, and it should be degraded naturally
during or shortly after the healing process.33 In tissue engineering, hydrogel-based scaffolds
have been extensively used due to their highly swollen three-dimensional (3D) environment.
These scaffolds are very similar to soft tissues and allow for the diffusion of nutrients and
growth factors through the elastic network which aids in the regeneration of damaged tissues.
Hydrogels are characterized as either synthetic, natural, or hybrid (composite), based on the
nature of their

constituent polymers.

In

this

thesis,

several

natural

(GelMA,

galactoglucomannan methacrylate, and cellulose nanocrystal) and synthetic (polypyrrole)
polymers were explored in a hybrid form for the fabrication of the electroconductive hydrogel.

3. BIOPOLYMER-BASED BIOMATERIALS
Biopolymers are a class of natural polymers that are produced by living organisms. They are
synthesized by enzymes that connect building blocks such as sugars, amino acids, or fatty acids
to yield high molecular weight molecules. As biomaterials in tissue engineering, biopolymers
offer diverse chemistries and help in the control of the structure and morphology of
extracellular matrix systems. Another key advantage of biopolymers is their inherent
biodegradability which helps to regulate the rate and extent of cell and tissue remodeling so
that tissue regeneration occurs at a rate that matches the degradation of the scaffold.34
Biopolymers that have been explored for tissue engineering applications are gelatin, collagen,
and hyaluronate. These biopolymers are components of the extracellular matrix; hence they
naturally interact with cells.34 Also, due to the biocompatibility of wood-based biopolymers
such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, they have attracted attention for application in
tissue engineering.32,35

NANOCELLULOSE

Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer on Earth, and it is the major component in
lignocellulosic plant biomass.36 Cellulose is a linear homo-polysaccharide comprising of Dglucose units connected by the β-1-4 glycosidic bond (Figure 1). Every other D-glucose unit
is rotated 180° to its neighbor and two D-glucose units form a cellobiose unit. Each internal Dglucose unit has three hydroxyl groups (-OH): the -OH group at the C6 position is a primary
alcohol, while the -OH groups at the C2 and C3 positions are secondary alcohols.37 These
hydroxyl groups are all potential sites for chemical modification of cellulose but the hydroxyl
group at the C6 position is the most reactive.38

Figure 1. The molecular structure of a cellulose polymer.

As shown in Figure 2, to extract cellulose fibers, they must be detached from the other main
components of the cell wall such as the hemicellulose and lignin. This is done via chemical or
mechanical pulping into discreet fibers. The cellulose fibers can be defibrillated and/or
hydrolyzed into smaller nanoscale entities known as nanocellulose, which occurs in the form
of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and cellulose nanofibers (CNFs).39 Other forms of cellulose
nanomaterials are algal cellulose, and bacterial cellulose.40

Devices,” by Dias, O. A. T. et al., 2020, Front. Chem. 8 (Copyright: Frontiers Media S.A.).

Peter Odion Osazuwa

Nanocellulose has received significant interest due to its mechanical and optical properties,
biodegradability, availability, recyclability, renewability, and low coefficient of thermal
expansion. Due to the presence of many hydroxyl groups within the nanocellulose structure as
well as its high surface area and high aspect ratio, this enthralling biopolymer is a more
attractive substrate for surface modification through various chemistries than traditional
cellulose.41 Another advantage of using renewable materials such as nanocellulose is that they
can replace plastic and metal substrates in a wide range of applications and consequently reduce
the pollutant deposits in the environment. Also, there has been rising concern about overdependence on finite and diminishing non-renewable petroleum and metal resources. Thus, the
use of advanced hybrid nanomaterials as a feedstock for next-generation materials such as
hydrogels for tissue engineering has become a key principle of ecological sustainability.

3.1.1. CELLULOSE NANOCRYSTALS
Cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) is a form of cellulose nanomaterial with a typical length of 50500 nm and a diameter of 3-10 nm that is primarily produced through acid hydrolysis of
cellulosic fibers.36 Compared to other forms of nanocellulose, CNCs have enhanced
mechanical properties such as large surface area (∼700 m2/g), high Young’s modulus (up to
140 GPa), high tensile strength, and stiffness.37,42,43 Many other attractive features of CNC are
biodegradability, biocompatibility, good colloidal stability, enriched surface-active groups,
low cost, and abundance. Studies aimed at evaluating the biocompatibility and toxicity of CNC
revealed that it did not affect the viability of colon epithelial cells and it showed minimal or no
cytotoxicity in a cellular model of the intestinal epithelium.44 These properties make CNC a
promising functional nanomaterial for the fabrication of other hybrid nanostructures with
enhanced properties. In recent years, CNCs have been widely explored as a reinforcement
material to improve the mechanical properties of nano scaffold systems45,46 and also used to
direct the morphology and differentiation of skeletal muscle cells.47
The production of cellulose nanomaterials from plant biomass is important because cellulose
is stronger than steel when density difference is factored in and it is comparable to carbon
nanotubes. Also, the crystalline cellulose tensile strength and modulus are approximately 10
and 100 times that of wood, respectively.36 CNC is primarily produced from cellulosic fibers
through acid hydrolysis. Through controlled acid hydrolysis, crystallites can be isolated from
natural cellulose by selectively hydrolyzing the water-accessible crystal defects and disordered
regions.36,37,48,49

Figure 3. Schematic representation of a cellulose fiber showing the crystalline and non-crystalline regions. Acid
hydrolysis removes the non-crystalline regions and only crystalline parts (CNC) will remain. Image is from
“Crystalline Nanocellulose — Preparation, Modification, and Properties,” by Börjesson, M. & Westman, G.,
2015, Cellul. - Fundam. Asp. Curr. Trends (Copyright: IntechOpen).

In the early stage of hydrolysis, the acid diffuses into the non-crystalline parts of the cellulose
fiber and hydrolyzes the glycosidic bonds. This is followed by hydrolysis at the reducing end
group and the surface of the cellulose nanocrystals.37 The hydrolysis of the reducing end groups
and the surface of the nanocrystals will make the nanocrystals charged depending on the type
of acid that is used. Although acids such as hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid can be
used for hydrolysis, sulphuric acid is commonly used because of the formation of sulfate halfester groups on the crystalline surface (Figure 4) that impart electrostatic stability to CNC
which promotes stable colloidal dispersion.36,37

Acid type and concentration, reaction time, and reaction temperature are some of the most
important parameters for controlling the acid hydrolysis of cellulose fibers. A reaction time
that is too long will hydrolyze the cellulose crystals completely and a reaction time that is too
7

Peter Odion Osazuwa

short will give a high degree of polymerization due to large undispersed fibers.37 The sulphuric
acid hydrolysis reaction has been optimized by several researchers and the generally adopted
way to produce CNC is by using a 64 wt% sulphuric acid solution at 45 °C for 45 to 60 min
with constant stirring. After hydrolysis, centrifugation, and purification through dialysis, small
crystalline rod-like particles will be yielded in an aqueous suspension.36,37,40 CNCs have been
hydrolyzed from various cellulose sources such as microcrystalline cellulose (MCC),50
cotton,42 rice straw,51 bacterial cellulose,52 wood,53 banana fibers,54 sugarcane bagasse,55
rejected fibers,55 and grass fibers.56 CNC was used in this thesis due to its excellent mechanical
properties which makes it a suitable reinforcement material in the hydrogel matrix.
Additionally, the surface charge of CNC will help to increase the electrostatic repulsion in the
composite and promote the colloidal stability of the particles in the composite.

3.1.2. CELLULOSE NANOFIBRES
Cellulose nanofibres (CNFs) consist of a bundle of individual nanofibrils entangled together
and comprised of alternating amorphous and crystalline cellulose domains.57 The leading
method of CNF isolation is the disintegration of the cell wall matrix through mechanical shear
(grinding, high-pressure fluidizers, and high-pressure homogenizer) to release microfibrils. To
cut down up to 98 % of the energy consumed during the mechanical disintegration, standard
pretreatment processes such as carboxymethylation or 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl
(TEMPO)-mediated oxidation have been applied before the defibrillation. The pre-treatment is
separated into two categories: enzymatic (e.g., TEMPO oxidation) or mild acid hydrolysis and
introduction of electrostatic repulsion between the fibers through chemical modification of the
fibrils to generate anionic surface charges.57 Other pretreatment techniques are phosphorylation
and periodate oxidation but the central theme of these processes are similar to TEMPO
oxidation: addition of charge on the microfibril surface to facilitate the detachment of
microfibrils from one another into CNFs.58
CNFs offer several benefits for the preparation of nanomaterials. Their high aspect ratio allows
easy preparation of nanomaterials due to the robust network formed by vast entanglement and
short-range interactions. They are also generally used for composite reinforcement because the
crystalline part of cellulose has a high stiffness (modulus of ca. 150 GPa and tensile strength
of ca. 10 GPa).59 Due to its fascinating properties, several applications of CNF have been

HEMICELLULOSE

Hemicelluloses are a group of heterogeneous plant cell wall polysaccharides and the world's
second most abundant renewable biopolymers after cellulose in lignocellulosic materials.60
They can be extracted by water or aqueous alkali from plant tissue, and they comprise a wide
variety of monosaccharides including xylose, arabinose, glucose, galactose, mannose, fucose,
glucuronic acid, and galacturonic acid, depending upon the source.60 Hemicelluloses in
hardwood are glucuronoxylan (most abundant in hardwood), glucomannan, and xyloglucan
while softwood hemicelluloses are galactoglucomannan (most abundant in softwood),
arabinoglucuronoxylan, and arabinogalactan.60
Due to the biocompatibility, biodegradability, and environmentally friendly properties,
hemicellulose has attracted much attention for applications in different areas such as biofilms,
food packaging, and biomedical applications.61 For example, electrically conductive
hemicellulose hydrogels have been fabricated via cross-linking O-acetyl-galactoglucomannan
with epichlorohydrin in the presence of conductive aniline pentamer at ambient temperature.
The formed hydrogel had a macroporous structure, controllable conductivity, tunable swelling
behavior, and good mechanical properties, which has great potentials for biomedical
applications such as tissue engineering.62

3.2.1. GALACTOGLUCOMANNAN
The major hemicelluloses in softwood are acetylated galactoglucomannan (AcGGM) shown in
Figure 5. The main chain is believed to be linear or slightly branched and consists of a
backbone of (1 → 4)-linked β-D-glucopyranose and β-D-mannopyranose units with α(1 → 6)-D-galactopyranose. A vital structural feature is the hydroxyl groups at the C2 and C3
positions in the main chain units which are partially substituted by O-acetyl groups, with an
average of one group per 3 to 4 hexose units containing this substitution.63 AcGGM has an
approximate degree of polymerization between 100 and 150, which is equivalent to a molecular
weight of around 16,000 to 24,000 Da.63

Galactoglucomannans are easily depolymerized by acids, especially the bonds between
galactose and the main chain while the acetyl groups are much more easily cleaved by alkali
and acid.60 Due to the presence of a high amount of hydroxyl groups, AcGGM can react with
acids, acid anhydrides, acid chlorides, etc to form modified products for applications as an
oxygen barrier, water-resistant coatings, and hydrogels.61

PHOTOPOLYMERIZABLE BIOPOLYMERS

Photopolymerizable biomaterials are commonly used in tissue engineering because of the
spatiotemporal

control

provided

by

photoinitiated

photopolymerizations.64

Photopolymerization reaction is fast and controllable, and requires low energy input, compared
to a traditional radical polymerization.65
A key factor in the development of photopolymerizable materials for 3D printing is to
incorporate photoreactive moieties such as methacrylate, acrylate, or thiol-ene groups. For
example, biopolymers such as gelatin, collagen, hyaluronic acid, decellularized extracellular
matrix (dECM), alginate, and galactoglucomannan have been made photopolymerizable via
the incorporation of photoreactive moieties such as (meth)acrylate groups.64,66,67 Although
there are several types of photopolymerization mechanisms such as orthogonal step-growth
polymerization, two-photon polymerization, and ionic photopolymerization, the free-radical
chain-growth polymerization is the most widely used.

3.3.1. PHOTOINDUCED

FREE-RADICAL

CHAIN

GROWTH

POLYMERIZATION
Most

photoreactive

biomaterials

undergo

photoinduced

free-radical

chain-growth

polymerization to form a cross-linked hydrogel. It involves the decomposition of
photoinitiators upon light exposure to form radicals which serve as kinetic-chain carriers by
attacking nearby free monomers to initiate chain-growth polymerization. The polymerization
is defined by three distinct stages: initiation, propagation, and termination. In the initiation
stage, the light (usually UV irradiation) strikes the photo-initiator and cleaves it into two freeradicals via bond cleavage at sites such as C-C, C-Cl, C-O, or C-S bonds.64 Thereafter, one or
both free radicals initiate the polymerization by reacting with the monomer to form a radical.
The newly radicalized monomer can react with another monomer, and this continues to
propagate in a chain-like fashion. The propagation of the polymer chain continues until a
termination reaction occurs.64 Lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP), and
2-hydroxy-4′-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone (Irgacure-2959) are photoinitiators
that are commonly used in photopolymerization. LAP has an absorbance maximum at around
375 nm and significant absorbance at 365 nm. The absorbance of Irgacure-2959 is around 270
nm but this is phototoxic and mutagenic for cellular encapsulation since DNA absorbs light at
260 nm and proteins absorb light at 280 nm.68 Hence, for applications involving cells, the light
source is filtered to allow light at 365 nm. At 365 nm, the molecular coefficient of Irgacure2959 is very low and it lags off almost completely before 370 nm. Thus, the utilization of
Irgacure-2959 for photopolymerizations performed at 365 nm or longer wavelengths is
limited.68
During photopolymerization, oxygen impurities can react with free radicals and impede their
propagation. This may increase the time required for crosslinking (UV irradiation exposure
time) and affect printing resolution.64 Since oxygen can diffuse into biomaterials over time,
they are often deaerated with nitrogen gas before photopolymerization to minimize the impact
of oxygen.

3.3.2. GALACTOGLUCOMANNAN METHACRYLATE
Galactoglucomannan (GGM) consists of a high amount of free hydroxyl groups that can be
functionalized with methacrylate groups to form galactoglucomannan methacrylate
(GGMMA). A green approach for synthesizing GGMMA by reacting GGM with methacrylic
11

Peter Odion Osazuwa

anhydride (MA) in an aqueous solution under a mild alkaline condition at 50 °C has been
reported (Figure 6).67

Figure 6. Schematic representation of the synthesis of GGMMA.

It was also reported that a hydrogel ink that consists of GGMMA/CNF showed good
mechanical properties and cytocompatibility.67 Hence, the biocompatible and biodegradable
properties of GGMMA make it a suitable biopolymer for application in tissue engineering. Due
to the presence of the photoreactive moiety (MA) in GGMMA, it was used in one of the
methods in this thesis to form the hydrogel.

3.3.3. GELATIN METHACRYLOYL
Gelatin is a natural hydrophilic polymer produced from hydrolysis and denaturation of collagen
under high temperature and it is biocompatible, soluble in aqueous and organic solvents,
biodegradable, and unlike collagen, it is non-immunogenic. Furthermore, gelatin possesses the
arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) peptide sequence which facilitates certain cell adhesion,
proliferation, and differentiation. It also possesses a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
degradation sequence which promotes cell enzymatic degradation.69 Due to the presence of
active groups (-OH, -COOH, -NH2, -SH) on the side chains of gelatin, it can be modified with
specific groups to improve its properties for various applications. The most used method of
functionalizing gelatin is the synthesis of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMa) which is widely used
in tissue engineering.

12

Peter Odion Osazuwa

GelMA is produced through the reaction of gelatin with MA via one-pot synthesis to conjugate
methacryloyl groups predominantly to amine groups and less so to the hydroxyl groups present
along the gelatin backbone and this method was first reported in the year 2000 by Van Den
Bulcke et al.70 (Figure 7). The reaction typically takes place in phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4) at
50 °C.

Figure 7. Schematic representation of the synthesis of amphoteric GelMA showing the methacrylate group (red
color) and methacrylamide group (blue color).

Different degrees of methacryloyl substitution can be achieved in GelMA by changing the
amount of MA added to the reaction mixture, which produces GelMA with distinct mechanical
properties.71 The chemical modification of gelatin by MA involves less than 5 % of the amino
acid residues in the molar ratio, which implies that the RGD motifs and MMP-degradable
motifs will not be drastically influenced.70,71 Besides, the RGD motifs do not contain groups
that will react with MA, which ensures the retention of good cell adhesive properties of
GelMA.71,72
GelMA crosslinks immediately under UV light when a photoinitiator is added via a
photoinduced free-radical polymerization to form GelMA hydrogels which have excellent
thermostability.69 Common photoinitiators used for photocrosslinking GelMa are 2,20azobis[2-methyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)propionamide]
trimethylbenzoylphosphinate

(LAP),

and

(VA-086), lithium

phenyl-2,4,6-

2-hydroxy-4′-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-

methylpropiophenone (Irgacure-2959). GelMA hydrogels have been widely used for various
biomedical applications due to their suitable biological properties and tunable physical
13

Peter Odion Osazuwa

characteristics. The main disadvantage of GelMA is its mechanical robustness; as a protein
biopolymer, it is susceptible to hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation, and it has a relatively
narrow stiffness range.64 To overcome this, GelMA is commonly implemented in composite
biomaterials. Due to the presence of the photoreactive moiety (MA) in GelMA, it was used in
one of the methods in this thesis to form the hydrogel.

4. ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTING POLYMERS
Electrically conducting polymers are a class of a new generation of smart biomaterials that
permit the transfer of electrical, electrochemical, and electromechanical stimulation to cells.73
The modern development of conductive polymers was triggered by the observation of Heeger,
MacDiarmid, and Shirakawa, who were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in the
year 2000 for the discovery and development of conductive polymers. They reported that the
conductivity of polyacetylene, a polymer that is normally only semiconducting at best,
increases by 10 orders of magnitude when it is oxidized using iodine vapor.74 Since then,
conductive polymers such as polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, and poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene) which exhibit excellent electrical and optical properties have been
explored in many applications including energy storage devices, actuators, light-emitting
diodes, etc. The molecular structures for the listed conjugated polymers are shown in Figure
8. After the pioneering work of Wong et al.75 who seeded mammalian cells on the conductive
films based on polypyrrole, more conductive polymers have been explored for tissue
engineering applications.76–78

14

Figure 8. Molecular structures of some common conductive polymers in their undoped state.

Electrically conductive polymers have a conjugated bond structure that contains localized
carbon-carbon single bonds (σ) and less localized carbon-carbon double bonds (π) (Figure 9).
The overlapping p-orbitals in the series of π-bonds allow for electron delocalization i.e. they
do not belong to a specific monomer, but the whole π-electron network. Thus, it allows charge
transport along the polymer backbone (intra-chain charge transfer) or in between polymer
chains (inter-chain charge transfer).73,79

Figure 9. A simplified scheme of a conjugated backbone: a chain containing alternating single and double bonds.

15

Peter Odion Osazuwa

In electrically conducting polymers, the unsaturated bonds (π-bonds) are shorter than the
saturated bonds (σ-bonds) and the alternation of the π-bonds and σ-bonds (bond length
alternation) in the polymer backbone results in the band gap or Peierls gap (Eg).80 All states
below the gap are occupied and form the π-band (valence band), and the states above the gap
are empty and form the π*-band (conduction band). As shown in Figure 10, when the valence
band overlaps the conduction band, the valence electrons are free to move and spread in the
conduction band and this is an intrinsic characteristic of metallic conductors. Semiconductors
possess small Eg that electrons can cross upon excitation to reach the conduction band. In the
case of insulators, the band gap is too large to be crossed by electrons, hence they do not
conduct electricity.81

Figure 10. Schematic representation of metals, semiconductors, and insulators in terms of the band gap (Eg).

Pristine electrically conducting polymers are essentially insulators because the energy gap
separating the valence and conduction band is too large for the valence electrons to move and
propagate in the conduction band. It is also believed that there is a distinct structural and
morphological disorder in the polymer matrix that delays charge transport along the polymer
chain.81 The key to the conductivity of electrically conducting polymers is doping.73,82 The
doping of a conducting polymer involves the partial oxidation (p-doping) or reduction (ndoping) of the polymer. This can be accomplished either chemically or electrochemically.
During doping, the twisted benzoid-like structure is transformed into a quinoid-like structure
thereby reducing the structural lattice distortion. Doping also introduces charge carriers to the
polymer chain in the form of polarons and bipolarons. The polarons and bipolarons create
sublevels between the valence and conduction bands which make it possible for the electrons
to move.81 The high conductivity of the doped conjugated polymers is due to the increase in
the number of free charge carriers, and the mobility of electrons as new electronic bands are
16

Peter Odion Osazuwa

formed between the conduction and valence bands. The structure of positively charged polaron
and bipolaron are shown in Figure 11.

Figure 11. The quinoid structure of polaron and bipolaron in polypyrrole.

Counterions or dopants neutralize the charge introduced through oxidation (p-doping) or
reduction (n-doping) and stabilize the polymer backbone.73 Different polysaccharides anionic
templates have successfully been applied as dopant anions for electrically conducting
polymers. For example, PPy has been successfully synthesized via situ polymerization of
pyrrole monomer in presence of CNC83,84 and tannic acid85 as dopants. Due to this unique
property of electrically conducting polymers, it is desirable to incorporate them inside bulk
hydrogels in a superstructure and ordered fashion to allow inter and intra-chain charge transfer
throughout the hydrogel.

4.1.

POLYPYRROLE

Polypyrrole (PPy) is one of the most widely studied electrically conducting polymers for
biomedical applications due to its high conductivity, biocompatibility, and easy synthesis.86,87
Various studies have reported the combination of PPy with biopolymers to make hybrid
biomaterials for tissue engineering. For example, Zhou et al.85 reported the fabrication of a soft
conducting PPy hydrogel cross-linked and doped with tannic acid for spinal cord injury repair.
Also, Wright et al.86 synthesized a conductive composite of PPy and alginate which was
suitable for 3D extrusion printing and facilitated the proliferation of PC 12 neuronal cells. In
another study, Yang et al.88 fabricated a conductive PPy/alginate hydrogel which enhanced the
cell adhesion and growth of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. PPy is
17

Peter Odion Osazuwa

generally synthesized by chemical or electrochemical methods. Electrochemical synthesis
results in the formation of thin films while chemical synthesis is used when large quantities of
material are required, and this method was adopted in this thesis.
Although the mechanism of PPy synthesis by the chemical method is debatable, the most
widely accepted polymerization mechanism is the coupling between radical cations.89 As the
first step, pyrrole is oxidized to give a radical cation. This is followed by dimerization because
of radical-radical coupling to form a positively charged dimer. The positively charged dimer is
then deprotonated and reoxidized to form a dimer radical cation. This is followed by coupling
between dimer radical cations (and later between oligomers), deprotonation, and
rearomatization (Figure 12).89,90 This mechanism was confirmed by Heinze et al.74 who
unambiguously showed that the consecutive oligomerization of conductive polymers starts in
solution and preferably takes place through successive dimerization steps leading from a dimer
to a tetramer and then to an octameric coupling product. By this repeated process, the chains
grow and finally lead to the polymer.

18

Figure 12. Mechanism of chemical synthesis of Polypyrrole.

Pyrrole is oxidized by compounds such as FeCl3, FeCl3·6H2O, and (NH4)2S2O8 (APS), hence
they are usually used in its chemical polymerization. The influence of the oxidants and oxidant
to monomer ratio in the chemical polymerization of PPy in aqueous solutions has been
investigated. Yussuf et al. compared the performance of FeCl3 and APS at room temperature
and reported a higher conductivity when FeCl3 was used.91 Also, Yussuf et al.91 and Armes92
have shown that the optimal mole ratio of FeCl3/pyrrole is approximately two (2). Furthermore,
APS has been utilized in other studies involving composites of PPy, and acceptable levels of
conductivity were reported.25,93 Studies have shown that polymerization is accompanied by
unwanted side reactions such as overoxidation which affects the properties of the polymer.94,95
In a study, it was reported that overoxidation occurs mainly at the beginning of the chemical
polymerization and is boosted by low oxidant concentration.94 The authors concluded that a
higher oxidant concentration will result in higher conductivity of the polymer. In another study
by Wu et al.95 where they performed an in-situ polymerization of PPy in a solution of CNC and
polyvinylpyrrolidone, they reported that overoxidation was caused by an extended period of
polymerization. In their study, they reported that the PPy growth on the surface of CNC reached
a conducting threshold at 3 h and it plateaued after 6 h where it remained constant for the next
10 h after which it rapidly decreased. These studies suggest that factors such as polymerization
time, oxidant type, oxidant concentration, and oxidant to monomer ratio influence the final
product of polymerization. PPy was used in this thesis to make the hydrogel electroconductive.

5. CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES
5.1.

ZETA POTENTIAL

Zeta potential (z-potential) also known as electrokinetic potential is a measure of the charge on
the surface of particles and gives information about the charge stability of colloidal
nanoparticles.96 It depends on factors such as strength and valency of the ions, and pH of the
medium. The measurement of z-potential is based on the electrophoretic mobility of the
particles after the application of an electric field to the sample. Electrophoretic mobility is the
degree to which the particles alter their movement proportional to the externally applied
electrical field.97 Z-potential can be resolved from the measured electrophoretic mobility of the
particle, based on the Henry equation below:
Equation 1
where Ue is electrophoretic mobility, ε is dielectric constant (i.e the relative permittivity of the
sample), z is zeta-potential, f(Ka) is Henry’s function (Smoluchowski approximation is usually
applied where f(Ka) is equal to 1.5), and η is the viscosity of the solvent.97 Z-potential of
± 30 mV indicates particle stability, where values greater than +30 mV or less than -30 mV
infers stability or an ability to resist the aggregation of particles.98,99 Zeta-potential was used in
this thesis to analyze the surface charge and assess the colloidal stability of the composites and
hydrogel inks.

5.2.

DYNAMIC LIGHT SCATTERING

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is a simple and commonly used method to estimate particle
size in a dispersed medium. DLS measures light scattered from a laser that passes through a
solution of nanoparticles undergoing Brownian motion. The motion of the particles which is
driven by gradients in the particle concentration is described by the translational diffusion
coefficient.100 This is important in DLS analysis because larger particles will move more slowly
than smaller particles and scatter more light. The hydrodynamic diameter of the particles can
be calculated from the time dependence of the scattering intensity measurements based on the
Stokes-Einstein equation (Equation 2).101
Equation 2

D = KT/3πηDt

20

Peter Odion Osazuwa

where D is the hydrodynamic diameter (reported as the mean particle size), K is Boltzmann’s
constant (J·K−1), T is the absolute temperature (K), η is the viscosity of the solvent (Pa·s) and
Dt is the translational diffusion coefficient (m2/s). The hydrodynamic diameter is the diameter
of a hypothetical sphere that diffuses at the same rate as the measured particle.96 Although the
hydrodynamic diameter is slightly larger than the “physical” particle, the results of DLS
measurements for unaggregated colloidal solutions are comparable to particle size obtained
with transmission electron microscopy.
While DLS measurement leads to acceptably accurate results for monodisperse nanoparticles,
it is unable to differentiate between nanoparticles with slight differences in diameter or to
precisely resolve polydisperse samples.97,102 This is because it measures the intensity of the
scattered light to the sixth power of the particle diameter, thus a population of large particles
in the sample can skew the results.103 DLS works best with homogenous particles in a
transparent solvent which ensures the stability of the sample in suspension.104 Hence, the results
of DLS measurements for polydisperse samples due to particle aggregation are not reliable.
DLS was used in this thesis to analyze the size of the particles to identify possible particle
aggregation.

5.3.

SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a high-resolution imaging technique that is usually
used in the investigation of surface morphology (texture), size distribution, aggregation, and
chemical composition of materials.96,98 It is vital in hydrogel characterization because during
cell culture, the microstructure of the hydrogels, such as the pore size and fiber arrangement,
influences the behaviors of the cells, such as their growth, migration, proliferation, and
alignment which consequently affects the processes of vascularization and osteogenesis.105 If
the hydrogels show good porosity, the growth of the cells would not be inhibited, since the
cells could readily spread and proliferate following their encapsulation within the hydrogels.
SEM operates by generating a beam of electrons in a vacuum. The beam is focused by
electromagnetic lenses within a column and directed towards the sample. The interaction of the
electron beam with the sample causes the ionization of the sample (ejection of electrons from
the atoms within the sample to produce secondary electrons), and reflection (back-scattering)
of the beam electrons from the sample surface to produce the backscattered electrons. With the
aid of a secondary electron detector, the crystal shape and surface morphology of the materials
can be visualized.98 SEM can be equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS)
21

Peter Odion Osazuwa

for elemental analysis of materials. The EDS detects and identifies the X-rays that are emitted
by the atoms on the surface layer of the material being analyzed.106 The X-rays are emitted
when the vacancy in the inner electron shell (due to the production of the secondary electrons)
is filled by an electron from an outer shell. Elements emit X-ray photons with characteristic
energies and the EDS measures the energy of each emitted photon to identify the elements in
the material. The abundance of the emitted photons also gives information about the abundance
of the specific elements on the sample. SEM was used in this thesis to analyze the surface and
cross-sectional morphology of the hydrogel.

5.4.

TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a common technique for characterizing the shape
and size of nanoparticles at high magnification.98 It is the most used technique for the
characterization of nanoparticles because of the high spatial resolution as compared with
SEM.40 In TEM, the focused electron beam passes through a series of electromagnetic lenses
and illuminates the whole area of the sample. The electron is collected below the sample and
projected onto a phosphorescent screen. Thus, the sample should be very thin to allow the
electrons to pass through it.98 One limitation of TEM is that the sample and substrates (pedestal
and grid used in sample preparation) are typically carbon-based so they will transmit to the
detector similar electron outputs due to the low contrast.107 Staining with heavy metal elements
is the main method to mitigate contrast issues. Positive stains chemically bond directly to the
sample (making the sample material itself have more contrast) while negative stains (more
common because of its relative ease of use), surround the outline of the sample, making the
background around the sample have more contrast.107 Common negative stains include uranyl
acetate, ammonium molybdate, and other heavy metal solutions. When applying the stain to
the sample, a common method is to add a droplet of stain solution to the sample, which is
allowed to sit for several seconds before removing the excess. Several techniques to remove
excess stain have been used, including wicking or dabbing off the solution droplet with a clean
tissue, rinsing with droplets of water, or dunking in a bath of water before drying.40 TEM was
used in this thesis to visualize the image of the composite formed through the in-situ
polymerization of PPy in CNC.

5.5.

FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY

Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a vibrational spectroscopy technique that provides information
about characteristic molecular vibrations, from which structural information about materials
can be interpreted. The IR spectral range is between the visible and microwave regions and
stretches from 14000 cm-1 to 10 cm-1. It is divided into three regions: the near-infrared (14000
to 4000 cm-1), mid-infrared (4000 to 400 cm-1) and far-infrared (about 400 to 10 cm-1). The
most frequently used region for chemical analysis is the mid-infrared region since molecules
can absorb radiation in this region to induce the vibrational excitation of functional groups.108
When IR radiation is passed through a sample, the frequencies equivalent to the active
vibrational modes of the molecules of the sample are to some extent absorbed, while other
frequencies are transmitted through the sample without being absorbed by the
sample. Radiation of various wavelengths can be absorbed depending on the chemical
composition of the sample. The output is an IR spectrum in which the intensity of IR radiation
absorbed or transmitted is plotted on the y-axis against the wavenumber of the radiation on the
x-axis. The wavenumbers (reciprocal of wavelength in cm) are normally used to denote
different wavelengths of radiation.
The prevalent form of IR is the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) because of
its good signal-to-noise ratio, maximum use of radiation, and high accuracy and stability.109 In
FT-IR, infrared spectra are collected as a time-domain spectrum of the sampled signal using a
Michelson interferometer. Thereafter, a mathematical transformation called the Fourier
transform is applied to the time-domain spectrum to obtain the frequency domain spectrum.
This spectrum is then compared to a reference spectrum measured without the sample
(background) to obtain the absorbance or transmittance spectrum. FT-IR spectroscopy can be
used with different sampling techniques and modes of operation. Amongst the different
techniques, the Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) is the most popular sampling technique in
FT-IR spectroscopy. In this technique, the sample without any treatment is placed in contact
with the internal reflection element also called ATR crystal, and IR radiation from the source
is directed through the crystal to its surface that is in contact with the sample at a certain angle
so that the light is reflected. The refractive index of the crystal must be higher than that of the
sample for the total reflection to occur. Therefore, high refractive index materials are chosen
for the ATR crystal. Some of the most used crystals are diamond, zinc selenide, and

23

Peter Odion Osazuwa

germanium. FTIR-ATR spectroscopy was used in this thesis to analyze the structure of the
hydrogel and confirm the incorporation of PPy in the hydrogel.

5.6.

UV-VISIBLE SPECTROSCOPY

Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy is an analytical technique that exploits light in the
ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Beer-Lambert law
(Equation 3) establishes a linear relationship between absorbance (A), the molar extinction
coefficient (ε) and concentration of absorbing species (c) in the solution, and the path length
(l). Hence, UV/Vis spectroscopy can be used to quantitatively ascertain the concentration of
the analyte in a solution.110
Equation 3
In a UV-Vis test, samples are placed in a cuvette, which is rectangular-shaped with an internal
width of 1 cm (i.e., path length l). A light beam is passed through the cuvette and part of the
light is absorbed by the sample being analyzed while the rest proceeds to the detector. The
wavelength of the light reaching the detector is measured. The measured wavelength provides
important information about the chemical structure and concentration (intensity of the
measured signal) of the sample measured. Hence, both quantitative and qualitative information
can be gathered. The absorption of incident energy promotes electrons to excited states. For
this transfer to occur, photon energy must match the energy needed by the electron to be
promoted to the next higher energy state. In addition, the shift in wavelengths of absorption
peaks of a sample in the UV-Vis absorption spectrum can be correlated to band gap change
(due to movement of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band) of electrically
conducting polymers.
The optical properties of a conducting polymer are important to the development of an
understanding of the basic electronic structure of the material. The π-conjugation in the
polymers is shown by their color and their electronic spectra; thus UV-Vis spectroscopy is a
powerful technique for characterization of the electronic processes that occur in the polymer in
the undoped and doped states, as well as during doping.111 The changes of the optical spectra
associated with doping are significant, and these spectral changes have played a key role in
understanding the mechanism of doping and the nature of the charge-storage species in the
polymer chain.112 UV-Vis spectroscopy was used in this thesis to analyze the electronic state
of PPy in the hydrogel ink.

5.7.

TWO-POINT PROBE RESISTANCE

The resistivity of a sample can be measured with either the four-point probe or the two-point
probe methods. The multimeter is an instrument that is commonly used for two-point probe
measurements. In the two-point probe configuration, two identical electrodes serve as both
current and voltage sensing probes.113 A small amount of voltage is provided to the resistor via
the contact probes of the multimeter, and the current flowing across the two contact points is
recorded, thereby giving the resistance value following Ohm's law. The two-point probe
measurement is the most common method used to determine the resistance of a material.114
However, one inherent flaw in this method is that the same two contact probes used for
providing the test voltage are also used for recording the current flowing due to the supplied
voltage. Hence, the internal resistance of the probes gets added to the actual displayed value,
thus, giving inaccurate results.115 The four-point probe provides more reliable results because
it has different probes for the current path and the voltage. Also, the two-point probe is not a
perfect method for resistance measurements of ionic or polarizable systems such as electrically
conducting polymers. Notwithstanding, the two-point probe method was used in this thesis to
monitor whether the hydrogel inks showed conducting properties or not.

5.8.

CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a type of potentiodynamic electrochemical technique commonly
applied to study the mechanism of redox reactions of electroactive materials such as conducting
polymer hydrogels.85 It is usually performed in a 3-electrode electrochemical cell where the
potential is cycled with a pre-determined scan rate in a certain potential range. As shown in
Figure 13, the potential is scanned from E1 to E2 and after the potential reaches a set value, it
is then ramped in the opposite direction back to the initial potential (E1) or a third potential
(E3).116

25

Peter Odion Osazuwa

Figure 13. Potential-time profile in cyclic voltammetry. Image is adapted from “Potential Sweep Techniques and
Cyclic Voltammetry,” by Pletcher, D. et al., 1993, Instrumental Methods in Electrochemistry, Ellis Horwood
Limited, Southampton, p. 179 (Copyright: Ellis Horwood Limited).

The potential is measured between the reference electrode and working electrode while the
current produced in the process is controlled between the working electrode and the counter
electrode. The plot of the current against the applied potential results in a cyclic
voltammogram. The shape and positions of the voltammograms provide a key understanding
of the properties of polymer structure such as the reversibility of the redox couple, and electron
transfer kinetics. For reversible systems, the current is limited by diffusional mass transport,
and the peak potentials (Ep) and peak separation (ΔEp) do not depend on the scan rate. For
irreversible systems, ΔEp increases, and Ep shifts to more extreme potentials with increasing
scan rate (more positive for oxidation, negative for reduction).117 As shown by the RandlesSevcik equation (Equation 4), there is a linear relationship between the peak current and the
square root of the scan rate for electrochemically reversible electron transfer processes
involving freely diffusing redox species.118

Equation 4

Where ip (A) is the peak current, D0 (cm2 s-1) is the diffusion coefficient of the oxidized analyte,
A (cm2) is the electrode surface area, n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox event,
C0 (mol cm-3) is the bulk concentration of the analyte, and v (V/s) is the potential scan rate.
Cyclic voltammetry is commonly used to analyze the electroactivity, charge storage capacity,

and electrochemical stability of conducting polymer hydrogels.119–121 CV was used in this
thesis to assess the stability and electroactivity of the hydrogel after continuous potential
cycling.

ELECTROCHEMICAL IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY

Impedance is the opposition by an electrical system to the flow of electric current and carries
units of Ohms, Ω.122 Impedance differs from resistance because resistance is observed in DC
circuits, and it obeys Ohm's law. Resistance is essentially impedance with zero phase angle
since the current is not alternating.122 In electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
experiments, a small amplitude sinusoidal excitation potential (Eac) is superimposed on a fixed
DC potential. At a set frequency, a current will flow through the electrochemical cell, and it is
recorded by the potentiostat. The current is then converted by software into an impedance value
with a real and imaginary component. This process is repeated across a frequency range where
different values are deduced for the real and imaginary components of the overall
impedance.122
EIS can reveal details regarding the conduction mechanism in a complex system such as a
hydrogel and it has been used to study the cellular responses in bulk artificial and biological
tissues.123,124 Impedance can be expressed in terms of a magnitude, Z0, and a phase shift, ɸ as
shown in Equation 5 below:
Equation 5
Where Z(ɷ) is the complex impedance and consists of a real and an imaginary part, ɸ is the
phase shift between the applied signal and resulting response. A phase shift of 0o corresponds
to a pure resistor, 45o corresponds to a Warburg impedance due to diffusion limitation (Figure
14), and 90o corresponds to a capacitor. The impedance of a system is commonly presented as
the Nyquist plot and Bode plot.122
The Nyquist plot or Complex-Impedance Plane representation (Figure 14a) is a plot in which
the data from each frequency point is plotted by the imaginary part (-Z”) on the y-axis and the
real part (Z’) on the x-axis. The high-frequency intercept on Z’ represents the ohmic resistance
of the electrolyte (Rs). The low-frequency intercept gives the characteristic impedance of the
system. Also, features such as the semicircle or a 45˚ low-frequency line give possible insight
into the governing kinetic in the system.122

In the Bode plot, the impedance magnitude and phase angle are plotted against frequency. The
impedance magnitude is given by Equation 6.125
Equation 6
Interpretation of EIS data has traditionally relied on models containing equivalent electrical
circuit elements (Figure 14b). The equivalent electrical circuit shown in Figure 14b is known
as the Randle’s circuit and it models a system in which a faradaic process occurs.116,122 The
Randle’s circuit consists of the resistance of the electrolyte solution, Rs, charge transfer
resistance, Rct, Warburg element, Zw, and the double layer charging at the electrode surface Cdl.
The Zw accounts for the diffusion of the ions in solution in an electrochemical reaction.122 EIS
was used in this thesis to assess the electroactivity and electroconductivity of the hydrogel after
the incorporation of PPy.

6. HYPOTHESIS AND AIM OF THE STUDY
Although several materials have been explored for tissue engineering, many of them are not
biocompatible. For example, the use of metal nanostructures and carbon-based materials (e.g.
carbon nanotubes) is limited by their long-term cytotoxicity. Furthermore, current studies
involving the use of electrically conducting polymers and biopolymers to fabricate hydrogels
rarely assess the printability of the hydrogel inks. This study is based on the hypothesis that
28

Peter Odion Osazuwa

CNC and PPy have excellent properties which make them suitable as starting materials for the
synthesis of electroconductive hydrogel inks for 3D printing. CNC has excellent mechanical
and rheological properties which makes it suitable as a reinforcing nanofiller in hydrogel inks.
PPy which is a biocompatible polymer with excellent intrinsic electrical conductivity could
provide the relevant electrical conductivity needed for the regeneration of electrically excitable
tissues. Consequently, this work is aimed at:
✓ Developing a suitable formulation of CNC/PPy composite that is colloidally stable and
without aggregation of the nanoparticles.
✓ Using the composite as a starting material to fabricate an electroconductive hydrogel
with promising properties for tissue engineering.

METHODS AND INSTRUMENTATION

7.2.1. CV AND EIS
Electrochemical studies consisting of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) were done in a conventional three-electrode one-compartment cell
connected to Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat, Nova 2.1.4 software. To prepare the working
electrode, an aqueous slurry of alumina powder (Al2O3) on a damp smooth polishing cloth was
used for manually polishing the platinum (Pt) electrode (Ø = 3 mm). Adherent alumina powder
was removed from the Pt electrode surface by rinsing with deionized water before polishing on
a clean cloth without alumina. The Pt electrode was then sonicated in deionized water and dried
in the air.
Before each CV and EIS measurement, the aqueous electrolyte solution (0.5 M KCl) was
deaerated for 15 min with N2 and all the measurements were performed in an N2 atmosphere.
In the CV experiments, the Pt electrode potential was monitored against an Ag/AgCl/KCl (3M)
reference electrode, and a glassy carbon rod formed the counter electrode. CV measurements
were performed using five (5) potential cycles from -0.4 V to 0.4 V at scan rates of 10 mV/s
and 20 mV/s. The measurements were repeated five times for each scan rate with five (5)
potential cycles for each measurement.
Immediately after the CV measurements, EIS measurements were performed at a frequency
range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. All measurements were done with an AC voltage amplitude (Eac)
of 10 mV and at DC potential (Edc) of 0 V. The impedance spectra obtained were fitted to an
equivalent electrical circuit using the NOVA Autolab impedance analysis software which
exploits a nonlinear least square regression to fit the data using the Levenberg–Marquardt
algorithm. The Bode plots (log of frequency vs impedance magnitude, |Z|) and Nyquist plots
(Z’ vs -Z”) were plotted with data extracted directly from the software. The EIS measurements
were repeated 10 times.

7.2.2. ZETA-POTENTIAL AND DYNAMIC LIGHT SCATTERING
Zeta-potential (ZP) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were done using a
Malvern zeta sizer Nano series (zeta sizer software 7.11). The ZP of the samples suspended in
deionized water (0.01 wt %) was measured to determine the stability and surface charge of the
samples. The samples were sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min before measurements.
30

Peter Odion Osazuwa

For each sample, after equilibration for 2 min at 25 ℃, five measurements were done with 10
to 100 runs per measurement. Although electrophoretic mobility was recorded, it is directly
proportional to the particle surface charge without assumptions of particle shape/size/charge
density.126 The electrophoretic mobility was converted to zeta-potential with the
Smoluchowski approximation in Henry’s equation (Equation 1).
DLS was used to measure the apparent diameter of the samples (0.01 wt %) at 25 ℃. The term
“apparent diameter” is used because, in DLS measurements, the particles are recognized as
spherical, and the hydrodynamic diameter is measured but CNCs which served as the template
for all the samples in this thesis are rod-shaped. However, for non-spherical particles, the
hydrodynamic diameter is the diameter of an imaginary sphere that produces the same
translational coefficient as the real particle of arbitrary shape hence the hydrodynamic diameter
for CNC is an approximate size measurement and it is accepted as a reliable metric for
comparison purposes.126,127 Also, diluted solutions are needed for DLS measurements because
the Stokes-Einstein equation that relates the translational coefficient to the hydrodynamic
diameter is applicable only for dilute solutions.128 For each sample, after equilibration for 2
min at 25 ℃, five measurements were done with 10 to 100 runs per measurement at a 173°
scattering angle. This optimum angle was selected because the scattering power of nano-sized
particles at a large scattering angle (173°) contains enough information for a general
interpretation procedure.128 The Mean particle size is reported as the average hydrodynamic
diameter (D) based on Equation 2 and determined by the instrument’s software.

7.2.3. UV–VIS ANALYSIS
For the CNC/PVP/PPy/GelMA hydrogel inks, the UV-visible spectra were measured using 100
μl of the sample diluted with 3 ml of deionized water, while the background spectrum was
recorded with 100 μl of CNC/PVP/GelMA diluted with 3 ml of deionized water. Pristine PPy
spectrum was recorded with 100 μl of dispersed PPy diluted with 3 ml of deionized water.
The UV-visible spectrum of the CNC/PPy/GGMMA/LAP hydrogel ink was recorded using 20
μl of the sample diluted with 3 ml of deionized water. The background spectrum was recorded
with 20 μl of CNC/GGMMA/LAP diluted with 3 ml of deionized water. The spectrum for
pristine PPy was recorded with 20 μl of dispersed PPy diluted with 3 ml of deionized water.
The background for the pristine PPy was recorded with 3 ml of deionized water. The spectra

31

Peter Odion Osazuwa

were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 25 spectrophotometer between 300 and 1100 nm
at a scan rate of 480 nm min−1 with a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette.

7.2.4. FTIR-ATR ANALYSIS
The FTIR spectra were obtained with a Bruker IFS 66/S FTIR instrument equipped with a
DTGS detector. The ATR set-up consists of Harrick's VideoMVP single reflection diamond
ATR accessory with a horizontal sampling area of 500 µm in diameter, and a built-in pressure
applicator. This technique was used for the structural analysis of the hydrogel to confirm the
incorporation of PPy. The prepared dry samples (freeze-dried hydrogel and pristine PPy) were
tightly pressed against the diamond crystal during the measurements. The angle of incidence
of the infrared beam was 45o. For each measurement, 32 interferograms were co-added and the
FTIR spectra were recorded in % transmittance mode in the wavelength range of 5000 to 500
cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1.
Before the analysis, the hydrogel was frozen in an ultra-low-temperature freezer at -40 ℃ for
about two hours. After being completely frozen, the sample was transferred to a freeze-dryer
(Alpha 1-4 LD Plus) and lyophilized under vacuum (0.067 mbar) at room temperature with an
ice condenser operating at – 52 ℃. The hydrogel was kept in the freeze-dryer for 24 h to
sublimate the solvent directly from the solid phase to the gaseous phase.

7.2.5. TEM/SEM
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was done using the JEM-1400 Plus TEM
microscope, JEOL Ltd., Japan. A drop of the diluted sample suspension with a concentration
of 0.01 wt % was deposited on the copper grids (200 mesh, TED PELLA INC. USA) coated
with thin carbon film which was used as the substrate. The grids were then incubated at room
temperature for 3 min and the excess liquid was eliminated by blotting with filter paper before
loading in the microscope. Before the deposition of the sample, the grids were glow-discharged
for 25 sec to increase their hydrophilicity. Also, before the analysis of pristine CNC, the sample
was incubated in 3 μl of 0.5 wt% uranyl acetate solution for 1 minute to produce a negative
stain contrast but the composite with polypyrrole did not require staining. The analysis was
carried out with an accelerating voltage of 80 kV.
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were done using the LEO Gemini
1530 SEM microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a Thermo Scientific UltraDry
32

Peter Odion Osazuwa

Silicon Drift Detector (Thermo Scientific Inc., Madison, Wisconsin, U.S.A). For the SEM
analysis, the freeze-dried hydrogel was attached to an aluminum plate with carbon tape and
further sputtered with carbon to increase the electrical conductivity and prevent charging. After
analysis of the surface morphology, the hydrogel was divided using liquid nitrogen, then the
cross-sectional morphology was analyzed.

7.2.6. TWO- POINT PROBE RESISTANCE MEASUREMENT
The resistance of the composites and hydrogel inks was monitored using a UNI-T UT 58B
general digital multimeter with an upper resistance limit of 200 MΩ. 100 µl of the samples (Ø
= 1 cm) were pipetted on a glass slide and allowed to dry in air, to form a thin film. The probes
of the multimeter were placed on the ends of the thin film and the instrument was checked for
the response. If the sample is conductive, the instrument shows the resistance in ohms but if
the sample is not conductive, there is no response on the multimeter.

7.3.

PREPARATION OF CELLULOSE NANOCRYSTALS

The CNCs were extracted from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) by acid hydrolysis according
to previously described methods37,42 with minor adjustments. In this project, 200 ml of sulfuric
acid (64 wt%) was allowed to heat up in an oil bath for 15 min before adding 14 g of MCC.
The hydrolysis of MCC was done under mechanical stirring for 90 min at 45 °C and the reaction
was stopped by adding the sample into 2 l of cold distilled water. The diluted suspension was
centrifuged with Milli-Q water four times at 4000 rpm for 20 min. This was done to remove
the sulfuric acid from the suspension. The CNC precipitate was then rinsed and dialyzed using
cellulose dialysis tubing (12-14 kDa MWCO) in DI water. The dialysis was done for 9 days
with the DI water being changed three times daily until constant conductivity and neutral pH
in the effluent were achieved. Finally, the suspension was dispersed with an AH-basic highpressure homogenizer by one pass at a pressure of 600 bar and two passes of 1000 bar to obtain
a homogeneous suspension. The final suspension was ca. 2.15 wt% CNC in water and it was
stored at 4 °C for further analyses.

7.4.

PREPARATION OF GGMMA

Galactoglucomannan

methacrylate

(GGMMA)

was

synthesized

by

reacting

galactoglucomannan (GGM) with methacrylic anhydride based on the method reported in the
literature with slight adjustments.67 Briefly, 2 g of GGM was dissolved in 100 ml of deionized
water at 50 °C then 4 ml of methacrylic anhydride was added to synthesize GGMMA. The
33

Peter Odion Osazuwa

reaction continued for 3 h with pH maintained at 8.0 by the addition of 6.0 M NaOH. The
GGMMA was purified by dialysis against Milli-Q water with regenerated cellulose dialysis
tubing (3.5 kDa MWCO). The GGMMA was obtained by lyophilization and stored as dry and
protected from light before further use.

7.5.

PREPARATION OF HYDROGEL INKS

As stated earlier in the literature review, the biomaterials for the formulation of 3D printable
electroconductive hydrogels for tissue engineering must possess certain physical and chemical
properties. In addition to enhanced electroconductivity, the materials need to be integrated into
a stable colloidal dispersion. To achieve these goals, different methods were explored to
synthesize the composite biomaterials which constitute the hydrogel inks. A common
procedure in all the methods is the in-situ chemical polymerization of PPy using CNC as the
matrix.

7.5.1. METHOD 1: PREPARATION OF GelMA HYDROGEL WITH
CNC/PVP/PPy COMPOSITE
A composite of cellulose nanocrystals, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polypyrrole (CNC/PVP/PPy)
was synthesized as a starting material before mixing with GelMA to form the hydrogel ink.
The PVP was used because it is an amphiphilic surfactant that can form a hydrophobic layer
on the surface of CNC and promote the uniform coating of PPy.129 Wu et al. reported an
increase in conductivity when PVP was used in the in-situ polymerization of PPy in CNC.95
Hence, it is expected that the use of PVP would provide enhanced electroconductivity for the
hydrogel.
The CNC/PVP/PPy was synthesized according to the method described by Wu et al.95 with
some modifications. In this project, 0.2 wt% CNC solution was mixed with PVP at a PVP/CNC
mass ratio of 10:100. The mixture was stirred vigorously overnight to ensure homogeneity.
Then 15 ml of the CNC/PVP mixture was transferred to a double-jacketed reaction vessel kept
in an ice water bath at around 0 oC and 5 ml of 0.45 M of FeCl3·6H2O was added dropwise to
the suspension and vigorously stirred. After one hour, 106.5 µl of pyrrole monomer (Py)
dissolved in 5 ml water was added slowly for 30 min and the suspension was left to mix under
mild stirring for 16 h. The reaction was ended by repeatedly washing the dispersion with
deionized (DI) water on a Whatman ashless filter paper, using a Büchner funnel to remove
excess oxidants and unreacted monomers. After washing, the CNC/PPy slurry was dispersed
34

Peter Odion Osazuwa

in DI water with probe sonication to form a stable suspension. The dispersed solution was then
mixed with GelMA to form the hydrogel ink.

7.5.2. METHOD 2: PREPARATION OF GelMA HYDROGEL VIA IN-SITU
POLYMERIZATION OF POLYPYRROLE IN CNC/PVP/GelMA
Another method was explored to fabricate an electroconductive hydrogel according to a
previously described method with some modifications.25 0.3 g of GelMA was added to 15 ml
of CNC/PVP solution and kept in warm water of ca. 37 oC to dissolve the GelMA. The
CNC/PVP solution was prepared using the same procedure described in method 1. After the
GelMA was completely dissolved, the mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 min. This was
followed by the dropwise addition of pyrrole to the mixture and the stirring continued for 2 h
at room temperature. Afterward, APS was added to initiate the polymerization. The
compositions of the samples studied are shown in Table 1.

The reaction was left for 24 h under mild stirring after which the black solution (indicating the
formation of polypyrrole) was dialyzed in DI water using cellulose membrane tubing with a
molecular weight cut-off of 14 kDa. The dialysis was done to remove excess oxidants and
unreacted monomers and the water in the beaker was changed three times daily. The dialysis
was done for about 5 days until a constant conductivity of the effluent was achieved.

7.5.3. METHOD 3: PREPARATION OF GGMMA HYDROGEL FROM
CNC/POLYPYRROLE COMPOSITE
The CNC/polypyrrole (CNC/PPy) nanocomposite was synthesized via an in-situ chemical
polymerization according to previously described methods with some modifications.93,95
Pyrrole (Py) monomer was added to 15 ml of CNC (Table 2) in a double-jacketed reaction
vessel before adding APS as an oxidant to initiate the polymerization. The CNC and Py
35

Peter Odion Osazuwa

monomer were initially mixed in the reaction vessel via rigorous stirring for 1 h with water
circulating the vessel to maintain a temperature below the room temperature. After an hour,
APS dissolved in 5 ml of DI water was added dropwise for 30 min to initiate the
polymerization. The samples and their formulations are shown in Table 2.

The polymerization continued under mild stirring for 6 h and the reaction was quenched by
repeatedly washing the dispersion with DI water on a filter paper, using a Büchner funnel to
remove excess oxidants and monomers. After washing, the CNC/PPy slurry was dispersed in
DI water via probe sonication for 1 h each at an amplitude of 38 µm to form a stable suspension.
The dispersed solution was then mixed with 6 wt% GGMMA to form the hydrogel ink.

8. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This project aimed at the fabrication of an electroconductive hydrogel in 3D printing
formulation for use in tissue engineering applications. To achieve this goal, biocompatible
materials were used in a series of hydrogel ink preparation methods. This section details the
significant improvements in the physical and chemical properties of the hydrogel inks from the
first method (method 1) to the last method (method 3).

8.1.

METHOD 1: PREPARATION OF GelMA HYDROGEL INK FROM
CNC/PVP/PPy COMPOSITE

Method 1 was adopted to prepare a composite of CNC, PVP, and PPy (Figure 15a) which was
mixed with GelMA to form the hydrogel ink. The GelMA (6.4 wt%) was mixed with 1 % of
CNC/PVP/PPy and 0.5 wt% LAP to form the hydrogel ink. The ink was cast into a mold and
crosslinked with exposure to UV irradiation at 365 nm for 9 min to form a hydrogel (Figure
15b).

PVP was used in this study because it is an amphiphilic surfactant that forms a hydrophobic
layer on the surface of CNC and promotes the uniform coating of PPy.129 Wu et al. reported an
increase in conductivity when PVP was used in the in-situ polymerization of PPy in CNC.95
Hence, it is expected that the use of PVP would provide enhanced electroconductivity for the
hydrogel.

8.1.1. TEM ANALYSIS OF THE CNC/PVP/PPy COMPOSITES
Before mixing CNC/PVP/PPy with GelMA to form the hydrogel, the level of CNC surface
modification with PVP and its effect on the growth of PPy were characterized with TEM and
the results are shown in Figure 16. A noticeable size expansion of CNC/PVP/PPy particles
was observed compared to pristine CNC without PVP. The TEM image confirms the successful
polymerization of PPy to form a core-shell structure with the CNC as the core.

8.1.2. SURFACE CHARGE AND PARTICLE SIZE MEASUREMENTS
Due to the negatively charged sulfate half-ester groups on the surface of CNC (i.e., OSO3–), it
had a negative zeta-potential (ZP) of -67.0 ± 4.0 mV (n = 5), and it was very stable in an
aqueous solution. After polymerization, the positively charged PPy neutralized the surface
negative charges on CNC. The ZP increased to -6.0 ± 0.5 mV (n = 5) which signifies a
homogeneous coating of PPy on CNC. Furthermore, the zeta-average size of the pristine CNC
measured with DLS was 85 ± 6 d. nm (n = 5) while the zeta-average size of the composite
(CNC/PVP/PPy) was 4846 ± 600 d. nm (n = 5). The remarkable difference in the zeta-average
sizes can be attributed to the coating of the CNC/PVP by PPy which facilitated the aggregation
of the particles due to reduction in electrostatic repulsion. The aggregation of the particles is
visible as shown in the image in Figure 15a. The increase in particle size in the composite
could also be visualized in the TEM image (Figure 16b) which shows a remarkable increase
in size after the polymerization. Furthermore, the particles were not stable for a long period.
The particles precipitated after about 5 h and this was due to the reduction of the number of
free sulfate half-ester groups on the surface of CNC which provided colloidal stability to the
composite. In agreement with the present results, previous studies have proven that
stabilization of particles in solution by electrostatic repulsion arises from the particles’ surface
charge.104,130 Hence, reduction of the surface charge affects the colloidal stability of the
particles and causes aggregation. The results in this thesis are consistent with earlier studies
which state that the ability of particles to resist aggregation and coagulation is indicated by the
ZP values greater than +30 mV or less than -30 mV.98,99
Also, after the addition of GelMA to the CNC/PVP/PPy, further aggregation of the particles
was observed. This can be attributed to further reduction of the electrostatic repulsion due to
the interaction between the negatively charged sulfate half-ester groups on the surface of the
CNC and the positively charged arginine.131,132 Arginine has a high intrinsic pKa value (13.8)
which ensures that it is always protonated, even at pH values as high as 10.133 Also, unlike
other basic and acidic amino acids, arginine can remain charged even when buried in a
hydrophobic micro-environment such as proteins, which is incompatible with the presence of
a charged group.133 As stated in the literature review, chemical modification of gelatin by MA
does not affect the RGD motifs (Arginine-glycine-aspartate) because they do not contain
groups that can react with MA,71 which ensures the availability of the positively charged
arginine for electrostatic interaction with CNC.

38

Peter Odion Osazuwa

Furthermore, it is believed that there is a complexation between the Fe3+ from the oxidant and
the OSO3– groups on CNC which further contributes to the reduction of the electrostatic
repulsion and thus leads to aggregation of the particles. The strong relationship between Fe3+
and the dopant ion (PSS-) during the polymerization of polypyrrole has been reported in a
previous study.94 Hence, to eliminate the possible electrostatic interaction between Fe3+ from
the oxidant and the OSO3– of CNC, FeCl3·6H20 was replaced by APS in the subsequent
methods.

8.1.3. ELECTRICAL

RESISTANCE

OF

THE

CNC/PVP/PPy/GelMA

HYDROGEL INK
Finally, the resistance of the hydrogel ink was checked with the two-point probe measurement.
There was no response on the multimeter when the dry film of the hydrogel ink was tested.
This was possibly due to the high number of insulators (CNC, PVP, and GelMA) in the
hydrogel ink which broke the network of PPy and affected the conductivity.
Considering the results of the various characterization techniques, the hydrogel ink synthesized
with this method was not suitable for high-quality 3D printing. The particle aggregation
observed in the hydrogel ink was indicative of poor colloidal stability which could affect the
resolution and precision of the tissue scaffold during 3D printing. Although the
electroconductivity could be induced by increasing the Py monomer concentration and
oxidant:monomer ratio, the poor colloidal stability of the hydrogel ink was still a major factor.
Hence, the hydrogel ink was not worth further characterizations.

8.2.

METHOD 2: PREPARATION OF GelMA HYDROGEL VIA IN-SITU
POLYMERIZATION OF POLYPYRROLE IN CNC/PVP/GelMA

In method 2, an in-situ chemical polymerization of PPy in a mixture of CNC, PVP, and GelMA
was done. This method was adopted to achieve a good network of PPy in the hydrogel ink.
Different hydrogel inks were prepared, and their compositions are shown in Table 1.

8.2.1. SURFACE CHARGE AND PARTICLE SIZE MEASUREMENTS
As seen in Figure 17, the particles in the hydrogel ink prepared with method 2 were not stable,
not homogenous, and they were very large.

39

Figure 17. CNC/PVP/GelMA/PPy hydrogel ink.

As stated in method 1, this is due to the reduction in the ability of CNC to stabilize the
dispersion because of the decrease in the number of free OSO3– groups on the surface of CNC
due to the polymerization of PPy. Also, the electrostatic interaction between the negatively
charged sulfate half-ester groups of CNC and the amino acid (arginine) in gelatin contributes
to the reduction in the electrostatic repulsion of the particles.131–133 Table 3 shows the
significant difference in the ZP values of the hydrogel inks compared to pristine CNC. This
further confirms the reduction in electrostatic repulsion in the hydrogel inks. These findings
are consistent with previous studies that ZP values greater than +30 mV or less than -30 mV
indicate the ability of particles to resist aggregation and coagulation.98,99

A closer inspection of the data for the Z-average size in Table 3 shows that there is a high
disparity in the size measurement amongst the different samples despite very little difference
in their composition. This can be attributed to the limitation in the DLS technique which was
used to measure the sizes of the particles. DLS is unable to differentiate between particles with
40

slight differences in diameter or to precisely resolve polydisperse samples (see Figure 17).103
This could skew the results in favor of the large particles and also affect the repeatability of
measurements.

RESISTANCE

OF

THE

CNC/PVP/GelMA/PPy

HYDROGEL INK
The two-point probe method (multimeter) was used to monitor the effects of the Py monomer
concentration and the oxidant:monomer ratio, on the resistance of dry hydrogel inks. In the
first samples prepared, 0.05 M of Py was used and the resultant hydrogel ink was not
conductive after testing with the multimeter. After the increase in the concentration of Py to
0.1 M (APS/Py ratio of 1 and 2) and 0.2 M (APS/Py ratio of 1), there was a decrease in
resistance of dry hydrogel films, and this resulted in a response on the multimeter. These
findings are consistent with the results of Liu et al.134 who reported that the conductivity of
polypyrrole-based cellulose composites correlates with the concentration of Py monomer.

8.2.3. ANALYSIS OF THE OXIDATION STATE OF PPy IN THE
CNC/PVP/GelMA/PPy HYDROGEL INK
To gain a better insight into the state of PPy in the composite, UV-Vis spectra of the samples
were recorded. UV-Vis spectroscopy is a valuable tool for analyzing changes in the electronic
structure of electrically conducting polymers and to characterize the doping state in which they
exist. The UV-Vis spectra of the CNC/PVP/GelMA/PPy hydrogel inks and pristine PPy are
shown in Figure 18.

The samples showed absorbance between 438 nm and 466 nm which is characteristic of the ππ* transition in PPy.93,135 The broad absorption band from the visible region to the near-infrared
region is characteristic of the bipolaronic metallic state of doped PPy.136 These results
confirmed that the PPy in the hydrogel inks was in its conducting form. Despite being in the
conductive state, at the low concentration of Py (0.05 M) in GelMA-H 1 and GelMA-H 2, the
repeating units of Py ring structures did not form a conductive network in the composite. These
results provided important insights which helped in developing suitable parameters for the
synthesis of the hydrogel inks in the next method.
Due to the large particle sizes and the instability of the dispersion, the hydrogel inks prepared
with this method were not suitable for high-quality 3D printing. The particle aggregation and
poor colloidal stability observed in the hydrogel ink could affect the resolution and precision
of the tissue scaffold structures. Another limitation of this hydrogel ink was revealed by the
work of Wang et al.25 which showed that the in-situ polymerization of PPy in GelMA leads to
the grafting of PPy on the double bond of MA. The absence of the double bond in the
photoreactive moiety could limit its potential to be crosslinked using photoinitiators. Also, due
to the electrostatic interaction between the charged arginine and the sulfate half-ester groups,
GelMA was not considered for further formulation of the hydrogel ink, and the hydrogel ink
formed with this method was not characterized any further.

METHOD 3: PREPARATION OF GGMMA HYDROGEL WITH
CNC/PPy COMPOSITE

Based on the knowledge obtained from the previous methods, a third method was developed
to prepare the hydrogel ink. The polymerization time was reduced to 6 h, as it has been reported
as the ideal time required to obtain good conductivity from PPy as well as moderately low zeta
potential.95 A total of six samples with different formulations were prepared, as shown in Table
2. Also, PVP was excluded in the formulation of the hydrogel ink, as it was observed based on
TEM images from the first method that PVP promoted the formation of a core-shell structure
of CNC/PVP/PPy with a large particle size. PVP is also an insulator that could impede the
conductivity of PPy in the hydrogel ink.

8.3.1. SURFACE CHARGE AND PARTICLE SIZE MEASUREMENTS
The CNC/PPy samples were left standing and undisturbed to confirm the stability and
dispersibility of the nanocomposites. Samples CNC/PPy-1 and CNC/PPy-2 precipitated after
14 h, while samples CNC/PPy-3 to CNC/PPy-6 remained stable without precipitating (Figure
19). The poor colloidal stability and aggregation of particles in samples CNC/PPy-1 and
CNC/PPy-2 could be due to the reduction in electrostatic repulsion because of the coating of
the CNC by PPy which decreased the number of free sulfate half-ester groups on the surface
of CNC.

Figure 19. Samples prepared by method 3 left standing and undisturbed for 14 h after probe sonication.

The particles in samples CNC/PPy-3 to CNC/PPy-6 remained stable without aggregation nor
precipitation because of the amount of free sulfate half-ester groups on their surface due to the
higher concentration of CNC. These observations were further confirmed by the measured ZP
of the samples (Table 4).

For samples CNC/PPy-3 to CNC/PPy-6, the high negative ZP showed that there were still
enough free sulfate half-ester groups on the surface of the composites to enable stability and
prevent particle aggregation. However, samples CNC/PPy-1 and CNC/PPy-2 showed a less
negative ZP which signifies an almost total coating of PPy on CNC. These findings are
consistent with previous studies that ZP values greater than +30 mV or less than -30 mV
indicate the ability of particles to resist aggregation and coagulation.98,99
Also, the DLS results showed an increase in hydrodynamic diameter of blended cellulose
nanocrystals when compared to pristine CNC and this was indicative of the formation of a
stable shell of PPy around the CNCs. The higher values obtained for samples CNC/PPy-1 and
CNC/PPy-2 are due to the further aggregation of the particles. Due to the particle aggregation
and precipitation in samples CNC/PPy-1 and CNC/PPy-2, they were not considered for further
characterization.

RESISTANCE

OF

THE

CNC/PPy/GGMMA

HYDROGEL INK
To form the hydrogel inks, samples CNC/PPy-3 to CNC/PPy-6 were mixed with
galactoglucomannan methacrylate (GGMMA) which does not have any surface charge.
Therefore, GGMMA would not have any impact on the electrostatic repulsion of the
nanoparticles in the hydrogel inks. For each sample, the resistance of the dry hydrogel inks
(CNC/PPy/GGMMA) was tested with the two-point probe method. Amongst the samples, only
44

Peter Odion Osazuwa

CNC/PPy-3 showed a response from the multimeter. It is believed that the combination of the
high concentration of Py (0.2 M) and the low concentration of CNC (1 wt %) contributed to
the low resistance in the hydrogel ink. Although 0.2 M Py was also used in CNC/PPy-5, the
combined effect of high CNC amount (2 wt%) and the GGMMA which are both insulators
could affect the network of PPy in the hydrogel ink and thus, affect the conductivity. Hence,
hydrogel inks formed with CNC/PPy-3 were used for further investigation in this thesis.

8.3.4. CNC/PPy/GGMMA HYDROGEL STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to further verify the incorporation of
PPy in the freeze-dried CNC/PPy-3/GGMMA hydrogel. The hydrogel ink (1 wt% CNC/PPy3 + 6 wt% GGMMA + 0.5 wt% LAP) was crosslinked under UV irradiation at 365 nm and
freeze-dried for the FTIR analysis. The spectra are shown in Figure 21. Most of the
characteristic peaks for pristine PPy were observed in the CNC/PPy-3/GGMMA hydrogel
including N-H stretching vibrations of Py rings at 3207 cm−1 and 3347 cm−1 and the
fundamental C=C Py ring vibration at 1521 cm−1 and 1557 cm−1 (asymmetric ring stretching)
for the pristine PPy and the CNC/PPy-3/GGMMA hydrogel, respectively. The peaks at 1281
cm−1 and 1302 cm−1 were attributed to C–N in-plane ring deformation (symmetric ring
stretching) for the pristine PPy and the CNC/PPy-3/GGMMA hydrogel, respectively. The peak
at 1015 cm−1 for the pristine PPy and 1029 cm−1 for the CNC/PPy-3/GGMMA hydrogel were
due to the =C-H out of plane vibration and it indicates the polymerization of pyrrole. The peak
at 1715 cm−1 seen in the CNC/PPy-3/GGMMA hydrogel represents the C=O stretching groups
of MA. The peak at 1165 cm−1 seen in the CNC/PPy-3/GGMMA hydrogel was assigned to the
C-O-C stretching vibrations in the CNC and GGM. The peak at 1632 cm−1 seen in the
CNC/PPy-3/GGMMA hydrogel was assigned to the H-O-H deformation vibration of lattice
water remaining in the CNC and GGM. The peaks obtained in this analysis were consistent
with those available in the scientific literature44,91,93,137–143 and the spectrum of the hydrogel
was in good agreement with that of the pristine PPy, which indicates the incorporation of PPy
in the CNC/PPy-3/GGMMA hydrogel.

Figure 21. FT-IR spectra of (a) pristine PPy, and (b) CNC/PPy-3/GGMMA hydrogel.

Also, it was observed that the peaks of the CNC/PPy-3/GGMMA hydrogel shifted towards
higher wavenumbers in comparison to that of pristine PPy. For instance, it can be seen in
Figure 21 that the C=C stretching vibration of Py rings which appeared at 1521 cm−1 for
pristine PPy shifted to a higher wavenumber at 1557 cm−1 in the CNC/PPy-3/GGMMA
hydrogel. Similarly, the absorption band at 1281 cm−1 in pristine PPy shifted to a higher
wavenumber at 1302 cm−1 in the CNC/PPy-3/GGMMA hydrogel. Bober et al.143 reported that
the shift of this absorption band (from 1281 cm−1 to 1302 cm−1) could be due to the hydrogen
bonding interactions between the N-H groups in the Py rings and the lone pair of electrons on
the oxygen atom of the -OH groups on the surface of GGM and CNC. On the other hand, the
hydrogen atoms of the CNC and GGM -OH groups can interact with the lone pair of electrons
on the Py nitrogens.144 Another reason for the blue shift of this band could be due to the
different degrees of doping of PPy which leads to lower conductivity of the composite
(CNC/PPy-3/GGMMA hydrogel) compared to pristine PPy.145 In summary, the shift in the
peaks is due to the strong intermolecular interaction between the components of the hydrogel
and PPy chains.138

CNC/PPy/GGMMA HYDROGEL
The SEM micrographs of the surface and cross-sectional morphology of the freeze-dried
hydrogels are shown in Figure 22. Due to the freezing of water and the sublimation of ice
crystals during freeze-drying, it is suggested that the physicochemical properties of hydrogels,
particularly the microstructures could get changed.146 Notwithstanding, the freeze-dried
hydrogels exhibited a 3D microporous foam-like network structure typical of hydrogels
reported in the literature.85,137

As shown in Figure 22, the microporous structures consist of interconnected pores which can
reduce the distance which molecules need to pass through thus ensuring fast diffusion of
molecules inside the pores. The pores allow for cell migration and proliferation, diffusion of
oxygen, transport of nutrients and wastes, and vascularization.85,137,147,148 Hence, the good
porosity shown by the hydrogels implies that the growth of cells would not be inhibited, since
the cells could readily spread and proliferate following their encapsulation within the hydrogel.

8.3.6. ELECTROCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATIONS
The electrical conductivity of the hydrogels is an important factor especially in cardiac, neural,
and muscle tissue engineering applications. Electrical conductivity improves cell-to-cell
signaling, which in turn facilitates cellular growth, viability, and function.149
The electrochemical analyses were done for the CNC/PPy/GGMMA hydrogel ink (1 wt%
CNC/PPy-3 + 6 wt% GGMMA + 0.5 wt% LAP) and without PPy (6 wt% GGMMA + 0.5 wt%
LAP). The working electrode was prepared by drop-casting 10 μl of the hydrogel ink onto the
Pt electrode. The analyses were initially performed without crosslinking the sample on the
electrode surface. However, it was observed that the sample was not stable in the aqueous
electrolyte for the duration of the analysis. The sample gradually disintegrated from the surface
of the electrode during the analysis.
To hinder the disintegration of the sample, the CNC/PPy/GGMMA hydrogel ink on the coated
electrode was UV irradiated at 365 nm to crosslink the hydrogel. The hydrogel was formed on
the electrode surface after 2 min, and this was confirmed by tilting the electrode horizontally
to check if the ink flows off the electrode surface. In this way, the hydrogel remained wellattached on the electrode surface and was stable during the electrochemical experiments. This
approach of fabricating hydrogels on the electrode surface was adopted based on the method
reported by previous studies.85,120,150,151

8.3.6a. ANALYSIS OF HYDROGEL ELECTROCHEMICAL STABILITY
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a powerful technique used to investigate electrochemical
processes, and it has been applied in the characterization of conductive polymers and hydrogels
for tissue engineering.85,119,152 For application as a long-term implant in tissue engineering, CV
is more gainfully employed in the assessment of the electrochemical stability by subjecting the

49

Peter Odion Osazuwa

polymer-coated electrode to continuous potential cycling to determine the changes in the
current-carrying capacity as time progresses.119,152
The electrochemical properties of the hydrogels with and without PPy were investigated with
CV from -0.4 V to 0.4 V in 0.5 M KCl aqueous electrolyte solution. The CVs shown in Figure
23 and Figure 24 are for the measurements performed at a scan rate of 20 mV/s. These CVs
are similar to the CVs at a scan rate of 10 mV/s shown in Appendix D. The rectangular shape
of the CV shown in Figure 23 is characteristic of capacitive currents due to non-faradaic
processes.93,153

rate of 20 mV/s.

As shown in Figure 23, there is a small increase in current for the electrode coated with the
hydrogel containing PPy when compared to the bare Pt electrode. The increase in current can
be attributed to the presence of PPy in the hydrogel. Also, during the 5 potential cycles used in
the CV measurement, the hydrogel with PPy showed good electrochemical stability and charge
carrying capacity as shown in Figure 24.

ANALYSIS
OF
ELECTROCONDUCTIVITY

ELECTROACTIVITY

AND

It has been shown that ion transport in electrically excitable tissues naturally occurs at a specific
range of frequencies and in a bidirectional, alternating fashion.154 Therefore, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements which are made under similar conditions to the
cell culture environment are more relevant to in vitro investigations of cell behavior than are
measurements of conductivity obtained by techniques such as the four-point probe method.12
Hence, EIS which accounts for electron transfer from capacitive and resistive effects was used
to characterize the conductivity and electroactivity of the hydrogels in an aqueous solution of
0.5 M KCl.
The results are shown for one of the replicates, while the other nine are shown in Appendix E.
The Nyquist plots (Figure 25) for the hydrogels show a straight line with a phase angle higher
than 45o (Warburg semi-infinite linear diffusion) but less than 90o (Warburg finite-length
diffusion). This deviation from the classical 45o line for semi-infinite Warburg diffusion can
be best attributed to a capacitive behavior such as a double-layer capacitance at the

51

Peter Odion Osazuwa

electrode/hydrogel interface, where the vertical line is slightly tilted (constant phase angle) due
to possible heterogeneities at the electrode/hydrogel interface.122,155,156

mV, and frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.

Several electrical circuits were tested with the inbuilt NOVA analysis software which exploits
a nonlinear least square regression to fit the data using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. It
works by changing the values of the parameters until the mathematical function matches the
experimental data within a certain error margin and the quality of the fit is represented by the
𝜒2 (chi-squared) value. The equivalent circuit shown in Figure 26 was found to give excellent
fits for the experimental data. The average error (𝜒2) of the fits for 10 different impedance
spectra of hydrogels with and without PPy is shown in Table 5.

Figure 26. The equivalent electrical circuit for the hydrogels.

As can be seen in Figure 26, the model is composed of a resistor in series with a constant phase
element (CPE). The resistor element accounts for the solution resistance (the high-frequency
intersection with the Z′ axis) and strongly depends on the electrolyte concentration.155 CPE was
used in the equivalent circuit model instead of capacitors, as is commonly done when the
52

Peter Odion Osazuwa

capacitive elements of a system are imperfect.157 The use of CPE improved the quality of the
fit significantly. The CPE element in the electrical circuits accounts for the capacitive current
observed in the cyclic voltammogram. This is confirmed by studies that the electrical
characteristic of an electrical double layer, which produces the non-faradaic current, does not
behave as an ideal capacitor but rather acts as a CPE.158 The CPE can be determined
mathematically with Equation 7.159

Equation 7

Where ω is the angular frequency, j = (-1)½, Q0 is the magnitude of 1/ZCPE (YCPE) at ω = 1 rad/s,
and the dispersion coefficient, α, obtains values between 0 and 1. When α = 1, the CPE shows
limiting behavior as a capacitor, and when α is equal to 0.5, the CPE shows limiting behavior
as a Warburg element. At the opposite limit, α = 0, CPE represents pure resistor. Although
several concepts, such as surface roughness and non-uniform current distribution, have been
proposed to account for the non-ideal behavior of the double layer, α is usually treated as an
empirical constant with no real physical basis.

Peter Odion Osazuwa

A closer inspection of the plots in Figure 25 and Appendix E at low frequencies (down to 0.1
Hz) shows that the Nyquist plots for the bare Pt electrode and the electrode coated by the
hydrogel with PPy deviate from the constant phase angle, forming the beginning of a
semicircle. It is expected that this semicircle will become more prominent at lower frequencies
down to 0.01 Hz. According to an earlier study by Bobacka et al.155, this low-frequency process
depends on the oxygen content of the solution and Edc. They further reported that this lowfrequency process is most probably due to a faradaic reaction at the electrode in parallel with
the doping process, due to traces of oxygen in the solution. These findings at the low-frequency
region are in agreement with the study of Vorotyntsev et al.160 which takes into account both
ion and electron transfer between the polymer and solution. Since this process is only observed
in the hydrogel with PPy, it is evidence of its enhanced electroactivity due to the presence of
PPy.
From the Bode plot (Figure 27) and as outlined in Table 5, at low frequencies similar to those
in electroactive biological tissues (1 Hz), the hydrogel with PPy had lower impedance than the
hydrogel without PPy and this is due to the better electron transfer kinetics in the system which
can be attributed to the presence of PPy.154 At 1 Hz, the impedance decreased from 56.9 ± 1.9
kΩ for the hydrogel without PPy to 43.3 ± 1.5 kΩ for the hydrogel with PPy.

mV, and frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.

Furthermore, the impedance at 1 kHz was examined because most neural cell communication
occurs between 300 Hz and 1 kHz.85,152 At 1 kHz, the impedance decreased from 113.4 ± 0.6
Ω for the hydrogel without PPy to 79.9 ± 2.2 Ω for the hydrogel with PPy. Also, the latest
studies into the use of hydrogel scaffolds through which conducting polymers are deposited
have shown that there is a significant increase in the surface area resulting in a reduction in
impedance from ∼1 MΩ on a bare gold electrode to 7 kΩ for PPy/PSS-coated electrodes.152
Hence, based on the EIS results, the reduction in impedance from 46.4 kΩ (1 Hz) and 91.5 Ω
(1 kHz) in the bare Pt electrode to 43.3 ± 1.5 kΩ (1 Hz) and 79.9 ± 2.2 Ω (1 kHz) in the electrode
coated with PPy-based hydrogel could be attributed to the conductive PPy in the hydrogel. The
low impedance is beneficial for in vivo rapid cell-to-cell communication by endogenous
bioelectrical signals produced by the activity of ion channels and pumps between neighboring
cells and for efficient charge transfer from the electrode to cellular tissues in vitro.12,85
Although, the reduction in impedance is relatively small, these results confirm the enhanced
electroconductivity of the hydrogel containing PPy.

9. CONCLUSIONS
The goal of this project was to develop a biocompatible, electroconductive, and 3D printable
hybrid hydrogel for tissue engineering. To achieve these goals, three different methods were
explored to synthesize the composite biomaterials which constitute the hydrogel inks.
The CNC/PPy composite formed with the third method at a concentration of 1 wt% and 2 wt%
of CNC showed good colloidal stability and sufficient electrostatic repulsion to prevent
aggregation of the particles. This was due to the presence of a sufficient amount of sulfate halfester groups on the surface of CNC after the chemical polymerization of PPy. Accordingly, the
hydrogel inks fabricated with this composite possessed promising properties for high-quality
3D printing. After checking the conducting properties of the CNC/PPy/GGMMA hydrogel inks
with the two-point probe method, a response was obtained on the multimeter for the hydrogel
ink formulated with 1 wt% CNC and 0.2 M Py (CNC/PPy-3). The hydrogel formed with this
sample (1 wt% CNC/PPy-3 + 6 wt% GGMMA) also showed lower impedance at
physiologically relevant frequencies (1 Hz and 1000 Hz) when compared with the hydrogel
without PPy and the bare Pt electrode.
On the other hand, the hydrogel inks formed with the first and second methods were not suitable
for 3D printing due to the aggregation of the particles and low colloidal stability in solutions.

It was discovered that the combination of PVP and GelMA contributed to the large particle
sizes via the reduction in electrostatic repulsion of the charges on the surface of CNC which
led to the drop in colloidal stability and aggregation of particles. The low colloidal stability of
the particles in the hydrogel inks could affect the resolution and precision of the tissue scaffold
structures during 3D printing.
The findings of this investigation complement those of earlier studies, and it also has significant
implications for the understanding of how the interactions of different materials in a composite
and the synthesis conditions can influence the final properties of the hybrid material. Whilst
this study did not confirm the biodegradability and biocompatibility of the hydrogel formed
with the third method, it did partially validate the potential suitability of the hydrogel composed
of CNC, PPy, and GGMMA for high-quality 3D printing and fabrication of tissue constructs
for regeneration of electrically excitable tissues.

10. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
This project was set out to fabricate an electroconductive hydrogel of 3D printing formulation
for tissue engineering application. A natural progression of this work is to test the suitability
of the hydrogel inks with direct ink writing 3D printing and encapsulate cells in the hydrogel
to assess their viability. In future research, it could be worthwhile to explore a better setup for
a more representative electrochemical characterization of the hydrogels. For example, the CV
measurement in this thesis did not show any increase in current for the hydrogel with PPy.
Previous studies have shown that in the electrochemical characterization of hydrogels, the
passage of ions through the hydrogel and its thickness as well as placement and geometry of
the electrodes are key factors. In literature, a predominant approach for the EIS analysis of
hydrogels with varying composition is to insert the hydrogel in between two electrodes (e.g.
gold-coated glass slides or stainless steel mesh electrodes) in one cell. The hydrogel is usually
held with a clip to maintain a constant distance between the electrodes.154,161 Another reported
approach is the use of a Pt wire mesh which was inserted into the hydrogel in a three-electrode
setup.162 When such setups are used, the performed measurements focus on the changes in the
impedance rendered by, for instance, different cross-linkers and residual charged monomers.
Therefore, a different setup is needed to fully understand the electrochemical implications of
the different components of the fabricated hydrogel.

Furthermore, considering that the hydrogel is meant to be a temporary scaffold for the delivery
and integration of cells and/or growth factors at the repair site, further research is required to
establish the biodegradability of the hydrogel because, in reconstructive medicine,
degradability must be predictable so that tissue regeneration occurs at a rate that matches the
degradation of the scaffold.34 Also, considering the potential application of the hydrogel,
further research could usefully explore the EIS response of the hydrogel in a phosphatebuffered saline solution which is more commonly used in biological research due to its
similarity with physiological conditions.154
Finally, since the coating of PPy on the negatively charged CNC reduces the electrostatic
repulsion required to maintain colloidal stability and prevent particle aggregation, it could be
worthwhile to explore the use of PEDOT:PSS as the conductive polymer. Since GGMMA does
not affect electrostatic repulsion, the comparatively higher conductivity of PEDOT:PSS could
produce better results.
