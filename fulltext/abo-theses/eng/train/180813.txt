Foreword
I want to thank Geberit Production Oy in Ekenäs for giving me the opportunity to make this master’s
thesis. The sanitaryware field has been completely new for me and I have learnt a lot throughout
this very interesting journey.
Special thanks go to my mentors Tove Lagerström and Timo Malmi at Geberit as well as Frank
Pettersson at Åbo Akademi, they were always there for me when I needed guidance. I also want to
thank D.Sc. Arto Ojuva and M.Sc. Teemu Yli-Hallila for their expertise on the measurement probes.
Finally, I want to thank my girlfriend for her support and patience throughout this entire process.
My family has also been very supportive and provided accommodation during my time at the
Geberit plant.

Abstract
In this master’s thesis, done in collaboration with Geberit in Ekenäs, the goal was to determine
whether a new in-line measurement probe was suitable for monitoring and controlling the slip
manufacturing process. The measurement method the probe uses is based on passive resonance
sensors. The probe measures losses in an electromagnetic field close to the probe’s sensor. A total
of five measurement probes were placed in different tanks to monitor different phases of slip
production and the probes sent data packets to a local PC where they were stored. The
measurement results were also uploaded to a cloud service based on Microsoft Azure. From there
they were easily accessible.
The conclusion was that the probes in their current state are not recommended for controlling the
slip manufacturing process. The measurement results provided by the probes were distorted due to
the probes absorbing silicon and aluminum close to the sensors’ surfaces, which made analyzing the
results challenging. The results were compensated to eliminate the effects of this absorption, but it
did not help in finding correlations between probe and conventional measurement results.
There were also some issues with reliability as one probe stopped sending data packets and needed
to be replaced. Occasionally no results would be sent to the cloud service, and this is thought to be
caused by at least partly by the internal firewall.
The probes are constantly being improved and it would be fair to give them another chance once
these problems have been ironed out. The technology is impressive, and they could give more
insight about the slip manufacturing process once they work as intended.

Abstrakt
I detta diplomarbete, som gjorts i samarbete med Geberit i Ekenäs, var målet att avgöra ifall en ny
in-line mätsond var lämplig för övervakning och styrning av den keramiska massans
tillverkningsprocess. Den mätmetod sonderna använder är baserad på passivresonanssensorer, och
sonderna mäter förluster i elektromagnetiska fält nära sondernas sensorer. Totalt fem mätsonder
placerades i olika behållare för att övervaka olika faser i massatillverkningen, och sonderna skickade
datapaket till en lokal PC där resultaten lagrades. Mätresultaten laddades även upp till en
cloudtjänst som är baserad på Microsoft Azure, där resultaten var lätt tillgängliga.
Slutsatsen var att sonderna i sina nuvarande tillstånd inte rekommenderas för att styra massans
tillverkningsprocess. Mätsondernas resultat var förvrängda på grund av absorberad kisel och
aluminium nära sensorernas ytor, och detta gjorde resultatens analys utmanande. Dessa resultat
kompenserades för att eliminera absorptionens påverkan, men det hjälpte inte att hitta
korrelationer mellan sondernas resultat och de konventionella mätresultaten.
Det fanns även problem med pålitlighet då en sond slutade skicka datapaket och ersattes av en
annan sond. Stundvis skickades inga mätresultat till cloudtjänsten, och dessa problem misstänks
åtminstone delvis bero på företagets interna brandvägg.
Sonderna utvecklas hela tiden, och det skulle vara rättvist att ge sonderna en ny chans då alla
problem har åtgärdats. Teknologin är imponerande, och de kunde ge mera insikt om keramiska
massans tillverkningsprocess då de fungerar som avsett.

1. Introduction
Throughout time, humans have felt a need to learn new things as well as to find improvements to
existing phenomena in order to secure their success. Our ancestors learned how to light fires in
order to keep themselves warm and to prepare food. If they found an action to be too difficult to
complete by using the human body alone, they would develop tools, such as the wheel, bow and
arrow among other inventions, in order to make the tasks at hand easier to complete or enable
entirely new things to be available.
A natural step forward was to find uses for the very earth they inhabited. For example, there is
evidence that indicates humans could create ceramic objects around 20,000 years ago in the Jiangxi
province in China (Wu, et al., 2012). Clay was found to be useful as raw material for building in
ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia by letting the clay dry in the sun into a desirable shape. While this
method does function to an extent, it is not an optimal solution, since these clay blocks tend to
dissolve if they encounter enough water. Later it was found that the clay hardens in an irreversible
way if it is burnt in high temperatures, often accomplished in an oven of sorts. (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)
This is the beginning of ceramics. The term has its roots in Greek and comes from the words
keramikos or keramos. Ceramics often refers to solid objects that largely consist of inorganic
compounds and that have been burnt in order to obtain their hardness and form. The inorganic
compounds often contain oxygen, silica as well as alkali metals, alkaline earth metals in different
forms, but the most common compounds are quartz and different types of oxides. (Jylhä-Vuorio,
2003)
Regarding traditional manufacturing of ceramic slips, no significant improvements or changes have
been made in recent times. The same raw materials are extracted from the ground and mixed with
water and some additives in order to obtain the ceramic slip. It appears the same stagnation applies
to the analysis of the quality of the ceramic slip. The slip has rheological parameters such as density,
viscosity and thixotropy, and these are measured from samples of the slips. These parameters have
been measured and utilized for quality control for decades by now (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003). The
drawback with analyzing samples in a laboratory is that the result is not obtained in real-time, but
often with delays measured in hours or even up to a few days depending on the variable. Therefore,
Geberit Production Oy wants to examine the possibility of using an inline probe in order to access
real-time data about the slip or possibly a new measurable parameter for improved quality control.
This thesis is structured as follows: it will begin with the raw materials and the chemistry of ceramic
slips and then the traditional analysis methods used by the company will be explained. After this the
new measurement probe and its functioning principles will be introduced. The measurement data
obtained from the probes will be processed and analyzed, and the end goal is to conclude whether
the probes contribute to increased quality control of the slip or not and if Geberit’s Ekenäs plant
should continue to use the probes after the trial period.

2. Raw materials for ceramic slip production
Ceramic materials are traditionally compounds of metals and non-metals. These could contain
lattice, glass phases and porosities (Asteljoki, 1974). The non-metallic component often comprises
of oxygen. These compounds are commonly known as oxides. The non-metallic component may
also consist of nitrogen, carbon, or boron, especially among newer ceramic materials. (Törmälä &
Järvelä, 1980)
This chapter will present information about the raw materials used in the manufacturing of ceramic
slip by Geberit in Ekenäs. The raw materials can generally be divided into two main categories:
plastic materials and non-plastic materials.

2.1 Plastic materials
Plastic materials are often rich in different clay particles. Clay minerals are hydrous aluminum
phyllosilicates with a sheetlike structure and a very small particle size. The structure of clay minerals
has largely been determined by X-ray diffraction methods. Clay minerals are generally built up by
two different sheets: tetrahedral and octahedral sheets. (Kodama & Grim, 2020)
Silicates are built up from SiO4-tetrahedrons with silicon in the center of the tetrahedron and with
oxygens in the corners. These tetrahedrons can form many different structures, depending on how
they interconnect. The tetrahedral sheet is obtained when each tetrahedron shares three oxygens
to form a hexagonal pattern, as seen in Figure 1. The ratio between Si and O is 2:5. All the
tetrahedrons have the apex pointing upward from the sheet. (Norton, 1970)

Figure 1: Schematic picture of the tetrahedral sheet (Kodama & Grim, 2020)
The octahedral sheet consists of a pair of octahedral-packed hydroxyl (OH-) sheets closely
superposed with cations between them, commonly Al3+, Mg2+, Fe2+ or Fe3+ (see Figure 2). The cation

2

spaces can either be completely filled or two-thirds filled. These are called trioctahedral or
dioctahedral, respectively. (Norton, 1970)

Figure 2: Schematic picture of the octahedral sheet (Kodama & Grim, 2020).
The tetrahedral and octahedral sheets can fit together to form the layers typical to clay minerals.
This happens when the upper apex oxygens of the tetrahedral sheet replace hydroxyls of the
octahedral sheet (Figure 3). The result is called a 1:1-sheet, since it consists of one tetrahedral sheet
and one octahedral sheet. It is also possible to form a 2:1-sheet, in which one octahedral sheet is
sandwiched by two tetrahedral sheets. (Norton, 1970)

Figure 3: Schematic picture of a 1:1 sheet structure (Kodama & Grim, 2020).

2.1.1 Ball clay
Norton (1970) defines ball clay as “a sedimentary clay of fine-grain size, usually containing some
organic matter and having good plasticity, high green strength and a white or cream color after
firing”. The main mineral in ball clay is kaolinite. It may also contain other minerals, such as
montmorillonite, halloysite, illite and quartz (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003). Ball clay has some key advantages
that make it an essential component in ceramic slip manufacturing:
-

it increases the workability (plasticity) of the body
it increases the green strength of the body
some ball clays have fluxing abilities to give tighter firing.

There are also some drawbacks with ball clays, however. Ball clays may contain iron oxide and
titanium to such amounts that it could impair the whiteness of fired bodies. Also, even relatively
3

small amounts of ball clay decrease the translucency of the body. The composition of a single ball
clay can vary significantly. It is, therefore, recommended by Jylhä-Vuorio (2003) to use two or three
different ball clays in the manufacturing of ceramic slip. (Norton, 1970)
It is also unwise to only use ball clay for slip production, since the slip would be too plastic and
“slippery”. Ball clay can bind vast amounts of water to itself and has high drying shrinkage, which
may lead to cracks if it is not accounted for. (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)
Worrall (1956) has investigated organic matters in ball clays and found that most of the organics
were lignite. The lignite can be categorized into waxes, resins, and lignin-humus by the types of
solvents used. The lignin-humus is thought to form protective colloids that affect the flow properties
of the slip. Worrall was able to determine that most of the organic particles are quite coarse and
are, therefore, easy to separate from the slip. In the finer fractions, the amount of organic matter
increases linearly with the surface area. This would indicate that the organic colloids are adsorbed
on the surface of the clay particles. These colloids are the ones that are useful for the flow properties
of the slip, as they keep the clay particles apart from each other. In an experiment, Worrall showed
that a lignin-humus extract added to a slip was able to decrease the minimum viscosity and the
tendency of the slip to settle. Norton (1970) thinks this lignin-humus found in ball clays is one of the
most important features of ball clays, overall. He even discusses the possibility of creating artificial
ball clay and simply adding this extract in order to minimize the negative effects of ball clay, while
still achieving the positive effects of the organics.
Ball clays contain larger amounts of soluble salts than kaolin. These have some effect on the flow
properties of the slip. The salts are often sulphates and chlorides of the most common oxides, such
as Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, K2O. Ball clays are, in general, finer than kaolin, although this can vary
considerably between different ball clays. (Norton, 1970)
Geberit’s Ekenäs plant uses two different ball clays to minimize the negative effects if the
composition of the raw materials fluctuates. Table 1 shows the chemical compositions of the ball
clays currently used in Ekenäs.

When comparing the two ball clays it is apparent that they are quite similar in terms of particle sizes.
The goal would be to minimize the impact of a single clay in the recipe if a batch of a clay was to
vary significantly from normal properties instead of achieving different things with the two clays.

2.1.2 Kaolin
The term kaolin is thought to originate from the Chinese word kao ling, meaning “high ridge”. A
pure kaolinite crystal has the following chemical composition: Al2 O3 ∙ 2SiO2 ∙ 2H2 O, and has a 1:1
sheet structure (Norton, 1970). Kaolin is a general term used for those clays that mainly contain
kaolinite crystals, and therefore the same composition may be used to describe kaolin as well (JylhäVuorio, 2003).
The addition of kaolin into a ceramic slip has the following properties:
-

kaolin is quite white after drying and firing, which is convenient for sanitaryware
the casting time for the slip becomes shorter than that for pure ball clay
kaolin leads to a more fluid slip than ball clay. (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)

The kaolinite particles are normally hexagonal plates with a diameter commonly in the range of 0.05
to 10 microns. The thickness of the plate is around 12 times smaller than the diameter. Refined
kaolin has a density between 2.1 and 2.6 g/cm3 and has a melting temperature region of 1750-1770
°C. The addition of kaolin in ceramic slips increases its melting temperature considerably. When
kaolin is fired, the crystallization water evaporates, which results in metakaolin that is approximately
13.95% lighter. In temperatures above 1,100 °C, kaolin largely turns into mullite; 2(Al2 O3 ∙ 2SiO2 ) +
5SiO2 , while the SiO2 that is released becomes amorphous. (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)
At the time of writing, Geberit’s Ekenäs plant uses two different kaolins in slip manufacturing: one
traditional kaolin (kaolin 1) and one that is almost a mix of kaolin and ball clay (kaolin 2). The
chemical compositions for the kaolins are presented in table 2 below.

2.2 Non-plastic materials
2.2.1 Feldspar
Feldspars are very common and constitute almost 60 percent of all igneous rocks. It is the most
central component after clays in fine ceramic industries. One of its most important properties is the
fact that it is one of very few sources of water-insoluble alkali compounds, which are relevant
melting agents. (Norton, 1970)
6

There are a few different types of feldspars, with the most common being
- K 2 O ∙ Al2 O3 ∙ 6SiO2 (potash feldspar)
- Na2 O ∙ Al2 O3 ∙ 6SiO2 (sodium feldspar) and
- CaO ∙ Al2 O3 ∙ 2SiO2 (calcium feldspar),
with potash feldspar being the most common followed by sodium feldspar. This can be a little
misleading, since the potash feldspar usually contains nearly equal amounts of sodium, while
sodium feldspar can also be rich in potassium. The two feldspars form a eutectic point if the ratio is
35% sodium feldspar and 65% potash feldspar, and the melting point for this eutectic mixture is
1,070 °C, which is lower than for any of the two components. (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)
At around 1,000 °C, potash feldspar starts to “weld” together the other raw materials of the clay
mass. As the temperature rises to 1,300 °C, the mass has started to form glass that dissolves clay
particles and quartz, and the amount of quartz in the mass diminishes as the formation of a mullite
lattice starts to dominate. (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)
The commercial feldspars are not really found in a pure form, but rather in pegmatites (usually the
“granite” type). These pegmatites tend to contain feldspar, quartz and mica. The feldspar that is
used for slip production by Geberit in Ekenäs comes from pegmatite that has been cleaned from
mica and further cleaned by high magnetic separation in order to remove iron-containing minerals.
The chemical composition for the pegmatite used is shown in Table 3 below.

2.2.2 Silica
Silica is the most plentiful mineral in the earth’s crust and is found almost everywhere. Its main
components are silicon and oxygen and it has the theoretical form SiO2. This is not to be confused
with the silicate ions (SiO44-) that make up the silica lattice. The silicates share their oxygens in the
lattice, so that for every silicate ion there are approximately two oxygen ions, hence the theoretical
form. The silicate ion is shaped like a tetrahedron with an oxygen ion in each corner and when these
corners are shared with other tetrahedrons, quartz is formed. Depending on the circumstances
(such as temperature, pressure, bonding angle), there can also be other variations of SiO2, and these
are called cristobalite, tridymite among others. (Norton, 1970)
Quartz acts like the skeleton of the ceramic slip while clay is the flesh, i.e. it gives the slip some
structure and thins out the slip if it is too plastic. The addition of quartz lowers the drying shrinkage
of the slip, but also decreases its green strength. The quartz in a slip increases its melting
temperature and supports the structure of the sintering mass. (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)
As mentioned before, the lattice structure of the silica can be structurally different under differing
circumstances. These changes in lattice structure often lead to a volume increase or decrease inside
the ceramic mass, and this needs to be accounted for during heating of the body in order to prevent
deformation or cracking of the ceramic body. In room temperature quartz, cristobalite and tridymite
are all in so called 𝛼-forms. The tridymite lattice converts to 𝛽-form in nine steps between 75 and
200 °C, which results in a volume increase of 3%. The cristobalite structure changes from 𝛼 to 𝛽
when temperatures reach 226 °C and above. This structural change will also lead to a volume
increase of around 3%.
The quartz lattice has its critical point at 573 °C, which is when 𝛼-quartz becomes 𝛽-quartz (Figure
6), and this transformation will lead to an increase in volume of 2%, while the total volume change
between 0 and 573 °C is estimated to be just above 3%. It is recommended to carefully

Figure 6: Schematic pictures of 𝛼-quartz and 𝛽-quartz. (Hamer & Hamer, 2004, p. 327)

raise the temperature up to 600 °C when firing a ceramic body in order to avoid cracks and other
deformations in the body. The same structural changes may be reversed when the body is cooled
down after firing, which is why the cooling needs to be slowed down typically between 600 and
500 °C and between 300 and 200 °C. (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)

Figures 7 a), b) and c) show the estimated volume increases for the lattice conversions of quartz,
cristobalite and tridymite respectively.
During slip production in Ekenäs, it is assumed that the quartz used contains very little or no
cristobalite and tridymite. The bodies are cooled relatively fast and it ought to be noticed if the
quartz did contain noticeable amounts of cristobalite or tridymite due to cracks in the bodies.

Figure 7: Estimated volume expansions as function of temperature for a) quartz, b) cristobalite and
c) tridymite (Hamer & Hamer, 2004, p. 328-329).

The quartz used in Ekenäs is produced from pegmatite ore using flotation. The mica is first removed
and then the feldspar and quartz are separated. The quartz is further cleaned by high magnetic
separation to remove iron-containing minerals. Table 4 shows the typical chemical composition of
the quartz used for slip production in Ekenäs.

3. Chemical properties of the slip
The raw materials discussed above are all dry powders or hardened materials until they are mixed
with water, which is when the plastic slip is formed. The rheological properties of the ceramic slip
are largely defined by the electrical charges that exist on the surface of the clay particles. (JylhäVuorio, 2003) It is, therefore, important to understand the chemical interaction between water and
clay particles before diving into the rheological properties.

3.1 Water-clay suspensions
Water molecules contain one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. These molecules are polar
thanks to the oxygen atom being highly electronegative compared to the hydrogens and due to the
angle between the hydrogen atoms being less than 180°. If the water molecule were shaped like
CO2, it would not be polar, since the two polar bonds would cancel each other out due to being on
opposite sides of the electronegative oxygen. This bent structure gives water molecules an electrical
dipole moment and the ability to attract other dipolar molecules and ions through hydrogen bonds
or ion- dipole forces. (Campbell, Williamson & Heyden, 2006)
Clay particles are mostly negatively charged on the surface and mostly positively charged around
the hexagonal edges. These charges need to be balanced out by free ions or polar molecules, such
as water molecules, and this will lead to ions adsorbing to the particle surface or the positive dipole
of water molecules to form hydrogen bonds with the surface of the clay particles and form a thin
water membrane on the surface of the clay particle. The difference in charges of the particles and
the bulk liquid that causes this behavior is called zeta potential (Hunter, 1988). Now the surface of
the particle is quite negatively charged, and so another layer of oppositely charged ions or molecule
dipoles will become attracted to the surface charge via the Coulomb force, thus electrically
screening the first layer. The second layer is loosely associated with the particle, since it is electrically
attracted to the surface rather than being anchored to the particle surface. It is, thus, called the
diffuse double layer, or alternatively electrical double layer. (Hunter, 1988)
The thin water membrane mentioned above allows the particles to glide close to other particles
freely. If the slip remains untouched for a while, however, the positively charged edges will begin to
turn towards and attach to the surface of other clay particles, and this results in a structure that
resembles a house of cards. This phenomenon is called flocculation. (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)
Surfaces of solids immersed in water can adsorb ions dissolved in the water due to, supposedly,
unsaturated bonds at the solid surface. The total amount of adsorbed ions is dependent on the
surface area of the solids. Some surfaces have the ability to preferentially adsorb certain ions from
a solution and, as a result, some ions may be exchanged for others. The general rule of thumb is
that finer clay can adsorb more cations due to the increased surface area. Johnson and Lawrence
(1942) were able to show that the exchange capacity for kaolinite was directly proportional to the
total surface area of particles. (Norton, 1970)
Cations can also swap places with other cations of the structural lattice of clay particles (Johansen,
1979). An example of this would be the addition of soda ash to clay containing structural calcium
(see reaction 1):
11

Ca − clay + Na2 O3 → Na − clay + CaCO3

(1)

The calcium ions are replaced by sodium ions from the soda ash, and due to the relatively big size
of sodium ions they are able to break the structure of water molecules near the surface of the clay
particles. This will result in an even larger negative charge than initially on the surface of the clay
particle, which in turn leads to repulsion between clay particles. This repulsion is so effective that
even small amounts of water are sufficient to keep a ceramic slip runny. This phenomenon is called
deflocculation or dispersion. (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)

3.2 Flocculants and deflocculants
Flocculants are substances that make the clay particles stick to each other and form flocs, commonly
in the shape of card houses. Examples of flocculants used in slip production are calcium sulfate
(CaSO4), magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and acetic acid (CH3COOH). When the flocculants dissolve in
the slip, small ions such as Ca2+, Mg2+ and H+ are attracted to the surfaces of clay particles and
strengthen the electrical pull of the clay particle. After this, the clay particles can begin to form the
floc structures more spontaneously (Johansen, 1979). Flocculants are generally not needed during
slip production in Ekenäs. If needed, though, gypsum (CaSO4∙ 2H20) is the flocculant of choice.
Deflocculants, in contrast, are soluble materials which are added to clay suspensions to increase
fluidity. The deflocculant creates this fluidity by increasing the electrostatic forces of repulsion in
the clay particles so that they begin to repel each other. This way the particles will slide past each
other rather than form flocs even with relatively small amounts of water. (Hamer & Hamer, 2004)
Some examples of deflocculants used in slip production are sodium silicate ((Na2O)x∙(SiO2)y, the SiO2
amount varies) and soda ash (Na2CO3). Alkaline ions are larger than the flocculating ions mentioned
above and, apart from the water structure breaking abilities of the sodium ions, they are also large
enough to keep clay particles apart from each other as such (Johansen, 1979). Hamer & Hamer
(2004) talk about larger “stand-off distance” in sodium ions than e.g. calcium ions.
There are two types of deflocculants: an alkali cation type and a polyanion type. It is typical to use
one of both types in slip production since, although they are both used for deflocculation, they give
different side effects, e.g. upon thixotropy. The alkali cation deflocculant is the one described earlier
that promotes cation exchange according to equation (1). The new cation (often sodium) increases
the particle’s zeta potential. In equation (1) the calcium that is replaced takes up the carbonate
radical and becomes an insoluble particle in the slip. There is a limit for the deflocculatory effect
which is achievable with cation exchange deflocculants. If more deflocculant is added after every
cation has been exchanged, it will have a flocculatory effect, since the surplus cations will crowd
into the stand-off distance gaps, thus lowering the zeta potential. This is called over-doping. Soda
ash is a great example of an alkali cation deflocculant (Hamer & Hamer, 2004).
The polyanion deflocculants provide cations for the outer layer of the clay particles, such as cation
exchange deflocculants, but they also enter the inner layers of the particles. The polyanion part of
the deflocculant replaces the anions in the clay particles, which are often hydroxyl groups with single
negative charges. This results in an overall increased negative charge inside the particle, which will
require more positively charged ions on the surface in order to balance out. The charge of the outer
layer will, therefore, be stronger and the zeta potential has increased. It is possible to add too much
12

polyanion deflocculant to the slip, but the negative effect will be smaller unless a great excess of
deflocculant is added. This is due to the fact that surplus anions will crowd the diffuse double layer,
which does not hurt the cation outer layer enough to affect the zeta potential. Instead, it would
seem that the excess anions in the double layer prevent cations from overcrowding it. Sodium
silicate is an example of polyanion deflocculants. (Hamer & Hamer, 2004)

3.3 Drying
Drying is a crucial step when manufacturing sanitaryware. It is a balancing act between removing
water quickly and avoiding warping or cracking due to stress within the body. In the slip, water can
appear in three different ways:
- in free form between clay particles and acts a lubricant of sorts. The evaporation of this water
causes drying shrinkage in the body,
- hidden inside porosities of clay and other particles thanks to surface tension, even when the body
is technically dry or
- chemically bound to the lattice structures and fully evaporates only when the mass is heated above
600 °C (Lawrence & West, 1982). (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)
The total amount of water adsorbed depends on the water vapor partial pressure. Coarse-grained
kaolin has a fairly low adsorption, while ball clay can adsorb nearly twice as much water. Bentonite,
which is rich in the very plastic clay mineral montmorillonite, has adsorption abilities up to ten times
greater than kaolin due to interplane adsorption. (Norton, 1970) Geberit in Ekenäs does not use raw
materials that are rich in montmorillonite or mica, due to the vast amounts of water they tend to
adsorb.
The first step of drying is removing the water that is in free form (or shrinkage water, as it is also
called). Stage 1 in Figure 9 depicts a ceramic slip in free form. The surface tension of the evaporating
water creates capillary pressure in the slip, which leads to a decrease in the volume and some
friction between particles (stage 2 in Figure 9). High humus content and very fine particles increase
the shrinkage. In stage 3, the clay is called leather hard. Due to the particles getting in contact with
each other, the surface openings begin to close and the water that is trapped inside the body will
have to travel further distances to find pores in the surface to evaporate through. As time passes,
this becomes increasingly difficult. It is, therefore, crucial to attempt to dry the body as evenly as
possible before firing. It is likely that water deposits inside the body will lead to steam explosions
where the water content is high.
In stage 4, the body does not shrink anymore. The weight, however, still decreases when pore water
evaporates. It is possible that some pore water remains in the body even after the body is seemingly
dry, if the surface of the body has dried shut. This is as dry as the body will become with air drying.
(Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003), (Norton, 1970), (Hamer & Hamer, 2004)

13

Figure 9: Five different stages of ceramic slip drying. (Hamer & Hamer, 2004)
The small amounts of pore water that are left in the body after drying will evaporate through the
surface during firing. The crystal lattice water will usually evaporate during lattice changes at higher
temperatures. The result in stage 5 is called bone-dry clay, and it should contain trace amounts of
lattice water at most. (Hamer & Hamer, 2004)
Drying shrinkage is most commonly given in percent. If a body is 100 cm long before drying and 90
cm long after drying, the resulting drying shrinkage would be given as
∆𝑙
100 − 90 cm
∙ 100% →
∙ 100% = 10%
𝑙0
100 cm

(2)

Very fine clay particles have a larger surface area for the water molecules to bond to, which results
in more drying shrinkage as a result, see figure 10. Ball clays result in higher drying shrinkages than
kaolin and non-plastic materials. Montmorillonite, along with other very plastic materials, result in
substantial drying and firing shrinkages as well as an increased chance for cracks and warping due
to the vast amounts of water they adsorb. These materials are able to hold water between lattice
planes of the 2:1-sheet structure, which initially vastly increases the volume and consequently
decreases the volume during drying and firing. (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003), (Norton, 1970)
Figure 10: The effect of particle size on drying shrinkage.

Non-plastic raw materials are, by particle size, on average noticeably coarser than plastic raw
materials. These non-plastic materials do not possess relevant surface charges like those found on
the surfaces of clay particles either. These properties allow for very little water adsorption and, thus,
non-plastic materials are used to decrease water need and drying shrinkage of the ceramic slip.
(Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)

4. Laboratory analysis methods
The laboratory in Geberit’s Ekenäs plant is responsible for quality control of the ceramic slip, glaze,
raw materials and fired bodies among others. Samples are taken according to a control schedule,
and these samples are then analyzed using standard procedures. The results are then calculated and
documented in a database. If there are anomalies in the results, the laboratory will inform
supervisors about this.
In this chapter, different measurable properties of ceramic slips will be discussed and the methods
the laboratory in Ekenäs uses to measure and analyze these properties are described. It is not
uncommon that laboratories have slightly differing methods for measuring certain properties due
to the experimental nature of the tests. The numbers are, therefore, difficult to compare to those
of another laboratory, and the main purpose of the results should be comparison with earlier data
to assess the quality.

4.1 Drying rate
A casting slip’s drying rate affects how long it takes until the body has reached the desired moisture
level during drying. This is of great importance as slow drying means that the drying process will
require more time or that the body will contain too much water and, therefore, risk cracking or
warping during firing. As mentioned before, plastic materials tend to increase the drying rate while
non-plastic materials decrease the drying rate.
Geberit measures the drying rate of a slip by filling a mold with the casting slip for a set casting time.
When the time has passed, the excess slip is removed from the mold and a stopwatch is started.
The surface of the slip is glossy at this point due to a present water film. The goal is to measure the
time elapsed for the water film on the surface to dry completely. This happens when the entire
surface of the body is matte. The time it takes for this to happen is called the drying rate.

4.2 Casting thickness
The casting thickness is a measure of how quickly the body’s cast walls are formed. This is measured
to gain knowledge about the casting time required to produce bodies that do not break after casting,
since newly casted bodies are quite fragile and susceptible to any forces that could cause inner
tensions in the body.
These tensions may lead to deformations, commonly known as seams, fins or spares, during firing
(Figure 11 a). When the body is cast in a mold, the clay particles are oriented parallel to the mold
surface. If the mold contains multiple pieces, a seam will most likely appear on the resulting green
body. If a force is exerted on a green body, it might cause the clay particles to orient differently and,
therefore, lead to tension within the body. Seams and other deformities may be sponged or scraped
until the surface is even (Figure 11 b), but when the body sinters during firing the inner tensions
strive to release and this shows as a ridge or bump on the surface of the fired body (Figure 11 c).
(Norton, 1970)

15

Figure 11: a) Green body with a deformity b) Deformity removed before firing c) Deformity
returned after firing.
Casting thickness is measured in Ekenäs by casting a flat body for a set amount of time. When this
time has elapsed, a set area of the body is cut out and weighed. The weight of the cut-out mass is a
measure of the casting thickness.

4.3 Density
Density (or liter weight) is a measure that gives how much a certain volume of ceramic slip weighs.
The result is given in g/l in Ekenäs. If the density is lower than normally, it either indicates that there
is too much water in the slip or too little raw materials. Generally, the main goal for Ekenäs is to
have as high density as possible in the slip without affecting its flow properties.
The laboratory test is fairly straightforward. A metal cylinder that has been measured to be 1 l is
filled to the brim with the sample slip, which is cooled down to 25 °C. A lid with a hole in it is placed
on the cylinder, which presses excess slip out through the hole in the lid. Now the cylinder contains
one liter of slip. The cylinder is cleaned and dried before weighing the cylinder and content. The
weight of the cylinder has been subtracted from the reading of the scale, and the reading given is
hence directly the density of the slip.

4.4 Viscosity
Viscosity is a measure of the resistance, in the form of inner friction between adjacent moving
layers, that a liquid offers to flow. For a pure liquid the viscosity is defined as follows. Two parallel,
adjacent planes with an area A and a distance x from each other are moving relative to each other
at a velocity v. The frictional force per unit area or shear stress F/A is given by:
−

𝐹
𝑑𝑣
=𝜂∙ ,
𝐴
𝑑𝑥

where 𝜂 is the coefficient of viscosity and

𝑑𝑣
𝑑𝑥

(3)

is the rate of shear. At constant temperatures, the

viscosity coefficient is also constant for pure liquids. Ceramic slips, however, are not regarded as
pure liquids. The viscosities are not constant and are affected by mechanical work such as stirring.
The measured viscosity of a slip depends on the shear rate at the time the measurement was made.
These fluids are also called non-newtonian, and the measured viscosity is often called apparent
viscosity. (Worrall, 1982)
One way of measuring apparent viscosity in Ekenäs is rather simple and involves manual labor. A
sample is cooled down to 25 °C and stirred carefully. It is then poured into a pipe viscometer, which
contains a valve in the bottom, until the pipe is full. The valve is then opened, causing the sample to
flow out, and a stopwatch is started. The stopwatch is stopped when a set volume of slip has flowed
16

into a measuring glass below the pipe viscometer. The time in seconds is directly a measure of
apparent viscosity, which is comparable to earlier results.
Another way of measuring apparent viscosity is with a rotational rheometer; an example of one is
shown in figure 12.

Figure 12 (left): A rotational rheometer that measures rheological parameters. (Anton Paar, 2016)
Figure 13 (right): Cross-section of the cylinder showing the sample (blue) between two cylinders.
(Wikipedia, 2020a)
The sample is first cooled down to 25 °C and stirred, after which it is placed in a cylinder. A rotational
cylinder is then lowered into the sample. This places the sample within the annulus of the two
cylinders (see figure 13). The inner cylinder rotates at set speeds and measures the shear stress and
velocity at certain intervals. The viscosity can then be calculated for these data points and is given
in mPa∙s. When the difference between the values in viscosity of two data points is calculated, a
measure for thixotropy is also obtained.

4.5 Thixotropy
Mewis and Wagner (2009) have found that thixotropy should be defined as “the continuous
decrease of viscosity with time when flow is applied to a sample that has been previously at rest
and the subsequent recovery of viscosity in time when the flow is discontinued”. In other words,
thixotropy is a decrease in viscosity of a fluid when it is subject to a force that puts it in motion. After
some time, if the fluid is no longer in motion, viscosity will return to its initial value. The cause of
this behavior is found in the attractive forces between the particles in the slip. They cause the
formation of “house of cards” flocs, if no external forces are exerted on the slip, which results in
increased viscosity. These interparticle bonds are, however, weak enough to be broken by
mechanical stresses that occur during flow or stirring. This leads to a decrease in viscosity and the
slip flows smoother. (Mewis & Wagner, 2009)

17

Thixotropy is a vital property for casting slips. It allows the slip to be transported to the casting molds
with relative ease, and when it sets in the mold it thickens quickly, which allows for shorter casting
times.
As mentioned above, a measure for thixotropy is obtainable with a rotational rheometer. Two
values for viscosity, which are measured a certain time apart, are subtracted and the result is a
measure for thixotropy. It is important to know when the measurements have been made, since
thixotropy is time dependent. Otherwise, the results cannot be compared.
There is a more traditional way of measuring thixotropy in Ekenäs. That is with a torsion viscometer
of Gallenkamp type. It is a viscosity measuring device developed mainly for the ceramic industry.
The machine is manually operated, and it comprises of a vertical torsion wire connected to a
flywheel over a graduated scale, and a cylinder (or bob), which is suspended under the scale (see
figure 14). (e.j.payne ceramic, 2018)

Figure 14: A torsion viscometer of Gallenkamp type. (e.j.payne ceramic, 2018)
When the flywheel is rotated 360 ° and then released, the viscosity of the slip sample causes the
bob to slow down and eventually stop at a peak value, which is readable on the scale. The result of
the Gallenkamp is often given as degrees overshoot, since the flywheel rotates beyond the initial
360 ° before stopping at the peak value and returning to equilibrium.
When using the Gallenkamp in Ekenäs, the slip sample is cooled down to 25 °C and stirred carefully.
The flywheel on the Gallenkamp is then rotated 360 ° and locked in position. As soon as the stirring
is complete, the sample container is filled and placed so that the entire bob is submerged in the
sample. Now, the flywheel is released. When it stops (before returning to equilibrium), the peak
value is written down. This is the first viscosity value for the slip. When the flywheel has stopped it
is again rotated 360 ° and locked in position. A timer is set to count down for six minutes. When this
time has elapsed, the flywheel is released again and a second value for viscosity is obtained. The
thixotropy is the difference between the first and the second viscosity values. This may also be called
“six-minute thixotropy”, due to the time elapsed between the results.

18

4.6 Permeability
In ceramics, the permeability of the slip determines the rate at which water can be removed from
the slip. Permeability affects the casting rate of the slip, as it is advantageous if the body is cleared
of water as quickly as possible. High permeability is generally found in flocculated slips, due to the
“house of cards”-structure formation. This advantage is negated by the fact that flocculated slips
require larger amounts of water than their deflocculated counterparts. If the slip is fully
deflocculated, however, the casting process might be unacceptably time consuming due to lack of
thixotropy. Worrall (1986) suggests adding deflocculant amounts just below those needed for
optimal deflocculation to preserve some thixotropy. This way cast walls may begin to form, with the
casting rate staying at a humane level. (Worrall, 1986)
Permeability of a slip is calculated, in Ekenäs, by using values obtained from a baroid test. The baroid
test measures the filterability of a slip. The equipment consists of a three-piece bomb unit (see
figure 15). The stand has a screw on top to tightly seal the bomb when pressurized. The bottom
piece of the bomb has an outlet where the filtrated water will exit from.

Figure 15: Picture of a baroid stand along with required components. (Universal Filtration &
Pumping solutions, Inc.)
The sample is cooled down to 25 °C before the baroid test. A screen, a moist filter paper and a
rubber ring are placed on the bottom of the bomb (see second picture of Figure 15). The cylinder is
filled halfway with the sample and placed in the stand. The pressure is set to 6 bar for 30 minutes,
which will lead to water being filtrated through the bottom outlet. This filtrate is collected in a
measuring glass below the outlet. When 30 minutes have elapsed, the cylinder is removed from the
stand and left to drain and dry for another 30 minutes. The filter cake is then weighed and the filtrate
volume in the measuring glass is verified.
The equation used in Ekenäs for finding the permeability K is the following:
𝐾=

𝑉𝑓𝑐 ∙𝑉𝑓
𝑐

𝐴 ∙𝑡∙𝑝

, 𝑐 = 𝜂 𝑐∙105 .
𝑤

19

(4)

𝑉𝑓𝑐 is the volume of the filter cake, which may be calculated when the density of the sample is
known. 𝑉𝑓 is the volume of the filtrate. 𝐴𝑐 is the filtration area inside the cylinder, 𝑡 is the time
elapsed with elevated pressure (30 minutes), 𝑝 is the elevated pressure (6 bar) and 𝜂𝑤 is the
viscosity of water in 25 °C.

4.7 Drying and firing shrinkage
The theory behind drying and the resulting drying shrinkage has been discussed in section 3.3.
During firing, the body undergoes irreversible changes and will not dissolve in water anymore, unlike
unfired bodies. This change is called the ceramic change. Firing progresses in different steps and
causes shrinkage in a few different ways.
After drying there could still be some pore water left in the body. This pore water is driven out by
heat during early firing. This phase of firing is called water smoking, and it is considered complete
at around 120 °C. The temperature increase needs to be moderate, since steam pressure will rise
and possibly crack the body if the temperature increase is too aggressive. (Hamer & Hamer, 2004)
Some clays contain ”vegetable matter”, which breaks down around temperatures of 200 °C (this is
called decomposition). This process is not really a burning process, but instead resembles
decomposing. Generally, the temperature is increased a bit faster at this stage than earlier, since
there are no changes in the slip that ought to cause problems. Cristobalite has its dunting point
around these temperatures, but the amounts are generally so small that the overall expansion is
negligible. (Hamer & Hamer, 2004)
Crystal lattice water is driven away at temperatures between 400 °C and 700 °C. The steam poses
little risk at this stage, as the water amounts are rarely substantial. The dunting point of quartz is
passed at 573 °C. It is recommended to slow down the temperature increase around this area.
The particles are now completely dry, but instead of becoming a pile of dust the body maintains its
form, thanks to sintering. Sintering is the “welding” of similar particles at very small contact surfaces.
Hamer & Hamer (2004) explain that “it is as if a vibration at these points creates an incandescence
of sufficient heat to fuse the tips together”. At this temperature interval, there is a minor shrinkage
due to sintering. (Hamer & Hamer, 2004)
Clays contain differing amounts of carbon and sulfur. Sulfur is oxidized at temperatures ranging from
700 °C up to 1,150 °C, while most of the carbon has oxidized by 900 °C. This process needs to be
completed, and it is recommended to slowly increase the temperature over a number of hours for
larger bodies, such as sanitaryware. If the oxidation is incomplete at this stage, the gas will become
stuck inside the body as the surface may become impervious during vitrification of the body, which
begins at around 800 °C. This is also known as bloating of the body. During the oxidation of the body,
no major changes in the body are observed. (Hamer & Hamer, 2004)
Vitrification begins at 800 °C, which is when sodium and potassium oxides start to flux free silica in
the body. This vitrification will progress as the temperatures rise, and the mass fills the pores
between particles (Hamer & Hamer, 2004). In the vicinity of 980 °C, metakaolin becomes spinel and
releases fine silica that further progresses the vitrification.

20

At temperatures between 1,050 °C and 1,200 °C, the spinel begins to transform into mullite crystals.
These crystals are described as long needled, and they vastly strengthen the final body. At the same
time, feldspar begins to melt and its volume decreases. When the vitrification progresses, the
porosity of the body decreases rapidly, since most of the porosities are filled with glass-like melt.
(Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)
Drying and firing shrinkage is measured in Ekenäs by casting test tiles (a minimum of two), which
are 100 mm long, and letting them dry overnight in a drying cabinet. They are further dried in 110
°C the following day before being measured. The lengths of the tiles after drying are now noted, and
after this the tiles are fired in an oven. The tiles are measured again after firing, and these results
are written down. The drying (equation 5) and firing (equation 6) shrinkages are given linearly in
percent with the following equations:
𝑆𝑑 (%) =

𝑙0 − 𝑙1
∙ 100%
𝑙0

(5)

𝑆𝑓 (%) =

𝑙1 − 𝑙2
∙ 100%,
𝑙1

(6)

where 𝑙0 is the length of the green body, 𝑙1 is the length of the dried body and 𝑙2 is the length of the
fired body. The total shrinkage of the body is defined as
𝑆𝑡 (%) =

𝑙0 − 𝑙2
∙ 100%
𝑙0

(7).

4.8 Modulus of rupture
Ceramics have very low ductility, which makes tensile testing on them quite meaningless. It is more
common to measure the modulus of rupture (MOR) or flexural strength of dry ceramic bodies. MOR
is tested in Ekenäs by casting six cylindrical rods and letting them dry in approximately 40 °C
overnight. Any seams and deformations are scraped, and the rods are again dried in 110 °C
overnight. After this, the rods are stored in an exicator to prevent the rods from absorbing moisture
before the flexural strength testing. The rods are tested one by one, and the rods are placed on top
of two supports located at a distance 𝑙 from each other. A machine begins to apply an increasing
force 𝐹 on the rod (see figure 16) until it breaks in half.

Figure 16: Schematic picture of a MOR test for a rod with a diameter 𝑑.

21

The force required is used for calculating MOR using the following equation:
MOR =

𝐹∙𝑙∙8
,
𝑑3 ∙ 𝜋

(8)

where 𝐹 is the force required to break the rod, 𝑙 is the distance between the supports and 𝑑 is the
average diameter of the rod at the breaking point. This diameter is the average of two diameters
measured at the breaking point, perpendicularly to each other. The unit for MOR is MPa.

4.9 Particle size distribution
The size range of particles and the distribution of mass in each size range affect many areas of
ceramics, such as drying, sintering, thixotropy, etc. It is, therefore, imperative to find out the particle
size distribution of ceramic slips used in mass production of sanitaryware. Ekenäs currently uses a
sedigraph for the analysis of particle size distribution.
The sedigraph operates based on two physical principles: sedimentation theory and x-ray
absorption (see figure 17). Stokes’ Law describes the drag force on a falling body as a function of its
diameter and velocity, as well as other properties of the body and the medium in which it is falling.
When the drag force equals the gravitational force, terminal settling velocity (𝑉𝑡 ) is achieved. Under
these equilibrium conditions, a measurement of terminal velocity allows the force equation to be
solved for particle diameter as follows:
1/2

𝐷 =

1/2
𝑉𝑡

(18ŋ)
[
]
(𝜌 − 𝜌0 )𝑔

,

(9)

where 𝐷 is the diameter of the spherical particle, 𝑉𝑡 its equilibrium sedimentation velocity, and 𝜌
its density. The ﬂuid medium is characterized by viscosity ŋ and density 𝜌0 , and 𝑔 is the acceleration
of gravity. (Micromeritics, 2020)
The Beer-Lambert Law describes, in this case, how much a beam of x-rays is attenuated by passing
through matter. The intensity of the incident beam 𝐼𝑖 is reduced exponentially to 𝐼𝑓 as it passes
through the absorber. It is a function of the absorptivity 𝜀 of the system, the concentration 𝑐 of the
absorber and the path length 𝑑 of the beam through the absorber. This relationship is:
𝐼𝑓
𝐼𝑖

= 𝑒 −𝜀𝑐𝑑 = 𝑇,

(10)

which deﬁnes a transmittance 𝑇 and has a range of values from zero to one. A value of zero means
total absorbance and 1 indicates no absorbance at all. (Micromeritics, 2020)

22

Figure 17: The functioning principle of a Sedigraph. (Micromeritics, 2020)
The results from sample analysis are automatically assembled into a report on a local PC. The
particle size distribution graphs used in chapter 2 are one example of what the Sedigraph can
produce for individual raw materials.

4.10 Porosity
Sanitaryware bodies have certain requirements that need to be met to qualify. One of these
requirements is that an unfired body should have an apparent porosity below 0.5%. Apparent
porosity is the total volume of open pores in relation to the volume of the body, while absolute
porosity also includes the volume of closed pores inside the body (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003).
Geberit in Ekenäs measures the apparent porosity with a water absorption test according to the EN997 standard. Test pieces are obtained from unglazed, fired bodies. They weigh between 100 and
150 grams each. The pieces are dried in 110 °C for three hours and are then cooled down in an
exicator. The test pieces are then weighed before being placed in a pot with water. The test pieces
are boiled for two hours and are then left in the pot for another 20 hours. The pieces are then wiped
with a cloth and weighed again. The apparent porosity is now solvable with the following equation:
𝜙𝑎 =

𝑚1 − 𝑚0
∙ 100%,
𝑚0

(11)

where 𝜙𝑎 is the apparent porosity, 𝑚1 is the mass of the test piece after water absorption and 𝑚0
is the mass before water absorption.

23

5. Slip production in Ekenäs
Ceramic slip is produced in Ekenäs in batches five days per week. Two ceramic slips are produced:
one for water closets (WC) and their tanks (Ta), and one for wash basins (WB). The main difference
between these is a lower density and viscosity for the WB slip. In this chapter, the slip production
process in Ekenäs will be introduced in order to gain understanding about the different steps of the
process. By doing this, key points in the process, to analyze with the new probes, are found.

5.1 General
Figure 18 below shows the different steps in slip production in Ekenäs. The clays are transported to
the Ekenäs plant by lorries, and they are moved indoors to the raw material storage with a conveyor
belt. These raw materials are weighed on a scale and then moved to a blunger. There are five
blungers in total. They are used to mix together kaolin and ball clay with water. Sodium carbonate
and sodium silicate are used for deflocculation at this stage. The density of this clay slip is typically
between 1,530 and 1,540 g/l. When this stage is complete, the clay slip is pumped to a mixer through
a 100-micron (micrometer) screen, followed by magnets in order to remove particles containing
iron.

Figure 18: An overview of the steps during slip production in Ekenäs
Pegmatite and quartz are stored in silos, separately from the clays. They are weighed on a scale
below the silos and transferred to a charging silo above the mixer. From here, the non-plastic
materials are added to the clay slip inside the mixer and are effectively mixed. There are 10 mixers
in two separate rows, with one of the rows being filled at a time. Every batch is controlled by the
24

laboratory and adjusted when necessary. The main parameters to follow at this stage are density,
viscosity and thixotropy. When the mixing is complete, the batch is pumped through a 180-micron
screen, followed by magnets, to the slip storage.
During later steps in the production, scrapped, unfired green bodies and cut-outs of green mass are
accumulated. These are recycled to the slip production. The unfired scrap and cut-out pieces are
placed in two scrap blungers, from where the recycled slip is pumped to the mixers in small amounts
to increase the density early in the mixing. The recycled slip is also pumped to the slip storage
through the 180-micron screen and magnets.
Ekenäs uses high-pressure casting (HPC) for all their bodies. During the casting, an excess of slip is
poured into the molds. This excess of slip is collected into return slip tanks, and this return slip is
pumped directly to the end of the slip storage instead of being pumped through the screen and
magnets.
There are 15 slip storage tanks, but only 11 of these are currently in use (see figure 19). After the
observation period FK1A and FK1B were taken out of commission, which reduced the number of
tanks in use to nine.

Figure 19: Layout of the slip production in Ekenäs.
25

After the screen bridge, the WC+Ta slip is placed in tanks FK2A or FK3A, after which it flows to FK2B
or FK3B and further on to FK1C. From here, it is pumped to FK5C. It then flows into FK5B before the
casting process. This is a slow cycle and lasts on average around 12 days. WB slip is placed in FK4A
after the screening bridge and moved to FK5A before going out to the casting process. On average,
the WB cycle lasts one day longer.
Figure 19 shows the return slip inlet from the WC+Ta HPC process. The viscosity of this slip is
measured and monitored, since the amount of return slip that is pumped back to FK5C compared
to the “fresh” slip from FK1C has a ratio of 2:1. In general, the viscosity of the return slip is slightly
higher than that of the fresh slip, so this is accounted for during the mixing stage.

5.2 Points of interest
There are a few points in this process that are of special interest when it comes to real-time
monitoring. One of the questions is about mixing. How much mixing is required before the slip is
homogenous? This is of interest in all steps of the process, but it is especially important during the
steps where new raw materials are introduced, such as blunging and mixing. It would be optimal if
the new measurement system were able to indicate when the mixing is sufficient. It has been
decided, therefore, that one probe is placed in Blunger 2, which will be called L2 (abbreviation of
Swedish word lösare) from now on.
When Figure 19 is examined closely, one can see that the clay slip from Blunger 1 is pumped forward
to Mixer 1A or 1B and then, unlike the rest, pumped straight to FK1A or FK1B. From there, it is
pumped to Blunger 3, from where the slip goes to Mixer 3 A or B without going through the screen
and magnets. The screening was already done during the first cycle. This cycle is unique, and it would
be interesting to see whether this slip differs from the slip that undergoes the conventional steps.
Two probes are, therefore, placed in this step of the process: one in Mixer 2B and one in Mixer 3B.
These will be called BL2B and BL3B (abbreviation of Swedish word blandare). It would also be
interesting to see if there are differences in mixing times between the two mixers, and if there are
any other valuable lessons to be learned.
FK2A and FK3A (abbreviation of Swedish förrådskar) are the first tanks where different batches of
slip are mixed for the first time. This is, therefore, a point of interest. One probe is, thus, placed in
FK3A. How long does it take before the slip has become homogenous or are the different batches
so similar that no changes will be noticeable at this point? Will parameter values be similar to those
of the individual batches or are they distinctly different?
The fifth and final probe is placed in FK5C. This is where fresh slip and return slip is mixed before
being pumped from FK5B to the HPC process. Will something unexpected be visible when return
slip is pumped back to FK5C, and how long does it take before the mixture is homogenous?

26

6. New measurement probe
Five measurement probes (see figure 20) were placed in different areas of slip production in
Geberit’s Ekenäs plant in order to observe if the probes can provide information that improves
process control or slip quality. Geberit’s ceramic slips have previously not been monitored in realtime like this, but rather in laboratory scale highly controlled tests. In this chapter, the technology
behind these probes will be introduced in order to better understand and predict the possibilities
and drawbacks of the measurement system.

Figure 20: Image of a probe, the sensor is situated on the left side.

6.1 Functioning principle
Dielectrics, or dipolar molecules, show reorientation of electric charges when an electric field is
applied. An electric field is a field that surrounds an electric charge and exerts force on other charges
in the same field, which either attracts or repels the other charges (Purcell & Morin, 2013). The
positive charges turn towards the electric field and the negative charges therefore in the opposite
direction. This is called polarization. The applied field may be varied from low frequencies to very
high frequencies. At low frequencies, the dipoles have enough time to rotate according to the
varying applied electrical field, but as the frequency is increased the dipoles are unable to return to
their original positions during the very fast field reversals. The frequency at which this occurs is
called the relaxation frequency. The dipoles’ inability to return to their original positions will result
in a loss in permittivity, which can be measured. Permittivity is defined as “the ability of a material
to store electrical potential energy under the influence of an electric field” (Merriam-Webster,
2020). (Mehrotra et al., 2019)
27

The probe measures the loss in an electromagnetic field caused by the slip within a few centimeters
in front of the sensor circuit. Everything that affects the electrostatic forces will show in the signal,
which could make interpretation of the results difficult. Everything begins with an electrostatic force
𝐹 between two particles, which is expressed by the following equation:
𝐹 = 𝑘𝑒

𝑞1 𝑞2
1
∙
.
𝑟 2 4𝜋 ∙ 𝜖𝑟

(12)

In the equation, 𝑘𝑒 is Coulomb’s constant, 𝑞𝑖 is the magnitude of charges for particles 1 and 2, 𝑟 is
the distance between the particles, and 𝜖𝑟 is the relative permittivity. Relative permittivity is a factor
by which 𝐹 is decreased relative to vacuum. This factor is frequency dependent, and it is expressed
with the following equation:
𝜖𝑟 (𝜔) =

𝜖𝑟′ (𝜔) − 𝑖𝜖𝑟 ′′(𝜔)
,
𝜖0

(13)

where 𝜖0 is the permittivity of vacuum and the numerator is a frequency dependent complex
permittivity. The probe calculates two units that resemble the real and imaginary parts of
permittivity based on the frequency response: calculated permittivity (CP) and calculated ion
viscosity (CIV). The probe’s frequency range is approximately 5∙105 − 5∙107 Hz. In this frequency
range, dipolar polarization is the dominant phenomenon (see Figure 21).

Figure 21: Real and imaginary permittivity spectrum over a wide frequency range (Wikipedia,
2020b).
Mehrotra et al. (2019) have used biosensors to sense changes in glucose concentrations on the
detection surface. This is due to a change in the relaxation frequency, which in turn leads to a change
in permittivity. While not the same case, the same theory applies to ceramic slips. This is the reason
different fluids give different permittivity readings.

28

The curves for the real and imaginary part of the permittivity behave differently in the probe’s
frequency interval, which could lead to non-linear responses or other anomalies when analyzing the
results. The results are also temperature dependent, since temperature affects the structural
properties of ceramic slips (such as viscosity and thixotropy). Thus, it is probably something that will
need to be compensated for.
The measurement method used in the probes is based on passive resonance sensors. It involves
measuring the behavior of an LC circuit (resonant circuit) by using another coil (Collins, 1967). An LC
circuit is an electrical circuit, and it consists of an inductor and a capacitor that are connected. It can
act as an electrical resonator. An inductive link is formed when a reader coil is placed close to an LC
circuit. This link makes it possible to measure the resonance of the LC circuit. The measurement
range for the circuits is typically a few centimeters. The reader coil creates a magnetic field, which
induces an electrical current. The induced current creates an electric field around the sensor coil.
This electrical field can partly pass through the ceramic slip, and changes in the permittivity of the
slip will affect the equivalent capacitance of the sensor. The electrical behavior of the sensor is
modelled as an RLC circuit, which is an LC circuit with a connected resistor (see Figure 22).
(Salpavaara et al., 2015)

6.1.1 Compensating calibrations
All probes measure CP, CIV as well as the surrounding external temperature. The values for CP and
CIV are calibrated on two separate levels to compensate for changes caused by temperature and
differences between the probes. The temperature compensation is based on measurements of a
slip in two different temperatures, which cover both ends of the assumed temperature spectrum
for the slip in Ekenäs. Two values for CP and CIV are obtained, and they are used to create a linear
function (the effect of temperature on the values is assumed to be linear within the boundaries of
slip temperature during production) of CP and CIV, respectively, as functions of temperatures. For
example, in the case of CP the resulting equation becomes
𝐶𝑃(𝑇) = a𝑇 + b,

29

(14)

where a is the slope of the linear function and b is the intercept. The values for a and b are then
used in the following function:
𝐶𝑃𝑡𝑐 (𝑇) =

𝐶𝑃𝑟𝑎𝑤 ∙ 𝐶𝑃𝑠𝑒𝑡
,
a𝑇 + b

(15)

where 𝐶𝑃𝑡𝑐 is the temperature compensated value of CP, 𝐶𝑃𝑟𝑎𝑤 is the raw value of CP and 𝐶𝑃𝑠𝑒𝑡 is
the value for CP where the correction factor is found to be 1.
The second calibration is designed to eliminate differences between the probes, and the probe
service provider (PSP) calls this the material calibration. The calibration is carried out by having all
probes measure the same slip, at a certain temperature, separately. The probes are likely to have
slightly differing values to describe the state of the slip, so one value is regarded as the true value
(this could be the average of the individual values). This procedure is then repeated for another
temperature and after this, still assuming linear dependency, a similar calibration can be done as
for the temperature calibration.

6.2. Measurable phenomena
CP and CIV may be plotted against each other, and the resulting graph has an interesting tendency
to identify and categorize chemicals and mixtures. Figure 23 shows a number of different fluids and
mixtures along with where they belong in the coordinate system.

Figure 23: CP/CIV graph showing where different fluids are placed in the coordinate system.
CIV reacts to free ions, increasing in value with increasing free ion amounts. This is understood when
watching Figure 23. Deionized water has the lowest CIV value of all fluids. The value increases
slightly for tap water, and the value is further increased when it comes to salty water. CP, on the
other hand, is affected by distortions in the electromagnetic field. Air has the highest value for CP,
which is natural since air contains very little particles to distort the electromagnetic field. CP is
30

sensitive to quickly rotating dipoles, and water causes the biggest loss in permittivity. The losses are
comparable to the dielectric constant of the chemical.

6.2.1 Surface area and particle size
The probe service provider (PSP) has conducted a few experiments with the probes in order to find
out what the probe is able to indicate. From an experiment in a lime process, a possible correlation
between CP and particle size was found. The PSP has a theory that the probe is able to “sense” the
surface area instead of actual particle size. In theory, it should be possible to detect if the overall
particle size in the ceramic slip changes.

6.2.2 Conductivity
In another experiment the correlation between conductivity and CP in a silicate dispersion was
investigated. When the isoelectric point is reached, the surface charge of the particles is zero, which
in turn dismantles the electric double layers on the particle surfaces. This change is visible for both
CP and conductivity, as can be seen in Figure 24.

Figure 24: The correlation between CP and conductivity in a silicate dispersion.
The explanation for this phenomenon is that, when the silicate particles lose their surface charge,
they become “less visible” to the CP measurement. The conductivity, on the other hand, increases
since the ions and charged molecules are no longer attracted to a single particle, but move freely in
the medium.
31

6.2.3 The ”fingerprint” identification
There are times when the CP/CIV graph is needed to identify the changes in a fluid. This was found
in an experiment, where the changes in CP and CIV were measured for an oil emulsion/water
mixture. For both pure deionized water and pure oil emulsion, the CIV values were very similar and
the trends developed similarly when the other liquid was added (see Figure 25).

Figure 25: CP and CIV values for changing ratios of an oil emulsion/water mixture.
The dots in Figure 25 represent actual measured values, while the dashed lines are very rough
estimates and no measurements have been conducted in that interval. If the composition of the
mixture were unknown and if the value of CIV was being monitored, it would be very difficult to
determine the ratio of the mixture. If the CP/CIV graph is plotted for the mixture it is possible to
identify the ratio of the mixture with greater ease, as can be seen in Figure 26. The percentages seen
in Figure 26 are the concentrations of water in the mixture. This tool may prove to be powerful
when trying to replicate the slip composition repeatedly by comparing the “fingerprints” of each
batch.

Figure 26: CP/CIV graph in order to identify the ratio of oil/water in the mixture.
32

6.2.4 Dissolving kinetics
There is an experiment that hints at a possibility to monitor dissolution kinetics with the probes. In
the experiment, NaCl was added to water. The addition resulted in clear jumps in both CP and CIV
values, as seen in figures 27 a) and b).

Figure 27: a) CIV graph showing the effects of adding NaCl at the time of the red line b) CP graph
showing the effects of adding NaCl at the time of the red line.
It seems that CIV reacts to the change in a matter of seconds when the ion count increases in the
water due to the salt dissolving. Around 10 minutes after the NaCl addition, the value for CIV
remains largely constant. The value for CP also changes in a matter of seconds due to an increased
amount of undissolved solids in the electromagnetic field. However, as the solids eventually
dissolve, CP begins to recover towards its initial value. This appears to take far longer for CP than
for CIV (over 40 minutes versus 10 minutes), and it seems that the CP value would continue to
change past the 45 minutes, if measured. This experiment is very simple in its nature and only
contains one raw material, so it remains to be seen if this CP phenomenon is something that could
be used to determine when raw materials are completely dissolved in the slip. The results of this
experiment indicate that it most certainly could be possible.

33

6.2.5 Dipolar moment
Small dipoles can rotate faster than large dipoles, which results in a change in relaxation frequency.
This appears to be something that can be measured with the probe. In this experiment, two
components of an epoxy glue were mixed together. CP was being measured during the hardening
of the epoxy. As epoxy monomers became oligomers, and further grew into polymers, a change in
the dipolar moment occurred. Figure 28 shows a decline in CP growth during the hardening period
of the epoxy, and this could be seen as an indirect way of measuring dipole moment.
Figure 28: CP measurements of an epoxy mixture over time.

The ability to measure the dipole moment of the slip could prove to be useful, especially during
longer breaks in production or to attempt to optimize mixing intervals of the slip.

6.2.6 Conclusion
Based on the experiments that have been conducted with the probe, it is clear that the sensor is
able to react to a number of phenomena, at least when inspected separately. The probes have not
been used in large scale slip production prior to the tests in Ekenäs, and it is probable that all the
phenomena occurring simultaneously will lead to difficulties when attempting to analyze the
results.

34

7. Results
In this chapter, the measurement data obtained from the five probes will be introduced. The results
will then be compared to existing data from the laboratory as well as other data, such as mixing and
pumping data, in order to find possible correlations between them.

7.1 Brief overview
The probes send measurement data every two seconds as long as they are connected (whether in
the air or submerged in the slip). The data are stored on a local PC, which in turn sends the data to
a cloud service based on Microsoft Azure. The data are observable in graphs in the cloud service.
Each probe has its own line, and their respective CP, CIV and temperature readings are observable.
Each probe’s line may be toggled on or off individually to study points of interest with greater ease.
An overview of the cloud interface is shown in figure 29.

Figure 29: An overview of the cloud service interface, showing the temperatures for BL2B (red),
BL3B (orange), FK3A (purple) and FK5C (pink).
The data are also downloadable from the cloud service as a CSV- or xlsx-file, which may be opened
by Excel. It was very early noticed that the amounts of data, accumulated by each probe, make the
xlsx-files prone to crashing. It was, thus, decided to use the median value for every minute instead
of receiving 30 values per minute.

7.1.1 Main goals of the study
The aim of this study is to determine whether the probes are suitable for slip production monitoring
or not. The ideal case would be that there is a clear and precise connection between the readings
of the probes and one or more of the laboratory’s measurements. This would probably allow for the
process to be controlled according to the real-time results, provided by the probes, instead of having
to take samples and analyze them. The next best outcome would be the finding of a strong
correlation between the results of the measurement probes and some other parameter that is
relevant to slip quality or process control. If none of these options are possible, it will become
difficult to find sensible use for the probes.
35

7.1.2 Slip process control in Ekenäs
Before coming to the results, it is important to understand how the slip process is controlled in
Ekenäs. The main goal of the slip production is to have as even slip as possible in the last slip tanks
(FK5A for WB and FK5B for WC+Ta). Since there are no experimental probes installed that can
monitor the WB slip process, only WC+Ta will be covered. The laboratory has certain boundaries for
the values of density, viscosity and thixotropy that the finished slip will need to stay within for it to
be approved. If the values start to drift away from these boundaries, it is crucial to investigate
whether the values are deviating for all slip tanks in the slip storage or if the deviation only occurs
in the final tanks. A deviation that only affects the final tanks could, for example, be a water leak
into the return slip. These can be adjusted by changing the ratio of fresh/return slip pumped into
FK5C. The return slip has a lower thixotropy and viscosity than the fresh slip, so adjusting the
fresh/return slip ratio can also temporarily be used as a way to adjust these variables in FK5C. If the
density is too high in the final tanks, water can be added to decrease it to the optimal value. In
general, no chemicals are used in the slip storage. In extreme cases of viscosity or thixotropy
increase, however, deflocculants may be required.
If the anomaly appears in all storage tanks, it is an indication of a systematic deviation that originates
from the earlier stages of slip production. This will require adjustments in the mixers to affect the
values in the storage. Such cases may be associated with new raw material batches or tests with
new slip recipes. If, for example, thixotropy and viscosity were above average for all storage tanks,
the probable response would be to produce slip with viscosity and thixotropy values below average.
When the fresh slip is mixed with the slip in the storage in proportionate quantities, the result will
be a slip with average values.
It is not as easy to determine parameter intervals for the blungers and mixers since the values may
vary relatively much, depending on the state of the finished slip. The trends for the tanks with
probes attached will be shown in their respective sections in order to obtain an idea of the
parameter value ranges.

7.2 General findings and common factors
In this section, observations that are common for all probes are introduced. Some of the
phenomena will be discussed in further detail in the sections designated for each tank. A slightly
altered recipe for the ceramic slip was used for a large portion of the observation period, and this
slip test will be briefly discussed in this section as well.

7.2.1 Raw versus compensated values
The PSP has estimated that an increase in temperature of 1 °C results in a change of +0.5 units for
CIV and -2.5 units for CP. The effects of the calibrations on the values can be very significant. Figure
30 shows the development of raw and compensated CP in L2 during a Sunday in August, when
nothing was added or done to the slip. The temperature decreased by 1.2 °C during the 24 hours,
and it is apparent that the raw value of CP (not compensated at all) rises by approximately 20 units
during this time. The compensated (both calibrations) value of CP, in contrast, decreases by only
one or two units. According to the estimations provided by the PSP, the raw value should only
increase by three instead of the 20 units. This may indicate that this specific probe has had very
36

differing values from the other probes, leading to a significant material calibration, or that the
estimate of temperature’s effect on CP values does not apply to this specific probe. The
compensated values appear to more accurately describe the slip, since the slip is not altered in any
way. Thus, very small changes in CP and CIV are to be expected, but the raw variant of CP changes
substantially. The slip has had ample time to regain its structural strength within these 24 hours, so
it is unclear why raw CP continues to increase linearly when nothing should be changing in the slip.
The temperature has only decreased by 1.2 °C, which indicates that the compensated values more
accurately describe the state of the slip than the raw values.

Figure 30: The development of raw and compensated CP in L2 during Sunday 2.8.
Another example, which highlights the difference between raw and compensated values, is shown
in Figure 31. The values were gathered from BL2B on a weekday morning. The slips in the blungers,
when in use, are mixed every weekday morning roughly between 06:10 and 07:10. During this time,
the laboratory takes samples from the blungers, since the slip is as even as possible during this time.
When the mixing starts, the structural strength of the slip decreases for a short time before reaching
a new equilibrium. Figure 31 shows that compensated CP represents this behavior well. Raw CP,
however, continues to change at a constant rate. This could be reasonable if additives or
deflocculants had recently been added. Since this is not the case, however, raw CP is flawed.

Figure 31: Raw and compensated CP in BL2B during and after morning mixing on August 17th.
37

The conclusion is that the raw values do not describe the slips sufficiently and, therefore, they will
not be used for this thesis. The compensated values of CP and CIV will instead be used, and they will
be referred to as CP and CIV.

7.2.2 Measuring air
L2, BL2B and BL3B are not continuously filled with ceramic slip. Instead, they are filled with batches
that are being pumped forward into the process before the vessels are refilled with the next batch.
The probes perform measurements continuously, so they will also measure air in between batches.
This is identifiable quite easily when studying the values of both CP and CIV. Figure 32 shows CIV
measurements from L2 over almost three days. During the long and stable periods, L2 has contained
ceramic slip. During the massive dips in CIV, L2 has been empty and the probe has measured air
instead of slip. The vast difference in values distorts the y-axis scale and it becomes difficult to study
the data points where slip has been measured. Therefore, the data points where air has been
measured will be eliminated whenever possible. From Figure 32, it is possible to see that the
difference between air and slip is more than 1,000 units for CIV. It is noteworthy that the
corresponding difference for CP is nearly 3,000 units (slip gives readings of roughly 46,500 while air
gives readings around 49,000).

Figure 32: CIV in L2 showing the difference between slip and air measurements.

7.2.3 Absorption of aluminum and silica
The laboratory collects samples from the tanks that are in use every morning. The general number
of samples taken each day is one per tank, apart from the mixers. They may require more samples
if the slip’s properties are not satisfactory immediately. The samples are taken approximately at
07:00, and for the blungers the potential second sample is taken at roughly 08:45, and a potential
third sample is estimated to be collected at 10:00. Laboratory results and CP/CIV readings from each
probe were collected into an xlsx-file for comparative analysis. The purpose was to compare the
measurements and look for relevant correlations between them.
One unexpected observation was found when CP and CIV values for a single probe were plotted
over time. It was found that, for every probe, their CP values plummeted rapidly over the first weeks.
The values then slowly began to approach equilibrium towards the end of the observation period.
38

For CIV the effects were opposite. The values quickly rose and then slowly edged towards
equilibrium. Figure 33 shows the development of CP for FK3A over time. It is apparent that the rate,
at which the values decrease, is at its highest during the initial days. Between the 13th of June and
20th of July, a vast majority of the staff in Ekenäs were on summer vacation. Therefore, no slip was
produced during this time. Hence, there are no laboratory results from these dates, which leaves a
gap in the graph.

Figure 33: The development of CP for FK3A over time, showing a systematic change.
As this anomaly was identified, an investigation was launched in order to find its cause. The probe
that was initially in L2 stopped sending data packets and needed to be replaced. Thus, the
dysfunctional probe was investigated externally in Ekenäs, but no abnormalities were found. It was
then sent to the PSP, where it was deconstructed for further analysis. A theory was developed that
the probe accumulated or absorbed certain ions or compounds that would distort the results. In
order to confirm this, the polyurethane casing was dissected and analyzed.
Comparison between probes that were constantly in slip and probes that were in air part of the time
showed that the values were experiencing their constant shift only during submersion, thereby
giving validity to the ion absorption theory. Due to this characteristic in value change, it became
tricky to compare results since the values did not change in unison. The corrections were finally
made individually for each probe by the PSP. They will be discussed separately in the probes’
respective sections.
The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis found that the polyurethane coating contained
some air bubbles with a diameter in the range of 10-100 microns, while the Energy Dispersive
Spectrometry (EDS) found approximately 2 mass-% silicon and aluminum near the edges of the
probe’s sensor, see Figure 34. Polyurethane does not naturally contain these elements, so they have
been absorbed from the ceramic slip onto the edges of the probe near the sensor. The PSP
speculates that this is a significant accumulation of foreign elements and causes at least some, if not
all, of the shifting in the readings. The PSP is focusing on improving the chemical resistance of its
probes in order to avoid such features in the future.

7.2.4 Data transfer issues
During the last two months of the observation period, data transfer to the local computer and cloudbased service abruptly stopped for a total of seven times. This resulted in loss of data over periods
of one to three days each. Several causes were found for this problem. The first one was identified
as the storage space on the PC running out. This was remedied by reducing the number of data
points stored on the computer by averaging them, after which the lack of storage space would not
cause any further issues. Another time a “blackout” was caused by an error that followed a software
update, but for the majority of the “blackouts” nothing out of the ordinary was found. Four out of
five times, a reboot of the local PC helped restart the data transfer. On the final day of the
40

observation period, however, rebooting the local PC did not help either. The issue appeared to
resolve itself a day later. A theory for this behavior is that the firewall may have blocked the transfer
of data during the “blackout” period, but it is unknown why the firewall would allow data transfer
again after one day. Overall, the frequency of these “blackouts” and not fully knowing what causes
them is worrying and needs to be addressed, as the probes are intended for real-time process
control.

7.2.5 Testing a new slip recipe
During the last two months of the observation period a slight alteration to the slip recipe was made,
as a third kaolin was added to the recipe. The new kaolin is expected to increase the plasticity of the
finished slip, as it contains finer particles than kaolin 1 it will partly replace. The two kaolin types are
quite similar apart from the particle size distribution. Hence, the laboratory does not expect
substantial changes in slip properties, apart from the increased plasticity during casting. For each of
the five tanks, the possible effects of the recipe change on measurement results will be investigated
to see if the probes or laboratory results react to this slight change.

7.3 Blunger L2
The blungers are the first step in the ceramic slip manufacturing process in Ekenäs. Here, the plastic
raw materials are mixed with water and deflocculants (such as sodium silicate). L2 was chosen as
the probe’s location over the other blungers because it is equipped with a more effective propeller
blade than the rest of the blungers. It is yet unknown how much mixing L2 requires with this new
propeller blade. One of the goals is, therefore, to investigate if the probe can help discover the
required amount of mixing or not.
Identical recipes for each batch are processed in the blunger, which should mean that the probe’s
parameter values are similar when comparing different batches (provided nothing exceptional has
happened). It is, therefore, one of the goals to study if this indeed is the case and if there is a
connection between the probe’s values and laboratory results.

7.3.1 Typical batch cycle
The typical measurement readings of a batch in L2 are depicted in Figure 35. The cycle begins at
point 1, which is when water, plastic raw materials and deflocculants are added to L2. As surface
level rises inside L2, it will eventually reach the sensor and begin transmitting data about the slip.
Both CP and CIV are increasing, while the temperature decreases due to the introduction of cold
raw materials. At point 2, all plastic materials have been weighed and added to L2. This triggers an
automated mixing for two hours. The mixing is visible in the temperature graph since the
temperature begins to rise rather quickly at a constant rate due to the shear friction. It is also
noticeable in the other graphs since the values begin to stabilize because of mixing. At point 3, the
mixing is finished, after which the temperature begins to decrease. Both CP and CIV values remain
quite stable during the evening and night, while L2 cools down on average 3 °C. The next morning,
at approximately 06:15, a one-hour mixing commences (point 4) and the temperature begins to rise.
At this point CP and CIV behave differently, as CP sinks immediately after mixing begins and slowly
begins to rise while CIV does the opposite. This suggests that mixing affects CP and CIV oppositely.
41

During mixing a sample is taken by the laboratory for analysis. After the mixing L2’s slip is being
pumped forward in the process to a mixer (point 5).

7.3.2 Laboratory and probe results
The main parameters that describe the slip are density, viscosity and thixotropy. The measurement
results from these parameters will therefore be compared to measurement results from the probe
in order to determine if there are any similarities or patterns that may be used for process control
in real-time. The samples from L2 are gathered every weekday morning at approximately 07:00
when it is in use, but this time may vary by some minutes.
Density for the blungers in general is lower than density for the other tanks, because the blungers
lack non-plastic raw materials. Figure 36 shows density measurements over the observation period
ranging from May 19th to October 13th and, in general, density resides between 1,540 and 1,560 g/l,
but there are some points that lie far outside this range. At point 1, on August 6th, a water leak
resulting in a major density decrease was found in FK5C. The leak was so vast that a decision was
made to create new slip batches with above average density levels to balance out the density in the
storage tank, and these are the data points above number 1 in Figure 36. The density level in FK5C
evened out faster than anticipated and the high-density slip was slowly being pumped to the storage
tanks, so as a countering measure two batches with low density were made (see the two data points
below number 1). Between point 1 and 2, there were issues with a magnetic water valve that
regulates water flow to L2 which caused batches with slightly higher density than average. The
42

magnetic water valve completely malfunctioned on August 27th (point 2 in Figure 36) and an excess
of water entered L2, resulting in disastrously low density, and the batch was deemed unusable. A
replacement water valve was installed, but unfortunately this valve was not designed for the correct
temperature range, and this resulted in the next batch containing too little water and thus a very
high density reading (point 3 in Figure 36). After these incidents, the density in L2 has remained
fairly even for the remainder of the observation period.

Figure 36: Density in L2 during the observation period with three points to highlight deviations.
The graphs for viscosity and thixotropy behave very similarly, as can be seen in Figure 37. The same
abnormal events have been pointed out for viscosity and thixotropy as for density in Figure 36, as
they share the causes. Overall, it is apparent that both viscosity and thixotropy are not easily
contained at this stage of the process, as viscosity values range between 100 and 300 mPas and
thixotropy between 50 and 100 mPas during the last month of observation. It is believed that the
unfinished nature of the slip could explain the variations in viscosity and thixotropy values.
When comparing the earliest results with the latest in Figure 37, there is a considerable difference
for both parameters. Viscosity in May and June hardly ever surpassed 100 mPas, while during
September and October it was closer to 200 mPas on average, and the same trend applies to
thixotropy. The first batch of new test slip, with a third kaolin replacing some of the first, was created
on August 19th, and it seems plausible that this altered recipe at least partly explains this increase
in viscosity and thixotropy values. The recipe change appears to have increased viscosity and
thixotropy levels, overall, and the recipe was changed in September to contain more deflocculants
in an attempt to counteract the increase. Other possible explanations could be changes in raw
material batches or variations in outdoor temperature and moisture levels.

43

Figure 37: Viscosity and thixotropy in L2 during the observation period along with the same three
points as Figure 36.
The results from Figure 36 and Figure 37 can be compared to CP and CIV trends by collecting the CP
and CIV values from each weekday at around 07:00 (which is the time of sample collecting), and the
results are shown in Figure 38 below. From both graphs in Figure 38, the effects of silica and alumina
absorption are clearly visible especially during May and June, but the values are still changing during
July and August at a slightly slower rate than initially. During the latter half of August, a gap in data
points is noticeable, and when the data points are resumed the values are clearly deviating from the
last values given in mid-August (point 1 in Figure 38). During this time, the probe in L2 stopped
sending data packets, as briefly mentioned in section 7.2.3, and needed to be replaced. When the
replacement probe was installed in late August, the values given by the two probes differed by 600
units in CP and 100 units in CIV. The replacement probe showed a rapid change in values after the
instalment, and this is likely caused by the absorption of aluminum and silica detailed in section
7.2.3.
When studying the massive jump in values between the probes it was noticed that the replacement
probe was not calibrated properly, so the probe was calibrated in late September. The effects of the
calibration are visible in the CP graph (depicted by point 2). At the end of the observation period
both CP and CIV values are still not in a state of equilibrium and the trend for CIV is especially
worrying, since the values follow a nearly linear trajectory and CIV has increased by 350 units
between late August and mid-October. It is reasonable to expect that this probe requires a few more
months of submersion in slip before it reaches a stable level for CIV values.
44

the text.

7.3.3 Compensating probe values
The values for CP and CIV were plotted against the parameters used by the laboratory, and there
were no similarities or connections found between any combinations of parameters. The drifting of
probe values overpowers everything else and any possible correlations between probe and
laboratory results are lost. A decision was made to add another compensation layer on the probe
values in order to minimize the effect of absorption.
The CP and CIV values for L2 from each day were used by the PSP to find an exponential function of
time with the best least-squares fit to describe the data. It turns out that only the original probe’s
(subscript op) CP values follow an exponential pattern (equation 17), while the replacement probe’s
(subscript rp) CP as well as all CIV values do not deviate consistently from a linear trend. The
compensations, therefore, take the following forms:
𝑡

𝐶𝑃𝑜𝑝 (𝑡) = 46,169.97 + 526.14 ∙ e−18.95

(17)

𝐶𝑃𝑟𝑝 (𝑡) = −12.46𝑡 + 47,408.27

(18)

𝐶𝐼𝑉𝑜𝑝 (𝑡) = 14.41𝑡 + 1,926.9

(19)

𝐶𝐼𝑉𝑟𝑝 (𝑡) = 15.12𝑡 + 1,591.38

(20)

45

These functions were used to compensate their corresponding parameters, and the resulting time
compensated values are shown in Figure 39 below. When comparing these results to the ones in
Figure 36 and 37 it is still difficult to find reliable correlations between probe and laboratory results,
but it appears that CIV might identify slip batches with high viscosity. Two batches on August 6th and
7th as well as one batch on August 31st have been pointed out in Figure 39 (in figure 36 these are
identified by point 1 and 3) and it seems that CP is very inconsistent while CIV values are slightly
higher for batches with high density. Point 2 in figure 36 cannot be analyzed in Figure 39 due to the
probe being unable to send data packets at the time, which is unfortunate as it would have been
able to give more insight to CIV’s density sensing abilities. Overall data shows that there is very little
use of the probe in L2 when it comes to using it as a real-time indication of the slip’s state.

Figure 39: Time compensated CP and CIV in L2 along with highlighted batches where density was
high.

7.3.4 Viscosity tests
When it comes to testing the required mixing time for L2, the PSP wanted to test a theory that the
probes are able to sense an increase in viscosity of the slip when plastic raw materials are added. A
plan to measure viscosity during raw material addition was set up. When the plastic raw materials
are added to L2, samples will be taken and the viscosity of these samples will be measured as
frequently as possible until the mixing stops, and the results will be compared to the results given
46

by the probe in order to study possible links to viscosity or other phenomena. The rotational
viscometer discussed in section 4.4 is designed to measure smooth slips and even small solid
particles in the slip may distort the results, so this measurement method is not useable during these
tests. Instead, the pipe viscometer introduced in section 4.4 will be used.
When the raw materials are added to L2 the necessary equipment is prepared for measurements,
and when the slip level rises to the level of the probe’s sensor, samples will begin to be collected.
The sample is sieved through a kitchen sieve in order to obtain a sufficiently smooth sample, which
is then brought to the laboratory where viscosity will be measured. In the laboratory, the sample is
poured into the pipe viscometer. When everything is ready the bottom valve of the viscometer is
opened and a stopwatch is started, and the timer is stopped when 250 ml of sample is collected in
a measuring glass below the pipe viscometer. After this, another sample is collected and this cycle
continues until the mixing stops.
A total of three batches were analyzed through this method and the viscosity measurement results
are quite similar. Figure 40 shows the results from the first viscosity test on September 17th along
with CP and CIV results from the same time span. Viscosity peaks at 54 seconds at 13:37, while both
CP and CIV peak at roughly 13:07 and have nearly evened out by 13:26. These results indicate that
instead of having a link with viscosity, the probe appears to give an indication of the amount of
undissolved solids in the slip at a given time. At approximately 13:07, all plastic raw materials had
been added and no more solids entered L2. This is precisely when both CP and CIV values begin their
decline as the amount of undissolved solids decreases in the slip. At around 13:26, both CP and CIV
values begin to even out which, according to the theory, would mean that there is an insignificant
amount of undissolved solids left in the slip. This is supported by observations made during sample
collection, as no solids were left in the sieve when collecting samples around this time.
Viscosity does not decrease when raw material addition is stopped, since there are still solids
undissolved in the slip, and when these solids dissolve over time viscosity will continue to rise. What
is interesting is that viscosity continues to rise for roughly 10 minutes after all solids have dissolved
according to the CP and CIV readings. The cause of this is unknown. After 13:37 viscosity begins to
decrease and reaches just under 20 seconds before the mixing stops.
Overall, the slip appears to become homogenous quite long before mixing is stopped at the time
being, but at this point viscosity has not yet reached its peak and it is unknown what the effects on
the slip would be if mixing was stopped when the slip is simply homogenous. Studying the effects
of viscosity on slip properties in L2 could be beneficial when trying to optimize the time required for
mixing during raw material addition. If it were found that viscosity has no significant impact on the
properties of the finished slip, it would be possible to shorten the mixing time to the point where
CP and CIV even out, otherwise the mixing time would be chosen according to the optimal viscosity
level.

span.

7.4 Mixers BL2B and BL3B
The mixers are the second step in the slip manufacturing process in Ekenäs, and here the non-plastic
raw materials are added to the existing slip from the blungers, and the slip is adjusted to its
processing parameters before it is transferred to the storage. This does not apply to BL3B, however,
since the slip that is pumped into BL3B already contains the non-plastic raw materials and,
therefore, only the final adjustments are made for BL3B. Therefore, two probes are placed in parallel
in the mixing stage so that it is possible to study whether there are noticeable differences in slip
properties due to the differing manufacturing cycles.
Another vital aspect of the slip manufacturing process is the adjusting of slip properties and the
effect of adding deflocculants and water on the probe values will be investigated. Ideally the probe
values between different batches would be close enough so that the probes could be usable for slip
adjusting instead of having to take up to three samples per day per mixer and analyzing them
separately, which takes up a lot of time in the laboratory. Any possible correlations between
48

laboratory parameters and probe parameters will also be investigated as this stage of the slip
manufacturing process is arguably the most crucial one.
Since the addition of non-plastic raw materials is documented by the probe in BL2B, a viscosity test
similar to that of L2 will be carried out on BL2B. The goal of the test is to find how quickly the slip
becomes homogenous and if viscosity decreases during the entire mixing period like in L2.
Otherwise, it will settle at a certain level, which would give an opportunity to shorten the mixing
time.

7.4.1 Typical batch cycle
The typical cycles of batches in BL2B and BL3B are depicted in Figure 41. The cycles begin at point
1, which is when the slip from the blungers is pumped into the mixers. The addition of non-plastic
raw materials begins for BL2B, while BL3B remains unchanged at point 2. When all raw materials
have been added the slip rests until the next morning, apart from a short mixing for BL2B, which is
observable at point 3. Both mixers receive their morning mixing, and samples are collected and
analyzed by the laboratory at point 4. If the results are unsatisfactory the slip’s properties will be
adjusted with deflocculants, flocculants, water, or combinations of these. After this the slip will be
mixed for approximately 30 minutes before a new sample is taken. This cycle is usually repeated
one to three times before the parameter values are satisfactory, and the slip is being pumped
forward to the slip storage at point 5.
Based on the values obtained from October 7th, both BL2B and BL3B have very similar CP values
upon entering their respective mixers, but once BL2B receives its non-plastic raw materials its CP
values rise by more than 150 units. This gap narrows ever so slightly during the night, but upon
leaving the mixers the difference in CP remains at 150 units, which is a significant difference. This
will be investigated in the next section, and laboratory results will be analyzed to see if the slips are
similar according to their more conventional measurement methods.

7.4.2 Laboratory and probe results
The results for BL2B and BL3B look more scattered than those for L2, as they may contain more than
one data point for each parameter and each day. This results in a vast spread, although certain
conclusions can still be drawn from the data points. For the mixers there is no need to examine
density results, as density does not fluctuate as much in the mixers as in the blungers. Instead, the
focus will be on viscosity and thixotropy. The viscosity and thixotropy graphs for their respective
mixer behave very similarly. Thus, only thixotropy graphs are shown for each mixer, but the results
for thixotropy are proportional to viscosity.
Figure 42 below shows the thixotropy results from BL2B and BL3B during the observation period,
and in both cases the results that required adjustment have been circled to highlight them. In
general, if there are two or more values on the same day, the lowest value is the one that has been
approved. Overall, thixotropy values in late July hovered around 150 mPas for both mixers, but after
August 17th the accepted thixotropy values started to decrease while the initial thixotropy results
consistently rose. This shift happens around the same time that the new test slip, with the third
kaolin, is introduced. There is reason to believe that something in the new test slip causes higher
thixotropy levels in the slip than before. This could be the new kaolin, new raw material batches
being introduced in August or a mixture of these two things, but the exact cause is yet unknown.

Figure 42: Thixotropy in BL2B and BL3B during the observation period with the result that have
required adjustments being circled.

50

Production of the new test slip does not explain the consistent decrease in thixotropy of the
accepted values, however. This is due to a change in the slip’s behavior in the storage tanks, as
thixotropy levels have suddenly begun to rise in the storage tanks when this has not occurred during
spring and summer. As a countermeasure thixotropy has been lowered in the mixer stage with
deflocculants, so that thixotropy levels will stay at a suitable level in the storage tanks. The increased
use of deflocculants in the mixers explains the consistent decrease of thixotropy values for the
accepted values in both mixers. When it comes to the initial thixotropy results, it appears that BL2B
has slightly higher values than BL3B overall, but after the adjustments both mixers have similar
values. This means that BL2B in general requires more adjusting than BL3B, and while the cause of
this is unconfirmed it could be due to the differing manufacturing steps. The slip in BL3B has had
the non-plastic raw materials added at an earlier process step and it has had more time to develop
compared to the case of BL2B.
Like L2, CP and CIV values for BL2B and BL3B are distorted by the constant drift in sensors as
discussed in section 7.3.2, and the trends for both CP and CIV of the respective mixers is shown in
Figure 43. By studying the values, it is apparent that BL2B has had consistently higher CP values and
lower CIV values than BL3B, which would indicate that there is a structural difference between the
slips. This is supported partly by the thixotropy results discussed above, but after the adjustments
in the mixers have been made both mixers have similar thixotropies while these adjustments result
in comparably small changes in CP and CIV. According to the probes the slips in BL2B and BL3B are
very different even after these adjustments, which does raise questions about whether thixotropy
or probe results are more accurate, and this is something that feels important to study further in
order to find answers. One alternative could be to try producing the slip using the same steps and
comparing the results to see if the differing production steps are the cause of this difference or not.

Figure 43: CP and CIV results for BL2B (left) and BL3B (right) during observation period.

51

When examining the results from BL2B, it seems that the distortion caused by absorption has slowed
down and is beginning to even out for both CP and CIV. The same cannot be said for BL3B as the
trend for CP seems nearly linear and the values for CIV appear to have begun accelerating in late
August and early September. This is highly worrying as it is difficult to estimate when or at what
level BL3B’s values will settle. Based on these graphs it is probable that the difference between BL2B
and BL3B will continue to grow for an unknown length of time, when in fact this is not the case
based on laboratory results. It appears that the difference in production process between the
probes leads to different levels of absorption, which causes BL3B’s probe to return more distorted
results than BL2B’s probe. Another possibility, although quite unlikely, is that there is a vast
difference between the probes physically which could explain this anomaly. It is apparent, however,
that these values need to be compensated further in order to determine if they may be of use or
not.

7.4.3 Time-compensated probe values
Similarly to L2, the values for CP and CIV from BL2B and BL3B were plotted against density, viscosity
and thixotropy and there were no similarities or correlations found between any combinations of
these parameters due to the drifting of probe values. The PSP provided least-square fitted
exponential functions for CP and CIV for BL2B and BL3B respectively, and the functions look as
follows:
𝑡

𝐶𝑃𝐵𝐿2𝐵 (𝑡) = 46,611.36 + 182.52 ∙ e−46.96
𝑡

𝐶𝐼𝑉𝐵𝐿2𝐵 (𝑡) = 3,159.40 − 669.16 ∙ e−169.05
𝑡

𝐶𝑃𝐵𝐿3𝐵 (𝑡) = 46,439.19 + 262.76 ∙ e−41.54
𝑡

𝐶𝐼𝑉𝐵𝐿3𝐵 (𝑡) = 3,040.04 − 404.02 ∙ e−74.94

(21)
(22)
(23)
(24)

These functions were used to compensate the values for their corresponding mixer and parameter,
and the results for BL2B are shown in Figure 44. The compensated values for BL2B’s CP contain a
considerable amount of variance, and the results do not match those of any other parameter. The
CIV values have a tighter spread, but they still do not correlate with any other parameter.

52

Figure 44: Time compensated CP and CIV for BL2B.
The compensated CP and CIV values for BL3B are shown in Figure 45. From the graphs it is noticeable
that the results from BL3B do not strictly behave exponentially as the compensated values are not
linear. The compensated values do not match the other parameters so that they may be used.

Figure 45: Time compensated CP and CIV in BL3B.
53

The time compensation managed to even out the numerical values of CP and CIV but did little in
helping find correlations between probe and laboratory results so that the probes could be used
instead of manual labor. The values for BL3B especially follow a more complex pattern than an
exponential one, so it is without a doubt difficult to time-compensate the original values sufficiently
without tampering with them too much. Excessive compensation would eventually lead to loss of
information about the slip.

7.4.4 Adjusting the slips
In this section the adjusting of slip batches with deflocculants and water will be examined both from
a laboratory and probe point of view. The main deflocculant used at this stage is sodium silicate.
Other flocculants, such as gypsum, are also used occasionally, but there were no such cases during
the observation period.
Generally, depending on which parameters require adjusting, there are three different alternatives
to adjusting the mixers, and these are:
-

adding only sodium silicate,
adding only water and
adding both sodium silicate and water.

Water is mainly used for lowering density while sodium silicate lowers viscosity and thixotropy of
the slip. There are plenty of cases where only sodium silicate has been or a mix of water and sodium
silicate have been added to the slips in BL2B and BL3B, but there is only one recorded addition of
water alone. While it would be beneficial to have more results from similar events to verify this, it
does seem that a conclusion can be made about how adding water affects CP and CIV. Figure 46
shows CP and CIV trends from BL2B 30 minutes before, during and 90 minutes after adding 200 l
water, and it appears that CIV is able to identify a clear change in the slip when water is being added,
while nothing significant changes upon inspecting the trend for CP from the same time span. With
more

Figure 46: CIV and CP trends in BL2B during an adjustment of 200 l water.
54

similar water adjustments, one could study CP and possibly verify that CP does not react to water
additions. It could also be investigated if adding water lowers CIV in a linear fashion or if there are
more complex mechanics that need to be studied in order to use these values for adjusting the slip
in the future.
What comes to adding sodium silicate, there is reasonable evidence to show that CP is better at
recognizing a change in the slip than CIV. Figure 47 below shows typical CP and CIV trends during a
sodium silicate addition, and it appears that while CIV senses a change in the slip it is merely
temporary and CIV will soon return to original values. This indicates that ion viscosity rises when the
deflocculant is added and dissolves into ions, but after a while the ions are bound to other ions or
compounds in the slip, and thus CIV returns to its original level. CP, on the other hand, senses the
change without having the results return to their original state soon thereafter, which makes this
the better unit to follow when using sodium silicate to adjust the slip. This is probably due to
permittivity increasing by the deflocculant, and permittivity does not change when the ratio of free
ions changes in the slip. Therefore, the change is permanent.

Figure 47: CIV and CP trends in BL3B during an adjustment of 2 l plus 1 l sodium silicate.
When examining the CP trend in Figure 47 it is apparent that the smaller amount of sodium silicate
causes a larger change in CP, which is not very uncommon when comparing to other similar cases,
but the rule of thumb is that a larger amount of deflocculant increases the magnitude of change.
Unfortunately, there is no clear ratio for this magnitude as one liter sodium silicate has led to
recorded decreases in CP between two and seven units, which is a large interval when it comes to
making small and precise adjustments. Typically, the amount of added sodium silicate is directly
proportional to its potency. Sodium silicate causes linear changes in viscosity and thixotropy of a

55

slip, so the laboratory is able to approximate the amount of sodium silicate that is needed for
adjustment, but the same does not apply to CP and CIV.
Knowing that neither unit is sufficiently capable of handling both water and sodium silicate additions
it becomes difficult to trust the results that are obtained when both substances are added to a slip.
An example of a case where both substances are added is shown in Figure 48 below. At point (1) 1.5
l of sodium silicate as well as 200 l of water are added simultaneously into the slip, and at point (2)
another one liter of sodium silicate is added. When studying the trend for CP one can see that the
total effect of sodium silicate and water is a decrease of approximately five units, which likely is
caused by sodium silicate alone as that would give it a potency of three units per liter which is quite
average. This means that the effects of water are lost in the CP trend. When examining the trend
for CIV the gap is larger and quite similar to the one seen in Figure 46, but where 200 l water lowered
CIV by 25 units in Figure 46 CIV is lowered by merely 17 to 19 units this time around. There is reason
to believe that this difference is caused by sodium silicate, as it has the tendency to temporarily
alter CIV values and a short time after point (1) in Figure 48 a

Figure 48: CP and CIV trend during addition of 200 l water and 1.5 l sodium silicate simultaneously
at point (1), while an additional 1 l sodium silicate is added at point (2).

small decrease in CIV is observable. This is likely when sodium silicate ceases to affect CIV values
and they return to their original level. This results in a loss of the effects of sodium silicate in the CIV
trend, so neither CP or CIV give correct values after point (1) and the results should not be trusted.
56

Upon closer inspection of Figures 41, 47 and 48 one may notice that both CP and CIV appear to
decrease steadily during, and even after, the adjustments up until the slip being pumped forward
to the slip storage (see Figure 41). The values can decrease by quite large amounts. For example, CP
and CIV decreased by roughly 10 and 20 units, respectively, by themselves in Figure 41. Similar
changes in CP and CIV are obtained by adding approximately two to four liters of sodium silicate or
200 liters of water, which are both very significant and cause visible changes in the slip. It is,
therefore, crucial to identify whether these decreasing values are an indication of ongoing changes
in the slip or if they are caused by the probes and do not correspond with the state of the slip.
One theory brought up for the oddly behaving CP and CIV is that the time between adjusting the
slips and it being pumped forward is possibly too short and that the slip does not have enough time
to settle after the adjustments. Another theory is that the probes do not describe the slip accurately
enough and the drifting values could be connected to the similar absorption problem, although on
a shorter time span.
In order to determine if the second theory has any merit to it, it is important to find a batch where
the slip has been resting for a long period before being altered. One case like this was found in BL2B,
where a batch had been moved to BL2B on a Thursday, adjusted on Friday, and was left standing in
BL2B over the weekend. The batch was then mixed on Monday and was not pumped to the storage
until Tuesday, so in total the batch was left in BL2B for nearly a full week.
The trends for CP and CIV for this batch are shown in Figure 49 below. When the slip is untouched
during the weekend, a nearly constant change in both CP and CIV is observable. The total change in
CP and CIV over the weekend is approximately 16 and 40 units respectively. Corresponding changes
would require between at least a few liters of sodium silicate for CP and probably 400 to 500 liters
of water for CIV, which are massive amounts and rarely needed.
There is a constant drift in CP and CIV that cannot be fully explained as of yet, and the corresponding
laboratory results from that Friday and Monday show no evidence of the slip changing anywhere
close to what the probes suggest. Therefore, there is reason to believe that both CP and CIV values
would continue to drift further if nothing was done to the slip for a long time, and thus it would not
help to let the slip rest longer before pumping it forward into the process. It is entirely possible that
the slip is still going through some changes by the time pumping commences, but any evidence of
that is overshadowed by the constant drifting of the values.

57

drifting of both CP and CIV values.

7.4.5 Viscosity tests in BL2B
Since non-plastic raw materials are added to the mixers, and the mechanics of this process is
relatively unknown, it was decided that viscosity tests similar to those made with L2 will be
conducted with BL2B to study the possibility of shortening mixing times. In section 7.3.4 the
conclusion is that the probes give good readings on the amount of undissolved solids in the slip
instead of viscosity, which was the original theory, but since this time non-plastic raw materials are
added instead of plastic raw materials, the results may be different.
The same measurement method that was used for L2 is used for BL2B, and a total of three batches
were analyzed. The results from these batches were nearly identical, so while only one batch is
shown the same conclusions apply to all batches. Figure 50 below shows the results from the first
viscosity test on September 17th, along with CP and CIV results from the same time span. The initial
viscosity resided at around 12 to 14 seconds and quickly rose when non-plastic raw materials were
being added. Approximately 70 to 80 minutes later, the peak in viscosity was reached at 118 to 122
seconds. After this, viscosity fluctuated before settling at 105 to 110 seconds when the mixing was
stopped. Both CP and CIV reached their peaks 20 minutes before viscosity. This is likely when the
amount of undissolved solids was at its largest, based on the CP and CIV peaks as well as
observations during sample collection. The amount of undissolved solids visibly declined slowly until
around 13:55, and after that nearly all solids had dissolved and the signal for CP stabilized. The CP

58

signal stabilized and viscosity peaked roughly at the same time, which would be expected as that is
the point when viscosity should be at its maximum.

Figure 50: Viscosity tests results along with the corresponding CP and CIV results.
When comparing the trend for viscosity with those for CP and CIV the similarities are quite
remarkable, which is not the case for L2. The difference is that viscosity in BL2B does not sink back
to its original values shortly after the peak in BL2B, but instead stays at a level close to its maximum.
The reason behind this is believed to be that the non-plastic raw materials give the slip its structure,
which permanently increases its viscosity, whereas the plastic raw materials do not provide
structure in the same sense.
The slip appears to become homogenous more than an hour before the mixing is stopped and,
unlike the case for L2, viscosity in BL2B does not significantly change after it has reached its peak.

7.5 Storage tank FK3A
The slip storage is where the slip matures before it is used in the casting process, and FK3A is the
first storage tank. Here, different blunger batches are mixed together and are then slowly being
pumped forward in the storage. One probe was placed here to monitor this. Typically, no
deflocculants or other additives are added to the slip at this stage, so the largest changes in CP and
CIV are expected to come from the addition of fresh slip from the mixers.
When studying the results of those mixers, the new test slip exhibits elevated levels of viscosity and
thixotropy, which in turn lead to more deflocculants being added as a countermeasure. Any possible
effects of the test slip on measurement results from FK3A will thus also be investigated.

7.5.1 Typical cycle
Since FK3A continuously contains slip, batch cycles become redundant. A typical graph for the
mixing cycle during a workday is shown in Figure 51 below, where examples of both mixing and
resting periods have been pointed out. The storage tanks have a periodical mixing cycle consisting
of three minutes of mixing followed by 30 minutes of rest. This excludes the one-hour morning
mixing, during which a sample is collected.
Mixing temporarily increases CP and decreases CIV by 10 to 15 units when the slip is even, but the
appearance of the trends changes when fresh slip from the mixers is added to the tank. When fresh
slip is added both CP and CIV are higher than otherwise for a few hours before they resettle, but
there are some differences between CP and CIV. In this case it takes around 90 minutes longer for
CP to even out than CIV, and when examining other cases this happens around 60% of the time.
During the remaining 40%, CP can either settle quicker or at the same time. The inconsistency comes
from CP as its trend for CP may look very different depending on the day, while the corresponding
trends for CIV look quite alike. The cause for this behavior is unclear.
It is apparent that CIV does not fully recover to its original level in Figure 51, as it settles at roughly
3,620 units after the addition of slip compared to 3,600 before the addition (values are subject to
change due to the time distortion of the probes, but the overall CIV values for FK3A are far higher
than for any other slip). This happens every time, but CIV slowly returns to its original value (in this
case 3,600) during the evening and night. Again, the same does not apply to CP, as most of the time
CP quite quickly reaches its original level (as is the case in Figure 51). With this said, there are cases
when CP has decreased below the original values after the addition of slip, and even decreased

60

during the addition itself. Nothing deviating has been found in the added batches or FK3A for these
cases.

Figure 51: CP and CIV trends during a typical workday for FK3A.
When slip is being added to FK3A, CIV increases during the resting periods while mixing lowers CIV.
This is logical as the probe sensor is situated closer to the surface than the bottom of the tank. Thus,
the fresh slip stays at the surface during resting periods, and it is not until mixing begins that it
begins to blend with the older slip. When all slip batches have been added, the CIV increase begins
to slow down and eventually stops as the slip becomes even.

7.5.2 Laboratory and probe results
Since adjustments are very rarely made in the storage tanks, only one sample is taken from FK3A
daily. This will result in fewer data points per graph, when compared to those of the mixers. Viscosity
and thixotropy results from FK3A are shown in Figure 52 below, and two points have been added to
point out noticeable deviancies.
Around point (1) in Figure 52, thixotropy hovers above 700 mPas, but then sinks down to 600 mPas.
This change in thixotropy is caused by the production pause during the summer, and during this
time slip was being stored in FK3A. Even though plastic films were placed on the storage tanks to
prevent excess water evaporation, some water may have evaporated, and the lack of mixing during
this time allowed for viscosity and thixotropy to increase. When production then resumed at point
(1), the slip was being mixed again, which led to viscosity and thixotropy levels slowly returning to
their usual values. Point (2) depicts a sudden spike in both viscosity and thixotropy, which was
caused by the water leak in RE2. Slip with higher viscosity and thixotropy was produced for a short
period to counteract the effects of the water leak.

61

After slip with higher viscosity and thixotropy was no longer needed, the production of regular slip
was resumed. During the last month of the observation period, a decreasing trend for both viscosity
and thixotropy values is noticeable. This is likely due to the properties of the new test slip. As
mentioned in the section for BL2B and BL3B, an increasing amount of deflocculants were added to
the mixers because thixotropy kept rising in the latter part of the slip storage. This increased amount
of deflocculants in the mixer stage caused FK3A’s parameters to gradually decrease, as thixotropy
did not yet climb in FK3A.

Figure 52: Viscosity and thixotropy results from FK3A during the observation period.
The storage tanks always contain some slip, which means that the probe placed in FK3A has always
been submerged in the slip. Therefore, the rate of change in probe values due to absorption has
slowed down and is approaching a state of equilibrium in FK3A and FK5C. Figure 53 below shows CP
and CIV results from FK3A during the observation period. It appears that the rate of distortion has
slowed down, but it is difficult to tell how long it will take until true equilibrium is reached. CP still
appears to be on a slightly downwards trajectory, while CIV may have reached a turning point. While
this is merely speculation, this could be the closest to a state of equilibrium any probe has gotten.

62

Figure 53: CP and CIV in FK3A during the observation period.
There were hopes that the latest CIV results would correlate with thixotropy, since they might be
unaffected by time distortion. When the results are plotted against each other, though, it is
apparent that there are no correlations between the two (see Figure 54 below). It is still too early
to generalize, but according to these results there might not be any correlations to be found
between laboratory and probe results even after time distortion has been fully eliminated for any
tank.

63

7.5.3 Compensating probe values
Exponential functions, with the best least-squares fit, were found by the PSP for CP and CIV in FK3A.
The functions look as follows:
−(𝑡−3)

𝐶𝑃𝐹𝐾3𝐴 (𝑡) = 46,575.86 + 164.80 ∙ e 26.62

−(𝑡−3)

𝐶𝐼𝑉𝐹𝐾3𝐴 (𝑡) = 3,609.77 − 313.34 ∙ e 27.64 .

(25)
(26)

These functions were used to compensate the values for CP and CIV in FK3A, and the results are
shown in Figure 55. These graphs do not resemble those of viscosity and thixotropy in Figure 52.
Even when splitting up the data points into smaller segments, nothing of significance was found for
either CP or CIV. It appears that while the overall shape of the CP and CIV graphs have improved,
when compared to the original ones shown in Figure 53, the compensation did little to make the
results more reliable or close to laboratory results.

Figure 55: Time corrected CP and CIV in FK3A.

64

7.5.4 Probe thixotropy concept
Every morning FK3A, along with the other tanks, is mixed for approximately one hour. The probe
reacts to this by increasing in CP and decreasing in CIV. After mixing has stopped, CP and CIV will
begin to return to their natural states. It will take some time for the slip to recover. A concept was
formed around this recovery time, as this time should vary depending on the slip’s properties.
Therefore, it could be possible to link this recovery time to viscosity, thixotropy or both if there was
an accurate measurement of this recovery time available. The excel-file, that calculates one median
value per minute, is insufficient when it comes to reliably measuring the recovery time, but there
are more sophisticated software programs that can calculate this time. The PSP uses a software that
can handle the data frequency of 30 data points per minute. The software is also able to
approximate the time required for the slip to return to its natural state (see Figure 56 below).

Figure 56: Image of a software approximating the time required for the slip to return to its natural
state after morning mixing.
If these approximations were done for a sizeable amount of days, and the results were compared
to viscosity and thixotropy measurements provided by the laboratory, there could be a correlation
between these. This requires some sophisticated software and large amounts of storage space, as
the higher frequency of data points is required for these approximations. Another problem as of
now is that these calculations are not automated, but require manual labor, and they cannot be
done in real-time. This is still acceptable for early stages, when a correlation between the returning
time and laboratory measurements is being investigated. If it was found, however, that this may be
65

used to indicate thixotropy instead of manual laboratory measurements, it would be beneficial if a
script could be developed to automatically calculate the recovery time every morning.
To summarize, this is merely a concept at the time of writing. However, if enough resources can be
allocated to this and a solid connection was found between returning time and laboratory results,
this just might become a useful tool for indicating thixotropy or viscosity in the future. It is
noteworthy, though, that there are in-line viscosity and thixotropy indicators specifically built for
this purpose.

7.6 Storage tank FK5C
FK5C is the second to last tank in the slip storage. Here, fresh slip from earlier storage tanks and
return slip from the casting process is mixed together. The pumping of slip into FK5C is controlled
by the surface level of slip inside FK5C: if the level drops below the lower limit, the tank will receive
slip from FK1C and RE2 (see Figure 19 for reference). From FK5C the slip flows forward into FK5B,
which is the final storage tank before being pumped into the casting process. FK5C is, however,
more interesting to study, as the two different slips are being mixed together there. The monitoring
could give insight about the mixed slip.

7.6.1 Typical cycle
Similar to the probe in FK3A, FK5C’s probe is also constantly submerged in slip, and batches become
mixed up with return flow and each other. What differs from FK3A is that smaller amounts of slip
are being pumped to FK5C from two sources many times per hour, depending on how much slip
flows from FK5C into FK5B and, therefore, the slip inflow is more inconsistent.
Figure 57 below shows typical behavior for CP in FK5C. The data are taken from the cloud-based
service, since the accuracy of the graph is lost in Excel due to the frequency of one value per minute.
The morning mixing is visible to the left of the Figure, where CP remains quite even. The same cannot
be said for the rest of the time period. It is quite common that CP plummets and recovers very
quickly, and there are numerous examples of that in Figure 57. Rapid increases in CP are rarer, but
one such occasion can be seen to the right in Figure 57. Otherwise, CP tends to fluctuate within ten
units.
In an attempt to decipher this behavior, mixing data from FK5C along with pumping data from FK1C
and RE2 were collected into an Excel-file. The data was manually compared to CP and CIV data from
the probes. Unfortunately, there were no clear causes to the highs and lows of CP and CIV, as it was
found that these occurred irregularly when comparing to all data available. CP and CIV both
increased and decreased during pumping of both slips, and even when nothing was being pumped
into FK5C at all. Mixing usually evens out CP and CIV, and attempts to bring it to a level similar to
the one during morning mixing, but there are also times when mixing appears to cause a plummet
in CP and CIV values.

66

Figure 57: Typical CP cycle in FK5C.

7.6.2 Laboratory and probe results
Thixotropy has been slowly increasing in the latter half of the slip storage, during the end of the
observation period. This phenomenon is visible in the laboratory data gathered from FK5C. Viscosity
and thixotropy results from FK5C are shown in Figure 58 below, and a total of four points and an
arrow have been placed in the graphs to help explain the deviancies.
When production resumed at the end of July, thixotropy varied a lot during the first few days before
reaching its normal state. This is depicted by point (1). At point (2), both viscosity and thixotropy are
at their lowest points. This occurred when the water leak was noticed in RE2, from which return slip
is pumped to FK5C. Density in FK5C sank by 10 g/l consequently, which is a critical change. As a
countermeasure, more dense slip was being produced. FK5C recovered faster than anticipated,
however. Viscosity and thixotropy both returned to normal values the next day, while density
needed around four days to recover. This led to the sudden increase and decrease in viscosity at
point (3), as the dense slip was no longer needed but it arrived to FK5C with a substantial delay.
After this, it was noticed that viscosity and thixotropy slowly began climbing by itself in the slip
storage, which it did not do earlier. This trend is depicted by the arrow for both viscosity and
thixotropy. Point number (4) shows viscosity and thixotropy results after the laboratory was forced
to add sodium silicate to FK5C, to keep thixotropy levels in check. The main countermeasure used
to keep thixotropy in check for the finished slip was adding deflocculants in the mixer stage, so that
the initial thixotropy and viscosity levels would be lower than before. When thixotropy then begins
to climb, as the slip matures in the storage, thixotropy would hopefully settle at a suitable level for
the finished slip. As shown by the steadily increasing viscosity and thixotropy levels in Figure 58, this
was insufficient.

67

Figure 58: Viscosity and thixotropy in FK5C during the observation period.
Figure 59 below shows CP and CIV trends for FK5C during the observation period. CIV has remained
nearly linear since September, while CP is still decreasing. One outlier is found for both CP and CIV,
but not due to the water leak on August 5th. Instead, it occurs on August 28th. Nothing in the slip
was observed that could be linked to the outlier, but instead the probe had behaved erratically
during that morning. Similar anomalies occurred a few times, and these events will be discussed in
section 7.6.4.

68

Figure 59: CP and CIV in FK5C during the observation period along with a highlighted outlier.

7.6.3 Compensating probe values
Exponential functions, with the best least-squares fit, were found by the PSP for CP and CIV in FK5C.
The functions look as follows:
−𝑡

𝐶𝑃𝐹𝐾3𝐴 (𝑡) = 46,552.22 + 247.96 ∙ e34.39
−𝑡

𝐶𝐼𝑉𝐹𝐾3𝐴 (𝑡) = 2,857.09 − 420.14 ∙ e25.12 .

(27)
(28)

These functions were used to compensate the values for CP and CIV in FK5C. The results are shown
in Figure 60. The compensation appears to result in some rather awkward looking trends, and the
compensated results have very little in common with laboratory results. These results could be
compensated further to better match laboratory results. At some point, however, one could risk
overdoing the compensation and compromising the validity of the results. The water leak on August
5th does not stand out on the CP trend, while it is visible in the CIV trend. The false outlier on August
28th, however, remains distinctly different from its surrounding data points.
The overall conclusion is the same as for the other tanks: the compensation in its current state does
not help in finding correlations between probe and laboratory results. The results were split up into
smaller segments, but this did not amount to anything noteworthy.
69

Figure 60: Time compensated CP and CIV in FK5C.

7.6.4 Anomalies in probe behavior
On August 28th, some unusual values for CP and CIV were recorded in FK5C during sample taking.
This raised concerns about the slip. The laboratory found nothing that explained the deviancies in
the probe values, and upon observing the slip it did not look abnormal either. The only possible
source of this anomaly was the probe itself, and it turned out that it was not the first time an
anomaly like this happened. Between August 17th and September 7th, CP and CIV results “crashed”
a total of seven times. After this they were not counted unless they affected results during sample
collection. These crashes would last between a few minutes and ten hours, and the values would
change by 30 to 350 units.

70

August 28th was not the first time the probes malfunctioned during sample taking, but the previous
crash caused such odd results that it had to be removed from the graphs. Otherwise, the scaling on
the CP and CIV graphs would have been inappropriate. Figure 61 shows CP and CIV trends from
August 18th, during one of these crashes. This happened to occur during sample taking. The normal
values for CP and CIV were approximately 46,575 and 2,850, respectively, before and after the crash.
During the crash, however, CP plummeted to just above 46,300 and CIV rose to nearly 3,150 before
slowly recovering from the crash. This crash lasted from 04:30 in the morning to 15:00 in the
afternoon, which was the longest crash recorded.

Figure 61: CP and CIV in FK5C during a probe crash on August 18 th.
The cause of these crashes is unknown. It is, therefore, also unknown why the crashes begun as late
as August instead of occurring from the get-go. This is not the same issue that the original probe in
L2 faced, as that probe completely stopped sending data packets. Since the crashes may last several
hours at a time, the user is completely in the dark about any possible changes in the slip during the
crash. Fortunately, the faulty probe is situated in FK5C, where the slip parameters vary very little.
Had this probe been placed in any of the mixers, where critical adjustments are made, a lot of
information would have been lost.

71

8. Conclusions and recommendations
Based on the results that have been gathered during the observation period, it is not recommended
to use the probes for real-time controlling of the slip manufacturing process. The absorption-based
distortion of probe results, discussed in section 7.2.3, makes it very difficult to find correlations to
laboratory results. The attempts to compensate probe results this far have not helped. The partly
unexplained data transfer issues, described in section 7.2.4, along with the probe crashes in FK5C
and the dysfunctional probe in L2 speak against relying on the probes during adjustments of the slip
(or other critical stages of slip production). It is recommended that Geberit continues to use their
traditional measurement methods to monitor slip adjusting for the foreseeable future.
If the reliability issues of the probes were fixed, it would be interesting to see what the probes are
capable of. There may still be slip parameters or aspects to the probe results that have not been
accounted for during this observation period, mainly due to time distortion. While it is difficult to
adjust the slip with the probes given the observations made in section 7.4.4, it still might be possible.
There could be some aspect to slip adjusting, that conventional measurement methods do not show,
that the probes react to, but this is merely speculation. What is positive is that probe results from
FK3A and FK5C have begun to even out. While it is known that the slip quality in those two tanks is
generally quite even, it is reassuring to notice that the probes agree. The probes are undeniably
smart, and it is unfortunate that the setbacks that have been encountered affected the results to
the magnitude they did.
Even though it takes a lot of manual labor to analyze all samples by hand in the laboratory, it is quite
reliable. It is suggested that this continues to be the primary method to control the slip production
process. With that said, there are some things to be learned from the probe results. Some
recommended actions for Geberit will be described in this chapter.

8.1 Verifying mixing times
The viscosity tests, that were completed in L2 and BL2B, indicated that the probes sense the amount
of undissolved solids in the slip. From the graphs in sections 7.3.4 and 7.4.5, it looks like the slips
become homogenous before mixing stops. This could be verified or dismissed by using the
sedigraph, which was introduced in section 4.9. Samples of the slips in L2 and BL2B, after raw
material addition, would be taken as reference samples. Samples would then be collected from new
batches with shorter mixing times. The results would then be compared to their reference results,
and if they do not differ substantially it indicates that the shortened mixing time has not affected
the slip quality. The mixing time would then be shortened by 10 to 20 minutes at a time, until the
results become affected negatively. Along with the sedigraph results, it would be beneficial to follow
up on viscosity and thixotropy results to ensure that the shorter mixing time does not affect these
negatively. This applies especially for L2 since viscosity still changed for L2 after the slip became
homogenous.
The PSP has thought about the possibility of monitoring the mixing process in real-time with the
help of the probes, and then ending it as needed. This would be beneficial when new raw material
batches are being used, as they might need different mixing times. It also could minimize the risk of

72

accidentally mixing insufficiently. In this case it is important to approximate the possible savings the
probes could bring and compare them to the cost of the probes.
If the mixing time can be cut down, it would result in lower electricity costs and a shorter processing
time for the blungers and mixers. The mixing time in L2 may also be compared to the other blungers
that use an older model of mixer, and if there is substantial time and money to be saved it may be
beneficial to replace the old mixers with newer model for all blungers.

8.2 Tying slip quality to process benchmarks
During the observation period, there was an idea that the results from the probes, especially the
ones from FK5C, could be tied to process benchmarks or results from the casting process. This could
also be done for benchmarks even further on in the manufacturing process. The goal would be to
investigate if some correlations between the process benchmarks and probe results could be found.
If this was possible, it could help identify optimal values for the slip in FK5C based on how well the
rest of the process performs with the slip.
The concept seems promising, but the issue is to find suitable data to compare probe results with.
In the casting process, the main parameter that is measured is casting thickness. Since the optimal
thickness varies depending on the model it does become difficult to use. One possibility is that the
slip would be evaluated during every shift: based on appearance, feel and how well it is suited for
casting. The problem with this evaluation system is subjectivity, as every shift might have different
opinions about the slip or how to grade it. The evaluation system might also be a bit too rough
around the edges, as there is a possibility that minor changes in the slip might go unnoticed.
Another indicator of slip quality could be the amount of scrapped green bodies, along with the
reasons they were scrapped. Do the green bodies get stuck to the molds or do they break easily?
What categories should be added to such an indicator? Different reasons for scrapping might give
additional information about the slip. There is much that is yet unknown, and it is encouraged to
communicate as much as possible between different process stages, since seemingly “useless”
information for one person could aid another in their job assignments.
I suggest that, if possible, key persons from each step of the manufacturing process in Ekenäs
attempt to identify key benchmarks for their respective steps, and attempt to combine these with
each other. This is not only useful for this specific case, but could also prove useful in the future,
when similar data is needed. A tool like this could also help overall production efficiency, as the
results from slip production could already help later process stages adjust their process, based on
the incoming slip. Sharing information needs to be seamless and brainstorming together helps bring
out new concepts and ideas that aid decision making for everyone.

8.3 Measuring thixotropy in the storage
It is likely that the new test slip, described in section 7.2.5, or a new batch of a raw material has
caused thixotropy to rise in the latter half of the tanks of the slip storage, which is an uncommon
and tricky problem. Since this thixotropy development cannot be seen with the probes, it would be
beneficial to monitor the increase by other means. The Ekenäs plant has recently installed two on-

73

line thixotropy indicators near the pumps to and from FK1C, and both indicators are surrounded by
two valves (see Figure 62 below).
When a pump shuts down after pumping slip, the valves around the indicator are closed and
viscosity measurements begin. The indicator measures viscosity several times, and then calculates
two average values approximately 80 seconds apart. The difference in average viscosity becomes
the thixotropy of the slip. The results are stored in the same database as the laboratory results, and
the trends are observable with a software called Grafana (Grafana Labs, 2021). Utilizing these for
slip monitoring in the storage is something I recommend, since the equipment is specifically
designed for viscosity and thixotropy measurements. The equipment is also already owned by the
company. If the indicators prove to be very accurate or comparable to laboratory results, one could
consider replacing manual viscosity and thixotropy measurements in FK2A, FK3A and FK1C with the
results from the indicators. This is still only speculation, however.

Figure 62: Image of one of the thixotropy indicators along with the two surrounding valves.

8.4 Streamlining the mixer stage
In section 7.4.1, probe results showed that there could be a significant difference between the slips
in BL2B and BL3B. If there truly is a difference, it could be due to their different production cycles.
In order to test this, the unique cycle for BL3B should be discontinued. Instead, the slip coming to
BL3B should follow the same steps as the other mixers. This way the slips are as alike as possible,
and it should be easier to determine if the probes show correct values or not. If the probes still
display a vast difference between the results from BL2B and BL3B, there is probably something
wrong in the calibrations in one or both probes. If the results begin to resemble each other, it
indicates that there truly have been some differences between the two mixers.

74

The production cycle for BL3B was changed in December. Based on early results, it appears that
BL3B’s probe values have changed drastically. The trends for BL2B and BL3B look very much alike
after the changes have been made. The results from the first new BL3B batch, compared to BL2B’s
results and older BL3B batches, are shown in Figure 63 below. What is fascinating is that all batches
enter the mixers with similar CP, considering that the old way of manufacturing BL3B’s slip meant
that it already contained the non-plastic raw materials. Upon inspection of Figure 63, it is apparent
that the addition of non-plastic raw materials increases CP by approximately 150 units. CP decreases
roughly 15 to 25 units during the first 20 hours after the raw material addition. According to
estimations, the old cycle, that began in L1 and ended in BL3B, lasted between 7 and 10 days,
depending on how much slip was being produced. If it was assumed that CP would continue to
decrease linearly at a rate of 15 to 25 units for 7 to 10 days, the total decrease would be quite close
to 150. This far longer cycle could be the reason behind the similar CP values upon entering the
mixers.

Figure 63: Color coded CP trends for batches from BL2B and BL3B from 24.11 to 11.12.2020
The two slips are rheologically very different, however. This is revealed by laboratory results. Older
measurement results from L2 and L3 (the mixers from where slip is pumped to BL2B and BL3B,
respectively) show that density in L2 had an average of 1,550 g/l, while the corresponding average
for L3 was 1,825 g/l. The viscosity and thixotropy values for L2 were on average 100 mPas and 40
mPas, whereas for L3 the values resided around 700 to 800 mPas and 200 mPas. The difference is
massive, due to L3 already containing non-plastic raw materials. Therefore, there is reason to
believe that something related to the old manufacturing cycle for BL3B caused energy losses that
affected probe results negatively. The rate at which CP decreases suggests that this is not the effect
of time distortion. There is a possibility that only CP behaves like this, similarly to how CP and CIV
75

react differently to water and sodium silicate. This is unconfirmed, however, since the CIV results
for the new tests have not yet been released.

8.5 Eliminating time distortion
It is obvious that time distortion is one of the main culprits when it comes to not being able to
recommend the use of the probes for process control. While it may not be the ideal solution, it still
could be beneficial to wait until the effects of absorption disappear. Considering an equilibrium is
reached for all probes, they would then be reinstalled into their respective tanks. The probes would
need to be submerged in ceramic slip around the clock to reach equilibrium as quickly as possible.
Even then, it could take months before consistent results are obtained. Once all probes show no
signs of distortion, data collecting would begin from scratch. This time around it should be easier to
determine if the probes are reliable or not.

1 Inledning
Människan har utnyttjat lera och mineraler för att skapa keramiska produkter sedan urminnes tider,
och det finns bevis som tyder på att människor kunde skapa keramiska objekt redan för 20 000 år
sedan i Jiangxi-provinsen i Kina (Wu, et al., 2012). Termen keramik härstammar från de grekiska
orden keramikos eller keramos. Med keramik avses ofta fasta objekt som främst består av
oorganiska föreningar och som har bränts för att åstadkomma dess hårdhet och form. De vanligaste
beståndsdelarna är kvarts och oxider av olika slag. (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)
Då det kommer till tillverkning av keramisk massa har det inte skett några stora förändringar eller
förbättringar under den senaste tiden, och detta gäller även för analys av den keramiska massan.
Keramisk massa har reologiska egenskaper såsom densitet, viskositet och tixotropi, och dessa mäts
utifrån prover av den keramiska massan. Nackdelen med manuell analys av prover är att man inte
får resultaten i realtid, utan istället får man information om hurdan massan var för några timmar
sedan eller i värsta fall någon dag sedan. Därför vill Geberit utforska möjligheten att använda en
sond som är i direkt kontakt med den keramiska massan för att erhålla mätresultat i realtid, och
samtidigt vill de undersöka ifall det hittas en ny parameter man kunde börja följa upp för att
förbättra kvalitetskontrollen. Ifall mätarna visar sig vara pålitliga kan man minska på antalet prover
som måste samlas samt analyseras varje dag, och samtidigt har man en bättre bild av massans
egenskaper i nuet vilket skulle underlätta justering av massan.

2 Råmaterial för tillverkning av keramisk massa
Keramiska material är traditionellt föreningar av metaller och icke-metaller, och dessa kan innehålla
gitter, glasfaser och porositeter (Asteljoki, 1974). Detta kapitel innehåller information om de
råmaterial som används av Geberit för tillverkning av keramisk massa. Råmaterialen delas allmänt i
två kategorier: plastiska och icke-plastiska råmaterial.

2.1 Plastiska råmaterial
Till plastiska råmaterial tillhör olika slags leror och kaoliner. Enligt Norton (1970) består lera främst
av kaolinit, som är en lermineral, men innehåller också olika organiska ämnen. Lera används vid
tillverkning av keramisk massa främst för att öka massans formbarhet samt för att öka det keramiska
föremålets styrka innan bränning. Lera kan binda åt sig stora mängder vatten och krymper därför
mycket under torkning, och därför är det viktigt att inte enbart använda lera för att tillverka
keramisk massa. (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)
I Geberits fabrik i Ekenäs används två olika slags leror för att minimera skadorna ifall endera lerans
sammansättning ändrar avsevärt. Det är svårt att hålla leran exakt likadan hela tiden eftersom den
utvinns från marken och markens sammansättning varierar beroende på var man gräver (Norton,
1970).
Kaolin är en term som används för leror som huvudsakligen består av kaolinitkristaller. Kaolin
används i keramisk massa för att hjälpa balansera ut lerans effekter, och gjutningstiden för kaolin
77

är kortare än för lera. Kaolin leder även till en mer fluid massa än lera, vilket underlättar förflyttning
och pumpning av massan. Sanitärvaror är oftast vita, och då kaolin bränns blir den rätt vit så detta
är också en fördel med kaolin. (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)
I Geberits fabrik i Ekenäs används två olika sorters kaolin för tillverkning av keramisk massa: ena
kaolinet är rätt konventionellt medan det andra kaolinet är mer som en blandning av lera och kaolin
till sina egenskaper.

2.2 Icke-plastiska råmaterial
Icke-plastiska råmaterial ger den keramiska massan sin struktur och ses ofta som massans skelett
medan de plastiska råmaterialen är dess muskler och vävnad. Geberit i Ekenäs använder pegmatit,
som är en blandning av fältspater och kvarts, samt rent kvarts vid tillverkningen av sin keramiska
massa.
Fältspater är mycket allmänna och utgör nästan 60 % av all vulkansten. Fältspater består av
aluminiumoxid samt kiseldioxid och är viktiga eftersom de är en av få källor av vattenlösliga
alkalimetallföreningar, och dessa föreningar är viktiga för att det keramiska föremålet formas rätt
under bränning (Norton, 1970). Det finns tre huvudtyper av fältspat: kalium-, natrium- och
kalciumfältspat (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003). Den pegmatit Geberit i Ekenäs använder innehåller alla tre
typers fältspat samt kvarts.
Kvarts består av silikatjoner som har format ett tetraedriskt gitter. Kvarts tunnar ut massan ifall den
är för plastisk och minskar på torrkrympningen hos det keramiska föremålet. Kvarts gör även massan
mer spröd och höjer på bränningstemperaturen, så de olika råmaterialen motverkar delvis varandra.
Keramiska massor blir därför ofta fulla av kompromisser. (Jylhä-Vuorio, 2003)

3 Laboratoriets mätmetoder
Laboratoriet vid Geberits fabrik i Ekenäs ansvarar för kvalitetskontroll av den keramiska massan,
råmaterialen, brända föremål med mera. Laboratoriet samlar prover som sedan analyseras med
hjälp av standardiserade mätmetoder. I detta kapitel redogörs för de viktigaste mätningarna
laboratoriet utför med tanke på den keramiska massans kvalitet.

3.1 Densitet
Densitet är ett mått på hur mycket en bestämd volym av ett ämne väger, och i Ekenäs anges detta i
g/l. Laboratoriet i Ekenäs mäts densiteten genom att fylla en metallcylinder, med volymen 1 l, med
keramisk massa. Massan kyls alltid ned till 25 °C innan vägning. Cylindern som är fylld med massa
putsas innan den ställs på en våg. Vågen är kalibrerad så att den inte beaktar cylinderns vikt, så det
resultat som ges av vågen är densiteten given i g/l.

3.2 Viskositet och tixotropi
Viskositet är ett mått på hur mycket en vätska motstår flöde med hjälp av sin inre friktion (Worrall,
1982). Laboratoriet kan mäta viskositet på två olika sätt. Det första sättet är rätt primitivt och utförs
manuellt. Provmassan kyls först ned till 25 °C och blandas om. Efter detta hälls provmassan inuti en
rörviskometer, som är en cylinder med en bottenventil, tills rörviskometern är full. Sedan öppnas
78

bottenventilen och tidtagning påbörjas. Då ventilen öppnas börjar provmassan att rinna ut, och
tidtagningen avslutas då en bestämd volym av provmassa har runnit ut. Den erhållna tiden i
sekunder är ett mått på viskositet.
Viskositeten kan även mätas med hjälp av en automatiserad rotationsviskometer. Provmassan
placeras i en cylinder som fästs i rotationsviskometern. Rotationsviskometern är försedd med en
mindre cylinder som positioneras inuti den cylinder som innehåller massa, och följaktligen kommer
det att finnas provmassa mellan de två cylindrarna. Den mindre cylindern börjar rotera med
varierande hastighet, och skjuvspänningen mäts för olika hastigheter. På basen av mätresultaten
kan rotationsviskometern räkna ut viskositeten och ange den i mPas.
Tixotropi är en minskning av en vätskas viskositet då vätskan utsätts för en kraft som får den att
flöda. Efter att vätskan inte längre är utsatt för externa krafter kommer viskositeten att återvända
till sin ursprungliga nivå. Detta beteende förklaras med attraherande krafter mellan partiklar i
vätskan. Då vätskan inte utsätts för externa krafter kommer de svaga krafterna mellan partiklarna i
vätskan ordna partiklarna i strukturer som påminner om korthus, men genast då en yttre kraft
appliceras på vätskan kommer de svaga bindningarna att brista och således sjunker viskositeten.
Tixotropi är viktigt för keramiska massor, eftersom det tillåter massan att transporteras lätt med
hjälp av externa krafter medan den tjocknar snabbt då den står stilla i en gjutform. (Mewis &
Wagner, 2009)
Tixotropi kan mätas med hjälp av rotationsviskometern, som beskrevs i 3.2, genom att mäta
provmassans viskositet på två olika tidpunkter och sedan subtrahera värdena. Skillnaden i dessa två
värden blir tixotropin, och tixotropin anges i Ekenäs i mPas.

4 Nya mätsonden
Totalt fem mätsonder placerades inuti behållaren i olika delar av massatillverkningen i Ekenäs fabrik.
Sonderna mäter förlusterna i ett elektromagnetiskt fält nära sondens sensor, och dessa förluster
orsakar av den keramiska massan. Sonden kalkylerar resultat på basen av dessa förluster och ger
två mätvärden: CP (calculated permittivity) och CIV (calculated ion viscosity). Allt som orsakar
förluster i det elektromagnetiska fältet som skapas av sonden kommer att märkas i mätresultaten,
så dessa sonder beaktar allt som händer inuti massan.
Keramiska massans temperatur påverkar mätresultaten i hög grad, och på grund av detta har
sonderna genomgått temperaturkalibrering. Temperaturskillnader som tidigare har påverkat
mätresultat med till exempel 50 enheter påverkar enbart 2 – 3 enheter efter kalibreringen.
Sonderna har också genomgått en så kallad materialkalibrering, vars mål är att få mätarna att ge så
lika värden som möjligt ifall de mäter samma keramiska massa. På så sätt kan man ersätta och byta
plats på sonder ifall någon går sönder eller dylikt.

5 Resultat
Målet med diplomarbetet är att avgöra om sonderna är lämpade för massatillverkningsprocessen
eller inte. I bästa fall skulle de resultat sonderna ger korrelera med en eller fler av de parametrar
laboratoriet mäter, och således skulle man direkt kunna ersätta manuell provtagning och analys

79

med sondernas mätresultat. Ifall det inte finns samband mellan sondernas och laboratoriets resultat
blir det betydligt svårare att hitta användning för sonderna.
Laboratoriet samlar i regel ett prov från varje behållare runt klockan 07 på morgonen, så de
mätresultat sonderna gav runt klockan 07 varje morgon dokumenterades och samlades i en xlsx-fil.
På detta sätt går det att direkt jämföra laboratoriets resultat med de resultat sonderna ger. Dessa
jämförelser gav oväntade resultat, då det rätt tidigt märktes att både CP- och CIV-värdena försköts
med tiden. I början av prövotiden låg CP-värdena i en behållare kring 46 850, medan värdena i slutet
av prövotiden låg kring 46 570. Denna ”tidsförskjutning” visade sig härstamma från jonabsorption.
Sonderna är gjutna av polyuretan, men då EDS-analys utfördes på polyuretanet hittades 2 mass-%
av både kisel och aluminium på kanterna av sondens sensor. Polyuretan innehåller varken kisel eller
aluminium, så dessa ämnen har absorberats från den keramiska massan. Dessa halter av
absorberade joner kan förklara varför sondernas värden har förskjutits med tiden. Dessa förvrängda
mätvärden orsakade problem vid analys av mätvärdena, eftersom mätvärdena inte längre stämde.
Mätvärdena kompenserades en tredje gång för att eliminera jonabsorptionens påverkan på
mätvärdena, men kompenseringen hjälpte inte att hitta pålitliga korrelationer mellan sondernas
och laboratoriets resultat.
Under de två sista månaderna av prövotiden upphörde dataöverföringen från mätsonderna till
datorn där resultaten sparas totalt sju separata gånger, och dessa brytningar i dataöverföringen
ledde till märkbara förluster av mätdata. Orsaker till dessa brytningar var inte alltid verifierad, men
det finns orsak att misstänka att Geberits interna brandväggar orsakade några av dessa fall.
Under mätsondernas prövotid utfördes ett så kallat massatest, vilket innebär att ett nytt recept för
den keramiska massan prövades under en viss tid. Det nya receptet innehöll 5 % av ett tredje kaolin
och ersatte således 5 % av ett annat kaolin, och laboratoriet förväntade sig inte att denna ändring
skulle leda till märkbara förändringar i massans egenskaper. Det visade sig dock att keramiska
massans viskositet och tixotropi ökade märkbart vid tillverkning av testmassan, vilket ledde till att
laboratoriet var tvunget att använda mer tillsatsämnen för att sänka viskositeten och tixotropin till
rätt nivåer. Utifrån mätsondernas resultat märktes inte att något var på tok med massan, utan
istället var det laboratoriets konventionella metoder som indikerade att massan beter sig ovanligt.
Det faktum att mätsonderna ger liknande resultat för två väldigt olika massor tyder på att
mätsonderna inte lämpas för kvalitetskontroll av den keramiska gjutmassan.
En av de viktigaste tillämpningarna för mätsonderna skulle vara övervakningen av keramiska
massans justering med tillsatsämnen. Laboratoriet sköter justeringen genom att ta ett prov av och
analysera massan, och ifall parametrarna inte är på tillfredställande nivå tillsätts t.ex. vattenglas
som sänker på viskositeten och tixotropin. Massan blandas sedan om en stund innan ett nytt prov
samlas och analyseras. Detta förfarande fortsätts tills massans egenskaper godkänns. Om
mätsonderna fungerade rätt skulle man kunna spara både tid och manuellt arbete genom att justera
massan på basen av de resultat som erhålls av mätsonden. Det visar sig dock att mätsonderna inte
reagerar på tillsättning av vatten och vattenglas på ett sådant sätt att man kunde använda sonderna
för att justera massan. Tillsättningen av vatten syns tydligt då man granskar värden för CIV, medan
tillsättningen av vattenglas syns då CP-värden granskas. Ifall en enda parameter kunde reagera på
tillsättningen av både vatten och vattenglas skulle mätsonderna möjligtvis kunna användas för att
justera massan utan laboratorieprover, men för tillfället är det inte möjligt.

6 Sammanfattning
Baserat på de resultat som har samlats under mätsondernas prövotid rekommenderas inte att
mätsonderna används för kvalitetskontroll av den keramiska gjutmassan. Jonabsorptionen på
sondernas yta orsakade förvrängning av mätresultaten, och fastän resultaten kompenserades för
att eliminera absorptionens effekt kunde inga korrelationer mellan mätsondernas och laboratoriets
resultat hittas. Utöver detta förlorades många dygns mätdata på grund av problem med
dataöverföringen, och det är oroande att en orsak till dessa dataöverföringsproblem inte alltid
hittades. Datats tillgänglighet är ytterst viktigt då det handlar om att utnyttja mätdatat i realtid, så
om dataöverföringen rubbas då massan ska justeras kan konsekvenserna vara ödesdigra.
Ifall mätsondernas diverse problem kan åtgärdas vore det intressant att se vad de verkligen kan
åstadkomma, och mätsonderna har använts i t.ex. målfärgsindustrin med god framgång. Därför
kunde Geberit överväga att införa en ny prövotid för mätsonderna ifall de ovannämnda problemen
har åtgärdats.
