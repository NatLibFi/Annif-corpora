Title: R&D activities in recessions: Implications on Nordic firm performance
Supervisor: Matti Skoog
Abstract:
This thesis investigates whether the research and development (R&D) activities of the
firm impact future firm performance, and whether differences in these R&D activities
during recessions could explain later performance differences among firms. This study
uses a Nordic firm sample – analysing accounting data consisting of Finnish and
Norwegian listed firms from 2007-2018.
Using heteroscedastic-robust multiple regression analyses and non-parametric tests,
how pre-recessionary and recessionary R&D activities impact on sales growth,
profitability, and market valuation was examined with panel data of the 90 listed firms.
The findings contradict the generally positively viewed relationship between R&D
activities and measures of firm profitability and sales growth. Higher R&D intensity
pre-recession led to worse recessionary firm profitability, whereas it still had a positive
impact on the following year’s market valuation. Recessionary R&D intensity
demonstrated significant negative effects on firm performance upward six years into
the post-recessionary period, albeit without consistent results indicating a specific
trend. Any disparity in profitability or sales growth post-recession among those firms
that increased or decreased R&D intensity during the recession, could not be detected.
Rather than offering definitive answers regarding the relationship between firm
performance and innovation, this thesis contributes to the scarce collection of research
into the strategical actions of firms during recessions, studying whether these actions
could be a source of sustained competitive advantage for firms. In addition to this, it
offers a multitude of opportunities for further research, entailing the need for additional
multidisciplinary studies.

1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter will begin by providing background information about the subject, followed
by a problem discussion that will describe the problem area further. Additionally, the
purpose of this study will be presented, along with the limitations of the research. Lastly,
the structure of this thesis will be presented.

1.1 Background
A company can outperform rivals only if it can establish a difference that it can
preserve.
(Porter M. E., 1996, p. 62)
What causes performance differences between firms and the variance in the timespans of
such performance differences? Understanding how to acquire a competitive advantage
and sustaining such an advantage has been the main mission of research in the field of
strategy, with varying approaches for analysis over time (Levinthal, 1995). According to
Michael E. Porter (1985), a sustained competitive advantage is to attain above-average
performance in the long run. Finding these “market-beating” strategies, which would
consistently result in excess returns in the long term, has also been one key interest in the
field of financial research, although, achieving this has proved to be complicated, if not
impossible. The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) has been the principal hypothesis
within finance since Eugene F. Fama (1970) reviewed it in his famous research paper
(Shleifer, 2000), despite the criticism the hypothesis has received both empirically and
theoretically. On an efficient market, prices would fully reflect all available information
and assets would be priced “correctly”, thus reaching above-average performance would
be impossible in the long term.
When discussing firm investments, firms may be considered as investors in strategic
factor markets, where resources can be obtained to implement product market strategies
(Barney J. B., 1986). These resources could imply physical investments, or inputs for
non-tradeable intangible assets as well. To profit from these physical assets would require
pricing inefficiencies in the factor market, which would enable acquiring the assets below
their real value; that is, through the exploitation of information asymmetries in the factor
1

Axel Koukkula
markets. The process of profiting from intangible assets is arguably more complex, as
these assets assume an elusive and more abstract form, which results in arduousness when
measuring asset-specific output. This unique, slippery nature of the intangible assets is
also one primary reason why they are considered as one vital source of potentially
acquiring a sustained competitive advantage (Barney J. , 1991). Intangible assets, due to
their firm-specific nature, require them to be internally accumulated over time (Dierickx
& Cool, 1989), whereas physical assets can be bought with relative ease from these factor
markets. Thus, for firms to gain a sustained competitive edge against other firms, they
either need to internally accumulate strategically important non-tangible resources or
acquire tangible resources from factor markets below their real value.
As theories regarding finance, strategic management, or economics are developed, more
often than so are they based on simplified assumptions of the reality, for the sake of
creating a flexible model to explain the relationships between different variables. One
such example of a simplified assumption is the neutral state of the economy in a market
or country, also known as the market equilibrium. In reality, the economy is more cyclical
to its nature; where periods of booming growth are followed by, sometimes even a severe
decline in growth (Benkemoune, 2009). One such example of a severe downturn in the
economy was the Great Recession, triggered by the financial crisis of 2008 and felt
globally throughout all developed economies, with varying severity in different countries
and industries (Suni & Vihriälä, 2016).

1.2 Problem discussion
Although it is generally agreed among the circles of scholars and practitioners alike that
recessions dramatically affect the competitive landscape of firms, relatively little research
on the strategical choices of firms has been done in the setting of a recession (Latham &
Braun, 2011, p. 111). Within the strategy literature finance is generally dismissed as
uninteresting, as the market efficiency is too high on the financial markets to explain
differences in firm performance (Peteraf, 1993). Also, projects will access financing as
long as the net present value (NPV) is positive. These assumptions are admittedly
oversimplified for several reasons.
Firstly, as Knudsen and Lien (2014) present, the efficiency of the financial markets may
vary over time, as recessions may cause demand reductions and issues in credit
2

Axel Koukkula
availability. Secondly, the characteristics of an asset may affect its difficulty to acquire
financing, as tangible assets acquire cheaper external financing than intangible assets
(Czarnitzki & Hottenrott, 2011). Lastly, Hall (2010) suggests that firm characteristics
may also affect the difficulty in accessing financing for investments, as established firms
may have easier access to external and/or internal financing than new firms. Therefore, it
is of relevance to combine strategical and financial theories for a comprehensive overview
of how and why investments during a recession might affect future firm performance.
The paradox of strategy and finance derives from the difficulties in financing the assets
that are considered as the most important from a strategic point of view, that is,
intangibles. According to the resource-based view (RBV) (Barney J. , 1991), with an
increasingly tangible nature of an asset, it has an inversed effect on the potential of the
asset to become a source of competitive advantage. While there exists research within the
fields of finance and economics about investments and how they are financed (Fazzari,
Hubbard, & Petersen, 1988), there are some relevant gaps in the literature. The first gap
is the traditional focus on physical investments, which derives from the results being
simpler to calculate with clear inputs and outputs, whereas intangible investments are
more complex to measure in the form of output. The second identified gap in the literature
is the tendency not to link these investments and the source of financing to firm
performance. For these reasons, by combining resource-based view and investment
theory from finance, it would be possible to investigate further competitive advantages
within industries on an asset- and a firm-level.

1.3 Purpose of the study
The purpose of this thesis is twofold. Firstly, it is to analyse whether firms’ R&D spending
affect future financial performance, in regard to the business cycle phase. Secondly, it is
to study whether differences in firms’ R&D activities during recessions can explain firm
performance differences. As prior research has been concentrating on a recession’s
impact on firms’ investments, this study will be a humble attempt to further fill the gap
in the literature by investigating the relation between firms’ later performance with firms’
R&D activity during recessions in the Nordic countries.

1.4 Limitations of the study
This study will be limited to the Nordic equity market, and more specifically to the
companies listed on the main market of Nasdaq OMX Nordic, including companies from
the Helsinki and the Oslo Stock Exchange. As the study requires access to accounting
figures for the research period, it limits the pool of firms to only include publicly traded
companies. The time period of research will begin before the 2008 financial crisis and
end in 2018, thus, the examined time period will be 2007-2018.
To further limit the study from extending too wide, this thesis will not examine the
financing viewpoint of research and development (R&D) activities nor how these projects
are valued. The theory chapter will present how accounting standards interpret R&D
spending, albeit it will not partake in-depth in the problematic discussion regarding
expensing or capitalising the R&D expenditures.
Without access to additional data regarding e.g. patents, type of research, and innovation
figures, assumptions on intensity will be made based on accounting figures from the
annual reports. Also, differences in the accounting standards GAAP and IFRS regarding
R&D spending may affect the results, when comparing the Nordic firms to earlier
research based on U.S. firms.

1.5 Research question
This study aims to answer the following research questions:
Does R&D spending affect future firm growth and profitability during periods of
recession and economic expansion?
and
Can firm performance differences be explained by differences in R&D spending during
recessions?
The two research questions are very much linked, as for the second question to even be
plausible, the first one needs to be true to at least some extent. Therefore, to provide a
broader analysis of the R&D activities’ effect on firm performance, this thesis will
examine both viewpoints.

discussion. Further, a walkthrough of the research purpose as well as limitations of the
study was provided. Lastly, the research questions were presented.

of R&D, and lastly, business cycles, and recessions.
Chapter three provides insight into prior research within the fields of strategical
management, accounting, economics, and finance. The aspect of the research will be
focusing on resources and firm performance, as well as the recessionary effects on R&D
and firm performance. Finally, the hypotheses for the thesis will be presented.

2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
This chapter is to provide insight into the basic theories regarding the subjects to be
analysed in this thesis. Firstly, determinants of firm performance will be explored, with
the point of view on both the external as well as internal environment of the firm. This
will be followed by a discussion on firm resources from the aspect of intangible assets,
more specifically on R&D – its implications on current accounting standards, firms, and
industries, as well as suitable measures for firm performance in relation to R&D. Lastly,
the external environment of a firm will be presented through a broader, macro-economic
perspective discussing business cycles and recessions.

2.1 Determining firm performance
Comprehending the origin of firm performance has been a key interest for researchers
both within economics, as well as the field of strategy. Why do some firms acquire
superior performance compared to its peers, while some show constant underperformance
in relation to the competitors? In the 1960s and 1970s, a considerable amount of empirical
research on firm performance emerged; generating essential insights in firm profitability
variation (McGahan & Porter, 2002). The goal of these studies was to investigate the link
between fundamental barriers of market entry, tacit collusion, and firm performance;
however, these studies tended to assume the structure of an industry is defined
independently of firm performance. This led to studies in the 1980s challenging these
early assumptions, developing a new form of research, which was pioneered by Richard
Schmalensee.
Schmalensee (1985) decomposed variation in firm profitability into components of firmspecific, corporate-parent and industry effects. The return on assets (ROA) was the unit
used as measure for firm profitability in his study of 465 U.S. firms in 1975. The paper
found industry effects to be the main variable of explanation in firm profitability
variation; albeit, only a single year was studied and therefore it does not consider year
effects or persistency of performance. Later, these findings were disproved by Richard P.
Rumelt, who found firm-specific effects to be the pivotal variable explaining the
differences in firm profitability (Rumelt, 1991). His analysis expanded the time period
from 1975 to 1974-1977, including thereby fluctuating and stable industry effects that
were not included in Schmalensee’s (1985) original work.
6

Axel Koukkula
As both Rumelt (1991) and Schmalensee (1985) find industry and firm-specific effects to
be key variables of explanation for firm performance variation, the following subchapters
will discuss these effects by considering them as the environment for firms to operate in;
namely, the external respective the internal environment of a firm.

2.1.1

Firm’s external environment

One of the presumably most well-known frameworks within the field of strategy research
in analysing a firm’s external environment is the Five Forces analysis pioneered by
Michael E. Porter (1980). The external environment of a firm, also known as its industry,
consists of suppliers, customers, and lastly, competitors (Grant, 2016). Rating the
attractiveness of a specific industry depends on the bargaining power of the suppliers, the
value of a firm’s products to its customers, as well as the intensity of competition. In
Porter’s (1980) framework, these are applied into two different “streams” of competition:
namely, horizontal and vertical. The horizontal competition includes the threat of
substitutes, the competition of established rivals, as well as the threat of new entrants to
the market. Vertical competition on the other hand is based on the supply chain of a firm;
the bargaining power of suppliers respectively buyers. The aggregate competitive
pressure of these two “streams” determines the profitability and attractiveness of an
industry; therefore, the weaker these forces are, the higher chance of acquiring superior
performance.

Axel Koukkula
Porter (1985) suggests that firms may identify their best positioning in an industry through
the five forces model; consequently, being able to defend themselves against threatful
forces and construct a suitable strategy to counteract. Considering this framework, it
would be possible even for firms with homogenous resources to acquire a sustained
competitive advantage if they can manage their competitive environment properly.
Nevertheless, while the external environment of a firm admittedly does play a pivotal role
when determining variation in firm performance, more recent research has shown its
effect to be smaller than earlier assumed. In a study conducted by McGahan and Porter
(2002), their findings suggest that environmental factors only account for 10.3 percent of
the variation in firm profitability, while corporate-parent effects were liable for 11.6
percent of the variation. The largest identified source of variation in the profitability of
firms was firm-specific effects, responsible for 36 percent of the total variation. The
outstanding estimated 40 percent was considered to be unexplainable variation, resulting
from short-term profitability differences, luck, coincidences, or issues in the research
methodology.
Lastly, as the underlying assumption of an industry’s attractiveness in Porter’s framework
originates from the ownership of assets, it further ties the external environment of a firm
into the following subchapter discussing the firm’s internal environment (Grant, 2016).

2.1.2

Firm’s internal environment

Throughout the late 1970s and into the 1980s, the main foci in the field of strategy were
on the firm’s external, competitive environment, which was deemed as the main
determinant for a firm’s potential for profitability (Grant, 2016). In the 1990s, this focus
in strategy shifted towards the internal environment of the firm, partly as a reaction to the
dominant perception purely on the external environment prior. The lack of considering
resource deployment in order to achieve or defend such a favoured position on the product
markets, was indeed one reason for this shift of focus. Following, this resource
deployment entails costs for implementing these product market strategies, which must
be considered. This neglect gave birth to Barney’s (1986) paper, presenting the idea of a
strategic factor market, where strategically fundamental resources could be acquired.

8

Axel Koukkula
Barney argued that the profits from a strategy are dependent on the costs of implementing
it, while the costs depend on the related strategic factor markets. If these strategic factor
markets would be considered fully informationally efficient, all expected profits would
subsequently be competed away. According to Barney (1986), for a firm to be able to
acquire factors below their real value, it would require them to either possess superior
information, to be lucky or both; therefore, being comparable to the semi-efficient form
of EMH (Fama, 1970). This could derive from possible differences in the valuation of the
expected future value of resources, as the value of a specific resource is not automatically
identical to all buyers and sellers. Ensuing the heterogeneity of resources, it is improbable
that firms possess identical complementary resources; which in turn, may affect positively
or negatively a firm’s valuation of a specific resource (Denrell, Fang, & Winter, 2003).
Further, most of the intangible assets cannot be acquired directly through factor markets
but rather accumulated internally within the firm over time (Dierickx & Cool, 1989).
Accordingly, these intangible assets also offer firms an increased chance of building a
sustained, inimitable factor; that is, determined by the imitability degree of the
accumulation process.
Following this, Barney (1991) proposed a model of firm performance, focusing on the
capabilities and resources commanded by firms. This resource-based view considers a
firm’s true value to reside within its resources, either tangible and/or intangible, along
with the capability of deploying these resources effectively. Ultimately, this will lead to
a sustainable competitive advantage for a firm (Barney J. , 1991; Peteraf, 1993;
Wernerfelt, 1984). Firm resources may be interpreted as “all assets, capabilities,
organizational processes, firm attributes, information, knowledge, etc. controlled by a
firm that enables the firm to conceive of and implement strategies that improve its
efficiency and effectiveness” (Barney J. , 1991). These firm resources may further be
divided into tangible and intangible assets, where tangible assets are represented by
physical and financial capital, while intangible assets consist of resources such as
organizational and human capital. These two forms of assets will be discussed more indepth in chapter 2.2 and its subsequent subchapters, with the focus primarily on intangible
assets.
The resource-based view rests on two main assumptions when considering the resources
and capabilities of a firm (Barney J. , 1991; Peteraf, 1993). Firstly, firms may be
9

Axel Koukkula
heterogeneous with respect to the resources they control, indicating that firms, regardless
of their operating industry, may possess divergent combinations of resources and
capabilities. Secondly, resources are assumed to not being perfectly mobile, enabling
persistence in the heterogeneity over time. This may be interpreted as arduousness in
acquiring the resources in factor markets, which eventually may lead to long-lasting
heterogeneity (Crook, Ketchen, Combs, & Todd, 2008).
Further, there are four criteria a resource must meet to be deemed a potential source for
sustained competitive advantage, according to Barney (1991; 1997). Firstly, it must be
valuable, in a manner of either exploiting opportunities and/or neutralising threats in the
environment of a firm. Secondly, it must be rare among competitors, being merely in the
hands of a relative few, if any. Thirdly, it must be imperfectly imitable by competitors
with a significant cost disadvantage to a firm trying to obtain, develop, or duplicate the
resource. Fourthly, and lastly, the firm is to be organised in a way to be able to exploit
the resource efficiently. These four aspects of resources are known as the VRIO
framework, a commonly used strategic tool for resource analysis within literature and
management practice (Grant, 2016).

Axel Koukkula
By default, valuable and rare resources do not offer firms a source of sustained
competitive advantage, unless these resources cannot be obtained by competing firms
(Barney J. , 1991). The substitutability of a resource will lead to diminishing returns to
the holders of the given resource (Wernerfelt, 1984), as the existence of substitute
resources will cause the resource to lose its ability to create a sustainable competitive
advantage to the original firm. This further supports the inimitable and non-transferable
feature that the resource is to possess. The causal ambiguity of a resource implicates the
degree of difficulty in assessing the causal relationship between the resource and firm
performance. Reed and DeFillippi (1990) highlight specificity and complexity as factors
that tend to increase the causal ambiguity of a resource, in addition to tacitness. Resources
related to firm-specific tasks or skills have a lower value in alternative use, while tacitness
implies the inherent and non-identifiable knowledge of actions taken. Social complexity
is closely linked to intangible assets, such as firm reputation and trust, both costly and
time-consuming for imitation attempts (Dierickx & Cool, 1989). Finally, if a firm
achieves to acquire valuable and rare resources due to unique, historical circumstances it
may implement unique value-creating strategies with these resources in a way that is
inimitable by competitors (Barney J. , 1991).
The key takeaway from the resource-based view is to understand its implication for firms’
opportunity to gain an advantage over their peers. For a firm to possess valuable and rare
resources, it enables the potential for a competitive advantage. Further, if the firm is able
to exploit these valuable and rare resources in a suitable manner, they can realise a
competitive advantage. Lastly, if these resources and capabilities cannot be substituted or
imitated, the firm will sustain this competitive advantage.

2.2 Assets and investments
As Barney (1991) emphasises, firm resources play a remarkable role in determining firm
performance, more so than the external environment of a firm. In accounting terms, these
resources take the name of tangible and intangible assets that are found on the firms’
balance sheet.
In the 2018 revised Conceptual Framework, The International Accounting Standards
Board (IASB), defines an asset as: “A present economic resource controlled by the entity
as a result of past events. An economic resource is a right that has the potential to produce
11

Axel Koukkula
economic benefits” (IASB, 2018). This updated definition has discarded the former
requirement of the potential economic benefits to be expected to flow to the entity, as the
new definition requires no certainty or likelihood of economic benefit. This new
definition is certainly long-awaited, as the old definition has indeed been problematic,
most notably for intangible assets (Lev B. , 2019). This will be discussed more
comprehensively in an upcoming subchapter presenting accounting for intangible assets,
namely R&D.
Combining multiple fields of research, namely accounting, strategic management, and
economics, has proven itself difficult from time to time regarding the terminology used.
The accurate definition of investing and investments has found itself to be very much like
the issue related to the definition of assets, varying in the literature from the different
fields of study.
When discussing investments from the viewpoint of economics or accounting, both share
the view of it being something that is not consumed immediately, but rather over time.
Therefore, investments should be and indeed are, included in the balance sheet of a firm,
where they are then amortised over time. In contrast, in literature and research papers
within the field of strategic management, the definition of firm investments is more
simplified and arguably sloppier. Here investments in R&D are clustered into one,
seemingly asset-like entity, without differentiating the amounts that will be expensed
immediately and those that are capitalised; mainly research respectively development.
To gain further insight into research and development characteristics, the following
subsection will present reasons for firms’ R&D activities and industry differences, along
with financing characteristics for the intangible asset. Following that, I will discuss in
detail the current viewpoint on accounting for R&D, as well as the criticism the
accounting standards have met regarding this definition. The last subsection will provide
insight into how firm performance will be measured in this thesis, in relation to R&D
spending.

2.2.1

R&D activities in firms and industries

Research and development (R&D) are considered to have an essential role in the
stimulation of innovation and economic growth, along with being a key source for
12

Axel Koukkula
competitive advantages in the modern economies (Bottazzi & Peri, 2003). Reflecting
back on the resource-based view and VRIO-framework provided by Barney (1997), many
attributes that are thought to be linked to sustained competitive advantages, are heavily
related with intangible assets, and subsequently, in R&D. It is highly firm-specific,
complex regarding the identification of the relationship between input-output, abstract as
in the form of human capital and knowledge, along with inimitability in the form of e.g.
patents. R&D is therefore proven to be a vital part of a firm’s intangible assets, signalling
the firm’s endeavour to improve and strengthen the firm’s competitiveness (Chan A. L.C., 2012).
Successful, continuous development of innovative products or processes in this fastchanging, increasingly technology-driven world has led companies like Apple, Microsoft,
Alphabet, and Amazon to reach over $1 trillion market capitalizations (Wakabayashi,
2020). While successful development and improvement of new products, processes, and
services have led to sales growth, increased market value, and reduced production costs,
this can only be observed in hindsight (Xu & Zhang, 2004). Due to the elusive, abstract
nature of research and development, there is no guarantee that the investment is
successful. It may in fact, turn out to be a failure even though the R&D activities would
have been fruitful, generating commercialized products. One practical example of this
was Nokia that generated cutting-edge products within its field of specialisation, although
due to lost customer focus, it managed to lose its role as the market leader (Bouwman, et
al., 2014). Therefore, it is of importance to identify that research and development solely
do not lead to firm success, but rather is a part of the process of identifying opportunities
on the market depending on customer needs.
Industries also differ quite considerably regarding their research and development
activities – some might annually spend a fifth of their revenues on R&D, while other
industries might spend under one percent of their revenues if anything at all. The
environment of competition varies between the different industries, which also results in
differences in the useful life of R&D (Lev, Nissim, & Thomas, 2008). Dependent on the
industry a firm belongs to, it might be assumed to invest more or less in R&D activities
(Xu & Zhang, 2004). Typically, R&D-intensive industries are sectors such as
pharmaceuticals and technology, as firms are dependent on providing new products –
either in the form of new medicine or technological products and services. Industries that
13

Axel Koukkula
do not interpret R&D activities as their main competitive factor, such as oil & gas,
utilities, and industrial metal industries, tend in turn demonstrate lower R&D intensities
(Tubbs, 2007).
R&D activities, like any other form of firm investment, also require financial resources.
A major portion of the R&D costs derives from wage and salary costs of the employees,
that are usually highly-skilled and that have gradually amassed the experience and
accumulated research capabilities over time (Czarnitzki & Hottenrott, 2011). Due to R&D
activities being highly connected to the human capital of the firm, adjustments in the level
of spending would be highly costly, as it would require layoffs for reducing costs and
costly hiring and training of staff for increasing the R&D level of input. Therefore, there
tends to be low volatility in the R&D costs of a firm, as investments are smoothed out
over time (Coad & Rao-Nicholson, 2010).
Financing R&D is mainly done with internal capital, if possible, for several reasons. As
R&D has a considerable high level of uncertainty regarding the output, it is deemed more
costly to be financed with external capital than tangible assets (Czarnitzki & Hottenrott,
2011). This is also due to R&D being highly firm-specific with low salvage value –
affecting as such its value as collateral for creditors and banks. Furthermore, there exists
an information asymmetry between the firm and potential investors, as the firm is
reluctant to share R&D information that could be imitated by competing firms (Hall,
2010). Lastly, as R&D is preferably internally financed, in the event of facing financing
constraints, firms may need to make involuntary cuts in R&D spending – eventually
leading into lasting disadvantages compared to competing firms (Knudsen & Lien, 2014).

2.2.2

Accounting for intangible assets: R&D

The accounting treatment for intangible assets is defined by IASB (2017) in International
Accounting Standards (IAS) 38, revised in March 2004. It is stated that research
expenditure must be expensed as incurred and that no intangible assets stemming from
research shall be recognised. Development expenses, on the other hand, may be
capitalised (and amortised), although, only if a firm can demonstrate that all the following
six requirements are fulfilled:

14

Axel Koukkula
1. the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be
available for use or sale, and
2. firm intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it, and
3. firm has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset, and
4. firm is capable of verifying that the intangible asset will generate future economic
benefits, and
5. firm has adequate technical, economical and other resources to complete the
development and either use or sell the intangible asset, and
6. firm is able to reliably determine costs stemming from the development phase of
the intangible asset. [IAS 38.57]
This is relatively analogous to the U.S. GAAP accounting treatment of research and
development, although with a few differences. The Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) (1974) states in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
2 that all R&D expenses are to be immediately expensed, with the exception being
acquired in-process R&D that is to be capitalised1. According to Lev (2019), FASB’s
reasoning for the R&D expensing in 1974 was based on their viewpoint of assumingly
missing direct relationship between R&D costs and specific expected revenue, something
that has been met with increasing criticism as outdated information.
The rate of investments in intangible assets has continuously grown in importance over
the span of the last two decades in the OECD economies, with even an increasing
frequency of surpassing tangible investments (Corrado, Haskel, Iommi, & Jona-Lasinio,
2012). This is largely due to intangibles being increasingly important for firms’
productivity growth through new technologies and knowledge (Demmou, Stefanescu, &
Arquié, 2019). Due to, inter alia, largely outdated accounting standards (Lev B. , 2019),
a majority of the intangibles are, albeit their considerable size, not visible to stakeholders
examining a firm’s financial reports.
Insufficient inclusion of these intangible assets in the financial reports had already been
noticed in Sweden during the late 1980s, as the book The Invisible Balance Sheet was
published by the Konrad group (1988). In the book, the authors point out that at an

1

Additionally “An exception is the development costs of software for sale which should be capitalized
(FASB, 1985), yet most… ignore the standard and immediately expense this investment” (Lev B. , 2019,
p. 713).

15

Axel Koukkula
increasing rate, firms are not able to present vital intangible assets effectively in financial
reporting documents, as the accounting standards and performance measures are
predominantly based on more traditional industries and key ratios based on the financial
capital. For knowledge-based firms as in industries like consulting, law or auditing, their
most important resource is the highly educated personnel, in other words, human capital.
The authors call for the need of new accounting standards for these knowledge-based
firms, as the current financial statements and key ratios do not provide investors enough
information to make sound investment decisions, due to the currently invisible value of
intangible assets for these firms (Konrad group, 1988).
Undervaluation is a risk that many small and/or young R&D-intensive companies face,
as Lev (2004) points out in his paper. This undervaluation may prevent the companies
from raising funds through the capital markets or cause the unneeded higher costs for
acquiring this capital. Established companies, such as the earlier mentioned ensemble of
tech giants with exceeding $1 trillion market capitalizations, have a proven ability to turn
their intangible assets into results of tangible nature, and thus, do not face the same
dilemma of undervaluation by default (Lev B. , 2004). This undervaluation could be
considered as a result of the aforementioned lack of information available from the
financial statements.
Lev and Sougiannis (1996) attempted to enact the objectivity, reliability, and valuerelevance of the capitalisation of R&D in their paper, by examining the link between
R&D expenses and the following earnings in a number of R&D-intensive U.S. firms. The
authors find a strong relationship between the reported earnings, book values, stock
prices, and returns; further implying that investors indeed obtain value-relevant
information from the process of R&D capitalisation. Additionally, Sougiannis (2015)
points out that the R&D capital is not fully reflected in the stock prices, indicating a
feasible systematic mispricing of R&D-intensive firms (Eberhart, Maxwell, & Siddique,
2004; Lev, Nissim, & Thomas, 2008) or alternatively, an additional factor for risk related
to R&D that is compensated by excess returns (Chan, Lakonishok, & Sougiannis, 2002;
Leung, Mazouz, & Evans, 2017). The author also lists insufficient acknowledgment of
the intangibles and outdated accounting practices (Baruch, Sarath, & Sougiannis, 2005),
along with analysts’ and investors’ inability to decipher the implications on eventual

16

Axel Koukkula
patent information as possible reasons for the mispricing of these firms (Sougiannis,
2015).
These differences in accounting standards have been noted in the process of writing this
thesis. As for the two Nordic countries included in this analysis, by only including
publicly listed companies in the sample that have adopted the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as their main form of reporting accounting figures, the
financial statements will be comparable throughout the firm sample. Also, in order to
acquire a more comprehensive picture of the sample firms’ R&D activities, I will include
both the expensed amount from the income statement, as well as the capitalised amount
from the balance sheet, on an annual basis.

2.2.3

R&D and firm performance

Establishing suitable indicators to measure firm performance is a key variable for a study,
as Selvam et al. (2016) identifies nine different determinants that are based on the needs
of different stakeholders. Some of these are more internally oriented, such as employee
satisfaction and social performance, while most assume a role towards external reporting
and financial performance, by the likes of profitability, market value, and growth. These
measurements of financial performance will be the base for this thesis as well, as most of
the related research adapt equivalent approaches.
Basing the models on data from financial reports, among others, also imply intrinsic
biases within variations in accounting standards and practices. Well-performing firms
tend to deflate their accounting figures to lessen the tax burden, while firms performing
poorly tend to attempt inflating their accounting figures to attract investors.
Consequently, this will affect the bottom-line and subsequently, measures of profitability.
As this thesis aims to link firm performance to the firm’s R&D activities, one suitable
ratio for measuring profitability is the return on assets. The ratio return on assets (ROA)
uses net income in relation to total assets for measuring profitability, measuring the firm’s
ability to utilise assets to earn money for investors. ROA will further be affected by
different factors such as tax rates, depreciation, and R&D expenditure. These factors vary
not only between countries and firms but also as a result of differences in the accounting
standards of GAAP and IFRS. Therefore, when using ROA as one measurement for firm
17

Axel Koukkula
performance, these differences need to be considered when making comparisons to earlier
studies.
Another measure of firm profitability is the EBITDA margin, measuring how effective a
firm is in turning their revenue into cash flow. It is a suitable addition to ROA, as it
eliminates non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, taxes, and capital
structure. As the sample contains a wide variety of industries with different options and
possibilities for financing, along with varying degrees of depreciation, amortization, and
impairment costs, measuring firm profitability through the EBITDA margin allows me to
exclude the effects of all these expenses.
Furthermore, innovativeness should be able to increase sales, and as such, sales growth
has been used as a financial performance indicator in an assortment of studies (see, e.g.
Coad & Rao-Nicholson, 2010; Lome, Heggeseth, & Moen, 2016; Parasuraman & Zeren,
1983). The effect that R&D and innovation have on sales growth seems to be lagged, as
the commercialization of a new, innovative product for example, might take a few years
before customers will be able to buy it from the store. This lagged effect has been reported
to take approximately two years to be visible in the revenues (Lome, Heggeseth, & Moen,
2016; Pakes & Schankerman, 1984), albeit it is uncertain by its nature, as there is no
guarantee of increased future earnings (Pandit, Wasley, & Zach, 2011).
Lastly, by including only publicly listed firms in this thesis, I am also able to analyse firm
performance from the market valuation viewpoint. Reflecting back on the last subchapter
regarding the inefficiency in presenting intangible assets properly on the firm balance
sheet, an appropriate ratio measuring this issue would be Tobin’s q. In equilibrium, when
the market value fully reflects the balance sheet asset value of the firm, the ratio assumes
the value of 1.0. If Tobin’s q is less than 1 it would imply market undervaluation of the
firm, while overvaluation assumes a value over 1. If the market correctly identifies the
value of intangible assets, even those that are not shown on the balance sheet, Tobin’s q
is expected to show a value over 1. Therefore, the measure of interest will be: does an
increased R&D intensity lead to a positive change in Tobin’s q?

2.3 Business cycles and recessions
Throughout time, an economy has been anything but stationary, as the constant change
in the development and growth has challenged firms to adjust themselves in their
competitive environment. Changes in trade opportunities, resource availability, the firm
composition within industries, and the regulatory environment compel firms to
continually overcome new challenges to ensure the firm survival. More so, the economy
as a whole is affected by macroeconomic indicators, such as interest rates, and global
trade patterns between nations. Business cycle theory investigates these short-term
fluctuations, resulting from the variation in these elementary factors in the economy. This
chapter will first present a theoretical backdrop of business cycles, followed by an
overview of the recessionary theory. The recessionary effects on both firm investments
and firm performance will be discussed in the next chapter presenting earlier research
within the field.

2.3.1

Business cycles

Defining what a business cycle is, or what components it consists of, has been a central
question during the 20th century. The oldest, simplest and presumably most widespread
concept of business cycles is provided by Burns and Mitchell (1946) in their landmark
work:
Business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate economic activity
of nations that organize their work mainly in business enterprises: a cycle consists
of expansions occurring at about the same time in many economic activities,
followed by similarly general recessions, contractions, and revivals which merge
into the expansion phase of the next cycle.
Identifying and measuring these fluctuations in the economy are mainly divided into two
dominating methods of measurement; classical cycles and growth cycles. The former is
the American standard, developed by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)
and based on an assortment of economic indicators in the U.S. economy (Zarnowitz,
1991). The latter is the European standard of a business cycle, measured by comparing
an economy’s actual GDP to its potential GDP (Snowden & Vane, 2005). Irrespective of
the cycle measurement method, fluctuations are usually classified into periods of
economic expansion (boom) followed by a period of contraction (recession) (Gärtner,
2006).

Figure 2.3 Simplified framework of business cycles

To illustrate the concept of business cycles, with respect to the thesis taking a Nordic
perspective on the matter, I will present the framework of a growth cycle context.
As depicted in Figure 2.3 above, the GDP level of actual income fluctuates around the
general long-term GDP trend that is the potential income of an economy. During times of
economic expansion, the actual income exceeds its potential income level, leading to a
positive output gap. This phase of expansion lasts until it reaches its peak level, the
maximum distance from the long-term GDP trend, thereafter, leading into a phase of a
slowdown. In this slowdown phase, the positive output gap diminishes, until the actual
GDP equals the predicted long-term GDP trend. Following this, the economy enters a
phase of a downturn, where the output gap increasingly becomes negative. This downturn
phase lasts until the output gap reaches the trough, its lowest point, ensued by a retrieval
phase towards the long-term GDP trend.
Despite the term cycle, the different phases in a business cycle may vary in terms of length
and severity from time to time, and economy to economy. Zarnowitz (1991) reports that
the periods of economic expansion for U.S. post-World War II have varied from one year
to ten years, while the periods of recessions varied between merely six and sixteen
months. This further implicates that the total length of a full business cycle will vary over
time for an economy (Gärtner, 2006).

20

Axel Koukkula
2.3.2

Recessions

Facing the same dilemma as business cycles, the definition of a recession varies among
scholars – the duration and the severity of an economic downturn being the key variables.
Gärtner (2006) defines a recession as the phase of a business cycle when actual income
is below the potential income, whereas NBER (2010) has a more strict definition of
recessions as, “… a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy,
lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment,
industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales”. Due to the accounting-based viewpoint
of this thesis, I will adapt the popularized and simplified definition of a recession
described by Shiskin (1974) as “a decline in the seasonally and calendar adjusted real
gross domestic product (GDP) in at least two successive quarters”.
Not only do recessions affect economies, but they may also purge and reconstruct
industries (Latham & Braun, 2011), and critically affect firm performance or even the
survival of firms (Geroski & Gregg, 1997). While the cause, length, and severity of a
recession may vary, there exist universal elements in most recessions that affect firms
considerably. Knudsen and Lien (2014) point these factors out as demand reductions and
financing constraints, albeit firms experience them in varying combinations and degrees
of severity.

Further, by utilising the illustrative model in Figure 2.4, it is possible to measure how a
firm’s specific response in the event of a recession affects its future performance. In
addition to the exogenous shock of a recession, the model includes an error term relating
to the factors affecting firm performance in the period, but those that are not related to
the recession. To be able to capture some extent of the error term, control variables will
21

Axel Koukkula
be used in the empirical model for the study. These control variables, together with the
empirical model, will be presented in the methodological chapter of this thesis.

3 LITERATURE REVIEW
This chapter will provide insight into prior research within relevant topics to the study.
Firstly, prior studies in firm resources and performance will be discussed. Then, further
analysis will be provided on firm performance and firm investments in recessions and to
conclude, a summarisation of the insights provided by these studies.

3.1 Resources and firm performance
Parasuraman and Zeren (1983) study how R&D expenses related to company sales and
profits through a longitudinal study of 310 U.S. firms in 24 industries. The data is based
on an annual R&D Scoreboard from the Business Week-magazine, including public
companies with annual sales of over $35 million and either at least $1 million spent on
R&D or an amount of at least 1% of their sales figures. Simultaneous and lagged
relationships are analysed in three periods of time; that is, from 1976 to 1980, 1975 to
1979, and 1974 to 1978. In the analysis generally more human-capital intensive industries
show persistently higher R&D to both sales and profits correlations, while more labourintensive industries show relatively lower correlations. Throughout the time blocks, the
authors find a more often occurring correlation between R&D expenditures and sales,
rather than R&D expenditures and profits – indicating that when evaluating the
effectiveness of R&D, sales figures may prove to be more beneficial benchmark.
Morbey (1988) indicates in his all-industry study, consisting of large U.S. companies over
the period 1976-1985, that there is a strong association between sales growth and R&D
intensity. From the 173 companies in the study, the group with the highest R&D intensity
at 4 percent or higher at the start of the period, also presented the highest sales growth.
Firms that invested at least 3% of sales revenue on R&D had an 80% chance for growth
of at least half the rate of GNP2 growth. Despite this growth in sales, the results suggest
no significant relationship between profitability and R&D intensity. Furthermore, the
growth of R&D funding showed a much weaker effect than the effect R&D had on firm

2

Actual gross national product

23

Axel Koukkula
growth. There was little evidence of increased profits and growth leading to additional
allocations for R&D.
Klette and Johansen (2000) present an improved econometric framework on R&D
investments and productivity, that allows positive feedback in earlier acquired knowledge
accumulation to be included, rather than the standard model that considers knowledge
accumulation equally to accumulation of physical capital. By including this feedback
aspect, it might explain the persisting differences in productivity between industries or
even countries, and eventual momentum gains and phases of soaring growth within these
countries or industries. This is further cultivated by the authors at the micro-level, by
analysing large firm-level differences in R&D efforts, as well as these efforts’ persistence
over time. This persistence might be explained by the positive feedback from prior R&D
success to the fruitfulness of ongoing R&D. When analysing their dataset containing
Norwegian manufacturing firms, Klette and Johansen find that the applicable part of
R&D capital depreciates quite fast, estimating an average annual depreciating rate of
around 18 percent. This high rate of depreciation suggests, according to their model,
significant spill over effects. Further estimates also present the significant effect of R&D
investments on firm performance (or alternatively on plant performance).
Ang and Wight (2009) research the accumulation of intangible resources from the
viewpoint of firm reputation and how it affects the financial performance of a firm, based
on reputation data from Fortune’s annual survey of firm reputation. The reputation of a
firm is nearly inimitable, non-substitutable, and one of the least tangible assets according
to RBV (Barney J. , 1991), and should as such, offer the greatest potential for firms to
create and sustain a competitive advantage if exploited appropriately. The authors find
that strong financial performance is critical for a firm to build a strong reputation, whereas
a reputation cannot be built by itself; but rather, is a result of a number of activities within
a strong financial performance. This strong financial performance is also merely a result
of chosen prosperous firm strategies and successful navigation of the surrounding
business environment. Further, firms are required to consistently perform well to build a
reputation, as firms with consistently superior performance have a stronger reputation
than those firms that are less consistent in their performance. This consistency also
applied to those firms that consistently performed poorly when compared to inconsistent
poor performers, where the former had a worse reputation than the latter. As reputation
24

Axel Koukkula
is also subjective and relative to competitors’ reputations, a firm with a strong reputation
can not only enjoy a sustained competitive advantage against current competitors but also
eventually discourage potential competitors from entering the market (Ang & Wight,
2009).
Ahmed and Jinan (2011) find evidence for firms’ life cycle stages impacting the
relationship between R&D expenditures and firm performance. The 321 Australian
companies during 1994-2004 in the sample were classified into one of three life cycle
stages: growth, mature or stagnant – based on a composite measure consisting of dividend
pay-out, sales growth, capital expenditure, and firm age. Results from the single equation
multivariate model suggest that there is a significant negative relationship between
unexpected expensed R&D amounts and firm performance that is more evident during
the stagnant phase of a firm’s life cycle. This indicates that the financial markets assume
that firms at this phase of the firm life cycle have limited possibilities of fully obtaining
the benefits of these expensed R&D costs.

3.2 R&D and innovation in recessions
Dugal and Morbey (1995) study the two recessionary periods of 1981-1982 and 19901991 in the U.S., analysing how firms with different degrees of R&D spending performed
during these times of economic turbulence. Earlier research during the time of the study
had also studied what implications R&D investments have on firm performance,
although, during periods of economic growth. The authors examine what effect R&D
expenditures had on sales during the 1990-1991 recession, what effects firm- and
industry-level variables had on inter-firm differences in R&D spending during this 1990s
recession, and finally, comparing these results to the recession of 1981-1982. While the
sample of 1982 consisted of 172 large established firms, this amount had sunk to 122 for
1991, due to acquisitions, mergers, and bankruptcies. The R&D intensity level was based
on corporate spending on R&D expenses in relation to sales, and average intensity for the
four-year period pre-recession was compared to the sales performance during the
recession. In their results, of the firms with sales declines during the 1982 recession, 81%
spent less than 3% of their sales on R&D. The same applied for 62% of the companies
with decreased sales during the 1991 recession. Meanwhile, among the firms that spent
more than 5% of their sales income on R&D, 70% had sales increases during the 198125

Axel Koukkula
1982 recession respectively 74% of the firms during the 1990-1991 recession. This
critical level of above 3% R&D intensity to prevent sales declines during a recession was
also concluded in an earlier study to be the critical level for ensuring acceptable longterm growth regardless of industry (Morbey, 1988).
Ghemawat (2009) argues that on the impact of a recession, a firm is met with two choices:
either to invest and experience a financial risk, or not to invest and, thus, encounter a
competitive risk. As a result of a recession, a company might be met with a reduction in
the demand for their products or services which, in turn, affects their opportunities to
invest for growth, as well as the ability to finance daily operations and new investments.
Firms that are more harshly affected by a recession tend to prefer short-term benefits and
survival, while those that are not as affected by a recession use the opportunity to acquire
under-priced assets in the hope of eventually gaining a competitive advantage in the long
term. (Knudsen, 2019) The findings in the study argue for managers underestimating the
competitive risk of not investing, as downturns may provide opportunities to acquire
assets far below their real value, thus, offering a chance on gaining excess returns
(Ghemawat, 2009). Further, sudden belt-tightening on the impact of an economic
downturn may cause more harm than good, which supports Hall’s (2010) suggestion on
the high adjustment costs of R&D investments. Thus, as long as a competitive advantage
can be reached cost-effectively, investing to create and maintain a competitive advantage
is the best way to manage a firm through an economic downturn (Ghemawat, 2009).
Paunov (2012) study eight Latin American economies during the global economic crisis
of 2008-2009 and its effects on the innovation performance of the 1 223 firms in the
sample. Research findings show that 25% of the firms halted their investments in
innovation projects following the crisis. Constraints in financing played a major role, as
firms that had access to public financing were less prone to abandon their innovation
investment projects, while young firms had a higher tendency to do so. Further, firms that
were either suppliers to foreign multinational corporations or those that had a decrease in
export market sales, had also a higher likelihood to end investments in innovation projects
(Paunov, 2012).
Knudsen and Lien (2014) were among the first to address the absence of recessions and
firm investment behaviour in strategical literature. As the authors point out, these topics
have however been included in many studies within the literature of macroeconomics and
26

Axel Koukkula
finance, with an explicit emphasis on physical investments given how financial shocks
affect either product demand or financial constraints (e.g. Fazzari, Hubbard, & Petersen,
1988; Myers & Majluf, 1984). In the paper, the authors further divide firm investments
into three categories: physical capital, R&D and innovation, and human- and
organizational capital. Depending on the severity of the shock and the combination of the
two effects that a financial shock causes, the effect on a firm’s investments vary. While
the authors emphasize more investment consequences in the event of a recession, these
consequences may affect firms negatively in their competitive outcomes for a long-lasting
period.
Ratvik and Svergja (2016) study in their master’s thesis on how firms’ innovation
activities impact their performance during a recession, namely, during the recession of
2008-2009 in Norway. The authors apply Norwegian innovation data from the time
period 2006-2010 together with accounting data from 2008-2012 while studying
innovation activities both before and during the recession. Contrary to the previous and
generally positively seen innovation-performance link in research, they find that
innovating firms constantly underperformed the non-innovating firms when measuring
firm profitability. For the top innovating quartile of the firms, ROA and EBITDA-margins
were negatively affected during the recession. Pre-recession innovation had a little and
not statistically significant effect on post-recession firm performance, which was also true
for innovation done during the recession and later firm performance.
Flammer and Ioannou (2018) study U.S. firms’ investments in key strategic resources and
how these investments were adjusted in response to the Great Recession of 2007-2009.
These strategic resources include R&D, capital expenditures, workforce, and lastly,
CSR3. When measuring firm performance post-crisis, and how the firms adjusted their
investments during the crisis, companies that reduced neither their workforce nor their
capital expenditure did not show better performance post-crisis. Meanwhile, those
companies that did not reduce their investments in R&D and CSR achieved significantly
better performance post-crisis, with a 19% respective 10% higher ROA, when compared
to those companies that did reduce their investments in these resources. In their findings,
the companies that responded to the financial crisis by reducing both workforce and

capital expenditures, while sustaining their investments on CSR and R&D, demonstrated
the highest performance in the post-crisis period.
Sun, Lee, and Phan (2018) research firm investments in the 2008-2009 financial crisis
from the perspective of family firms, compared to those firms that are not family-owned.
The study was conducted in the U.S., where these family firms have an immense
contribution to the country’s economy, as the firms not only contribute 64% of the GDP
but also account for nearly four-fifths of the new jobs created. Their results showed that
non-family and family firms tend to behave differently when facing economic distress,
where the latter group saw external threats as opportunities for risk-taking when having
excess funding available for usage. Although, approximately only one fifth of the family
firms were financially unconstrained, while the same number for the non-family firms
was nearly one-third of the firms. Therefore, there are indications that non-family firms
have better access to capital markets, as the family firms also showed higher levels of
cash and lower leverage, by chance to abstain from borrowing at a higher interest rate.
No differences in investment behaviour were found when comparing financially
constrained family and non-family firms R&D investments, whereas the differences
between the two firm types arose when comparing unconstrained firms. The authors
imply that these results could indicate family firms’ higher willingness to engage in
longstanding investments during downturns in the business cycle (Sun, Lee, & Phan,
2018).
In their most recent paper regarding investments in recessions, Knudsen & Lien (2019)
examine alterations in Norwegian firm investment behaviour, as a response to changes in
demand and credit access caused by recessions. Findings imply that investments in both
physical assets and R&D are negatively related to the two types of shocks a recession
causes; that is, demand reductions and credit constraints. The negative effect of a demand
reduction for physical investments was approximately threefold in comparison to R&D
investments, while a reduction in credit access gave roughly equal effect on both
investment types. Facing momentary fluctuation in demand, the firms displayed a
tendency of shielding R&D investments, although also showing a higher sensitivity to
credit changes than generally assumed. Additionally, investments in human capital were
independent of reductions in credit access, but changes in demand showed a cubic pattern
in relation to human capital investments. Small reductions in demand caused firms to
28

Axel Koukkula
increase investments in human capital, while strong demand reductions reduced these
investments. Similarly, when experiencing a minor increase in demand these investments
stayed constant and large increases in demand caused a rise in human capital investments
(Knudsen & Lien, 2019).

3.3 Firm performance in recessions
Geroski and Machin (1993) examine what effects innovation has on corporate
performance in the UK, by utilizing a unique dataset containing major innovations
produced and used over the time period 1945-1983. The innovativeness of each firm was
of interest, and by using this dataset the firms were divided into two groups of firms,
innovating and non-innovating, based on if the firm managed to produce a major
innovation during the examined time period. By comparing the twofold effect of
innovation – “the product view4” and “the process view5” – the authors find evidence of
both effects in the data. Even though some single innovations had a positive effect on
profitability and growth, it seems that the process of innovation itself transforms firms in
a specific way, causing a general difference between the non-innovating and innovating
firms. Further, the most noticeable difference between these non-innovating and
innovating firms was that the latter were considerably less sensitive to cyclical shocks
than the former. Geroski and Machin (1993) argue that this is due to innovating firms
being more adaptable and flexible, with internal capabilities to respond quickly to
exogenous changes, whether that is new developments in technology or changes in the
business environment due to economic downturn.
Earlier research has shown the absorptive capacity of slack resources6 in the event of
exogenous shocks in the economy (Bourgeois, 1981; Cheng & Kesner, 1997), resulting
in better firm performance during an economic downturn. Latham and Braun (2008)
research what implications slack resources, especially financial slack, had on firm
performance in the event of economic recession and recovery period. Here financial slack
was described as the difference between the working capital available to a company and
the required working capital, where a higher ratio indicated ineffective usage of excess
resources. The setting for the research was the period of 2001-2003, studying a sample of

Axel Koukkula
450 companies in the software industry of the United States. The results in the study imply
that firms with a higher degree of financial slack experienced worse performance than
their counterpart, possibly due to slower reaction time to the beginning of a financial
shock. However, this higher degree of slack also enabled better withstanding to a
continued period of economic downturn or allowed these firms to shift excess resources
into strategic investments during economic scarcity. Further findings showed that firms
with heavy investing in R&D had a more rapid decline in firm performance, measured as
ROA than firms with a lower intensity. Admittedly, the sample included many start-up
firms with high R&D spending compared to their revenue, eventually leading to
disproportionality in the R&D/revenue-ratio by the demand shocks. Meanwhile, these
more intensely investing firms also demonstrated a faster rate of recovery in the wake of
a recession, as the firms might have gained a competitive position on the market when
the demand for information technology rejuvenated.
Considerable investments in R&D might also offer firms improved performance during
financial crises, compared to counterparts that do not invest as heavily in R&D.
According to Lome, Heggeseth, and Moen (2016) this was the case for Norwegian
manufacturers during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. The study covers the period of
1999-2009, analysing 247 Norwegian SMEs7 through data on financial performance and
a survey that was distributed to managers of these firms in 2004. When grouping the firms
into three groups based on R&D intensity, the ones investing heavily into R&D presented
growth in revenue over 3.5x as much as the ones with a low intensity during 2004-2009.
Further, the authors imply there is a two-year lag on R&D spending prior to resulting in
the revenue stream, which is within the 1.17-2.40 years’ time lag found in earlier studies
(Pakes & Schankerman, 1984; Rapoport, 1971). Lome et al. (2016) also discuss the
eventual causes for this result in differing performance due to R&D investments and
highlight R&D’s positive effect on firm’s absorptive capacity (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990;
Griffith, Redding, & Van Reenen, 2003), which also presumably contributed to the
greater performance of the R&D-intense firms throughout the economic turmoil.
Nason and Patel (2016) examine how firm holdings in cash affect their performance
during a recession, as earlier research into the matter has been based on times of stable
economic conditions. By analysing a sample of publicly traded U.S. manufacturing firms

7

Small and medium-sized enterprises

30

Axel Koukkula
in the period of 2004-2010, the authors aim to study if the stock market values firm cash
holdings in a period of economic downturn. Based on earlier research (Kim & Bettis,
2014), the chosen dependent variable for measuring firm performance was Tobin’s q,
measured as the total market value of the firm divided by total assets. The results show
that the benefits of cash during recession decline at medium levels of cash holdings, 0.4
of total assets, while the same ratio for pre-recession is as high as 0.9 of total assets. When
further testing the model with ROA as the measure of performance, despite finding ROA
being lower during a recession, the authors do not find a significant effect of cash on ROA
during a recession. This difference in the result was interpreted as a difference in marketbased measures compared to accounting-based measures, where the main findings are to
be interpreted in line with market-based performance, as it is forward-looking compared
to the past-oriented accounting measures (Nason & Patel, 2016). In summary, the stock
market appreciates firm cash holdings up to a certain level when measured with Tobin’s
q, both pre-recession and during a recession, albeit to a lower level for the latter period.
Burger, Damijan, Kostevc, and Rojec (2017) investigate sources for firm performance
and growth during the financial crisis of 2008-2009 in the corporate sectors of the Central
and Eastern European countries (CEECs). These, at the time, new EU member states were
hit far harder than most of the old EU member states, as the total value added of nonfinancial corporate sectors decreased by 10.4 percentage points for CEECs during 20082010, compared to the average of merely one percentage points decrease in old EU
member states. The causes for this difference are manifold, as the authors uplift CEECs
being in a distinguished boom period before the crisis and the economic fundamentals
being less robust than in the old EU member states, as some of the reasons behind this
worse performance. As for the panel VAR analysis of factors, which may affect a firm’s
resistance to economic distress, these were: firm size, firm age, firm’s export propensity
and source of ownership, whether it is domestic or foreign. Burger et al. (2017) find small
young firms to react faster to cyclical shocks by reducing employment, whereas exporting
firms and foreign-owned firms had a more stable number of employees. Firm investments
did not react to demand shocks, but rather to the component of free cash flow during the
business cycle. Young firms were the ones to react most to a financial shock, while small
old firms were the least responsive when measuring their investment activity. Also,
exporting firms had a more stable investment activity when compared to non-exporting
firms, and foreign-owned firms showed the same trend, compared to domestic firms.
31

Axel Koukkula
In their master’s thesis, Vethe and Hage (2018) study the impact of cash holdings on firm
performance in Norwegian companies – in general, as well as for the period of an
economic downturn. According to the resource-based view (Barney J. , 1991), financial
assets such as cash are easily imitable and commonly available to competitors; therefore,
it should not be considered as a source of sustained competitive advantage for a firm.
Despite this, the authors prove cash having an effect on firm performance, although their
sample of Norwegian firms’ performance were being less affected by cash than U.S.
manufacturing firms’ performance were in the study of Nason and Patel (2016).
Throughout the studied time period, cash had a positive, albeit weakly diminishing effect
on firm performance and the effect was most evident before the recession. The effect
being the most prominent pre-recession corresponds with the business cycle theory, as an
expansion period often precedes a recession. Firm performance could be affected
negatively by having high cash reserves during an economic boom, as the opportunity
cost of not investing increases (Vethe & Hage, 2018). Further, the authors find that firms
with a higher level of knowledge intensity hoard more cash than less knowledge-intensive
firms, and that capital-intensive firms hoard less cash than labour intensive firm. Lastly,
Vethe and Hage (2018) emphasize that the deployment of cash is vital, when examining
if cash is to be valued as a firm-specific strategic asset. Cash itself does not generate
value, but it allows firms to obtain, grow, and develop strategically important resources
that may impact firm performance.
Knudsen (2019) suggests that differences in pre-recession characteristics of firms may
answer why recessions impact some firms worse than others. The study was based on
Norwegian companies, combining a unique survey about the firms’ viewpoint on how the
financial crisis of 2008 affected them, along with accounting data from the subsequent
years of recession. The paper presents high pre-recession market growth as one primary
influential factor that causes demand problems during a recession. Also, firm strategies
emphasizing on quality led firms to be more severely struck by a financial shock.
Additionally, firms that prioritized low-cost strategies and those that had been investing
generously into innovation were in a more advantageous position in the wake of a
recession.
Giebel and Kraft (2019) find in their study that innovative firms are more likely to have
more severe consequences of a financial crisis than non-innovative firms, when
32

Axel Koukkula
interpreting innovativeness as introducing product(s) new to the market (cf. Lee, Sameen,
& Cowling, 2015). Like related research articles (Campello, Graham, & Harvey, 2010;
Knudsen, 2019), the authors use here a combination of a questionnaire-based assessment
on the financial crisis’ impact on firms, together with accounting data for the firms. The
data is acquired from the IAB Establishment Panel, for the time period of 2006-2010 and
consists of close to 16 000 firms in Germany. Although the results of the study contradict
Knudsen’s (2019) findings, the authors here imply the negative effects of a financial crisis
as credit constraints. Also, different types of investments were not distinguished, resulting
in no differentiation between intangible assets that are preferably financed with internal
capital (Czarnitzki & Hottenrott, 2011; Myers & Majluf, 1984; Ughetto, 2008) and procyclical physical investments (Aghion, Askenazy, Berman, Cette, & Eymard, 2012).
Admittedly, financial constraints still also affect R&D negatively (Mancusi & Vezzulli,
2010; Paunov, 2012), albeit it being an intangible asset.

3.4 Hypotheses development
Having established a theoretical backdrop of sources for firm performance; research &
development implications on accounting and firms; business cycles and recessions, as
well as empirical evidence on how recessions impact R&D spending and firm
performance, I can develop hypotheses on how recessionary R&D spending affects firm
performance.
First, there seems to be a generally agreed positive relationship between R&D activities
and firm performance. It is the source of new product innovations and improved processes
that enables further firm growth in this increasingly global and technological world. For
this reason, it can also be seen as a necessity; if your firm does not innovate, your
competitors will and you risk losing the competitive edge against them.
When adding the business cycle viewpoint on R&D activities in relation to firm
performance, results begin to vary among academics. Some studies find that innovative
firms are hit harder by the recession than non-innovators (Giebel & Kraft, 2019; Ratvik
& Svergja, 2016), while other find that innovative firms survive the recessionary period
better than their counterpart (Geroski & Machin, 1993; Knudsen, 2019; Lome,
Heggeseth, & Moen, 2016). It is therefore of interest to examine if there is a significant

33

Axel Koukkula
relationship between R&D activities pre-recession and firm performance during the
recessionary time period:

Hypothesis 1
H0 = There is no relationship between R&D activities pre-recession and firm
performance during the recession
H1 = There is a relationship between R&D activities pre-recession and firm
performance during the recession,
and whether this effect is either positive or negative:
H1a = There is a positive relationship between R&D activities pre-recession and firm
performance during the recession
H1b = There is a negative relationship between R&D activities pre-recession and firm
performance during the recession.
Latham and Braun (2008) find for example that while the R&D-intensive companies
suffered a more rapid decline in ROA when the recession hit, the firms also exhibited
faster growth than their counterparts after the recessionary time period.
As the R&D activities are closely tied to the human capital of the firm, firms tend to
smooth out R&D spending due to high adjustment costs (Hall, 2010). During recessions,
Knudsen and Lien (2014) point out credit constrains and demand reductions as the main
effects that firms suffer, which can be argued to affect the firm’s ability to finance its
operations and ongoing investments. Due to the aforementioned high adjustment cost of
R&D projects, firms tend to shield these from temporary demand shocks such as the ones
during recessions (Knudsen & Lien, 2019). As the R&D spending is preferably internally
financed (Czarnitzki & Hottenrott, 2011), those firms that are not able to upkeep spending
might face involuntary cuts in their R&D activities, causing possible lasting
disadvantages compared to their competitors. Thus, could recessionary R&D intensity
affect later firm performance, even several years after the recession?

34

Axel Koukkula
To examine this, my second hypotheses is whether the R&D intensity, measured in
relation to total sales and total assets, during the recession has a significant relationship
with later firm performance:

Hypothesis 2
H0 = There is no relationship between the intensity of R&D during the recession and
later firm performance
H2 = There is a relationship between the intensity of R&D during the recession and
later firm performance,
and whether this effect is either positive or negative:
H2a = There is a positive relationship between the intensity of R&D during the
recession and later firm performance
H2b = There is a negative relationship between the intensity of R&D during the
recession and later firm performance.
As a variation of this hypothesis, would there be a difference between firms that increase
their R&D spending during recessions, compared to those that do not? As Knudsen and
Lien (2019) point out, firms may adopt a countercyclical strategy when demand
reductions lead to excess capacity, albeit to a certain level. This excess capacity is then
used to stimulate human capital investments, which also happens when firms experience
high demand increase, as during years of economic boom.
This leads into the final hypothesis of this thesis: is there a relationship between increased
R&D intensity and later firm performance when compared to the firms that decrease their
R&D intensity?

Hypothesis 3
H0 = There is no relationship between increasing the intensity of R&D during the
recession and later firm performance
H3 = There is a relationship between increasing the intensity of R&D during the
recession and later firm performance,
35

Axel Koukkula
and whether this effect is either positive or negative:
H3a = There is a positive relationship between increasing the intensity of R&D during
the recession and later firm performance
H3b = There is a negative relationship between increasing the intensity of R&D
during the recession and later firm performance.
To test for these hypotheses, I will adapt different analysis methods with a variety of
different variables. The following chapter 4 will explain the methodology of this thesis in
detail, while the results will be presented in chapter 5 and discussed thoroughly in chapter
6.

4 METHODOLOGY
In this chapter, the research method, empirical context and data for this thesis are
presented. This will be followed by an introduction of the variables chosen for the study.
Then, theoretical background will be provided regarding the regression analysis and the
non-parametrical test. Lastly, concerns regarding data and the validity of the study will
be discussed.

4.1 Research design
Bryman and Bell (2011) determine that a research purpose may be exploratory,
descriptive, or explanatory. The research question in this thesis attempts to investigate the
relationship between differences in firms’ R&D activities during recessions and
differences in the firms’ later performance, thus including all three aspects listed.
Although, as the aim of the study is to discover a causal relationship between R&D
activities and firm performance, the research purpose of this thesis is explanatory.
The approach for research within the business and economic studies generally is either
inductive or deductive (Bryman & Bell, 2011). If an inductive approach would have been
used in this study, gathered data would have been used to develop theories. As this study
uses existing theories, prior research, and empirical observations, it will befittingly to the
explanatory purpose adopt a deductive approach (ibid.).

4.2 Empirical context
To offer further insight into the time period of interest in this study, this subchapter will
present the impact of the Great Recession of 2008-2009 on the Nordic countries that are
chosen for this study. In addition to the larger macroeconomic picture, the research and
development activities of these two countries are shown, discussing the similarities and
differences between the countries.

4.2.1

Recessionary impact on Finland and Norway

The financial crisis of 2008 began, in fact, a year prior as in February 2007 some subprime
mortgage lenders began reporting losses. During the following year and a half there were
indications of a possible upcoming financial crisis, as negative revelations related to the
37

Axel Koukkula
credit default swaps (CDS) consisting of subprime loans were discovered. In August
2008, however, the sudden bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers caused
a full-scale panic on the financial markets, resulting in the financial crisis that led to the

Viewed from a macroeconomic perspective, Figure 4.1 above shows that the real GDP
growth of Finland and Norway barely stayed positive in 2008 as the full-scale global
market crash hit in September. The following year depicts the difference in how the
economies suffered due to this crisis, as the real GDP growth for Finland plunges to -8%,
while it decreases for Norway only to -1.7%. Still, while this dip in GDP growth for
Norway was not as extreme as that of Finland, Norwegian firms were nevertheless
severely affected in their growth and profitability (Knudsen & Lien, 2019).
In 2010 and 2011 the GDP growth turned yet again positive for both countries, whereas
differences arise during the period from 2012 to 2014. During these three years, Finland
is technically in a recession, whilst the Norwegian economy is experiencing annual
growth in GDP. It was during this period that the European debt crisis happened, causing
uncertainty on the markets due to the inability of some eurozone members to pay their
government debt. Lastly, from 2015 to 2018 both countries boast positive real GDP
growth, ending the study period with anticipated positive firm performance. Examining
Figure 4.1, it can be seen that the Finnish real GDP growth depicts quite befittingly the
earlier discussed business cycle, showing clear periods of economic expansion and
38

Axel Koukkula
downturns. For Norway, this cyclical nature is not as clearly illustrated during this
relatively short 11-year period.
The focus of this thesis, however, is not studying why these differences arise between the
countries, so they won’t be discussed in further detail. It is still of importance to recognize
the practical differences between these two countries in the study, as these countryspecific effects may severely affect analysis results throughout these 11 years examined.
How this is controlled for in the regression models, will be shown in chapter 4.4.3 that
discusses the control variables used in the analyses.

4.2.2

R&D investments in Finland and Norway

Reported by the European Innovation Scoreboard of 2019, among the four leading EU
member states regarding innovation are three Nordic countries: Sweden, Finland, and
Denmark (European Comission, 2019). As Norway is not included among the EU
member states, it is not included in the report. The heavily oil-based country, however, is
no stranger to innovating activities, as the OECD countries follow innovation reporting
guidelines known as the Oslo Manual. Norway is also, due to this high dependency to the
oil- and other resource-based sectors, facing a transition towards a more diverse economy,
emphasizing the need of strong research and development activities in the society as a

Figure 4.2 NOR & FIN R&D spending, 2007-2018

In Figure 4.2 above, the R&D expenditures for both countries spanning from 2007 to
2018 can be seen from different perspectives. On the right-hand scale the R&D spending
39

Axel Koukkula
of the business sector of respective countries is shown in billion euros. The figures for
both countries are adjusted for country-specific inflation before transforming NOK into
EUR for comparison. Inflation percentages and currency exchange rates are found in
Appendix 2. respective Appendix 3. On the left-hand scale, R&D spending is measured
as a percentage of the Gross domestic product (GDP), including the average for the 35
OECD countries as well. This percentual R&D spending includes all R&D activities done
in the country, within the public sector, the business sector as well as research institutes
and universities.
While one of the indicators depict the evolution of R&D spending from a broader
perspective, and the other one from a narrower point of view, both illustrate the same
trend: the gap in R&D spending between the countries has narrowed during the last
decennium. Finland peaked in R&D expenditure around the recessionary years of 20082009, while Norway has quite steadily increased its efforts within research and
development, at least when viewed purely from the spending point of view.

4.3 Data
The following chapter will first describe the data selection process, the selection criteria
for the sample, the differentiation between the different time periods, and the industry
classification system. Then, it will present the different biases the sample might suffer
from and their eventual consequences. Finally, it will present the data treatment process,
how the observations were filtered, the removal of outliers, and other effects that would
affect the analysis results.

4.3.1

Selection of data

The selected Nordic data for this thesis is based on listed firms from Finland and Norway.
The research sample was collected from the listed firms in the Helsinki Stock Exchange
(OMXH) and the listed firms in the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE). Only companies that
were still publicly listed in December 2018 on the main list of the stock exchanges were
included in the study. This initial sample consisted of a totalling 326 companies, of which
130 were Finnish and 196 were Norwegian companies. I will use Microsoft Office Excel
2016 for compiling and treating the data for outliers, while IBM Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 26 will mainly be used to analyse this data.
40

Axel Koukkula
Data collection process
The data for the companies was collected from various sources, as a single solution for
gathering all the data was not available. For the Finnish companies included in the initial
sample, accounting data was collected mainly using the Voitto+-software, along with
verifying these figures and supplementing the missing values from the companies’
financial statements. For the Norwegian companies, accounting data was collected purely
from the companies’ financial statements.
Share price data was gathered from Nasdaq Nordic for the Finnish companies, also
verifying the reported year-end share price figures in the financial statements.
Outstanding share amounts were found in the financial statements as well. For the
Norwegian companies this data was not as easily available, as the Oslo Stock Exchange
only provides stock price development for the last 5 years. Therefore, while most of the
Norwegian companies reported their year-end share price in the financial statements,
some companies were missing this data. This share price data was then gathered from
Yahoo Finance and Reuters, followed by cross-checking with each other for further
verification of the accuracy of the data.
The accounting data gathered consists of the fiscal years from 2007 to 2018. The fiscal
year of 2007 is considered as a pre-recession period, 2008 to 2009 as the recessionary
period and 2010 to 2011 as the post-recessionary period. Reflecting on Figure 4.1, the
fiscal years of 2012-2014 could be considered a period of recession for the Finnish
companies, while Norway maintained a positive GDP growth during this time period. For
the remaining years from 2015 to 2018, both countries boasted a positive GDP growth,
thus, being a period of post-recession. At this point, several companies did not have
accounting data available to the starting year of 2007 for the analysis, due to various
reasons. Some of the listed companies had only been established after the recession of
2008-2009, while some had listed themselves merely a few years before 2018 and
therefore, not being obliged to provide financial figures dated to 2007 in their Initial
Public Offering (IPO) prospectus.
Following the gathering process of accounting data, further filtering on the dataset was
done through different selection criteria. Firstly, the 2008 and 2009 financial statements
of the remaining companies were examined, to ensure that the company had ongoing
41

Axel Koukkula
R&D activities during the recessionary period. Companies missing this data were
immediately excluded from the sample. Also, the only company that did not match their
fiscal year with the calendar year, like the remaining sample, was left out.
Industry classification
The remaining firm sample was then split into different industries, based on the Industry
Classification Benchmark (ICB)-codes that were found on the Nasdaq Nordic website.
FTSE Russell is the responsible organisation for maintaining the ICB-system and the
classification process of the companies (FTSE Russell, 2019). The ICB-system consists
of 10 main industries (1-digit) that are divided first into 18 supersectors (2-digit),
followed by 41 sectors (3-digit) and finally, 114 subsectors (4-digit). On the Nasdaq
Nordic website, these publicly listed companies are reported on a 2-digit accuracy, which
will also be used in this thesis.
While all of the Finnish companies had their ICB-codes listed, merely 20% of the initial
Norwegian firm sample had their classification information available on Nasdaq Nordic.
With the filtered firm sample, 16 of the 26 remaining Norwegian firms were missing an
ICB-code. These were manually added into a befitting sector, based on their financial
statements and the publicly available information about the companies. From the Finnish
company sample, Fortum was changed from being the sole representative of code 7500
“Utilities” to being part of code 0500, the “Oil & Gas”-supersector. A closer examination
of the total included sample in the study, along with the manually adjusted ICB-codes can
be found in Appendix 1.

Table 4.1 Industry classification of the sample

Axel Koukkula
In Table 4.1 above, we can examine the final 90 firm sample in the study, consisting of
64 Finnish companies and 26 Norwegian companies. This results in 12 176 observations
for the analysis, from which outliers will still be removed.
Potential biases in data
It can be noted that this final sample data may contain biases that are described below.
These biases may affect the analysis outcomes shown in chapter 5 and therefore, need to
be considered when interpreting the results.
The first bias originates from the issue that all firms that partake in R&D activities, in
fact, do not report R&D spending in their financial statements. Companies may report
their expensed research costs as part of other operating expenses, as R&D costs consist
mainly of payroll expenses. This leads to the sample of firms with reported R&D activities
being smaller than the actual population engaging themselves in R&D activities. Albeit
these companies are assumedly low R&D-intensive firms, their inclusion would have
increased the already small final sample of firms for the analysis and thereby, increased
the validity of the study.
An additional problem is the possible survivorship bias in the data. This bias occurs when
firms that have bankrupted no longer exist in the data, resulting in a skewness to the right
when only including companies that have survived throughout the time period of the
study. Survivorship bias can be reduced by using delisting data of the stock exchanges,
as Chan et al. (2002) used in their study on the U.S. stock market. This delisting
information was not included in the data collection process of this thesis.

4.3.2

Data treatment and outliers

Treating for inflation and currency

In order to make the annual accounting data throughout the time period comparable, it
has been adjusted for inflation for both the Norwegian and Finnish companies. The
process for the Finnish companies was simple, using 2007 as the base year and adjusting
the reported financial figures by an adjustment factor each year in regard to the annual
inflation. The annual inflation is calculated from the Consumer Price Index (CPI)

43

Axel Koukkula
provided by Statistics Finland, along with the adjustment factor can be found in appendix
2.
For the Norwegian companies, this adjustment for inflation required a more complex
process. According to the Norwegian Accounting Act (Regnskapsloven) § 3-4.,
companies may in their annual reports present their financial figures in the currency that
their business is mainly related to, also described as “functional currency”
(Finansdepartementet, 1998). While most Norwegian firms in the sample used NOK as
their currency for reporting, one firm used EUR, and some used USD, which were mainly
companies from the Oil & Gas-sector. As the companies were still listed on the Oslo
Stock Exchange, the quoted stock prices and the calculated market capitalisation were in
NOK. Therefore, to be able to provide accurate financial ratios for these companies, the
financial figures in foreign currency had to be transformed into NOK.
The process began by searching for both the annual average exchange rates of NOK into
USD and EUR, as well as the year-end exchange rate. These exchange rates were
provided by the central bank of Norway (Norges Bank) and are presented in greater detail
in Appendix 3. Stated in the Finnish Accounting Act Chapter 6 section 6 (13.7.2011/629)
“Balance sheet items… shall be translated into Finnish currency for the purposes of
consolidation using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Profit and loss account
items shall be translated using the average exchange rate for the financial year.” (Ministry
of Economic Affairs and Employment, 2017). This method of currency exchange rate
transformation will also be adapted for the Norwegian firm sample. Thereby, the figures
in the income statements were transformed into NOK based on the average annual
exchange rate, while those in the balance sheet were transformed in accordance with the
exchange rate on the balance sheet day. Lastly, all the figures were adjusted for inflation
based on the CPI reported by Statistics Norway, with 2007 as the base year as well.
Sample outliers

Chatterjee and Hadi (1986) define an outlier as an observation with an abnormal distance
to the mean and whose exclusion would significantly affect regression results. These
abnormal observations should still not be treated as a negative factor affecting the sample
data, as they may provide valuable insight. Thus, as the data sample is treated, the main
goal is to remove as few outliers as possible; thereby, maximizing the external validity of
44

Axel Koukkula
the analysis results. This leads into the predicament of a trade-off between deleting
observations that could offer valuable information in the regression model or including
outlier observations that are negatively affecting the regression model; therefore, risking
possible bias in estimation.
Outliers originate either from errors in the data, resulting in unusual observations, or they
are extreme values that are caused by natural and logical reasons (Barnett & Lewis, 1978).
There are two main procedures that may be used when choosing to treat outliers. The first
alternative is to simply use a variety of statistical techniques to objectively remove those
extreme value observations that are deemed as outliers. The second approach is to define
specific qualitative boundaries for key variables used in the study and then remove the
observations that exceed these limiting values. Both methods have their benefits and
drawbacks, when considering which method to apply. While the first method offers an
objective, purely statistical approach to remove abnormal observations, it can be argued
to lead to the removal of observations that should actually be included in the data. The
second method, however, while offering an approach to remove outliers based on earlier
academic research and to one’s best knowledge, requires arguably more effort to conduct
properly. Determining relevant boundaries for the key variables require manually
checking for outliers, as the goal is to remove as few observations as possible from the
already small dataset. This is done by utilising scatter plots on the key variables as an
effort to identify eventual extreme value observations.
This qualitative method for identifying and removing outliers was used in unison with a
statistical method, as it was found as the most appropriate way to handle extreme values
affecting the results of the analysis. The statistical choice of method was Cook’s Distance,
which was used after conducting the qualitative filtering approach on the variables. After
generating a multitude of scatter plots for the key variables, the final cut-off values were
chosen as criteria are listed in Table 4.2 below. For further insight into how these
qualitative boundaries affected the key variables, the pre- and post-distribution scatter
plots are shown in Appendix 4.

45

Axel Koukkula

Table 4.2 Outlier cut-off values for key variables

After removing extreme values that existed beyond these boundaries, the aforementioned
12 176 observations are reduced into 12 028 firm year observations.
Cook’s distance
This influence measure was proposed by Cook (1977) and it assesses the influence in
regression models by combining the residual and the leverage of an observation. As
mentioned, outliers are observations that have high residuals and result from erroneous
data or simply odd, extreme values. Leverage then again displays the distance of an
independent variable from its mean. Higher leverage, therefore, leads to a greater effect
on the regression coefficient estimates. Cook’s distance measures the influence of the ith
observation, and it can be expressed as (Chatterjee & Hadi, 2012):
𝐶𝑖 =

∑𝑛
̂ 𝑗 −𝑦̂𝑗(𝑖) )2
𝑗=1(𝑦
̂ 2 (𝑝+1)
𝜎

, 𝑖 = 1,2, … , 𝑛.

Which can be translated into
𝐶𝑖 =

𝑟𝑖2
𝑝+1

×

𝑝𝑖𝑖
1−𝑝𝑖𝑖

, 𝑖 = 1,2, … , 𝑛,

where
ri = standardized residual

p = number of coefficients

pii = leverage of the ith observation.

46

Axel Koukkula
The first term is a representation of the observation residual and the second term
represents the leverage of the observation; if the observation is influential, deleting it
results in considerable changes and increases the value of Ci. The higher value Ci assumes
the greater influence of the ith observation has on the model.
When adopting the model for removing outliers, the cut-off values for leverage, and the
tolerated observation distance need to be determined. This threshold has been met with
differing opinions among academics, with Cook (1977) assuming values greater than 1
as influential points (Chatterjee & Hadi, 2012). McDonald (2002) suggests that the
threshold should be related to the number of independent variables in the regression
model. With 2 regression parameters Ci>0.7, 3 regression parameters Ci>0.8 and
exceeding 3 parameters, Ci>0,85, given the number of observations in the dataset exceeds
15. This latter threshold would result in a higher amount of observations removed from
the even now small sample and therefore, I will adapt the original and more conservative
approach of using values exceeding 1 as points of influence. As Chatterjee and Hadi
(2012) also suggest, I will analyse the observations graphically in scatter plots, as I
generate Cook’s D values annually for the regression models.

4.4 Variable descriptions
This section will present the appropriate variables for developing a suitable research
design for empirical analysis. The dependent and independent variables will be
established first with a discussion regarding the motivation behind choosing these specific
variables. Then, the control variables for the study will be introduced, as these will play
a vital role in reducing the unexplained variation that is affecting the assumed effect R&D
activities have on firm performance.

4.4.1

Dependent variables

The focus of this analysis is on the financial performance of the firm and its relation to
the R&D activities it performs during a recession. Therefore, the dependent variables in
this study are metrics that measure financial performance from different viewpoints. I
consider these four indicators to give the widest perspective on firm performance, as they
measure effects on the top line, operating efficiency, bottom line, and lastly, market
valuation.
47

Axel Koukkula
Sales growth
As found in earlier research, the successful generation of innovative products and services
could offer firms possibilities to increase their revenue in the future. I will test for this
proposition by measuring a percentual change in revenue on an annual level.
𝑌1 = 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ =

(𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑡1 −𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑡0 )
𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑡0

This variable is expected to react strongly when the recession hits, as demand shocks
impact most industries. It is of interest if pre-recessionary R&D activities mitigate or
aggravate this effect and at a later point, if those that conduct a higher degree of R&D
intensity during the recessionary period, actually have an impact on their later revenue
growth development.
EBITDA margin
The second variable offers further insight into the firm’s ability to generate cash from its
sales figures. Acquiring the ratio, I divide EBITDA with the annual revenue figure.
𝑌2 = 𝐸𝐵𝐼𝑇𝐷𝐴 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 =

𝐸𝐵𝐼𝑇𝐷𝐴
𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠

As this thesis focus does not align with tax, capital structure, or asset-level effects,
EBITDA was preferred to operating profit, EBIT. Most companies did not include
EBITDA in their financial statements, so depreciation and amortization costs were
manually added to the operating profit figure before calculating the EBITDA margin.
Return on Assets
In order to measure how well the firm is able to able to generate profitability in relation
to its total assets, I will use Return on Assets as one additional indicator of financial
performance.
𝑌3 = 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 𝑜𝑛 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠 (𝑅𝑂𝐴) =

𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒+𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠

While the ratio is a popular choice within finance and accounting research, it does impose
a challenge as the capital structure of the firm affects it. This is adjusted for by adding
interest expenses on top of the net income, to mitigate the capital structure effect.
48

Axel Koukkula
Tobin’s q
Tobin’s q will be defined as an approximation, as shown in Chung and Pruitt (1994):
𝑌4 = 𝑇𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑛′ 𝑠 𝑞 =

≈

𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠
𝑀𝑉 (𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦) + 𝑀𝑉 (𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡)
≈
𝑅𝑒𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠
𝐵𝑉 (𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦) + 𝐵𝑉 (𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡)

𝑀𝑉 (𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦) + 𝐵𝑉 (𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡)
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠

where
𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 = 𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 (𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒) ∗ 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔

As mentioned in chapter 2.2.3, Tobin’s q is a measure that assumes that the market value
of a firm’s assets matches the replacement value of these said assets. The replacement
value of the assets is in its simple form, the total assets of the firm. Assuming the book
value of debt for example, is considered much harder, and therefore, it is in its simplest
form defined as the total liabilities mentioned on the balance sheet. As all the accounting
data is adjusted for inflation, the equity market value, also known as the market
capitalisation, has been adjusted for this as well.

4.4.2

Independent variables

Next, I present the independent variables that will be the main focus of this thesis. In
order to investigate how R&D activities affect firm performance, I have gathered R&D
accounting figures from the financial statements of the sample firms. As I did not have
access to additional innovation or research and development data in the form of surveys,
questionnaires, or other qualitative sources, I have chosen to estimate annual R&D
intensities purely based on the accounting figures. This is a method used in various prior
research, albeit the exact variables vary from somewhat among the studies. The two
methods that seemed to appear most frequently were R&D in relation to sales (see, e.g.
Lome, Heggeseth, & Moen, 2016) and R&D to total assets (see, e.g. Flammer & Ioannou,
2018); therefore, these two intensities were chosen to be included in this thesis.
In order to answer the research hypotheses chosen for this thesis, I will conduct three
different regression models that will be presented in subchapter 4.5. Thus, I will generate
three different variations of the focus variable for the regression models.
49

Axel Koukkula
Pre-recessionary year
The first measures of R&D intensity are to be included in the first regression model,
attempting to answer the first hypothesis. Pre-recessionary R&D spending in relation to
total sales respectively total assets will be the first point of examination, as I study
whether differences in R&D intensity affect how firms experience the recessionary years
of 2008 and 2009.
𝑅&𝐷1,2007 =

𝑅&𝐷 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠2007 + 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 𝑅&𝐷 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠2007
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠2007

𝑅&𝐷2,2007 =

𝑅&𝐷 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠2007 + 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 𝑅&𝐷 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠2007
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠2007

Some of the previous studies have found an approximately two-year lag and few even a
one-year lag (Del Monte & Papagni, 2003), which is certainly of interest regarding this
hypothesis and the approximation to the beginning of the recessionary period.
Recessionary years 2008-2009
The second measures of R&D intensity are based on the same formula as the previous
one, although this time for the two recessionary years that are of specific interest in this
thesis. These four proxies for R&D activities during the recession will be applied to the
second regression model, in an attempt to answer the second hypothesis, whether
recessionary R&D spending can explain later differences in firm performance.
𝑅&𝐷1,2008 =

𝑅&𝐷 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠2008 + 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 𝑅&𝐷 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠2008
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠2008

𝑅&𝐷2,2008 =

𝑅&𝐷 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠2008 + 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 𝑅&𝐷 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠2008
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠2008

𝑅&𝐷1,2009 =

𝑅&𝐷 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠2009 + 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 𝑅&𝐷 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠2009
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠2009

𝑅&𝐷2,2009 =

𝑅&𝐷 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠2009 + 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 𝑅&𝐷 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠2009
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠2009

The fit of the two R&D intensity indicators will be under scrutiny, as the expected demand
shock caused by the recession might skew the R&D to total sales ratio. This would
50

Axel Koukkula
provide a misleading picture of the actual R&D intensity the firms normally possess.
Therefore, R&D to total assets might suffer less variation, depicting a more accurate and
comparative view of the R&D activities of the firms for these two years.
Increased R&D activity during recessionary years
The final variation of measurement for firms’ R&D activities will be a combination of
the two previous ones but assuming the form of a dummy variable instead. It is derived
from comparing R&D spending during 2008 respective 2009 to the base year of 2007, as
the last pre-recessionary year in the study. Those firms that increase their R&D spending
in relation to total assets both 2008 and 2009 assume the role of 1, while those that do
not, assume the role of zero.
𝑅&𝐷⁄𝑇𝐴 𝐷𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑦08−09 = [1𝑅&𝐷2,2008−2009 >𝑅&𝐷2,2007 𝑜𝑟 0𝑅&𝐷2,2008−2009 <𝑅&𝐷2,2007 ]
This dummy variable will be used in the third regression model, in an effort to answer the
third hypothesis: whether increasing R&D spending during recessionary years could
improve later firm performance, compared to those that do not increase their spending.
Research and development spending in relation to total assets was chosen as the variable
to be compared, as R&D to total sales is expected to increase as the expected demand
shock of the recession decreases firm revenues.
In addition to the regression analysis, the dummy variable will be analysed with the
Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test to examine how the firms that increased their R&D
activities during the recessionary time period differ in later firm performance from those
firms that decreased their R&D activities. This method will be described in more detail
in subchapter 4.5.3.

4.4.3

Control variables

Now that I have presented the variables that are my main focus in this thesis, I will follow
with the control variables that are used in the study. Firm performance is not a result of a
single action or resource, but rather something that is determined by a multitude of
variables. In order to account for some of these firm characteristics that are known to
affect firm performance based on prior research, I will include these as control variables
in the regression models. As the main focus is on R&D activities’ effect on firm
51

Axel Koukkula
performance, by including these control variables, I will be able to reduce the unexplained
variation that may otherwise affect the shown effect of R&D has on firm performance.
These control variables have been chosen based on prior, corresponding analysis on R&D
or firm performance and periods of recession (see, e.g. Knudsen, 2019; Nason & Patel,
2016; Ratvik & Svergja, 2016; Tubbs, 2007).
Firm size
Firm size is usually linked to firm performance, as economies of scale offer larger firms
efficiency benefits that the smaller firms cannot enjoy to the same degree. Porter (1980)
interprets these size effects also as plausible entry-barriers to markets. Firm size may also
positively affect the possibilities of dividing research and development costs on bigger
revenues, whereas the R&D intensity is normally higher for smaller companies (Tubbs,
2007). There are also aspects in firm size that may affect firm performance negatively
during recessions, as drastic changes in firm strategy during times of economic shocks
would lead to high costs for the larger firms (Knudsen, 2019). Higher levels of financial
reserves and superior access to external financing also allow larger firms to wait out
possible demand shocks, while younger firms need to adjust their business based on the
impact.
𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑚 𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒 (𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠) = ln (𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠)𝑡1
As an alternative to this measure, the natural logarithm of the total sales was tested,
although it was found to be inferior regarding the impact on the explanatory power. In
prior research, alternative measures on firm size have been the natural logarithm of annual
average personnel and market capitalisation.
Liquidity
As earlier concluded, the internal financing capabilities of a firm are essential for
investments in R&D (Czarnitzki & Hottenrott, 2011). Low levels of liquidity might result
in firms not being able to invest in NPV positive project opportunities and there are also
clear indications that liquidity also affects product market outcomes and financial
performance positively (Myers & Majluf, 1984; Wang, 2002). Also, as mentioned
regarding the firm size, having access to financial reserves might alleviate the distress the
firm experiences during recessions.
52

Axel Koukkula

𝐶𝑎𝑠ℎ 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 =

𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐶𝑎𝑠ℎ 𝐻𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠

Based on this hypothesis above, the cash ratio is expected to show its highest effect on
firm performance during the recessionary time period of 2008 and 2009.
Leverage
In order to control for performance effects deriving from the capital structure of the firm,
I will include the debt ratio as a control variable. Under what was assumed normal market
conditions, the capital structure was originally seen not to affect firm value, according to
Modigliani and Miller (1958). Implicitly, seeing that firm value is not affected by the
capital structure, this would indirectly implicate that firm performance is neither affected
by the capital structure of choice. However, later studies have shown that the capital
structure of the firm may affect its performance.
Myers and Majluf (1984) find that chosen financing methods of firm investments act as
an information signal to stakeholders, resulting in the pecking order theory. Debt
overhang might lead to situations where the firm is not able to invest in NPV positive
projects, leading into underinvestment and therefore, decreased firm performance. The
negative effect of leverage on firm performance has been found in diverse papers (Bhagat
& Bolton, 2008; King & Santor, 2008), while other studies have found a positive effect
(Margaritis & Psillaki, 2010; Weill, 2008). Nevertheless, whether the effect leverage has
on firm performance is positive or negative, these results indicate the need for this control
variable:
𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 =

𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐿𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠

Furthermore, Opler and Titman (1984) report that highly leveraged, R&D active firms
suffer the most during periods of economic distress, which further validates the need for
this control variable in this study. Due to these findings, it is presumed that the debt ratio
will have its greatest significance during the recessionary years of 2008 and 2009.
Fixed assets ratio
While the need for fixed assets greatly varies in different industries, they may also be
seen as a signal of a firm’s financial stability. Fixed assets are long-term in nature, bought
53

Axel Koukkula
for usage in firm operations and thus, the organic conversion to cash of these assets might
take over one year (Kieso, Weygandt, & Warfield, 2013). Firms that have a high ratio of
fixed assets in relation to total assets may have several advantages over those that do not.
For example, these assets may act as collateral for firms when applying for external
financing, as opposed to the more arbitrary and firm-specific nature of R&D as an asset.
This could result in lower debt costs for the firm with higher proportions of fixed assets,
as well as access to debt that would not otherwise be available to the firm (as a result of
increased security through collaterals) (Welch, 2013). Therefore, I will control for this
variable by dividing fixed assets with the total assets of the firm:
𝐹𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑑 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 =

𝐹𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑑 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠

Here fixed assets are defined as the tangible, long-term assets of the company; that is,
property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). Due to the aforementioned relationship to debt,
I expect to see a significant correlation with the debt and liquidity level of the firm.
Firm age
Another control variable to be included in the regression models is the firm age, as this
may affect firm performance by proxy, but not directly. The accumulation of reputation
throughout the time period the firm has been active, through well-established routines and
certain organisational perseverance developed over the years might give an edge to older,
established firms (Coad, Holm, Krafft, & Quatraro, 2018). During times of recession,
these firms may also be perceived by investors as stronger and of higher quality, than
their younger counterparts and thereby, be affected by the “flight to quality”-phenomenon
(Bernanke, 1983). This “liability of newcomers” may also lead younger companies to
lose suppliers and customers, as they may not hold as established and loyal customer
bases as the older firms (Knudsen, 2019).
𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑚 𝐴𝑔𝑒 = ln(𝐴𝑔𝑒)2018
Firm age has been based on the year of establishment, which has been noted in the
financial statements of each sample firm. In his paper, Knudsen (2019) measures firm age
as the natural logarithm of the first year of his study, but as an increase in firm age is
constant for all firms, the chosen year does not play a pivotal role. I have chosen the last
54

Axel Koukkula
year of my analysis, 2018, as the year measuring firm age and take the natural logarithm
of that value for all sample firms.
Industry dummy
As the sample firms are active in different business sectors, I will adopt an industry
dummy in the analysis. This sample differentiation between different industries is vital,
as the R&D activities and intensities greatly vary, depending on the general industry
characteristics mentioned in chapter 2.2.1. This dummy variable will capture industrylevel effects that otherwise might affect the estimation accuracy of R&D activities’ effect
on firm performance (Coad & Rao-Nicholson, 2010). It also accounts for any possible
industry-specific omitted variable bias that could intervene in the regression models and
therefore, significantly affect the results. Two-digit ICB-codes are applied when
measuring industry.
𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑦 𝐷𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑦𝑗 = [1𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑦=𝑗 𝑜𝑟 0𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑦 ≠𝑗 ]
Country dummy
Furthermore, as this dataset includes listed firms both from the Oslo and Helsinki Stock
Exchange, I will adopt a country-specific dummy. As seen in Figure 4.1, the two countries
have experienced both the recessionary period, as well as the subsequent time period
differently. Especially, when comparing the years 2012 to 2014, Finland was in recession
while Norway was not, which might translate into worse firm performance for the Finnish
firms in the sample. Therefore, the country dummy will be included in the regression
models to ensure further validity in the study.
𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦 𝐷𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑦𝑗 = [1𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦=𝑗 𝑜𝑟 0𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦 ≠𝑗 ]

4.5 Empirical methodology
In this subchapter I will present the statistical analysis method I will use in order to
analyse the effect R&D activities may have on future firm performance. I will elaborate
on the theoretical background on both ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions as well
as multiple linear regressions. The theoretical backdrop in this subchapter will be based
on Wooldridge (2015) unless otherwise stated.

4.5.1

Regression analysis

In its simplest form, a regression analysis examines how variable Y is affected by changes
in variable x. Here, the variable Y is also referred to as the response or dependent variable,
whereas x is referred to as the independent or explanatory variable. An Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS) regression analysis draws a linear line through the observations,
determined by minimising the sum of squared distances between the regression line
(Wooldridge, 2015). The algebraic equation takes the form of:
𝑌̂ = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑥1 + 𝜀
The simple OLS regression model has 𝑌̂ as the predicted value of Y given by the model,
𝛽0 as the constant in the regression, 𝛽1 as the variable beta that measures the effect 𝑥1 has
on Y, and lastly, 𝜀 as the error term. The error term catches the effect of the changes in Y
that the model is unable to explain based on the chosen independent variable(s).
In practice, a simple OLS regression is often lacklustre when trying to explain complex
statistical questions. It is often a combination of different factors that explain the variation
in the dependent variable, which is thus unexplainable with merely one independent
variable. Therefore, multiple regression analysis is generally used as it includes several
independent variables of influence. The model for a multiple regression analysis can be
shown as follows:
𝑌̂ = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑥1 + 𝛽2 𝑥2 + 𝛽3 𝑥3 + ⋯ + 𝛽𝑛 𝑥𝑛 + 𝜀
In order to account for several explanatory variables rather than just one, I will adopt
multiple regression analysis in this thesis. This offers the chance to improve the
explanation power of the variation in Y when compared to a simple OLS regression. It is
done with the variables presented in the previous chapter and that are chosen as they are
known to affect firm performance, based on prior research. The specifications for the
multiple regression models are presented in chapter 4.5.3 below.

4.5.2

Gauss-Markov assumptions for OLS-regression

While a regression analysis does not discriminate the usage of any dataset or how the
analysis itself is used, there are still several conditions that affect how valid and accurate
the results are. Possible significant bias may exist in the dataset, making the regression
56

Axel Koukkula
results less feasible to correctly represent the relationships between the variables in an
actual population. To account for this, there are several assumptions to ensure that the
regression analysis is unbiased. These are known as the Gauss-Markov assumptions or
theorem.
Assumption 1: There is linearity in the parameters.
Assumption 2: The dataset is a random sample of the whole population.
Assumption 3: No perfect collinearity exists between the independent variables, and
neither are any of them a constant.
Assumption 4: The expected value of the error term is zero, ε(u|x) = 0.
Assumption 5: Error term assumes equal variance for any independent variables
(Homoscedasticity), Var(u|x) = σ2
To reach unbiased OLS estimates the first four assumptions must hold, signifying that the
probability distribution of an explanatory variable is estimated to represent a value true
to the whole population, (E(β) = β̂). If the fifth assumption does not hold, it means that
the regression model estimates show heteroscedasticity. This does not affect estimator
bias, but rather it reduces the estimator’s efficiency that is measured in standard errors of
the coefficients. This is taken into consideration in the thesis and explained
comprehensively in chapter 4.6.2.

4.5.3

Specification of the regression models

I will now introduce the regression models that will be applied in the analysis, in order to
either validate or reject the research hypotheses presented in chapter 3.4. This subchapter
will not explain in detail the variables used in the models, as those are discussed
thoroughly in chapter 4.4.
General model for regression
The following equation presents the base model used in this thesis to study the
relationship between firm performance and the R&D activities of a firm:

57

Axel Koukkula

Equation 1 General Regression Model

As this equation is quite lengthy, the independent variables β2 -β8 will be abbreviated into
control variables in the latter regression model variations. The control variables will stay
constant in the following variations of the regression model.
R&D activities affecting recessionary firm performance
Linking the regression model into the first research question if firms’ R&D spending
affects their future firm performance, this equation will use the pre-recessionary R&D
intensity as the focus variable affecting firm performance during the recessionary time
period of 2008 and 2009.
𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑚 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑌1−4,𝑡1 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑅&𝐷1−2,

Equation 2 Regression model for Recessionary Performance

Running this regression model will yield results that either validate or disprove the first
hypothesis.
Recessionary R&D activities affecting later firm performance
This variation of the base regression model estimates if differences in R&D intensities
during the recessionary years 2008 and 2009 affect later firm performance, measured
during the years 2010 to 2018.
𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑚 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑌1−4,𝑡1 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑅&𝐷1−2,

2008−2009

Equation 3 Regression model for Recessionary R&D activity intensity

Much like the first regression model, it is closely related to the second research question,
as well as the second hypothesis.
Increased R&D activities during the recessionary years
This regression model is very much linked in the second research question, analysing if
those firms that increase their R&D/TA intensity during the recessionary time period
perform better or worse at a later time period than their counterparts. The model,
therefore, resembles closely the previous model, but instead of just measuring the R&D

58

Axel Koukkula
intensity as percentual changes, it will adapt a dummy variant of those firms that
increase/decrease their R&D spending for the recession period.
𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑚 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑌1−4,𝑡1 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑅&𝐷 ⁄𝑇𝐴 𝐷𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑦 2008−2009 + [𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑠] + 𝜀
Equation 4 Regression model for Increased Recessionary R&D Activity

This final variation of the regression will either corroborate or reject the third, and the
final hypothesis of this thesis.

4.5.4

Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test

In addition to the multivariate regression models, I will also adapt the non-parametric
Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test (also called Mann-Whitney U test) to analyse the
two groups of firms that either increased or decreased their R&D activities during the
recession. Specifically, the later firm performance of these two firm groups is of interest,
and the MWW-test is meant to complement the results from the regression analysis. Is
there a difference between those that increased their R&D intensity in 2008 and 2009,
when compared to those that acted oppositely? The null hypothesis is that there is no
tendency of the ranks (firm performance) in one group to be systematically higher or
lower than for those in the other group.
The firms are divided into two groups, based on the R&D dummy variable presented in
chapter 4.4.2. The firm performance is then analysed year by year from 2010 to 2018,
including all firm performance indicators.
As this non-parametric test compares medians instead of means, it is not sensitive to
extreme values and therefore, it does not require a normal distribution for the variables.
If the variables were normally distributed, the parametric equivalent test would have been
the T-test for independent samples.
The smaller of the two U statistics that are measured in the test is derived from (Corder
& Foreman, 2014):
𝑈𝑖 = 𝑛1 𝑛2 +

𝑛𝑖 (𝑛𝑖 +1)
2

− ∑ 𝑅𝑖 ,

where ni is the number of values from sample examined, n1 and n2 are the number of
values from respective samples and ∑ 𝑅𝑖 is the sum of the ranks from the sample of
59

Axel Koukkula
interest. After analysing for the U statistic, it is then further inspected for significance or
alpha (α), at a level of 0.05. With a smaller sample (<20) it would be possible to use a
table of critical values to find the value that is to not be exceeded, in order to reject the
null hypothesis. The sample analysed in this thesis varies from 82 to 89, so this is not a
viable option. Instead, as Corder and Foreman (2014) suggest, a large sample
approximation can be carried out by computing a z-score and using a normal distribution
table to find critical values of z-scores. As this is done automatically by SPSS, I will not
go into greater detail behind the mathematical model, but rather present the results of the
test in chapter 5 and discuss those more in-depth in chapter 6.

4.6 Data concerns and validity
Much alike any other dataset, there exist concerns regarding analysing this data, which
may affect both the validity and reliability of this study. First the statistical concerns of
the data will be discussed, presenting how multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity will
be taken into consideration. Following this, the validity and reliability of the study will
be discussed in detail.

4.6.1

Multicollinearity

Multicollinearity is defined as a high, albeit not a perfect correlation between two or more
independent variables (Wooldridge, 2015). Instead of actually breaching any of the
Gauss-Markov assumptions for unbiasedness of regressions, multicollinearity is
problematic as identifying which of the collinear independent variables are of interest,
becomes futile. Nevertheless, all regression models show a correlation to some degree
between the independent variables (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2019).
In order to inspect the several regression models for multicollinearity, there are a few
alternatives to consider. One of the simplest procedures to do this is through examining a
correlation matrix, in this case a Pearson’s r matrix. Shown in Table 5.4 and Appendix
6., the correlation between the independent variables can be seen for all the annual
variables used in the regression models. The two coefficients that show the highest levels
of correlation, of those that are actually used in the regressions, are the two measures of
R&D intensity and cash holding ratio. The highest correlation between cash ratio and
R&D intensity is 0.779 throughout this 11-year period. This is a quite high level of
60

Axel Koukkula
correlation, albeit not exceeding the 0.8 threshold, but nevertheless worth investigating
further.
The variance inflation factor test (VIF) is a method to analyse how much the
multicollinearity inflates the variance of the coefficient estimate. The general assumption
is to investigate variables with a VIF exceeding 4 and those that exceed a threshold of 10
show serious multicollinearity issues (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2019). As
mentioned by Hair et al. (2019) this VIF threshold of 10 is corresponding to a tolerance
value of 0.10, thus also suggested as a cut-off value for values of tolerance. Running VIFtests in unison with the several regression models show no independent variables with
VIF values above 4, other than for the industry and country dummies. These high VIFs
for the dummy variables are although expected and do not cause issues with the regression
estimates. The VIF values are shown in Table 5.6 and Appendix 7.

4.6.2

Heteroscedasticity

As previously mentioned, in order to ensure that the regression is unbiased it must fulfil
certain assumptions, also known as the Gauss-Markov assumptions. One of these
assumptions is the homoscedasticity of the independent variables, as in assumed equal
variance for the error term. If heteroscedasticity would be present in the regression model,
rather than affecting the biasedness of the estimates, it would instead reduce the model’s
efficiency. To check for heteroscedasticity in the regression models, I will apply the
Breusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity.
The Breusch-Pagan (BP) test is used to detect heteroscedasticity in linear regression
models, assuming that heteroscedasticity is a linear function of xj (Breusch & Pagan,
1979). The test regresses the squared residuals of the independent variables with a nullhypothesis of homoscedasticity, given that the p-value is above a critical level
(Wooldridge, 2015).
𝑢̂2 = 𝛿0 + 𝛿1 𝑥1 + 𝛿2 𝑥2 + ⋯ + 𝛿𝑘 𝑥𝑘 + 𝜖
The example model above assumes merely two independent variables, instead of the
eighteen independent variables used in the actual regression models. If the regression
models would include interaction or non-linear terms, the BP test would not be sufficient
and require an alternative test to supplement. White test for heteroscedasticity could be a
61

Axel Koukkula
viable option for this. Although, as the regression models used in this thesis lack
interaction terms or non-linear variables, the Breusch-Pagan test is ample to check for
heteroscedasticity. In a majority of the regressions performed, the test provided a p-value
of 0.000, indicating heteroscedastic errors for linear relationships in the model.
In order to adjust the regression results for heteroscedasticity, I will apply
heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors as recommended by Wooldridge (2015).
Using these robust standard errors result in increased standard errors that are causing the
reduced model efficiency. If the sample size is small, these robust standard errors may
affect the estimated coefficients (Wooldridge, 2015). As the sample size is equal or below
250, I will employ the supported HC3 in accordance with Long and Ervin (2000).

4.6.3

Validity

In research it is of importance to evaluate the quality of the study and whether its results
stand when subjected to scrutiny. To discuss this in detail, this section will discuss the
validity of this study from different aspects: construct validity, internal validity, and
external validity.
Construct validity
Construct validity refers to whether correct operational measures are established for the
concepts that are to be studied. In this study, it is relevant regarding the different measures
for firm performance as well as for measuring the research and development activities of
the firm.
In order to acquire an overview of firm performance, I have included several performance
variables to measure firm performance from different aspects. First, the operating
efficiency of the firm will be measured through the EBITDA margin and ROA. Second,
successful product innovation should result in increased sales, thus measuring sales
growth is of relevance. Third, as the sample comprises of public firms, the market
valuation of these companies is an additional aspect to analyse, leading to using Tobin’s
q as the final firm performance variable. These variables are commonly used in research
combining firm performance and the innovative activities of the firm, although isolating
the effect is not a simple feat (Tubbs, 2007). To gain a more accurate view of this
innovation-performance relationship, several analyses include adjustments for both
62

Axel Koukkula
industry- and country-specific effects as well as control variables. Much alike any
empirical study regarding firm performance, there is still the concern of isolating the
specific effect from the focus variable.
Measuring the research and development activities of the firm is done through a proxy,
as in intensity in relation to either total assets or revenue. While this proxy has been used
in prior studies in different variations, it can be accepted to offer limited insight into the
actual process of innovation within firms. The variable does not differ between the
different types of activities done within R&D, but rather cluster all processes into one
unit of expense for the firm. Certainly, including the activated R&D costs into this proxy
measure give some indication of the R&D process that has been done with this spending,
as the criteria for capitalisation are strict. These capitalised expenses indicate that the
output of the R&D process could provide the firm future cash flow, while the general
spending on R&D expensed through the income statement does not fulfil to offer such
outlook. Therefore, while this proxy measure of R&D depicts the activity as mere costs
for the company, there is still support for using this aggregate measure from prior studies.
While it may not offer the same depth of insight as qualitative innovation data could offer
regarding the innovative activities of the firm, I am still confident this proxy measure
could offer some increased understanding of how the R&D spending affects firm
performance throughout the business cycle.
Internal validity
Internal validity concerns questions regarding whether two or more variables truly have
a causal relationship (Bryman & Bell, 2011). This is imperative in quantitative research
to be able to differentiate whether the relationship between the variables is purely
correlated or if causality exists. The secondary data in this thesis is based on financial
figures, with time-lags included in the regression models. In order to further ensure the
internal validity of the study, the research design is based on the available theory as well
as prior research (Bryman & Bell, 2011).
Including all relevant independent variables in the regression models is also of concern,
as omitting variables that should have been included in the model will have implications
on the validity of the study. In order to account for this, I have thoroughly investigated
available literature to identify well-known variables that may affect firm performance and
63

Axel Koukkula
thus, included those in the study as control variables. There are still limitations regarding
this, as the data used in the study is solely quantitative to its nature, whereas the inclusion
of qualitative data could have included a more multifaceted point of view on the study.
In studies regarding innovation and firm performance, one issue that arises is
simultaneity. Do (low-) high-performing firms innovate more, or do innovative firms
simply perform better (worse)? While the time-lagged regression model provides some
hints regarding the direction of this relationship, there are still uncertainties that need to
be accounted for and these will be discussed further in chapter 6. To further increase the
validity of the study, I use Pearson’s r correlation matrix to ensure the absence of
multicollinearity in the independent variables that are used in the regression models.
External validity
External validity concerns the question of whether the findings of the study can be
generalised outside the chosen research context (Bryman & Bell, 2011, p. 43). As
previously mentioned in the theory chapter, recessions vary by their length, severity, and
causation, which makes the generalisation of these findings debatable. Nevertheless,
recessions still share credit constrains and demand chocks as common effects, according
to Knudsen and Lien (2014), making these findings generalisable to other recessionary
periods.
Still, within external validity there is also the concern of time validity, which is obviously
an issue that is difficult to account for, as the data is based on historical accounting figures
and share prices. Past performance is not indicative of future results, making time validity
a concern that cannot be accounted for, due to the nature of the study.
Reflecting back on Figure 4.2, the research and development activities of Norway and
Finland differ during this time period to some extent. While R&D in Finland was nearly
twofold of that in Norway, the gap between the countries has decreased considerably over
time and currently approximately represents the OECD average as well. Therefore, there
is support for the findings to be generalised to at least other developed OECD countries.

5 ANALYSIS
Having presented the data, the variables used in the study, and the regression models, this
chapter will now present the analysis results. First, R&D activities of the sample firms on
a country- and industry-level basis will be presented, along with firm performance
indicators for the total sample, as well as separate for both countries. Then, the regression
results are shown, first presenting the control model for each regression, and then
including the R&D focus variable in each model. Lastly, the findings are summarized
before the discussion chapter.

5.1 Development in R&D and firm performance
In order to depict a picture of the general development of R&D spending and firm
performance during the time period of interest in this study, this section will provide a
country- and an industry-specific overview of these aspects.

5.1.1

R&D activities in the sample

To begin the analysis, I will present a simple illustration of the R&D activities for the
total sample used in this thesis. The table below presents the R&D spending in relation to
revenues and total assets as annual averages in percentages.

Table 5.1 R&D intensities (%), sample average 2007-2018

In Table 5.1, the annual R&D spending in relation to sales and total assets is depicted,
differing between the Finnish and Norwegian firms and the total sample. It is noteworthy
65

Axel Koukkula
that the R&D intensity is much higher among the Norwegian companies with high yearly
variance. Comparing these to the Finnish sample, the figures are quite stable and showing
low variance throughout the time period.
Looking at the total sample, the major changes in the R&D intensity appear to happen
during 2008 and 2010-2011. For the Norwegian companies these large variations are
likely to be caused for two reasons. Firstly, the firm sample is less than half of those
included in the Finnish sample, and therefore, large annual deviations in a few companies
result in a more noticeable effect on the whole country-specific firm sample. Secondly,
as the R&D intensities are from 2007 to 2013 more than double their Finnish counterparts,
it can be assumed that the Norwegian sample consists of young, R&D-intensive
companies with low sales figures and small balance sheet values in relation to their R&D
spending. The low revenue assumption could explain the sudden doubling of R&D to
total sales between 2007 and 2008, as the financial crisis hit in 2008, leading to demand
reductions for many firms.
As the focus of this thesis is on the pre-recessionary and recessionary R&D activities of
the sample, the next table presents the R&D spending on an industry-level for these years
of interest. The industries are ranked by R&D expenditures relative to annual sales.

Table 5.2 R&D intensities (%), industry averages 2007-2009

As shown in Table 5.2 above, the R&D spending in relation to sales and total assets varies
considerably among the different industries. Unsurprisingly, the two industries that
display the highest R&D intensities are Health Care respective Technology. The drugs
66

Axel Koukkula
and pharmaceutical companies that spend remarkable amounts on developing new
medicine are included in the Health Care industry, which explains the high R&D
intensities. Of the 6 companies included in the sample, many were relatively young with
low revenues, thus resulting in very high R&D to sales ratios for the years 2007 and 2008.
Examining the lower end of the table, the industries Media, Basic Resources, and
Telecommunications rank as the bottom three industries in R&D intensity. Among these
industries, the sample firms boast solid revenue streams and total assets that also reflects
in the relatively stable research and development intensities during these three years.
Also, while the R&D spending still might translate into millions of NOK or EUR, in
relation to the revenues or total assets, the amounts are still lower than in the other
industries included in the study.
This table further confirms the need to differentiate between industries in the regression
models, as the industry-specific effects would interfere with the results considerably.
Also, noteworthy is that both in Table 5.1 and 5.2 the R&D intensity measured in relation
to total sales fluctuates more than R&D to total assets. This demand shock that decreases
the sales during the recession would skew the R&D intensity to an abnormally high level,
which would affect the analysis results. Therefore, in order to ensure that a more realistic
R&D intensity of the firms during this time period is depicted, R&D to total assets will
be used in the regression analysis.

67

5.1.2

Performance indicators in the sample

Next, in order to assess how the recession and the subsequent time period have affected
firm performance, I have compiled the annual averages for the performance indicators of
the sample in Table 5.3 below and for Tobin’s q in Figure 5.1.

Table 5.3 Performance indicators (%), annual averages 2007-2018

Evaluating the dependent variables on an annual and country-specific basis, there are
some interesting findings. First, while ROA is at its lowest point for the whole sample
during the year 2013, it experienced its peak level of 7.49% in 2007. Both countries firm
samples experienced their climax during that year, after which the Norwegian companies
have averaged a negative Return on Assets, with the only positive exception being in
2016. The Finnish companies exhibit a positive ROA throughout the whole time period,
even though the country itself has experienced a recession at least twice during this study
period, based on the GDP evolution presented earlier in Figure 4.1. One probable reason
for this difference between the two countries is the small sample of Norwegian firms, of
which many were also young, while the Finnish companies are not only many more but
also older with proven track records of profitability.
Second, reflecting back on the same Figure 4.1 depicting the GDP development of the
two countries, it was expected that the Finnish firms would generally exhibit worse
performance in 2008 and from 2012 to 2014. In 2008 the firms of the two countries fared
relatively similarly, with the only difference being the priorly mentioned superior ROA
performance of the Finnish firms. From 2012 to 2014, however, while the Finnish firms’
68

Axel Koukkula
ROA stayed superior to their Norwegian counterparts, the Norwegian firms show higher
sales growth as well as slightly outperform the Finnish firms in the EBITDA margin for
two of these years.

Figure 5.1 Tobin's q, annual averages 2007-2018

Examining how Tobin’s q evolved during this time period of 11 years, there are
immediately some noteworthy findings. First, during this entire time period the sample
average of Tobin’s q has stayed fairly high, averaging between 1.2 to 1.8. This would
indicate that the sample firms are overvalued, or rather, have high growth expectations
that the market has valued in the valuation of these firms. Likewise, it might also be an
indication of the investors recognising some additional value-building assets or
capabilities that these firms possess, with these being of such nature that prevents them
from being displayed on the balance sheet of the firm; therefore, leading into Tobin’s q
values above one.
Second, it is immediately noticeable how gravely the financial crisis of 2008 impacted
the market valuation of these companies, as the average Tobin’s q sank from 1.8 the year
prior to 1.2 by the year-end of 2008. Surprisingly, although the lagged impact of the
recession severely affected the operations of these firms in 2009, as shown in Table 5.3,
Tobin’s q still rebound back to an average of above 1.5 the same year. This is still
somewhat understandable, as the variable is of a forward-looking nature, anticipating
future growth expectations contrary to the other performance indicators that merely
reflect on past performance. It could, therefore, describe the positive market outlook for
69

Axel Koukkula
the future that was shared by investors amidst the recession. This positive outlook
however, changed into a high level of uncertainty in 2011 amidst the European sovereign
debt crisis, with fears of further contagion of countries being unable to repay their debts.
Following this, the average Tobin’s q grew from 2012 to peak in 2017, followed by a
drop in 2018.
Third, and lastly, the general evolution of Tobin’s q has been rather identical between the
Finnish sample and the Norwegian firm sample. The Finnish sample firms were harder
hit in 2008 than their Norwegian counterparts, but then again, they were better off in the
shock of 2011 than the Norwegian firms. The average change in Tobin’s q in 2017 and
2018 was, although, opposite for the firms in the two countries. These results, however,
do not by any means represent the entire picture of how the firms in these countries have
developed during this time period in valuation, as the firm samples for both countries are
admittedly small; thus, overrepresenting certain industries while omitting others.
While these results do not depict the whole picture of how all of the listed firms in these
two countries differ in firm performance during this 11-year period, the results do indeed
confirm the need of using a country dummy variable to decrease country-specific effects
that might inference the findings in the regression analyses.

5.2 Descriptive statistics
Having presented some general country- and industry-specific trends of firm performance
and R&D spending, this section will discuss the basic features of the data used in the
analyses. Data distribution and normality will be presented, which will be followed by
discussing correlations between the variables that are used in the regression models.
Lastly, as this thesis includes 124 separate regressions, it results in a large amount of
descriptive statistics tables that need to be included. Therefore, in order to present all this
in a tidy manner, I will include most of the tables in the Appendices 5. – 7., while
presenting one of each table in this section. I will, however, present any anomalies or
other noteworthy findings from these tables that are included in the Appendices, in this
section as well.

5.2.1

Descriptive statistics and data normality

In order to acquire an overview of the data used in the analyses, descriptive statistics and
data normality tests are provided for the key variables in 2007 and 2008 in the table below,
whereas the same information for the remaining years is shown in Appendix 5.

Table 5.4 Descriptive statistics & Shapiro-Wilk test, table 1/11 - 2008

In addition to the mean values, standard deviations, and the minimum and maximum
values of each chosen variable, the table shows both the skewness and kurtosis. These are
critical values to explore, as they describe whether the dataset is normally distributed,
which is an important assumption of an OLS-regression (Wooldridge, 2015). Skewness
describes the symmetry of the data, where a value close to zero implicate symmetric
distribution, whereas a positive or negative value demonstrate the concentration of the
distribution mass on either right respective left tail (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson,
2019).
Among the key variables during the whole period of the study, there are certain ones that
consistently show a positive skewness. In addition to the R&D intensity measures of
2007, 2008, and 2009, Cash Ratio and Tobin’s q exhibit a positive skewness throughout
the years, with values ranging from 2.2-3.0 respective 1.3-2.4. Respectively there is one
ratio that demonstrates consistently a negative skewness through this same period, with
the only exception being 2016, showing a positive skewness. ROA shows mostly a left
tail with values varying from -1.0 to -3.3, with the exception of a positive skewness of
71

Axel Koukkula
1.9 in 2016. Excluding the cash ratio, R&D intensities, and the performance indicators,
the highest skewness values are demonstrated by the FA ratio peaking at 0.8 in 2010.
Firm size, as a natural logarithm of the total assets, shows skewness values close to zero
as anticipated for the transformed data.
The other measure that describes the shape of a distribution of data, is kurtosis. This term
refers to the peakedness of a probability distribution, where distributions taller than the
normal distribution are called leptokurtic, while those that are flatter, are referred to as
platykurtic (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2019, p. 43). As the kurtosis of a normal
distribution is approximately three, those that exceed that value exhibit a leptokurtic
distribution, whereas those with a value below three demonstrate a platykurtic
distribution. The statistical program SPSS automatically subtracts this pivotal value of
three, resulting in any negative values indicating a platykurtic distribution respectively
positive values a leptokurtic distribution. Out of all the variables, there are several that
consistently show a leptokurtic distribution; namely, the cash ratio, EBITDA margin,
ROA, Tobin’s q, and the R&D intensities in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Similarly, there are
two variables, FA ratio, and firm size, that exhibit a platykurtic distribution every year,
albeit only to the extent of never exceeding a value of minus one.
Furthermore, the tables in Appendix 5 together with Table 5.4 report the results of the
Shapiro-Wilk tests. This test that was created by Shapiro and Wilk (1965) measures the
normality of a small data sample, having a null hypothesis of a normal distribution. In
2008, and from 2010 onward, the null hypothesis of a normal distribution in the variables
can be rejected for all variables except for the firm size and debt ratio. In 2009, however,
in addition to the firm size and debt ratio, ROA and the sales growth also exhibit such
values so that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. In summary, most of the variables
used in the study do not exhibit a normal distribution during these 11 years.

5.2.2

Tests of correlation

Measuring correlation, as in how a variable reacts to the change of another variable, is
done with the Pearson’s r correlation matrix. Granted, even though two variables indicate
correlation it is not sufficient to confirm the existence of causality regarding the direction
of the relationship between these variables (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2019, p.
616).

Axel Koukkula
Table 5.5 above, as well as Appendix 6 report the correlations of the variables used in the
several regression models, excluding the dummy variables. The coefficient for each
variable adopts a value between -1 and 1, whereas a coefficient of zero indicates no
correlation between two variables. If the coefficient between two variables is 1, the
change between these two variables is identical, while the opposite is true for a value of
-1. As these regression models include several control variables, and thereby, significant
correlations between the variables, I will point out the most pivotal ones for this study.
Several correlations corroborate the motives behind the chosen control variables, as their
expected relationships with other variables are shown. First, the research and
development intensities show high levels of correlation with the liquidity of the firm.
Second, liquidity is negatively correlated to firm age, fixed assets ratio, and firm size.
This is also quite logical, as older and larger firms usually exhibit higher total assets than
their younger and smaller counterparts, this results systematically in a lower proportion
of liquidity for these firms. These older and larger firms also often demonstrate higher
ratios of fixed assets, as smaller firms may not pertain to those industries that typically
have high FA ratios, such as telecommunications, or basic resources sectors. Third, it is
noteworthy that whilst R&D intensity to total sales and R&D intensity to total assets show
very high levels of correlation that could cause multicollinearity issues, these two
variables are never included in the same regression.
Fourth, and most interestingly, these tables present how the R&D intensities correlate
with the different firm performance indicators. In the first regression model, shown in
Table 5.5 and Appendix 6.1, both measures of R&D intensity demonstrate mostly
negative correlations to the profitability measures and sales growth, whilst the correlation
is positive to Tobin’s q. The exceptions to these results are the insignificant correlations
for R&D to total assets in 2007 contra ROA and sales growth in 2009. Surprisingly, R&D
to total sales shows a significant and positive correlation to ROA in 2009. Subsequently,
the second regression model that is shown in Appendix 6.2 to 6.10, report rather similar
correlations between the recessionary R&D intensities and later firm performance. Sales
growth in 2012, 2014, and 2016 is shown to have a significant and positive correlation to
recessionary R&D intensities, whilst the years in between do not show significant results.
Tobin’s q demonstrates a positive and significant correlation during this whole postrecessionary period to recessionary R&D intensity, as does the EBITDA margin, albeit
with a negative correlation to the R&D intensity. Lastly, ROA exhibits a significant and
74

Axel Koukkula
negative correlation to the recessionary R&D intensities from 2010 to 2017, with the
exceptions of 2010 and 2013 when this correlation was positive for R&D intensity in
2009.
These implications of a negative relationship between the R&D intensities and measures
of firm performance, excluding Tobin’s q, are quite surprising. However, it is still
necessary to further analyse these results before any conclusions can be drawn.

5.2.3

Tests of multicollinearity

As priorly presented in chapter 4.6.1, variance inflation factor (VIF) tests will be carried
out to ensure that the regression models would not suffer from multicollinearity issues.
While most of these results from the VIF tests can be found in Appendix 7, Table 5.6
below presents the results of one such test measuring firm performance in 2010 with the
third regression model.

Table 5.6 Variance Inflation Factor, third regression – 2010

Evident from this table, as well as from the tables in Appendix 7, none of the non-dummy
variables indicate any form of multicollinearity issues that would interfere with the
regression results analysis. Only the dummy variables exceed the critical tolerance or VIF
values in some regressions, although due to the binary nature of these control variables,

75

Axel Koukkula
they do not hamper the results and may thus be ignored (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson,
2019, p. 316).

5.3 Results from analysis
This section presents the results from the various analyses, beginning with how prerecessionary R&D activities affect firm performance during recessions. It is followed by
examining how R&D activities during the recession affect post-recessionary firm
performance. Then, how increased R&D activities during the recession affect postrecessionary firm performance will be analysed by two means, as both regression
analyses, as well as a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, will be applied. Finally, the
empirical findings will be summarised before proceeding to the discussion of these
results. In order to keep this section tidy as well, it will include only the most vital result
tables, while the rest of the tables are presented in Appendix 8.

5.3.1

R&D activities and recessionary performance

First, I investigate how pre-recessionary R&D intensity affects firm performance during
recessions by running the second regression model, equation 2. The model is first to run
with solely the control variables, followed by the full model with the focus variable R&D
to total assets intensity for the financial year 2007. The regression results are shown in
Table 5.7 respectively Table 5.8.

Table 5.7 Pre-recessionary R&D activities, control model results

76

Axel Koukkula
Running the first regression model with only the control variables offers rather decent
explanatory power with ROA and the EBITDA margin having the highest R2 between
37% and 46%, respectively 35% and 50%. However, for sales growth and Tobin’s q the
regression model is significant only for the year 2008, while the explanatory power and
regression significance drop considerably in 2009.
Then, adding the focus variable R&D intensity, as shown in Table 5.8 and Appendix 8.1,
increases the explanatory power considerably for the different regressions. The only
exception for this is the model for sales growth in 2009 that still demonstrates an
insignificant F-value. Using R&D intensity to total assets increased the R2 of ROA to
between 43% and 54%, while the EBITDA margin had a humbler increase to between
37% and 50%. For sales growth this focus variable increased R2 from between 22% and
35% to between 25% and 42%. The biggest change, although, was for Tobin’s q where
the explanatory power increased from between 26% and 34% to between 38% and 54%.
Examining in turn how R&D intensity to total sales changed the explanatory power when
compared to the change R&D intensity to total assets had, the effect was near identical
for ROA, clearly superior for the EBITDA margin, marginally superior for sales growth,
and inferior for Tobin’s q.

Table 5.8 Pre-recessionary R&D activities, full model results

Measuring pre-recessionary R&D intensity to total assets, a one percent increase in this
variable resulted in a 1.4% decrease in sales growth 2008, whilst increasing Tobin’s q by
4.1% and 2.7% in 2008 respective 2009. When the R&D intensity is measured to total
77

Axel Koukkula
sales, an increase of one percent in this intensity resulted in a 0.4% and 0.6% decrease in
ROA respective EBITDA margin in 2008.
These results confirm the previously suggested negative relationship between increased
R&D intensity and measures of profitability and sales growth, as well as the positive
effect on Tobin’s q. The limited extent of this negative relationship, however, was
surprising as the Pearson’s r correlation matrix suggested a significant effect of both R&D
intensities on the firm performance indicators for both 2008 and 2009. This lesser degree
of significant results is the outcome of the HC3 estimator correcting the heteroscedasticity
of the dataset. Nevertheless, these findings support both H1a and H1b, as both a positive
as well as negative effect on firm performance during the recession was found to stem
from pre-recessionary R&D activities.

5.3.2

Recessionary R&D activities and later firm performance

Now, in turn, the focus shifts to whether R&D that is performed during the recession can
affect later firm performance in the post-recessionary period from 2010-2018. As
previously mentioned, due to the total sales being severely affected by the demand shock
of the recession, R&D intensity in relation to total assets has been chosen as the proxy for
measuring the R&D activities during recession. The control models for each firm
performance variable during 2010 to 2018 are presented in Appendix 8.2-8.5, whilst the
full regression models are shown in Appendix 8.6-8.13. In this subsection, Table 5.9 and
Table 5.10 presents the noteworthy, significant findings from 2010 to 2018.

78

Axel Koukkula

Table 5.9 R&D activities in 2008, full model results

First, using R&D to total assets in 2008 as the focus variable, only a few significant effects
on later firm performance can be found. An increase of one percent in the R&D intensity
to total assets in 2008 decreased the EBITDA margin with 1% in 2013 and with 1.1% in
2014. While a significant effect is shown for ROA in 2016, an F-value of 1.255 implies
that the regression itself is not significant, and therefore, this result cannot be considered
as statistically robust. The focus variable itself increased the explanatory power most for
the regression models involving ROA and the EBITDA margin, whereas Tobin’s q had a
more modest change, and lastly, sales growth hardly any change at all.
Nevertheless, while the results did show several significant effects between R&D
intensity in 2008 and later firm performance, after correcting for heteroscedasticity only
the EBITDA margin in 2013 and 2014 remained significant. Still, this lagged effect of up
to six years is intriguing and it will be discussed further in the following chapter 6.

79

Axel Koukkula

Table 5.10 R&D activities in 2009, full model results

Then, after changing the focus variable into R&D intensity in 2009, it was found to affect
a broader scale of firm performance indicators than the R&D intensity in 2008. One
percent increase in R&D intensity in 2009 increased Tobin’s q of the following year by
3%, decreased ROA by 0.5% in 2011, and decreased the EBITDA margin by 0.9% in
2014. This following-year effect on Tobin’s q is similar to the one identified in the first
regression model, whereas another significant effect on the EBITDA margin in 2014
could indicate the existence of a year-specific effect.
The explanatory power of the regression models using R&D intensity in 2009 compared
to the previous ones using R&D intensity in 2008, exhibit quite similar performance
throughout the post-recessionary period. These regression results, nevertheless, indicate
that the second hypothesis may be accepted to at least some degree. H2a finds support
from the negative effects R&D intensity in 2008 had on the EBITDA margin 2013 and
2014, while R&D intensity in 2009 affected negatively ROA in 2011 and the EBITDA in
2014. H2b, subsequently, is supported from the positive effect R&D in 2009 had on
Tobin’s q in 2010. However, without any seemingly logical trend in these results, the
hypothesis can be argued to find only partial support. This will be discussed more indetail in the following chapter.

80

5.3.3

Increased R&D activities during recessionary years

To investigate the second research question in whether differences in these recessionary
R&D activities could explain differences in post-recessionary firm performance, the last
regression model adopts the R&D dummy variable as the focus variable. Then, similarly
to the second regression model, regressions are performed on the firm performance
variables as the dependent variables, spanning from 2010 to 2018.
Shown in Appendix 8.14-8.17, it can be stated that the performed regressions are
unsuccessful, as no significant effects are found between the performance indicators and
the dummy variable. Admittedly, ROA in 2015 exhibits a 10 percent significance level
with a significant regression model, but as the other results stated in this thesis are
significant on at least a 5% level, a ten percent significance is too low to be accepted.
The general fit of the model can also be considered inadequate, as the explanatory power
barely increases after adding the focus variable when compared to the control models. In
many cases, this explanatory power even decreased from the control models. These
findings as a whole, with insufficient indications of significant effects between the
variables, do not find support for the third hypothesis. Before fully rejecting the third
hypothesis, further analysis will be done with the MWW-test.

5.3.4

Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test on firm performance

Examining these results further, I apply the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test where
the sample is grouped based on the same dummy variable as in the regression above. That
is, the firm belongs to group 1 if it increased its RD/TA-intensity during the recessionary
years 2008 and 2009 compared to the pre-recession year 2007. The four dependent firm
performance variables were then analysed for the same time period 2010 to 2018 as in
the regression models.

81

Axel Koukkula

Table 5.11 Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test, increased R&D intensity 2008-2009

As shown in Table 5.11, the only variable that showed a significant difference among the
groups was Tobin’s q. On a 5% level of significance this only applied for the year 2018,
while on a 10% level this applied for the year 2017. Those that increased their R&D
intensity during the recessionary years (median: 1.13; Q1: 0.93 – Q3: 1.95) showed
significantly lower Tobin’s q values in 2018, compared to those that did not increase their
R&D intensity (median: 1.45; Q1: 1.14 – Q3: 2.13) (U = 625; p = 0.041). Respectively,
for those that increased R&D intensity (median: 1.35; Q1: 1.08 – Q3: 2.06) had lower
Tobin’s q in 2017 than those that did not increase their R&D intensity (median: 1.62; Q1:
1.28 – Q3: 2.31) (U= 591; p = 0.053). Unsurprisingly, no other financial performance
indicator showed a significant difference between the two groups for any year from 2010
to 2018, which further verifies the regression results.

5.4 Summary of findings
In the analysis, I first examined the relationship between pre-recessionary R&D intensity
and firm performance during the recession of 2008-2009. Using a regression model with
several control variables for the asset-, country- and industry-specific effects, the results
showed a significant relationship between pre-recessionary R&D intensity and firm
performance during the recessionary time period. This effect was positive for Tobin’s q,
whilst it was negative for the measures of firm profitability and sales growth. Therefore,
there was support for both H1a and H1b.
Following these results, I analysed whether R&D intensity during the recession could
affect firm performance post-recession. Both R&D intensity during 2008 and 2009 were
measured separately, providing varying results throughout the time period of 2010-2018.
Firstly, R&D intensity in 2008 showed a negative and significant effect on the EBITDA
margin in 2013 and 2014. No other variables showed a statistically significant effect on
this R&D intensity. Secondly, R&D intensity in 2009 showed a statistically significant,
positive effect on the following year’s Tobin’s q, similar to the pre-recession R&D
intensity to Tobin’s q during the recession. In addition to this, the R&D intensity of 2009
also showed a negative effect on ROA in 2011 and EBITDA margin in 2014. The latter
of these two measures of firm performance was the sole variable and year with a similar,
statistically significant, and negative relationship to the R&D intensities during the
recession. For this reason, as there was no consistency or trend in the effect recessionary
R&D intensity has on later firm performance, H2a and H2b can only be partially accepted.
There are indications of a relationship between these variables, but persistent effects
throughout the time period cannot be found.
To test this from another aspect, I grouped the firms into two groups based on their R&D
activities during the recession; those that increased their R&D intensity both years
compared to the pre-recession R&D intensity, and those that did not. This time the
explanatory power of the regression model barely increased, often even decreased,
indicating that this dummy variable grouping these firms would not affect the firm
performance indicators, Accordingly, the only variable to show an effect was ROA in
2015, showing a negative effect, albeit on a 10% significance level. Based on these
results, there was no support at all for Hypothesis 3 during this time period of the study.

83

Axel Koukkula
In order to validate these results further, I chose to run a non-parametric Mann-WhitneyWilcoxon test, grouping these firms with the same dummy variable used in the regression
model above. Among all the firm performance indicators from 2010 to 2018, only Tobin’s
q showed a significant difference between the two firm groups. This difference only
applied for 2017 (p = 0.053) and 2018 (p = 0.041), were those that increased their R&D
intensity during the recession, in fact, showed lower Tobin’s q values during in 2017 and
2018 than those that did not increase their R&D intensity.
Regarding the control variables used in the regression models, both the dummy variables
controlling for industry and country, as well as the individual measures of other firm ratios
showed significant effects on the firm performance indicators. While in many cases the
non-dummy variables showed no significance on firm performance, the industry-specific
dummy variables had indeed significant effects on the performance indicators; thus,
leading into relatively high explanatory power for the model.
Liquidity was negatively related to both ROA and the EBITDA margin during the
recessionary years of 2008 and 2009. In the post-recessionary period, liquidity was only
significantly affecting ROA in 2017, while the EBITDA margin was unaffected during
this time period. Sales growth and Tobin’s q were totally unaffected by the firm liquidity
level during the whole time period.
Debt ratio did not have an effect on firm performance during the first year of the recession,
but a significantly negative effect on ROA and EBITDA margin in 2009. This negative
relation on EBITDA margin continued for 2010-2012, with an increasing negative
coefficient during the post-recessionary period. The negative effect of increased debt
affected ROA only triennially, in 2011, 2014 and 2017. While leverage had no statistical
significance on sales growth during the recession, it showed a significant and negative
effect in 2014. Tobin’s q showed no significant relationship to the debt ratio in the study.
The fixed assets ratio appeared to have a weakly significant, positive effect on ROA in
2009 and the EBITDA margin in 2008. This positive effect on ROA only appeared in
2018 during the post-recessionary period. It was also evident for the EBITDA margin in
2014, 2016, and 2018, albeit with a decreasing positive coefficient. Interestingly, the
fixed assets ratio had a significant and negative effect on sales growth in 2015 – the sole

84

Axel Koukkula
year during the whole studied time period. Tobin’s q showed no significant relationship
to the fixed assets ratio during the time period studied.
Firm size depicted a positive effect on ROA in 2009 and EBITDA margin 2008 and 2009,
indicating that larger companies could upkeep profitability better during the recession
than their smaller rivals. This positive effect on ROA continued in the post-recessionary
time period as well, with the only exceptions being 2016 and 2017 without significant
effects. EBITDA margin had the same positive relationship to firm size throughout most
of the post-recession time period, omitting the missing statistical significance in 20112012 and 2017. Firm size affected sales growth only in 2015, showing a significant and
negative relationship between the variables. Lastly, Tobin’s q was once again missing a
statistical significance to the control variable during the whole time period.
Firm age proved not to affect firm performance to such an extent that was expected, as
the variable showed significance only on two occasions. Firstly, it showed a minimal
negative effect on the EBITDA margin in 2008. Secondly, it had a positive and significant
effect on ROA in 2014, albeit in neither case on a 5% significance level. Despite this, it
was motivated to include the firm age in the regressions, as it increased the explanatory
power in all of the models.

6 DISCUSSION
The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the analysis results from the previous chapter
while reflecting on the strategic and financial theory presented in unison with prior
research. Secondly, I will review the theoretical implications of my findings and their
relevance to future studies. This chapter will lastly outline the limitations and weaknesses
of this study, discussing the implications of these choices.

6.1

Discussion of analysis results

This section discusses the results from the quantitative analyses, as well as it contemplates
the used variables and the quantitative model itself. First, the implications of the chosen
focus variable are deliberated. Then, the focus shifts towards the different time periods in
the study, discussing the possible firm dynamics that resulted in these findings. Finally,
the quantitative model and chosen actions related to it are scrutinised.

6.1.1

Linking R&D activities and firm performance

Evaluating the used proxy for R&D activities of the firm, the R&D intensity is based
purely on accounting figures, indicating often higher costs for the firm when R&D
intensity is increased, unless there has been a decrease in the denominator that is either
total sales or assets. As the sales figure proved itself to be more volatile due to the demand
shock caused by the recession, it was only used when measuring pre-recessionary R&D
intensity in relation to firm performance during the recession. However, the very nature
of this proxy, indicating higher costs for the firm at higher levels of R&D intensity, may
be the very reason for the mainly negative relationship to firm performance, as stated in
the results chapter.
Furthermore, it can be speculated if this very aspect of measuring R&D as merely a cost
for the firm, could result in a short-term effect on the accounting-based measures of firm
performance. Sustained or time-lagged effects of the R&D intensity of a single year,
however, could be argued to indicate more asset-specific effects of R&D activities, rather
than seeing the variable as simply an increased cost for the firm. Yet, this also opens up
the possibility that the R&D intensity of one year is nearly identical to the year that
demonstrates a significant effect on firm performance, as firms often smooth their R&D
86

Axel Koukkula
costs over time (Coad & Rao-Nicholson, 2010). This would imply the possibility of
multicollinearity issues between the R&D intensities of these years, and therefore, result
in a falsely significant effect on firm performance for the latter year. While this certainly
is a possibility that cannot be excluded when discussing the findings of this thesis, I
attempt to offer other explanations for these significant results based on the theories and
prior research presented.
Pre-recessionary R&D and recessionary performance
Described in the summarisation of the findings, there was support for the first hypothesis
regarding a relationship between the R&D activities before the recession and the firm
performance during the recession. This relationship was found to be negative for the pastoriented measures on sales growth and profitability, whilst the market-related and
forward-looking Tobin’s q exhibited a positive relationship to increased R&D intensity.
Higher pre-recession R&D intensity, in relation to sales, indeed led to worse ROA during
the recession, resulting in similar findings as Latham and Braun (2008) found in the
United States. Their findings imply that these firms also recover faster from the economic
shock, which is also indicated by the regression results in this thesis where R&D intensity
2007 had a positive relationship to ROA in 2009, albeit the result proved to be
insignificant. This opposes the other results that I found when R&D intensity was
measured in relation to total assets – demonstrating a negative relationship to ROA
throughout the whole time period. Admittedly, the sample that Latham & Braun (2008)
used consisted of a quintuple amount of firms from a single industry, making their results
more robust than the smaller sample used in this thesis.
As to why higher R&D intensity pre-recession led into worse firm performance during
the recession, there are a few possible aspects to consider for. First, whereas firms commit
themselves in investing into projects, there are often projections made of estimated future
earnings of these projects – a positive NPV leading into profitable investment
opportunities, whereas those projects with a negative NPV are not worth pursuing for, as
they would result in a net loss for the company to invest in. These pre-recessionary R&D
projects may be estimated with such future earnings projections that do not account for a
sudden economic shock, leading unexpectedly to unprofitable projects. This, in turn,
would cause underperformance during the recession. For this assumption to be plausible,
although, a nearly imminent, following-year effect should exist for the relationship
87

Axel Koukkula
between R&D intensity and firm performance. With findings that indicate the existence
of such effect, it certainly is plausible, although, not certain without further analysis.
The second possible explanation for this negative relationship would stem from the prerecessionary firm characteristics that Knudsen (2019) mentions in his paper. He finds that
firms with high pre-recession sales growth are hit harder than those that exhibit lower
growth, arguing that the firm may have attracted a high share of marginal customers
during the preceding economic boom, which are then lost as the economic shock occurs.
These customers may have participated in the market at a late stage of the economic
expansion, possibly due to highly cyclical products or services, or alternatively, due to a
new, innovative product or service that the firm has introduced to the market (Knudsen,
2019). Unfortunately, to account for pre-recessionary sales growth would require
accounting data two years before the recession, as opposed to the one year available in
this dataset.
A third, possible explanation for this negative relationship may derive from the high
adjustment costs of R&D that were discussed in the theory chapter. As Coad and Rao
(2010) found in their paper, firms tend to smooth out their R&D costs over time to
minimise fluctuations or interruptions in the process. This tendency of firms to shield
their R&D investments was also reported by Knudsen and Lien (2019), indicating that
firms may rather turn towards using external financing during an economic shock than
make cuts to their R&D processes. This, in turn, may lead to a worse firm performance
at the hand of two effects separately, or in the worst case, through the combination of
both effects. First, firms may suffer from debt overhang problems, where the firms that
already have high levels of leverage, may have issues attempting to acquire even more
debt. Second, if these firms that seek external financing have inadequate collateral for
debtors, the usage of R&D projects as collateral would indicate a riskier alternative for
banks, as the projects are often highly firm-specific and the salvage value for these
projects may be zero. It is shown in Table 5.5 that increasing R&D intensity is negatively
correlated to the ratio of fixed assets, which banks regularly accept as collateral. Both
effects, in turn, may lead to higher interest rates for the firm, which would negatively
impact firm performance. However, this can be expected to mostly affect performance
measures relating to the bottom line, such as ROA, as the EBITDA margin excludes
interest costs when calculated.
88

Axel Koukkula
R&D during recession and later firm performance
Having discovered a negative relationship between the R&D intensity pre-recession and
recessionary firm performance, the focus now shifts toward the recessionary R&D
activities of the firm, and how these relate to firm performance post-recession. Rather
than demonstrating superior firm performance post-recession as reported by Latham and
Braun (2008), higher R&D intensity is found to lead to inferior post-recessionary
performance regarding profitability. These results match the findings of Ratvik and
Svergja (2016) from the Norwegian market during the same period, however, though only
spanning to 2012.
Similar to the previous regression, R&D intensity shows a significant and positive
relationship to Tobin’s q of the following year. Unlike the previous results, none of the
other performance indicators exhibit similar following-year effects, as they did during the
recession. Instead, ROA demonstrates a two-year lag similar to the previously reported
lag by Lome et al. (2016), and even more surprising, the EBITDA margin demonstrates
a time-lagged negative effect of up to six years. Also, rather unexpectedly, sales growth
does not indicate any significant effects for this whole post-recessionary period.
This similarity in the negative relationship between R&D and firm profitability as in the
previous regression begs to question the direction of the relationship between these
variables. Do those firms that exhibit worse firm profitability partake in higher levels of
R&D activities, or do R&D-intense firms, simply perform worse than their competitors?
The process of research and development is complex, with anticipations of improvement
in the competitive advantages of the firm in the form of either knowledge or tangible
products, albeit there is no guarantee that the output is fruitful for the firm. There is neither
any certainty that these R&D-intense firms are actually good at research and
development, whereas the firms may, in fact, be forced to innovate.
Ratvik and Svergja (2016) suggest that this pressure to innovate might result from both
general market pressure from rivalling firms, as well as from investors. This pressure to
innovate might result in firms partaking in these research and development activities only
in order to fulfil these expectations, rather than being a result of a systematic innovation
strategy of the company. Listed firms that perform poorly might be especially prone to
this kind of pressure – as investors expect the firm to improve their performance through
new product offerings, services, or the organisation as a whole. This explanation certainly
89

Axel Koukkula
seems plausible, as an increase in the R&D intensity of the firm resulted in a significant
positive effect on Tobin’s q in the following year, suggesting that the market appreciates
firms partaking in the research and development activities. Furthermore, as this effect was
visible both regarding pre-recessionary R&D and recessionary Tobin’s q, as well as for
recessionary R&D and post-recessionary Tobin’s q, there are indications that this
relationship may exist throughout the business cycle.
Examining the overview of these findings from the second regression model, however,
result in more questions than answers. Granted, there are significant relationships
between the R&D intensity during the two years of recession and post-recessionary firm
performance, albeit the inconsistency of the significances and the lack of a noticeable
trend in these relationships appears enigmatic. Having accounted for both country- and
industry-specific effects through the use of dummy variables, there may exist specific
year effects that could not be accounted for, requiring further investigation into.
Nevertheless, having found support for the first two hypotheses, the findings from the
third regression model oppositely found no support for the third hypothesis. The chosen
dummy variable for measuring the increase or decrease in R&D intensity during the
recession proved itself to be a lacklustre fit, as the explanatory power of the model stayed
unchanged or in some cases, even decreased. Investigating into this, there are a few
possibilities for these insignificant results.
First, there is naturally the concern of using this highly simplified dummy variable as a
proxy for measuring whether the R&D activities of the firm increased or decreased during
the recession. Even a minuscule increase in the firm’s R&D intensity for both 2008 and
2009 would result in the firm being in the group that was theorised to adopt a
countercyclical strategy (Knudsen & Lien, 2019), opposed to those firms that would have
to decrease their R&D activities due to the recessionary shock. Firms could have been
included in this “superior” group merely due to having a low R&D intensity in the single
pre-recessionary year 2007 compared to their normal R&D intensity, or alternatively, by
only keeping the same R&D intensity as in 2007, but having a decrease in their total
assets. Such small changes could distort the intended composition of the firms included
in the group, and thereby, affect significantly the regression results.

90

Axel Koukkula
The second possible cause for the insignificant results is also related to the adopted
variable for R&D, relating to the previously discussed weaknesses in using a purely costbased proxy for such a complex process as research and development. It would be a naïve
assumption to expect higher levels of R&D intensity translating simply into better firm
performance, rather than assuming that not all R&D is born equal. It is very much related
to being able to keep the customer focus as the primary driver for new, innovative
products and services, in order to be able to link these activities into possibly superior
firm performance. Still, there is also the knowledge developing capability of R&D,
resulting in R&D activities, in general, being able to develop unique, rare, immobile, and
inimitable resources for the firm – characteristics that are likely to result in improved firm
performance, according to Lome et al. (2016). Whether R&D intensity, as a measure of
costs for the firm, is an appropriate representation of this highly complex process, is
debatable.
Third, there is also the possibility of the insignificant findings being a result of the chosen
time period, geographical area, or firm sample for the study. As this study only covers the
recession of 2008 to 2009, analysing a different time period might result in opposite
results. Similarly, markets in Norway and Finland might share similar, underlying effects
that cause insignificant results. Lastly, it might also be purely due to the chosen small
firm sample, resulting in a similar trend of insignificance specifically for these 90 listed
firms. These possibilities cannot be confirmed or denied unless replicated studies are
performed with variations regarding the period of the study, geographical coverage, or
the firm sample.
Interestingly, while the third regression model failed to provide statistically significant
results regarding differences in later firm performance among the firms that increased
their R&D intensity during the recession, and those that did not, the Mann-WhitneyWilcoxon test succeeded in this. The statistically significant results applied merely on
Tobin’s q for 2017 and 2018. This result had another even more interesting aspect than
only the fact that it provided different results regarding the significance than the
regression analysis. Surprisingly, those that increased their R&D intensity during the
recession actually exhibited lower Tobin’s q values than the firms that acted oppositely
during the recession. In all of the regression models, the R&D intensity demonstrated a
positive relationship to Tobin’s q, while the MWW-test suggests an opposite relationship
91

Axel Koukkula
between the two variables. However, I believe there exists a logical explanation for the
difference in the test results.
This stems from Tobin’s q being an indicator of the anticipated growth opportunities of
the firm (Chappell & Cheng, 1982), in addition to Tobin’s q being a suitable measure
studying whether investors acknowledge the research and development activities of the
firm, despite often only a minor part of the expenses are actually being capitalised
annually. For firms that display a high Tobin’s q, the former function of the ratio would
translate into high expected growth opportunities – a characteristic that could be linked
to smaller, younger firms that are not as established on the market as their counterparts.
Reflecting back on the theory, recessions cause financial constraints and demand shocks
for firms; thus, the R&D activities are severely dependent on the internal financing
capabilities of the firm (Knudsen & Lien, 2014). This accentuated positive correlation
between liquidity and the R&D activities would imply that in order for firms to being able
to increase their R&D intensity during a recession, they should demonstrate financial
stability to some degree as well as have excess capacity in terms of personnel – a feat that
could be described being possible for larger and more stable, incumbent firms. This, in
turn, would explain the results from the MWW-test, as larger incumbent firms might hold
lower Tobin’s q values than their smaller counterparts that might have higher anticipated
growth opportunities priced in their market valuation. This theory does not, however,
explain why this difference in Tobin’s q was significant only for the years 2017 and 2018.

6.1.2

Quantitative model and used variables

As with any quantitative model measuring firm performance, it is impossible to entirely
eliminate the different aspects that affect how firms perform. While this study managed
to capture some of the inference through the abundant usage of control variables, it did
not manage to acquire as significant effects between these variables as related studies (cf.
Ratvik & Svergja, 2016). Nevertheless, this may stem from using a comparatively small
sample with the addition of several significant industry-level effects that the industry
dummies succeeded to capture. The model can still be considered relatively successful,
as by eliminating these inferences caused by industry- and asset-specific effects the focus
variables were found to demonstrate significant effects on the dependent variables while
showing satisfactory levels of explanatory power.

92

Axel Koukkula
As an exception, the quantitative model exhibits a generally low explanatory power when
measuring sales growth, indicating a lack of fit for measuring this variable of firm
performance with the chosen focus variable and control variables. The sole years that
demonstrate significant regressions were 2008, 2015, and 2016, whereas the remaining
years fail to do so. This would, in turn, indicate specific year-effects for these three years
that show significance, whilst the remaining years show a more accurate picture of the
general fit of this model. Admittedly, there are some improvements that could be done to
correct this in future studies. One such example could be including control variables that
account for eventual inorganic growth, resulting from firm activities within mergers
and/or acquisitions, which may impact sales growth considerably when measuring on an
annual basis.
Lastly, as the dataset as a whole exhibited heteroscedasticity, there was the alternative of
either transforming the data further or to use heteroscedastic-consistent standard errors.
Due to the nature of the data, a transformation was not a viable option, as it included
many negative coefficients, so the latter option was chosen instead, to reach valid
regression results by using the HC3 estimator. The HC3 estimator, however, while
correcting for heteroscedasticity in the standard errors, may result in more conservative
results regarding the statistical significance of the tests (Brown, 2014; Cattaneo, Jansson,
& Newey, 2018). Rather than this being a problem, it further increases the reliability of
the results of this study.

6.2 Theoretical implications and outlook for future studies
This study, due to its multidisciplinary approach, offers a multitude of abundant
possibilities for future research both within the aspects of firm performance, as well as
into the strategical choices of firms that are done during specific time periods. It can also
be known as the first study measuring the firm performance impact of the R&D activities
of Finnish public companies during recessions, as well as the first known study to
combine Norwegian and Finnish data when analysing the R&D activities of public
companies.
Findings in this thesis add to the scarce collection of prior research that opposes the
general, positive relationship between innovation and firm performance (Latham &
Braun, 2008; Ratvik & Svergja, 2016). The probable key aspects here are the differences
93

Axel Koukkula
in how innovation and R&D are measured, resulting in varying findings regarding this
relationship between R&D and firm performance. Nevertheless, by adopting a multitude
of various measures for R&D and innovation in diverse contexts, it can be argued to lead
to better insight into the specifics when compiling these studies into a greater assembly.
Therefore, rather than resulting in definitive answers regarding this relationship between
firm performance and the R&D activities during recessions, this study opens the door for
additional aspects for future studies to research into.
One such aspect is replicating this study, but rather than applying solely quantitative
measures on firm innovation, use a combination of both qualitative and quantitative data.
Having a deeper knowledge of the firms’ actions during recessions through the usage of,
for instance, survey data with ranking questions on the recessionary impact on firm
operations. This data could further be applied in unison with patent data, offering insight
into the actual output of the R&D activities of the firms. Applying qualitative measures
may enable more diverse grouping of the firms and offer as such deeper knowledge in the
exact drivers behind how R&D activities impact different measures of firm performance,
given that the firm sample is abundant enough for robust results.
If one still chooses to pursue this question from a purely quantitative aspect, it could be
of interest to differentiate between the capitalised development and the expensed research
costs and determine which of these two cost types act as the driver on firm performance.
As the criteria for capitalising development costs are strict, requiring the output to be able
to generate future economic benefit, the relationship between the capitalised costs and
future firm performance should in theory be positive – opposed to the negative
relationship found in this thesis. Similarly, the expensed research costs found on the
income statement should exhibit a negative relationship to firm performance, as measures
of firm performance often relate to the bottom-line of the income statement. Whether
these assumptions prove to be true, is left for future research to explore.
Furthermore, when comparing this thesis to prior research related to recessions, it can be
seen as a relatively long study covering a time period of 11 years, whereas many related
studies cover shorter timespans. This longer time period provided the means to examine
whether R&D activities had longstanding effects on firm performance, as prior research
has found time-lags of approximately two years (Lome, Heggeseth, & Moen, 2016; Pakes
& Schankerman, 1984). Lagged effects of up to six years between the variables could be
94

Axel Koukkula
identified, albeit, with a lack of unison or trend in the results as a few, seemingly random
years showed significant effects. Therefore, there are indications of many interesting
year-specific effects that could be studied further, as these were not accounted for during
the post-recessionary time period in this thesis.
Lastly, amidst the current disarray in the business sector that is caused by the impact of
the novel coronavirus, there has grown concerns among nations how to prevent the
seemingly unavoidable wave of bankruptcies, as firms have been hit by an unprecedented
demand and supply chain shock. This has led governments to choose varying approaches
to support the funding of these firms, in the hope to prevent bankruptcies of otherwise
financially healthy companies. One example of such funding is the Funding for Business
Development in Disruptive Circumstances that Business Finland offers to Finnish midcap companies and SMEs that fulfil certain firm size criteria. This maximum funding of
100 000€ is aimed to support the product development processes of these firms during
the crisis (Business Finland, 2020). As previously discussed, there is no guarantee that
the research and development processes of the firm are fruitful and successful, leading
automatically to improved firm performance. This is especially noteworthy in a situation
like the current one, where firms are seemingly forced to innovate, in order to be eligible
for financing. Therefore, it can be disputed if this is the most effective use of financial
support for companies that suffer from a market and supply chain shock? If, and how this
financing actually supported the firms over this crisis of as yet unknown duration, is
something that future research may find intriguing investigating further into.

6.3 Limitations of the study
Even though the analysis found a significant relationship between prior R&D activities
and later firm performance, there are still some concerns regarding the limiting choices
made in the study. First, the research and development activities of the firm were
measured as a proxy through accounting figures of expensed and capitalised spending, in
relation to total assets. This simplified viewpoint on a complex intangible asset, without
differentiation between the different types of firms’ innovation activities, treats all R&D
activities as the same. Access to alternative data, in the form of patents would although
have been expensive and this proxy for R&D had been used in earlier research, and thus,
chosen for this study as well. Furthermore, as the measurement of R&D intensity
95

Axel Koukkula
combined both capitalised and expensed R&D spending, separating these two for the
analysis might result in differing results.
The second issue concerns using a single year as the measurement of pre-recessionary
firm activities. Including a three-year period or even a five-year period before the
recession could ensure a higher validity on the accuracy of a firm’s activities, instead of
a single-year snapshot. This cut-off was still necessary, as accounting data for earlier
years were unavailable for many firms in the sample from the sources available to the
author.
The final concern is the selection issue for the sample, as including only public companies
in the study led to relatively small sample size. Examining private firms as a control group
in comparison to public companies could have offered greater insight into the strategic
choices of these companies. Regrettably, due to the earlier mentioned data availability
this was not possible to conduct in a desirable manner. Also, because of time limitations
and the intense labour that was required to manually gather the data, this led to the
exclusion of the initially included public companies in Sweden and Denmark.

7 CONCLUSION
The purpose of this thesis was to analyse whether differences in firms’ research and
development (R&D) activities could explain differences in firm performance, from the
viewpoint of strategic actions that are done during recessionary periods. It also briefly
presented the accounting dilemma regarding R&D treatment and studies that have shown
support for changes to be made to it. The three developed hypotheses were to test how
R&D intensity affects firm performance during the recession and after the recession. The
analysis of firm performance, measured as sales growth, profitability, and market
valuation, was done in unison with several other explanatory control variables that are
known to affect firm performance. The empirical analyses were executed using panel
data.
The empirical findings of this thesis suggest a significant relationship between firms’ prerecessionary R&D intensity and firm performance during the recession. This relationship
was negative for measures of profitability and sales growth, whilst it was positive for
market valuation. Interestingly, R&D intensity in relation to total assets showed a
significant effect only on Tobin’s q and sales growth, while R&D intensity to sales had a
significant, negative effect on ROA and the EBITDA margin. These results still support
some of the previous empirical findings where R&D and innovation are negatively linked
to firm performance, although the adopted measure for R&D varies among the studies.
Continuing this, it was of interest to examine if R&D intensity during the recession could
affect firm performance later, as previous studies have found approximately a two-year
lag before an effect was identified. Indeed, while the following year effect was found for
Tobin’s q, ROA exhibited a two-year lag on R&D intensity in 2009 and the EBITDA
margin exhibited a four- and five-year lag after the recessionary R&D intensity. Increased
R&D intensity had yet again a negative relationship to the profitability ratios and a
positive relationship to Tobin’s q. Nevertheless, while these results were not consistent
and did not exhibit a trend throughout the post-recessionary period, there are indications
of a relationship between recessionary R&D activities and later firm performance.
As recessionary R&D intensity proved to affect later firm performance, differences in
firms’ R&D activities may explain later firm performance differences. Examining this,
although, proved to offer insignificant results. While there are theoretical implications
97

Axel Koukkula
that involuntarily budget cuts in research and development activities may result in longlasting, negative effects for the firm, measuring this through quantitative, accounting data
turned out to be unsuccessful. This corroborates the need for alternative measures of R&D
activities in future studies, to pursue this research question further. Examples of these
measures could be in the form of qualitative survey data on firms’ innovation activities,
or alternatively by including data on firm-specific registered patents.
Even though R&D intensity calculated with accounting data is a highly simplified
measurement of such a complex, elusive process, this thesis achieves to find it to be linked
with future firm performance. The negative relationship was still quite surprising, as the
innovation process of firms is generally seen from a value-building, positive aspect. Yet,
as also seen in Nokia’s case, a high R&D intensity does not automatically translate into a
positive impact on firm performance, if the customer focus is lost. It is therefore of utmost
importance to view the impact of firms’ strategical choices on firm performance from a
broader point of view, encouraging future multidisciplinary studies.
Despite its limitations, this thesis offers fertile ground for future research on the strategic
choices of firms during periods of recession and these actions’ implications on firm
performance. This is especially relevant, as the world is facing a seemingly unavoidable
global recession as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. On the one hand, this pandemic
might result in an unprecedented technological leap, where innovative and adaptable
firms can build themselves sustained competitive advantages. On the other hand,
fundamental changes in consumer behaviour may be imminent, forcing firms to adapt
accordingly in their strategic choices or risk their very existence in the future.

8 SUMMARY IN SWEDISH
FoU-aktiviteter under recessioner: implikationer på nordisk företagsprestanda
Vad orsakar skillnaderna i hur företag presterar i relation till varandra och varför presterar
vissa företag bättre än andra över en längre tidsperiod? Förståelsen för hur man skapar
hållbara, långsiktiga konkurrensfördelar har varit en av de centrala frågeställningarna
inom strategiforskning (Levinthal, 1995). Strategilitteraturen på 1980-talet fokuserade på
de externa faktorer som påverkar företagsprestanda – resulterande i bland annat en av de
mest kända modeller inom strategin, Porters femkraftsmodell (Porter M. E., 1985). Detta
fokus skiftade under 1990-talet mot interna faktorer och hur dessa kan utnyttjas för att
uppnå konkurrensfördelar.
RBV (Resource Based View) baserar sig på företagens heterogenitet, eftersom resurserna
och förmågan att nyttja dessa resurser varierar bland företag, vilket leder till skillnader i
hur företag presterar (Barney J. , 1991). För att resurser ska bidra till hållbara
konkurrensfördelar, anser Barney (1991; 1997) att de behöver vara värdefulla, unika,
inneha förmågan att motstå imitation samt inte kunna substitueras. Dessa karakteristika
är starkt kopplade till företagets immateriella tillgångar, eftersom dessa företagsspecifika
tillgångar ackumuleras internt och således antar en mer komplex, abstrakt form som är
svår för konkurrenter att imitera (Dierickx & Cool, 1989).
Forskning och utveckling (FoU) kan anses vara en av de centrala immateriella
tillgångarna för att skapa ekonomisk tillväxt och ökad konkurrenskraft (Chan A. L.-C.,
2012). FoU är en uttalat företagsspecifik tillgång eftersom den är nära bunden till
humankapitalet inom företaget och exempelvis kan skyddas mot imitation genom patent.
Trots att tidigare forskning bevisat ett positivt samband mellan innovativa aktiviteter och
företagsprestanda, finns det ingen garanti för att FoU-processen är framgångsrik och leder
till garanterad tillväxt i exempelvis försäljning för varje företag. Denna osäkerhet kring
FoU-processens slutprodukt samt dess företagsspecifika natur bidrar till att företag
föredrar att finansiera FoU-aktiviteter internt, eftersom extern finansiering skulle vara ett
dyrare alternativ (Czarnitzki & Hottenrott, 2011).
Redovisningen

av

FoU-aktiviteter

har

dock

bemötts

med

kritik,

eftersom

redovisningsstandarderna grundar sig på lätt föråldrade antaganden om hur dessa
aktiviteter saknar en påvisad koppling till förväntade framtida ekonomisk nytta (Lev B. ,
99

Axel Koukkula
2019). Under US GAAP är detta synsätt mera strikt än under IFRS – den förstnämnda
kostnadsför huvudparten av FoU-utgifterna, medan dessa kostnader inom IFRS kan
kapitaliseras under strikta kriterier. Som ett resultat av detta kritiska synsätt på hur FoUutgifter ska redovisas uteblir en del av det värde som FoU-aktiviteter skapar för företaget,
vilket i sin tur kan leda till en felprissättning av företagets aktier (Lev, Nissim, & Thomas,
2008; Sougiannis, 2015). För att bidra till helhetsbilden av de FoU-aktiviteter
sampelföretagen ägnar sig åt, inkluderar denna studie både aktiverade FoU-kostnader och
FoU-utgifter i kalkylerna för företagsspecifik FoU-intensitet.
Denna avhandling avser studera FoU-aktiviteter under ett specifikt tidsintervall i
konjunkturer,

nämligen

recessioner,

och

hur

dessa

aktiviteter

påverkar

företagsprestandan. Tidigare studier har visat att innovativa företag presterar bättre
(Knudsen, 2019; Lome, Heggeseth, & Moen, 2016) än sina motparter, medan vissa
studier har visat motsatta resultat (Giebel & Kraft, 2019; Ratvik & Svergja, 2016). På
grund av den tidigare nämnda tendensen att internt finansiera FoU-aktiviteter kan
recessionens kreditrestriktioner och negativa chock på efterfrågan leda till oönskade
nedskärningar i FoU-aktiviteter (Knudsen & Lien, 2014). Eftersom de tillgångar som
FoU-aktiviteter leder till ackumuleras internt över tid, kan nedskärningar i dessa orsaka
långvariga nackdelar i förhållande till konkurrenter som inte tvingas till motsvarande
åtgärder. I vissa fall kan företag anpassa en kontracyklisk investeringsstrategi, där
överskottskapacitet i personalen används för att stimulera investeringar i humankapital
(Knudsen & Lien, 2019).
För att koppla FoU-intensitet till hur företag presterar under och efter recessioner,
använder jag mig av fyra olika finansiella mått som representerar olika synsätt på
prestanda: tillväxt i försäljning (Sales Growth), effektivitet i att omvandla omsättning till
kassaflöde (EBITDA margin), lönsamhet i förhållande till de totala tillgångarna (Return
on Assets, ROA) och slutligen Tobins q som anger om marknaden över- eller
undervärderar dessa företag i förhållande till deras totala tillgångar.
Baserat på tidigare forskning finns det både positiva och negativa resultat gällande
sambandet mellan företagets prestanda och FoU-aktiviteter, när detta har studerats i
anslutning till recessioner. Däremot finns det inga studier som klargör ifall det finns ett
samband mellan företagets prestanda och FoU-aktiviteter när det gäller nordiska eller

100

Axel Koukkula
finska företag under recessioner. För att undersöka detta närmare, presenterar jag följande
forskningshypoteser:
H1. Det finns ett samband mellan företags FoU-aktiviteter före recessionen och
företagsprestanda under recessionen.
H2. Det finns ett samband mellan intensiteten av FoU under recessionen och senare
företagsprestanda.
H3. Det finns ett samband mellan ökad FoU-intensitet under recessionen och senare
företagsprestanda.
Alla dessa hypoteser har antingen ett positivt samband, H1a-3a, eller ett negativt
samband, H1b-3b.
Syftet med denna avhandling är således tudelat. För det första undersöker jag ifall företags
forsknings- och utvecklingsaktiviteter påverkar deras framtida prestanda, med hänsyn till
konjunkturer. För det andra analyserar jag om skillnader i dessa FoU-aktiviteter under
recessioner kan förklara senare skillnader i företagsprestanda. Tidsperioden som
avhandlingen behandlar sträcker sig från 2007 till 2018, där recessionen 2008–2009 ägnas
speciellt intresse. Studien begränsar sig till enbart finska och norska börsbolag.
Studien använder ett flertal olika källor för att samla in data eftersom jag inte hade tillgång
till mjukvaror så som Thomson Reuters Datastream. Paneldata om företagsbokslut
hämtades för de finska företagen delvis från databasen Voitto+ för tidsperioden 2007–
2018, och dessa finansiella data kompletterades och säkerställdes med varje företags
årsbokslut för samma tidsperiod. För de norska företagen i samplet användes enbart
årsbokslut för den finansiella informationen. I de flesta fall hämtade jag aktiepris för dessa
listade företag från årsboksluten, och i vissa fall då denna information saknades, från
Nasdaqs webbplats, Oslo Børs webbplats, Reuters och Yahoo Finance. Det ursprungliga
samplet bestod av 326 företag, varav 130 var finska och 196 norska företag.
För att ytterligare avgränsa urvalet utelämnade jag företag som inte rapporterade utgifter
för forskning och utveckling under recessionen 2008–2009, samt de företag som använde
sig av brutna räkenskapsår. Detta resulterade i ett slutligt urval på 90 företag, varav 64
var finska börslistade företag och 26 norska börslistade företag. Dessa företag fördelades
i 12 olika sektorer, baserat på företagens huvudsakliga näringsgren samt deras
101

Axel Koukkula
rapporterade ICB-koder (Industrial Classification Benchmark). De finansiella siffrorna
inflations- och valutajusterades för att för varje företag skapa ett urval som var jämförbart
på årsnivå. Utöver detta, raderades avvikande observationer med hjälp av vissa kvalitativt
bestämda gränser på nyckeltal i samband med att jag använde den statistiska metoden
Cook’s Distance.
De tre forskningshypoteserna som jag prövade genom att köra tre varianter av OLSregressioner, som grundar sig på samma grundmodell. De beroende variablerna i
regressionsmodellerna är de fyra finansiella måtten på företagsprestanda, medan den
oberoende variabeln i fokus är FoU-intensiteten som varierar beroende på modell. För att
ytterligare försäkra att fokusvariabeln inte påverkas av industrispecifika effekter eller
andra variabler som är kända för att påverka företagsprestanda, kommer kontrollvariabler
att användas för att fånga dessa effekters påverkan på regressionsmodellen. Modellerna
använder sig av robusta standardfel på grund av möjlig heteroskedasticitet i data. Utöver
dessa regressionsmodeller, kommer jag att använda Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW)
testet för att närmare granska hur de företag som ökar sina FoU-intensiteter under
recessionen skiljer sig i företagsprestanda senare i jämförelse med de företag som agerar
på motsatt vis.
De beroende variabler som inkluderas i regressionerna består av: Sales Growth som anger
omsättningen under innevarande året subtraherat och dividerat med fjolårets omsättning,
EBITDA-marginal som EBITDA dividerat med omsättningen, ROA som nettoresultat plus
räntekostnader och dividerat med totala tillgångar och Tobins q som marknadsvärdet av
eget kapital plus totala skulder och dividerat med totala tillgångar. Marknadsvärdet av
eget kapital anges som aktiepriset på bokslutsdagen multiplicerat med antalet uteliggande
aktier. Fokusvariabeln FoU-intensitet räknas ut genom att addera den kostnadsförda FoUutgiften med den kapitaliserade FoU-kostnaden, varefter denna summa dividerades med
antingen omsättningen eller de totala tillgångarna. I den tredje regressionsmodellen antar
fokusvariabeln formen av en dummyvariabel, där företag antar siffran 1 (ett) endast ifall
de ökar FoU-intensiteten både 2008 och 2009, i förhållande till 2007, och i andra fall
siffran 0 (noll).
Kontrollvariablerna som används i studien är: Firm Size som den naturliga logaritmen av
totala tillgångar eller omsättningen, Cash Ratio som kassa och bank dividerat med totala
tillgångarna, Debt Ratio som förhållandet mellan företagets totala skulder och dess totala
102

Axel Koukkula
tillgångar, Fixed Assets Ratio som materiella tillgångar dividerat med totala tillgångar
och slutligen, Firm Age som den naturliga logaritmen av företagets ålder år 2018.
Dessutom inkluderas två dummyvariabler, där den ena kontrollerar vilket land och den
andra vilken specifik industri som företaget tillhör.
Resultaten uppvisar ett signifikant samband mellan företagets FoU-intensitet före
recessionen och hur företaget presterar under recessionen. FoU-intensitet mätt i relation
till försäljning uppvisar ett negativt samband med EBITDA-marginalen och ROA, medan
FoU i förhållande till totala tillgångarna har ett negativt samband med följande års tillväxt
i försäljning och ett positivt samband med Tobins q. Därmed kan både H1a och H1b
accepteras.
Den andra regressionen finner även signifikanta samband mellan FoU-intensiteten under
två år av recession och senare företagsprestanda. FoU i förhållande till de totala
tillgångarna 2008 har en negativ effekt på EBITDA-marginalen 2013 och 2014. Samma
mått på FoU-intensitet för 2009 har negativ inverkan på ROA 2011 och EBITDAmarginalen 2014, samt ytterligare positiv inverkan på Tobins q 2010. Härmed kan även
H2a och H2b accepteras.
Baserat på tidigare forskning och befintlig teori finns det ett antal möjliga orsaker till att
detta negativa samband existerar mellan FoU-intensitet och företagsprestanda. För det
första har FoU-projekt som påbörjats före recessionen troligen använt sig av
lönsamhetsmått som inte beaktat sannolikheten för en ekonomisk kris. Detta har lett till
att tidigare lönsamma projekt har blivit olönsamma, vilket resulterade i en systematiskt
sämre företagsprestanda. För det andra kan detta negativa samband härledas från de höga
justeringskostnaderna för FoU och att företag tenderar skydda sina FoU-investeringar
under recessioner (Knudsen & Lien, 2019), och därmed leda till situationer där företag
finansierar sin FoU med externt kapital då de drabbas av en ekonomisk kris. Detta i sin
tur kan resultera i två separata effekter som kan försämra företagsprestandan. Om
företaget lider av skuldöverhäng (debt overhang) eller innehar otillräckliga fysiska
säkerheter för banklån, kan dessa orsaker försvåra företagets anskaffning av externt
kapital och troligen också leda till högre finansieringskostnader. Märkbart högre
finansieringskostnader skulle därmed leda till en försämrad företagsprestanda under
recessionen.

Axel Koukkula
Eftersom ett negativt samband infann sig mellan FoU-intensiteten under recessionen och
företagsprestanda upp till sex år senare, kan det anses vara väsentligt att ställa frågan:
presterar företag med högre FoU-intensitet sämre än sina motparter eller leder en högre
FoU-intensitet till en försämrad företagsprestanda? Då FoU-processerna är komplicerade
finns det inte heller någon garanti för att dessa FoU-intensiva företag verkligen är duktiga
inom FoU, utan de kan i själva verket vara tvingade till att begå forskning- och
utvecklingsaktiviteter. Ratvik och Svergja (2016) antyder att företag kan känna sig
pressade av investerare och konkurrenter att engagera sig i innovationsprojekt, vilket kan
leda till situationer där företag gör detta endast för att uppfylla dessa förväntningar, i
stället för att systematiskt skapa en innovationsstrategi för sig själva. Börslistade företag
som presterar dåligt kan vara särskilt känsliga för denna press, eftersom investerare har
höga förväntningar på att företaget ska skapa nya produkter, tjänster eller förnya
organisationen i sin helhet, och således åter öka sin företagsprestanda. Då Tobins q
uppvisade ett signifikant och positivt samband med ökad FoU-intensitet tidigare år, ger
detta ett intryck av att aktiemarknaden sannerligen värdesätter företagets FoU-aktiviteter.
Däremot uppvisar den tredje regressionsmodellen inga signifikanta samband mellan ökad
FoU-intensitet 2008–2009 och senare företagsprestanda. I motsats till de tidigare
regressionsmodellerna ökar förklaringsgraden i modellen minimalt eller till och med
sänks när fokusvariabeln inkluderas. Således kan inte nollhypotesen förkastas för H3. För
att ytterligare undersöka detta används MWW-testet där dummyvariabeln för ökad FoUintensitet grupperar företagen och analyserar de två gruppernas prestanda på senare tid.
MWW-testet finner endast signifikanta skillnader i de två gruppernas resultat för
variabeln Tobins q för 2017 (p = 0,053) och 2018 (p = 0,041), där de som ökade sin FoUintensitet under recessionen uppvisar lägre Tobins q för båda åren än den andra gruppen.
Avsaknaden av signifikanta resultat från den tredje regressionsmodellen härstammar
möjligen från svagheterna i dummyvariabeln. Minimala förändringar i företagets FoUintensitet, en lägre FoU-intensitet än normalt för året innan recessionen eller stabila FoUkostnader under recessionen med sänkta totala tillgångar, kan alla leda till att ett företag
blir felaktigt inkluderat i den grupp som i teorin skulle öka sin FoU-intensitet utöver det
normala under recessionen. Däremot kan det sannolikt finnas en logisk förklaring till de
statistiskt signifikanta resultaten från MWW-testet. Eftersom Tobins q även är en
indikator på företagets förväntade tillväxtmöjligheter (Chappell & Cheng, 1982) kan det
antas att ett högt värde antyder en hög förväntad tillväxt för företaget, om investerare är
104

Axel Koukkula
beredda att betala mera för företaget än vad balansvärdet är värt. Högre förväntad tillväxt
kan förknippas med yngre och mindre företag, medan större och äldre bolag antagligen
kan förväntas växa mindre. Då recessionen orsakar både kreditrestriktioner och en negativ
chock på efterfrågan, blir företag allt mer beroende av den interna finansieringen för att
kunna finansiera sina pågående investeringar inom bland annat forskning och utveckling.
Stora och äldre företag kan ytterligare antas ha bättre likviditet än sina yngre och mindre
motparter, som sannolikt investerar sitt kapital på ytterligare tillväxt. Därmed är det
tämligen logiskt att MWW-testet uppvisar resultat som indikerar att de företag som kunde
öka sina FoU-intensiteter under recessionen också uppvisar lägre Tobins q under perioden
efter recessionen. Detta antagande förklarar dock inte varför resultatet var signifikant
endast för 2017 och 2018.
Sammanfattningsvis är dessa resultat som indikerar ett negativt samband mellan
företagets FoU-intensitet och företagsprestanda ett tillägg till den forskning som bestrider
det generellt positiva synsättet på företagets forsknings- och utvecklingsaktiviteter. Trots
att jag inte kunde ge ett definitivt svar på hur företagets FoU-aktiviteter påverkar dess
prestanda, eller kunde påvisa om skillnader i dessa aktiviteter under recessionen kan
skapa hållbara konkurrensfördelar, erbjuder denna avhandling ett brett utbud av
möjligheter för framtida tvärvetenskaplig forskning.
