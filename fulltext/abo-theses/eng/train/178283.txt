Title: Implementing the General Data Protection Regulation — The experiences of
three Finnish organizations
Supervisor: Eija Karsten
Abstract:
This study investigates how three Finnish organizations have implemented the EU’s
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR was adopted by the
European Council in April 2016 and entered into force on May 25 th 2018. The
research topics of the study are GDPR implementation, guidance and compliance.
The study’s literature review comprises a review of central concepts of the study,
data protection legislation in Europe and in Finland, as well as a review of the
GDPR. The focus of the GDPR review lies on data protection measures targeting
data collecting and processing organizations. The GDPR itself and literature about
the implementation make up the most important sources for the literature review.
The multiple-case study research approach is used as the study’s research method.
The research design consists of three organizations, a Data Protection Officer
(DPO) and an employee informed of the GDPR were interviewed. Qualitative
interviews were used as a data collection method for the study. All in all, six
interviews were made. The findings of the study are presented in case descriptions.
The results of the study show that the organizations have taken similar measures
for implementing the GDPR. These are for example, the establishment of task
forces, DPO’s attending courses held by external experts and GDPR guidance for
employees. However, organizational actors influence the implementation of the
GDPR. The main factors found were the access to time and resources for data
protection activities and the organizational structure.

1 Introduction
This is a study about the European General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation
2016/679) and how three different Finnish organizations have implemented it. The
General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the Regulation and
the GDPR) regulates data protection in the European Union (EU). The Regulation was
adopted by the European Council in April 2016 and entered into force on May 25th
2018. The Regulation affects how organizations process and manage personal data,
as well as increase citizen rights and control over personal data. This study will
address the Regulation, the data protection measures it enforces on organizations
and the implementation of the Regulation in three Finnish organizations.

In the beginning of 2018, the Regulation was given great attention also by the average
citizen. As the enforcement date approached, millions of organizations and
companies sent e-mails to customers and clients informing them that their privacy
policy had been updated to be compliant with the Regulation. After the Regulation
entered into force, it occurred that websites run outside of the EU were temporarily
blocked for IP-addresses located in the EU. This occurred because the websites were
non-compliant with the Regulation and the website keepers did not want to risk
sanctions. Whether conscious of the Regulation or not, becoming affected by the
Regulation during the implementation time period was close to inevitable, especially
when using digital services.

An interest in the Regulation was sparked because of its magnitude, the demand it
puts on organizations and because of it being the most significant change in EU data
protection legislation in 20 years. Implementing the Regulation was not something
that data collecting organizations could avoid without the possible consequences of
sanctions and negative publicity. The threat of sanctions requires a certain vigilance
from organizations handling even the smallest sets of personal data. The Regulation
makes little difference between organizations, the clearest division between
organizations in the Regulation is defined by the number of employees and the
1

characteristics of the data processing. Also, small and medium-sized organizations
need to be aware of the Regulation and, in some cases, even to a great extent.

There is a vast amount of predictive research about the Regulation and research that,
from a legal perspective, criticizes the Regulation. Also, a fair amount of research
scrutinizing a specific principle of the Regulation and the Regulation’s impact on
privacy policies has published. There is little research about how organizations have
implemented the Regulation it in practice. Therefore, there is a motivation for this
study as it will contribute to the research arena of information and data security
management in organizations.

The purpose of this study is to explore how three different organizations in Finland
have implemented the Regulation through the following research questions:
RQ1) How did organizations prepare for the implementation of the Regulation?
RQ2) What kind of guidance is used for supporting compliance with the Regulation?
RQ3) How is compliance with the Regulation monitored?

The study begins by defining the concepts of personal data, data protection and by
reviewing data protection history. The study continues with a general introduction of
the Regulation, a summary of the Finnish adoption of the Regulation and a review of
the Regulation’s key definitions and elements. Then follows an explanation of six
important data protection measures for organizations enforced by the Regulation
and a review of the infringements and its effects for organizations. The
implementation of the Regulation is discussed through the aspects of planning,
responsibilities and guidance.

The methodology chapter contains a description of the research approach and the
research design as well as the data collection and data analysis. In this chapter the
trustworthiness of the study is also discussed. Subsequently, the findings are
presented, and the results of the research are discussed. Finally, the study’s
conclusions are presented followed by a summary of the research.

2

2 Personal Data and Data Protection
In this chapter two of the most relevant key concepts of this study will be defined and
presented. Understanding the characteristics of personal data and data protection is
fundamental for interpreting the Regulation and its provisions.

2.1 Personal Data

Personal data has become a valuable commodity both for the private sector and
public authorities (Lynskey, 2016). The quantity of personal data being processed
continues to increase exponentially. Kitchin (2014) categorizes data according to
form, structure, source, producer and type; these characteristics define how the data
can be handled and what it can be used for. One of the most common sources of
electronically and directly captured personal data is generated through forms used
when for example, making an order or partaking in a survey. What differentiates data
from personal data is that the latter can be used to identify an individual. In a legal
context, personal data is often referred to as any ‘personally identifiable information’
(Pangrazio & Selwyn, 2019).

Organizations and governments deal with varying amounts of personal data,
however almost all kinds of active organizations possess data that may be connected
to a person. For a small company, a set of personal data could consist of staff data
such as, contact details and bank details. Nevertheless, a small company’s staff
generated personal data fades in comparison to the sets of data social media
companies like Google or Facebook collect about their users and other persons.

Pangrazio and Selwyn (2019) highlight three of the most important types of personal
data: actively given data, extracted data and processed data.

3

2.1.1 Actively Given Data

The first type of personal data is actively given by individuals to devices and systems.
Social media and general personal information are good examples of personal data
which individuals feed into different systems whenever creating a virtual profile
(Pangrazio & Selwyn, 2019). The social media platforms’ datasets are multiplied when
individuals use already existing social media accounts to identify themselves on other
platforms instead of creating new ones. Facebook is known for letting their users log
in to other systems using their Facebook account. While it is convenient for the users,
Facebook collects detailed information about its users’ behavior by linking them to
external systems.

Although data is voluntarily generated, the average citizen might not be aware of the
scope of personal data collected through different online activities. This became
particularly visible in the Cambridge Analytical scandal connected to the 2016 USA
presidential elections. During the time of the election campaign, personal data
generated through a personality test on Facebook was processed in order to
influence voter behavior (Hsu, 2018). It is estimated that the personal data of around
87 million Facebook users was concerned in the scandal (Brown, 2020). In connection
to this privacy on social media became a heavily debated topic resulting in the
hashtag #deletefacebook trending on Twitter.

Another less extensive example is different kind of platforms used by institutions and
companies. For example, the national Finnish Transport and Communications Agency
Traficom’s contractual partner Ajovarma is a company in charge of theoretical tests
and driving examinations for different kinds of driving permits and licenses (AKatsastus, 2019). It is the only of its kind in Finland which in theory means that anyone
who gets a Finnish driver’s license must use Ajovarma’s platform. Ajovarma is a
company owned by A-Katsastus Group which is owned by the venture capital firm
MB Rahastot. A-Katsastus Group is the leading company for vehicle inspections,
registrations and driver’s examinations in Nothern Europe (A-Katsastus, 2019). This

4

leads to A-Katsastus Group possessing a vast amount of personal data of both Finnish
and other European citizens.

2.1.2 Extracted Data

The second type of personal data is extracted by systems or devices without the user
having to actively formulate the data (Pangrazio & Selwyn, 2019). GPS and Internet
based applications generally extract a vast amount of sensitive data (Lutz & Ranzini,
2017). These data sets may contain information about the user locations, personal
preferences, financial details etc.

Getting access to an application usually requires agreeing to the terms and conditions
of the application. In general, this implies agreeing to the application accessing
different personal data and depending on the application’s characteristics granting
access to camera, microphone and contact list may also be required. A user agreeing
to the terms and conditions of a service or product legally indicates that the data
extracted is owned by the service provider (Pangrazio & Selwyn, 2019).

The mobile and geolocation-based dating application Tinder is a good example of a
service that is based on extracting user data. For example, Tinder tracks the user’s
device information such as IP-address and device sensor information for monitoring
the mobile phone’s orientation and navigation (Tinder, 2018). The application
requires user consent to collect precise geolocation, the user’s geolocation can be
tracked even when Tinder is not running. One of the basic features of Tinder is
allowing the user to set the maximum geographical distance of potential matches.
Although Tinder’s (2018) privacy policy states that granting access to the GPS only
occurs with the consent of the user, the application cannot function properly without
the GPS.

Another mobile application with similar extraction of personal data is the fitness
application Sports Tracker. Sports Tracker is used for tracking the user’s physical
5

performance in connection to workouts. According to the application’s privacy policy
it also collects biometric and health data which may be recorded with monitoring
devices such as fingerprint readers and heart rate sensors paired with the application
(Sports Tracking Technologies, 2016).

2.1.3 Processed Data
The third type is processed personal data, the purpose of processing is to add
meaning and value to data entities (Pangrazio & Selwyn, 2019). In many cases the
person who is the source of the data, will only be given a fraction of the processed
data and have little exposure to the actual data processing steps. Instead, full data
sets may be sold to third parties that use the data sets for commercial purposes.

It is common that processed personal data is visualized by using dashboards and
simplified analytics. The Finnish Kesko Corporation offers its customers with a loyalty
card personalized discounts, an insight in their shopping history and analyzes based
on the collected data. The customers can, among other things, compare their
shopping records with other customers living in their area and track the proportion
of domestically produced goods purchased.

The loyalty card customers have the option of limiting the data collected on three
levels or completely deny the collection of any data (Markkinointi & Mainonta, 2016).
However, Kesko’s Chief Digital Officer, Anni Ronkainen stated in an interview that the
more the customer chooses to restrict the collection of data, the less the customer
will benefit from the reward system (Markkinointi & Mainonta, 2016). The data
processing can be interpreted as an additional service for the customers. Yet the
companies that control and own the data have the power to influence the consumers’
behavior (Kitchin, 2014).

6

2.2 Data Protection

According to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (1950) the
respect for private life is considered a basic human right making the protection of
personal data fall under the same article (Psychogiopoulou, 2017). However, there
are many paradoxes connected to personal data and the protection of privacy. The
collection, processing and use of personal data is ethically, politically, socially and
legally complex and it is difficult to draw a clear line between ‘good’ and ‘bad’
personal data (Kitchin, 2014). Especially on social media users seem to willingly give
away detailed data about themselves. This in turn complicates the control authorities
and governments can have over data protection (Lynskey, 2016).

Data is generated and used for many different purposes; companies, governmental
bodies and institutions use data for making businesses more profitable, protecting
societies and efficient decision making among other things. At the same time
collecting the data needed for the named causes might result in exploitation and
misuse of the single individual’s privacy. Lynskey (2016, p.1) goes as far as describing
modern society as being “…in the middle of a tug of war for control over personal
data.”. Kitchin (2014) describes how data in connection to purely scientific research
may be used to manipulate the citizens’ conception of reality.

2.2.1 European Data Protection Legislation – a historical overview

Data protection became a legally relevant topic when personal data and information,
at a larger scale, started to become subject to manipulation (Bennett, 1992). During
the late 60s people started to become more aware of the endangerment of their
individual rights and liberties (Bennett, 1992). In the mid 70s, British barrister Paul
Sieghart predicted that personal data increasingly will be disseminated through
various channels and that data generally will be easier to access (Bennett, 1992).
Sieghart also forecasted that fewer people will be aware of what is happening to the
data and that the data will be easier to tamper.
7

The development of policies for data protection became at an early stage subject to
international cooperation. The world’s first data protection act was approved in the
German federal state Hessen in 1974 (Freude & Freude, 2016; Lloyd, 2018). Five years
later the rest of Europe followed in Hessen’s footsteps and in 1981 the Council of
Europe signed the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to
Automatic Processing of Personal Data also known as Treaty No. 108 (1981), the
convention entered into force in 1985. The objective of the Convention is to protect
the individual’s right to privacy and regulate cross-border flow of personal data.

In 1995, the European Commission adopted the EU Data Protection Directive (DPD)
(Directive 95/46/EC) which set a minimum standard for data protection in the EU. All
27 EU member states implemented the directive in domestic legislation resulting in
slightly varying legislation across the EU. When the DPD was adopted in 1995, only
1% of the EU population was using the Internet (Lynskey, 2016). According to
Eurostat (2020) Internet access in the EU has since then steadily increased at a fast
pace. In 2018, Internet access had risen to 89% which is already 29% higher than in
20081. Since 1995, the increased access to Internet and the launch of web-based
companies such as Google and Amazon have radically changed the relevance of the
DPD which made an update of the EU data protection legislation inevitable. The data
protection reform package was introduced by the European Commission in January
2012 and included a Proposal for Data Protection Regulation (Lynskey, 2016).

3 The General Data Protection Regulation
In April 2016, the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation 2016/679) was
passed in the European Parliament. As of the 25th of May 2018, the Regulation
became directly binding for all EU member states, also organizations outside the EU
handling EU citizens’ personal data became affected by the Regulation. In principle,
this means that the Regulation can affect any organization in the world. Prior to
coming into force, the Regulation was promoted as a framework that would reshape
the European data protection and harmonize privacy legislation among EU Member
States in a more effective way than the DPD (Voss, 2012). The objective of the
Regulation is to make EU residents enjoy a higher level of protection of their rights,
privacy and freedoms while businesses enjoy reduced barriers for movement of data
in the EU (IT Governance Privacy Team, 2017). For personal data collecting
companies, the enforcement of the Regulation was expected to bring more
demanding legal requirements and a need for reallocating resources (Freiherr von
dem Bussche & Zeiter, 2016). The general presumption was that the Member States
with strict domestic data protection legislation would be required to put in less effort
for complying with the Regulation than Member States with rather lenient data
protection legislation.

The Regulation has received great attention, especially from personal data collecting
companies since penalties for non-compliance may result in significant fines and
damaged public relations (Hoofnagle, van der Sloot, Zuiderveen Borgesius, 2019).
Although the Regulation has been welcomed as a needed update for European data
protection legislation it has also been substantially criticized for its vagueness and
complexity (Bygrave, 2017; Davies, 2016; Hoofnagle, van der Sloot, & Borgesius,
2019).

In accordance with the standard for EU directives and regulations, the Regulation is
divided into two sections, the first section contains recitals and the second articles
(IT Governance Privacy Team, 2017). The recitals provide background and context to
9

the legislation. The 99 articles are divided into 11 chapters, the four latter ones
mostly concern the European Commission and supervisory authorities.

3.1 The Adoption of the Regulation in Finland

Before the Regulation became effective Finnish legislation had several Acts devoted
to protecting personal data. The Finnish Act on Protection of Privacy in Working Life
(759/2004) defines basic freedoms and rights, as well as ensures privacy in
professional life. In order to comply with the Regulation, many EU Member States
updated existing legislation. In Finland new legislation was passed. The Finnish Data
Protection Act (Act 1050/2018) implemented in 2019, complements and defines the
domestic adoption of the Regulation. The Finnish Data Protection Act is thus a
legislation that must be used in parallel with the Regulation. According to the Finnish
Data Protection Act (Act 1050/2018) 3§ Finland based data controllers and
processors must follow both the Regulation and the specifications set in the Finnish
Data Protection Act. Another result of the implementation of the Regulation in
Finland was the repletion of the Finnish Personal Data Act and the Act on the Data
Protection Board and Data Protection Ombudsman.

3.2 Key Definitions and Elements of the Regulation

Next, the most relevant concepts for the implementation and compliance of the
Regulation for organizations will be explained. The concepts have been selected
based on their occurrence and relevance in the literature. The Regulations complete
definitions can be found in Article 4 of the Regulation.

10

3.2.1 Personal Data

Personal data is any kind of information relating to an identifiable natural person,
also known as a data subject in the GDPR context. Westerlund (2018, p.53) defines
personal data in the light of the GDPR: “Personal data is characterised as only such
data that can be linked to a natural person (i.e. an individual’s physical presence).”
The Regulation’s definition of personal data comprises a considerably wider scope
than the traditional perception of personally identifiable information (Hoofnagle et
al, 2019). Within the Regulation, every piece of information that may identify a
person can be considered personal data. For example, IP-addresses, fingerprints, card
numbers, cookies and location data may, depending on the context, be legally
interpreted as personal data (Hoofnagle et al, 2019). Legal persons such as companies
are thereby excluded from the Regulation’s interpretation of personal data, the same
applies for deceased persons (IT Governance Privacy Team, 2017; Regulation
2016/679 Recital 27).

3.2.2 Data Controller

A controller is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body acting
as main decision-makers exercising control over the motives and means of processing
personal data (Regulation 2016/679). Examples of typical data controllers are public
authorities, businesses and NGOs. The controller determines and controls what data
to collect, from whom, how long the data will be kept, for what purpose and whether
there is a need to notify data subjects about the chain of events. Thereby, controllers
often act as the organization data subjects interact with and supply their information
to (IT Governance Privacy Team, 2017). Controllers must be able to prove compliance
with the Regulation. Their scope of compliance also includes data processors should
data processing services be procured. Controllers may be fined and sanctioned for
non-compliance.

11

3.2.3 Data Processor

A processor processes personal data on behalf of the controller. The processor is
usually a third-party actor hired by a controller organization to process the
controller’s data. A processor organization could for example be an accounting firm
processing pay slips on behalf of the controller organization (European Commission,
n.d.a). Although controllers are more accountable for managing data protection the
processor organization might still need to make decisions on how the data is stored,
what IT systems and methods to use for collecting the data among other things.
Nevertheless, often the controller and the processor are the same organization, it is
considered unusual that a controller would not handle any processing at all (IT
Governance Privacy Team, 2017).

3.2.4 Supervisory Authority

A supervisory authority is an independent public authority responsible for the
enforcement of the Regulation. In accordance with Article 51 of the Regulation each
EU member state must have at least one supervisory authority, Member States may
appoint several but must in that case designate one public authority to represent the
Member State in the European Data Protection Board (EBPD). In addition to
monitoring and enforcing compliance, the duties of supervisory authorities include
“promoting public awareness and understand the risks, rules, safeguards and rights
in relation to processing.” (Regulation 2016/679 Recital 122). A supervisory authority
is thereby required to act as a public preceptor and provide guidance to both data
collecting and processing organizations and to data subjects.

The supervisory authority’s powers can be divided into the following categories:
authorization and advisory, investigative and corrective (IT Governance Privacy
Team, 2017). A supervisory authority has the power to order controllers and
processors, carry out investigations in the form of data protection audits, review
12

certification requirements, notify organizations of alleged infringements of the
Regulation and require access to all personal data of controllers and processors if
needed for the fulfillment of their tasks (Regulation 2016/679 Article 58). A
supervisory authority can exercise its corrective powers and issue warnings,
reprimands and fines along with ordering controllers and processors to comply with
data subject requests. Supervisory authorities are encouraged by the Regulation to
develop standards and certification mechanisms facilitating compliance with the
Regulation.

In Finland, there is only one body acting as national supervisory authority, it is named
the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman. The office consists of one Head
Ombudsman, two Deputy Ombudsmen and around 40 data protection specialists
(Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman, n.d.d). The Data Protection Ombudsman
is appointed by the Finnish government for a five-year term of office.

3.2.5 Processing of Personal Data

The processing of personal data refers to any set of operations or activities, both
manual and automated, involving personal data. These are for example the
collection, structuring, storage, alteration, use and dissemination of personal data (IT
Governance Privacy Team, 2017). Less apparent examples of data processing include
everything from the planning of processing to the elimination of personal data (Office
of the Data Protection Ombudsman, n.d.f).

Processing personal data in compliance with the Regulation must be done in
accordance with six principles for data protection (IT Governance Privacy Team, 2017;
Regulation 2016/679 Article 5). The principles are: Lawfulness, fairness and
transparency; Purpose of limitation; Data minimization; Accuracy; Storage limitation;
Integrity and confidentiality. The controller is responsible for demonstrating
compliance with all six principles. The principles must be respected throughout the
entire data processing process (Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman, n.d.a).
13

Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency
The data subject must be clearly informed of the data processing taking place and the
processing’s characteristics. The actual processing must correlate with the
description and the processing must be motivated by at least one of the six lawful
purposes stated in the Regulation’s Article 6. The lawful bases for processing personal
data are the following:
a) Consent of the data subject
b) Processing motivated by a contractual term
c) The controller’s legal obligation
d) The protection of vital interests of data subject or of natural person
e) Processing carried out motivated by public interest or the exercise of a public
authority based on law or legal provisions
f) The legitimate interest of the controller or a third party
i.

For example, data processing for historical or statistical purposes

Each Member State may keep or introduce more detailed provisions if they are
legitimate within the Regulation’s scope.

Purpose of Limitation
The second principle is closely linked to the first one and specifies processing
limitations. The purpose of the data processing must be determined prior to the
commencement of processing, failing to do so will result in illegal data processing
although the processing purpose would be supported by the Regulation’s lawful
purposes for processing. Organizations need to specify and record the processing
purposes in addition to providing the information to potential data subjects in the
form of for example privacy policy documents, consent forms or terms and condition
documents (IT Governance Privacy Team, 2017). Thus, organizations must keep track
of the content of the privacy policy and make sure that the information is constantly

14

updated whenever the data collected will be used for other purposes than previously
mentioned.

Data Minimization
The purpose of the data minimization principle is to minimize organizations’ excess
data. Data minimization also implies regularly deleting unnecessary personal data. In
order to comply organizations must set up frameworks and processes that facilitate
the ability to provide sufficient proof of data minimization. An example illustrating
the data minimization principle can be an employer collecting detailed health
information from employees dealing with hazardous tasks in case of health
threatening accidents. Would the same employer collect the same kind of
information from employees with office jobs it would be classified as excessive
collection of personal data (Information Commissioner’s Office, 2019).

Accuracy
Collected personal data must be correct and accurate. Defect personal data must
immediately be corrected or deleted by the data controller. Faulty personal data may
have serious consequences especially in the health care sector; thus, this principle’s
importance vary according to the purpose of the data collection. Data subjects have
the right to rectification which implies that data can be corrected and erased upon
their request. Therefore, organizations must develop methods and systems enabling
data subjects the access to their personal data and if needed correct the possibility
to correct or request its deletion. Organizations are recommended to integrate such
schemes into regular processes (IT Governance Privacy Team, 2017).

Storage Limitation
Whenever collected personal data is no longer needed it needs to be deleted or go
through encryption without further notice. Pseudonymization may be used to detach
15

the data subject’s identity from the data and thereby ensure secure storage for inter
alia statistical, scientific and historical purposes. However, it is not a suitable method
for organizations that do not have sufficient resources for reversing
pseudonymization as it could be a required measure in for example investigations. In
connection with implementing the Regulation, many organizations found themselves
in situations where they had to destroy significant amounts of personal records
because of the storage limitation principle (IT Governance Privacy Team, 2017).

Integrity and Confidentiality
Personal data must be treated with integrity, confidentiality and security. Data
collecting organizations must protect data from any kind of corruption and from
getting in the wrong hands. Organizations must also have the ability to restore
personal data in case of accidents, such as fires or floods.

16

4 Data Protection Measures for Organizations Enforced by the
Regulation
The Regulation enforces several measures supporting adequate personal data
protection in organizations. In this chapter, some of the most significant
organizational measures enforced by the Regulation will be discussed.

4.1 Data Protection Officer

One of the most significant measures for organizations enforced by the Regulation is
the appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) (Regulation 2016/679 Article 37).
The appointment of a DPO is mandatory for processors and controllers whenever one
of the following statements are fulfilled:
a) Data processing is carried out by a public authority or body (courts are
excluded)
b) The organization’s core activities include data processing
c) The organization’s core activities consist of processing of sensitive data at a
large scale

Exactly under what circumstances and context an organization may exempt the DPO
criterion remains unclear (Freiherr von dem Bussche & Zeiter, 2016), the definition
of core activities may also vary between Member States (IT Governance Privacy
Team, 2017). Furthermore, the Regulation lacks a clear definition of ‘large scale’.
Controller and processor organizations may therefore not have a clear understanding
if the appointment of a DPO is required from them. However, an organization has the
possibility to voluntarily appoint a DPO, in that case the DPO will act under the same
requirements as if the designation had been required by the Regulation (IT
Governance Privacy Team, 2017).

17

A DPO does not have to be a person employed by the organization, the service of a
DPO might be purchased from a third-party service provider if there are no conflicts
of interest. The Regulation does not prohibit a DPO from fulfilling other
responsibilities unrelated to the role of the DPO. However, the Article 29 Data
Protection Working Party2 Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (2017) states that
a rule of thumb is to not give the role of a DPO to a person who has a position within
the senior management of an organization. For example, a CEO, CFO, Head of IT,
Head of Marketing or Head of Human Resources might have responsibilities
conflicting with the DPO role. Traditionally, data protection compliance duties have
by default been directed to IT superiors. According to the Regulation, however, this
is no longer an option.

The DPO tasks, responsibilities and relationships to other entities are outlined in the
Regulation’s Articles 37-39. The DPO’s role is to act as a contact person for data
subjects, internally in the organization and for the supervisory authority. The contact
details of the DPO must in accordance with Article 37 (7), be published and publicly
available for potential requests from data subjects. The DPO must be available for full
cooperation with the supervisory authority on a relatively short notice; the DPO has
no longer than one month to react to requests from the supervisory authority.

The expertise and skills required by a DPO are provided in the Regulation’s Article 37
(5), the DPO “…shall be designated on the basis of professional qualities and, in
particular, expert knowledge of data protection law and practices and the ability to
fulfil the tasks referred to in Article 39”. In the Working Party 29 Guidelines on DPOs,
the following duties connected to monitoring compliance are particularly highlighted
(Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, 2017 p.17):
•

“collect information to identify processing activities

•

analyse and check the compliance of processing activities

2

The Data Protection Working Party was an advisory board set up under Article 29 of the EU Data
Protection Directive 95/46/EC. Members of the Working Party comprised of Member State
representatives and was replaced by the European Data Protection Board in connection with the
application of the GDPR. https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/article-29-working-party_en

18

•

inform, advise and issue recommendations to the controller or the processor”

The level of expertise of a DPO is not strictly defined as such. Nonetheless, the more
extensive and sensitive data processing the organization does, the more important it
is to choose a DPO with sufficient expertise (Regulation 2016/679 Recital 97). Besides
understanding the basics of data protection, the DPO should also have knowledge of
national and European data protection laws and practices (Article 29 Data Protection
Working Party, 2017). In addition, the DPO gains from understanding the
organization’s practices, processes and the sector it operates in. The DPO is
encouraged to foster a data protection culture within his or her organization (Article
29 Data Protection Working Party, 2017). Making data protection embedded in the
organizational culture will support the implementation of significant GDPR elements,
such as data processing principles and record keeping.

The responsibilities of a DPO are stated in the Regulation’s Article 38 (1) “The
controller and the processor shall ensure that the data protection officer is involved,
properly and in a timely manner, in all issues which relate to the protection of personal
data.” In accordance with the Regulation, it is the controller and processor
organizations’ responsibility to ensure that the DPO is facilitated in carrying out his
or her tasks. This can be interpreted as the controller having the duty of providing
the DPO with necessary training and adequate equipment for fulfilling the tasks. By
contrast, the controller and processor are prohibited from giving the DPO any
instructions regarding his or her tasks (Regulation 2016/679 Article 38 (3)).
Accordingly, the DPO enjoys a degree of autonomy and neutrality enabling him or her
to perform his or her tasks without direct influence from others.

Ultimately, the processor or controller organization is responsible for compliance and
the demonstration of it. The Regulation’s Article 38 (3) determines that the DPO
cannot be dismissed or penalized by the processor or controller for correctly
performing his or her duties as DPO. In the Regulation, accountability has been
integrated as a principle the organization needs to answer for (European Data
Protection Supervisor, n.d.d). Should the controller or processor activities be
19

incompatible with the Regulation and the DPO’s advice, the DPO has the right to
report his or her separate opinion of the matter to the highest management (Article
29 Data Protection Working Party, 2017). In summary, the Regulation gives the DPO
numerous tasks and responsibilities related to personal data protection.

4.2 Data Protection by Design and Default

Bygrave (2017) notes that the provisions of the Regulation’s Article 25 about Data
Protection by Design and Default result in the most innovative and ambitious norms
of the Regulation. Article 25 requires that the controller integrate appropriate
technical and organizational measures which purpose are to implement data
protection principles into the organization’s practices. Pseudonymization is
mentioned in the Regulation as an appropriate measure for embedding Data
Protection by Design (DPbD), respectively data minimization for Data Protection by
Default (DPbDf). Although the concepts relate to each other, DPbD refers to
embedded data protection precautions and mechanisms in services and products
while DPbDf refers to the application of such precautions as a default setting
(Jasmontaite, Kamara, Zanfir-Fortuna, & Leucci, 2018).

The provisions of the article target especially the development of information
systems and business models with DPbD principles embedded. DPbD implies
designing systems in which privacy requirements have been considered and built-in
in all phases of the system development (Hansen, 2016). Since the Regulation only
provides one example for how to fulfill DPbD which is pseudonymization, the
controller itself is required to assess whether other measures are deemed necessary
for compliance. Adding privacy features to a running system subsequently is not
considered to be PDbD. Hansen (2016) emphasizes that today’s system design does
not, as a rule, meet up the demands of PDdD. One of the reasons behind this is that
there is an absence of financial incentives for developers to develop such systems. If
controllers and processors are sufficiently legal and compliant in their data
processing, they can still use systems without built-in data protection (Hansen, 2016).
20

DPbDf makes the controller responsible for implementing appropriate technical and
organizational measures for limiting, for example the quantity of personal data
processed by default. This also includes the extent of processing, the time period for
storage and accessibility. It is particularly important that the data subject’s
information, by default, is not made accessible to other parties without the data
subject having the possibility to deny access. The European Data Protection
Supervisory (2012) states that the aim of the ‘by default’ principle is to protect data
subjects from situations in which they would not understand or control the
technological features of the data processing.

When the Regulation was implemented, few established guidelines on DPbD and
DPbDf could be used to facilitate the implementation of Article 25. In the end of 2019,
the European Data Protection Board published the document Guidelines 4/2019 on
Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default which contains practical guidance
on the adoption of the principles. As a first step the IT Governance Privacy Team
(2017) suggest developing an appropriate compliance framework ensuring that data
protection is embedded in the organizational behavior.

4.3 Data Processing Records

Controllers and processors must keep a record of processing activities and upon
request make it accessible to the supervisory authority. A complete and correct data
processing record is vital for organizations’ ability to demonstrate compliance and
provide necessary evidence. The records must be kept in a shareable format,
preferably electronically (Regulation 2016/679 Article 30 (3)).

Organizations with fewer than 250 employees are exempted from retaining an
explicit record of their processing related activities (Regulation 2016/679 Article, 30
(5)). However, there are certain data processing conditions that require data
processing records regardless of the 250-employee limit. If the organization’s data
21

processing poses a probable risk to the data subject’s rights a data processing record
is required. The same applies for organizations that process data on a regular basis,
meaning that processing is a regular and frequent activity of the organization. Also,
organizations processing special categories of personal data or data relating to
criminal convictions and offences, are required to maintain a data processing record.

There are differences in the record details required of controllers and processors,
controllers must keep more extensive and detailed data processing records. The
records of a controller must contain name and contact information about the
controller and processor along with purposes of processing, descriptions of
categories of data subjects and personal data, information about data being
transferred to a third country or international organization and a general description
of the technical and organizational security measures. The controller must also keep
records of time limits for erasure and categories of different types of data recipients
to whom the data is disclosed. The processor’s recording obligation is similar to the
named requirements but requires fewer details. Supervisory authorities support
controllers and processors in fulfilling this measure by providing templates and
guidance for correct record keeping (Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman,
n.d.b). For example, The Office of the Data Protection Dataombudsman (n.d.h; n.d.i)
provides freely accessible record templates for both controllers and processors on
their website.

4.4 Data Protection Impact Assessment

A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is required under Article 35 from
controllers whose processing is likely to result in high risks for data subjects’ rights
and freedoms. A DPIA is an assessment of the impact planned data processing will
have on data subjects’ privacy protection (European Data Protection Supervisor,
2020). Mitigating the threats caused by the controllers processing to data subjects
are especially considered when performing a DPIA and should support controllers in
implementing the DPbD principle. Preparing the assessment should take place when
22

designing a new processing operation or activity and it should be subsequently
reviewed and updated. Performing a DPIA should help the controller since it is an
opportunity to detect potential security loopholes and problems and fixing them
before they pose an actual threat and cause potential sanctions.

The supervisory authority of each Member State oversees publishing and
maintenance of lists of processing activities that require the controller to perform a
DPIA. Controllers shall reach out to their DPOs for advice and guidance on the DPIA
requirements. A DPIA should include a description of the planned processing and its
purposes, a necessity and proportionality assessment, risk assessments to data
subjects along with measures to handle the risks and demonstrate compliance
(European Data Protection Supervisor, 2020).

According to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman (n.d.c) and the European
Data Protection Supervisor (2020), a controller’s processing activities and operations
pose a high risk to data subjects when two of the following characteristics of the
processing apply:
a) Systematic and extensive evaluation or profiling
i.

Can occur in connection to marketing profiling for targeted advertising
online.

b) Automated decision making
i.

Can occur when a person applies for a quicky loan and no human
interaction is needed from the loan giver to approve the loan.

c) Systematic monitoring of data subjects
i.

Monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a larger scale, for example
constant video surveillance of a public area.

d) Sensitive data processing
i.

Processing of genetic and biometric data occurs for example, when a
mobile phone is unlocked with a fingerprint or facial recognition.
23

e) Processing on a large scale
i.

Processing of special category personal data revealing health
information, ethnicity, political opinions, religious beliefs or sexual
orientation.

f) Matching or combining datasets with different purposes
i.

Matching can occur with the purpose of analyzing data subject
behavior.

g) Vulnerable data subjects
i.

Vulnerable data subjects entail data subjects that are perceived weak
beside the controller, examples are children, data subjects in need of
protection and employees.

h) New technologies
i.

Especially applies when a new technology impacts the data processing
significantly.

i) Processing that prevents people from exercising their rights or entering a
service or contract
i.

Especially applies to processing with the purpose of determining
whether the data subject is allowed or denied to use a service.

4.5 Data Breach Notification and Documentation

A personal data breach could be caused by anything from cyber attacks to malware
infections. Also, stolen USB-sticks or a fire in a data center are also possible scenarios
resulting in data breaches. The consequences of a personal data breach can be
devastating, in worst cases they result may result in identity theft, fraud or loss of
confidentiality. In case of a personal data breach the controller must notify the
24

supervisory authority within 72 hours starting from the discovery of the breach
(Regulation 2016/679 Article 33). If the 72-hour limit is not met the controller must
provide the supervisory with an explanation. Due to the strict time limit,
precautionary notifications may be necessary to file (Freiherr von dem Bussche, Axel
& Zeiter, 2016). In case of a personal data breach with a high risk of posing a threat
to natural persons’ rights and freedoms the controller shall, without delay, inform
the data subjects about the occurred breach (Regulation 2016/679 Article 34).

When informing the supervisory authority and the data subjects about the breach,
the controller must provide exhaustive details about the nature of the data breach,
communicate the name and contact details of the DPO, describe the probable
consequences of the breach and inform both of the taken and planned preventative
measures the controller has and will take to minimize the damages (Article 33). The
processor could also be the entity to inform the supervisory authority if so has been
agreed, however the primary responsibility remains with the controller (Office of the
Data Protection Ombudsman, n.d.e).

For a controller to in an efficient manner comply with the data breach provisions, it
is crucial to have appropriate and established data documentation processes.
Documentation of the data breach and the management of it is mandatory under the
Regulation’s Article 33 (5), this also ensures that the supervisory authority can control
the compliance of the Regulation under such circumstances. The role of the DPO in a
breach situation is to act as a mediator between the controller and the supervisory
authority (IT Governance Privacy Team, 2017).

4.6 Data Subject Rights

In comparison to the controller the data subject is weak and can be compared to a
customer and business relationship (Wolters, 2018). Nevertheless, data subjects have
seven rights that can be exercised defined in Chapter III of the Regulation. These are
the right to be informed; of access; to rectification; to erasure; to restrict processing;
25

to data portability; to object to processing and rights in relation to automated
decision making and profiling.

The rights give the data subjects the right to make requests to organizations
collecting and processing their data. First and foremost, data subjects have the right
to be informed about the data collected about them and how the data is processed.
Data subjects also have the right to access and request rectification and erasure of
their data (Regulation 2016/679 Articles 13, 15-17). These requests and demands can
at any time be exercised making it crucial for organizations to have processes and
resources enabling to fulfill the duties they have towards data subjects.

Although data subjects’ request might be resource intensive, especially if there is no
suitable architecture in the systems in use, controllers can generally not require any
financial compensation for performing the request (Regulation 2016/679 Article 12
(5). The data subject requests may be done in any format and through channels that
have not been assigned as official for data subject requests. Therefore, it is crucial
that staff potentially receiving the requests are sufficiently trained to identify them
(IT Governance Privacy Team, 2017). The IT Governance Privacy Team (2017)
recommends remodeling existing data access portals to enable data subjects’ access
to their data, thus facilitating the communication between controller and data
subject.

In accordance with the Regulation’s Article 12 the controller must react to the
requests as soon as possible or within a month from receiving the request. If that
time limit is not possible to meet due to the complexity of the request the time limit
may be extended to two months. In such a situation the controller is obliged to within
a one-month time limit inform the data subject about the motivation behind the
delay.

26

4.7 Infringements and its effects

One of the most significant incentives for complying with the Regulation are the
sanctions regulated by the Regulation’s Article 83. Prior to the Regulation coming into
force the maximum fines for non-compliance in the DPD only reached a couple of
thousand euros at the most, also the sanctions were inconsequentially applied
throughout the Directive’s lifetime which lead to a weakened incentive for
compliance (Hoofnagle et al., 2019). According to Privacy Affairs’ (2020) fines tracker,
347 fines had been issued in the EU by the end of July 2020, two years and two
months after the Regulation came into effect. The total amount of these fines
combined was nearly 176 million EUR (PrivacyAffairs.com, 2020). Of those the largest
fine of 50 million EUR was issued to Google France for being untransparent about the
personal data gathered (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés,
2020). The most frequently issued fine has been due to insufficient legal basis for data
processing (CMS Hasche Sigle Partnerschaft von Rechtsanwälten und Steuerberatern
mbB, 2020).

Although the Regulation has received a lot of media attention caused by the generous
fines, imposing fines is generally not necessarily the first step a supervisory authority
takes when an infringement is detected. As visualized in Figure 1 the supervisory
authority shall issue a warning when intended processing operations are likely to
cause infringements, a reprimand shall be issued when operations have infringed
provisions of the Regulation (Article 58). There are two tiers of fines which are applied
according to the magnitude and the aforethought of the infringement. The factors
considered when determining the seriousness of the infringement are among other
things, the preventative and mitigative actions, previous infringements, cooperability
with the supervisory authority, adherence to approved codes of conduct or approved
certification mechanisms as well as aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the
circumstances (Article 83 (2a-k). The smaller fine can subject to up to 10 000 000 EUR

27

or up to 2% of the annual turnover while the bigger fine can be subject to up to
20 000 000 EUR respectively 4% of the annual turnover (Article 83 (4,5)).

4.7.2 Infringements in Finnish Organizations

Since the Regulation came into force, the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman
has received multiple data breach notifications from Finnish organizations and
complaints from private persons about Finnish organizations not respecting the
provisions. Many of these complaints concern phished personal data and websites
not allowing the user in a simple and transparent manner, decline the collection of
cookies (Fagerström, 2020; Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman, 2019). By June
2020, the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman had imposed four administrative
fines on four Finnish organizations in May 2020. At the time of writing none of the
decisions are final, the fines can be appealed in the Finnish national administrative
court.

The largest fine of 100 000 EUR was imposed on the leading Finnish postal service
operator Posti Oy for deficiencies in the information provided to customers making
change-of-address notifications (Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman, 2020b).
The customers who made a change-of-address notification, started receiving
communications and direct marketing from companies. The Office of the Data
Protection Ombudsman’s investigation disclosed that Posti had failed in informing
the customers about their rights and providing the customers with the option to
decline disclosure of their personal data to third-party companies. Only during 2019,
161 000 customers had become victims of Posti’s infringements although Posti
already in 2017 had promised the Dataombudsman to correct the issue.

The second largest fine of 72 000 EUR was imposed on Taksi Helsinki, a taxi company
that had seriously neglected the assessment of risks and consequences of processing
personal data prior to installing audio and video recorders in their taxi cars (Office of
the Data Protection Ombudsman, 2020a). Taksi Helsinki could not motivate the need
for audio recording nor did they inform their customers about the monitoring of
them. Furthermore, Taksi Helsinki failed to be transparent about the automated data
29

processing and profiling connected to their loyalty program as well as failed to
conduct proper documentation.

A fine of 16 000 EUR was imposed on a company failing to do a data protection impact
assessment although they process employee location data which calls for an impact
assessment under Article 35 of the Regulation. The collected location data was used
for monitoring employees’ working hours. The characteristics of the personal data
and its processing resulted in a high probability of risks for the employees’ rights and
freedoms. The smallest fine imposed to date violated the principle of data
minimization by collecting unnecessary personal data from individuals applying for
jobs. The fined company asked for information about the applicants’ religion, family
status and health details among other things. The company was fined 12 500 EUR.

30

5 Implementation of the Regulation
Implementing the Regulation requires organizations to act both technically and
practically. Organizations that prioritized data protection prior to the Regulation have
a clear advantage compared to organizations that previously have neglected privacy
or kept privacy matters to a minimum. For example, organizations that prior to the
Regulation’s enforcement were accredited with the ISO/IEC standard 27001 for
information security management will already have a lot of data protection processes
documented (IT Governance Privacy Team, 2017).

A survey on the awareness of the Regulation (Dimensional Research, 2016) concluded
that 93% of the respondents did not have a plan to prepare for the Regulation,
furthermore 82% of the respondents were concerned about Regulation compliance.
The respondents consisted of data privacy professionals working for small and
medium sized businesses and larger enterprises affected by the Regulation. Although
organizations had a two-year period to prepare themselves, in 2018 the market
research company Forrester (n.d.) predicted that 80% of businesses affected by the
Regulation would not be compliant at the time of the Regulation coming into effect.
Of those non-compliant, 50% were predicted to aim for compliance but fail, the other
50% were predicted to deliberately not comply.

5.1 Planning the Implementation

Tikkinen-Piri, Rohunen and Markkula (2018) suggest that the first thing organizations
need to do is become familiar with the Regulation and identify how they stand under
the Regulation’s definitions and the measures required from them. Organizations
must identify and analyze all processes and activities that in any way are linked to
personal data and assess how the Regulation will affect them. Teixeira, da Silva and
Pereira, (2019) identified Lopes’ and Oliviera’s (2018) roadmap as the most complete
in comparison with other implementation roadmaps. In their roadmap the first step
31

is to gather and map all the personal data controlled and processed by the
organization. The second step is to analyze the data in order to identify inadequacies
and carry out a DPIA if necessary. The last step is to implement necessary measures
and security mechanisms. In order to maintain compliance, the organization must
regularly perform audits and reviews.

Implementing the required measures might be challenging and organizations might
require tailor-made solutions since the Regulation lacks specific prescriptive
instructions (Teixeira et al., 2019). Although there are many implementation
guidelines provided by the European Commission (n.d.b) among others, putting the
Regulation into practice is ultimately up to the organizations themselves. Especially
organizations operating with little documentation might experience the Regulation
as heavy to implemented (Tikkinen-Piri et al., 2018).

5.2 Responsibilities

It is crucial to decide who or whom in the organization, except for the DPO, that will
be responsible for overseeing and implementing the changes along with organizing
potential GDPR courses. In accordance with the Regulation’s Article 28, controllers
are only allowed to work with processors that can prove sufficient compliance of the
Regulation. This puts pressure on controller organizations since they have the
responsibility of making sure that the potential data processing organizations are
compliant.

5.3 Guidance

Supervisory authorities, various consultancies and NGO’s have organized GDPR
courses and put together guidance documents facilitating organizations’ compliance
with the Regulation. Many actors also offer freely available implementation
32

checklists and simple compliance tests that organizations can use to get a basic
notion of the compliance status. Also, the European Commission and the EDPB have
published numerous guidelines, factsheets, infographics, online videos, webpages
and even podcasts guiding organizations in the implementation and compliance of
the Regulation. Examples of these can be found in EDPB’s collection of factsheets and
on their YouTube channel and podcast page (EDPS, n.d.a; n.d.b; n.d.c).

Although there are many actors that provide guidance, supervisory authorities are
bound by the Regulation to provide guidance in accordance with Article 57.
Supervisory authorities are thus recommended as the primary source for guidance
(IT Governance Privacy Team, 2017). Many supervisory authorities provide vast
guidance on their websites both for organizations and data subjects along with
telephone hotlines and possibilities to regular e-mail and mail correspondence.
Examples can be found on the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman’s (n.d.g)
website and on the Information Commissioner’s Office (n.d.) website.

6 Methodology
In this chapter the methodology of the study will be presented. The objective of the
research methodology is to create a research framework allowing to exploratively
and qualitatively analyze the research context. First the type of research and the
research design will be presented, then follows a presentation of the data collection
and analysis methods. The chapter ends with a review of the trustworthiness of the
study.

6.1 Multiple-Case Study Research

Case studies are a common form of organizational research (Jones, 2014). Conducting
case studies as a research method are widespread within social sciences and are
preferred when the questions ‘how’ or ‘why’ need to be answered and in contexts
where the researcher has little control over happenings (Yin, 1994). He describes a
case study as “an empirical study that investigates a contemporary phenomenon
within its real-life context” (p.13). A case study can be either exploratory, descriptive
or explanatory, in many cases the research purposes overlap.

A multiple-case study is one containing more than one case. Some scholars make a
distinction between the methodology and describe multiple-case studies as
comparative studies (Yin, 1994). He, however, includes both variants of case studies
in the same methodological framework. Multiple-case studies are perceived as more
robust than single case studies because of the results generally are more convincing
and comprehensive. In a multiple-case study each case must be carefully selected
and serve a specific purpose. In general, multiple-case studies use replication rather
than sampling with the cases selected based on criticality, topicality or feasibility
(Jones, 2014). The assumption is that the result of a multiple-case study will either
lead to similar results or lead to contrasting results.

34

6.1.1 Research Design

The research design of this study, presented in Figure 2, demonstrates the framework
for the research context and data collection of the study. The aim of the research
design is to explore how the research context has been applied in three different
cases. To explore the research context in the cases, two entities of analysis in each
case organization are investigated. The study was replicated with the approach of
literal replication on all three cases meaning that each case was treated identically in
terms of methodology.

6.1.2 The RACI-Matrix

For organizing GDPR responsibilities internally, the IT Governance Privacy Team
(2017) suggest using a RACI matrix to divide tasks derived from the Regulation.
Therefore, the RACI-matrix was used for determining the entities of analysis in the

35

research design. In the following section the RACI-matrix will be examined as a
framework for supporting the adoption of the Regulation in organizations.

Given the prerequisites the Regulation poses on controller organizations, it might be
helpful to use a set framework for clarifying tasks, processes and division of
responsibilities. An option is to use a responsibility assignment chart which may
support cross-departmental coordination and increase the added value of the data
protection actions within the organization (Kane & Koppel, 2013). The Responsibility,
Accountability, Consult and Inform (RACI) matrix is an organizational matrix for
identifying tasks along with the organizational units and their relationships with the
tasks. The RACI-matrix has for example been suggested as a tool for implementing
the ISO/IEC standard 27001 for information security management standard and for
GDPR implementation in EU institutions (Calder, 2016). This suggests that the RACImatrix may also be suitable for GDPR implementation in other kinds of organizations.

The first step of creating a RACI-matrix is to identify the areas of responsibility and
the respective tasks, the second step is to identify the organizational units and posts
that will be involved (Kane & Koppel, 2013). For each task, the organizational units
and posts will be assigned a letter representing the role the unit or post will have (see
Table 1).

The roles of the RACI-matrix are the following (Kane & Koppel, 2013):
•

Responsible
o The unit or person who works to complete the task.

•

Accountable
o The unit or person who delegates and approves decisions and actions
before the deliverable is deemed complete.

•

Consult
o At least one unit or person is consulted and reviews the decisions and
actions. Consulted parties are often people who provide input based
on their expertise.

•

Inform
36

o An informed unit or person needs to be informed about the big picture
of the progress.

Each task should have at least one unit or person responsible and accountable. The
consult and inform roles are not always required for every task. Thus, the RACI matrix
is an efficient way to strategically clarify the resources needed for successful project
implementation in addition to detecting loopholes and gaps in the roles and
responsibilities.

In this study the entity of analysis 1 equals a person who is responsible for the
Regulation, the entity of analysis 2 equals a person who is informed of the Regulation.
In this case, it means that all interviewees categorized as responsible hold the
position of a DPO in the respective organizations. The criterion of being informed of
the Regulation only implies that the interviewee has a work description that requires
some knowledge of the Regulation. The purpose of interviewing members of
organizations classified as responsible and informed of the Regulation was to get a
wide overview of the implementation of the Regulation.

The choice of interviewing responsible and informed employees allowed an
investigation of the research context both from a top-down and bottom-up
perspective. Interviewing employees responsible for the Regulation, gave a picture
of how the implementation was planned and managed. Interviewing employees
informed of the Regulation, gave an indication of how the implementation process
had been received by regular employees in their daily work. In order to investigate
the implementation more thoroughly and from other perspectives, employees
accountable for and consulted about the Regulation could have been interviewed.
However, it was not done due to time and resource constraints.

6.2 Data Collection

The data collection of the study was made through making six qualitative interviews.
This section contains information about qualitative interviews as a data collection
along with a review of the data collection process.

6.2.1 Qualitative interviews

Interviews are one of the most common methods used in qualitative research
(Bryman & Bell, 2011). Interviews are used for collecting information and individual’s
stories and understandings of a phenomenon. The purpose of qualitative
interviewing is making use of the direct meeting and conversation that occurs
between researcher and interviewee in a specific context (Widerberg, 2002).

38

Semi-structured interviews are characterized by the researcher having a checklist of
themes or query fields with appurtenant follow-up questions (Jones, 2014; Lantz,
2007). The types of questions can generate both open and closed answers. In a semistructured interview, the researcher will get an understanding of the questions’
meaningfulness to the respondent. However, in replicated multiple-case study the
level of the answers’ openness may cause difficulties in performing a qualitative
analysis of the phenomena (Lantz, 2007).

Jones (2014) discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using interviews for data
collection in organizational research. The advantages of interviews are that they are
relatively low-cost, enable the covering of a large sample and may result in the
researcher gaining access to the organization site. On the other hand, the researcher
may intentionally or unintentionally provoke the data and the interviewee’s
perceptions might have inaccuracies especially if they are reflecting on past events.
Also, there is the issue of reflexivity, the interviewee might give the sort of answers
he or she expects the researcher wants to hear (Yin, 1994). Furthermore, Widerberg
(2002) states that there are no guarantees for the researcher and interviewee to have
matching personal chemistry which may influence on the outcome of the interview.

6.2.2 The Data Collection Process

Based on the study’s research questions an interview guide was made (see
Appendices 1 & 2). All the interviews followed the same interview guide, the first two
questions were basic questions about the interviewee’s position and his or her brief
description of the organization he or she works in. These questions had two purposes
of which the first one was to gain valuable background knowledge about the
interviewee and his or her perception of the organization he or she is operative in.
Acquiring data about the perception is valuable because it provides a deeper
understanding of the organization and the interviewee’s perspective of it. The second
purpose was to allow both the researcher and interviewee to acclimatize to the
interview situation thus creating a sense of mutual trust. Lantz (2007) states that
39

there is a lack of meaning in commencing an interview without the researcher and
interviewee having a common understanding of the purpose of their meeting.

The interview questions were based on the study’s research questions which were
operationalized and grouped according to the research themes implementation,
guidance and compliance. Separate interview guides were made for responsible and
informed interviewees as their relationships to the research context differs
significantly. The interview guides were made in English and later translated to
Swedish.

This study’s research design requires three different cases to be to be studied through
two entities of analysis. Since the objective of the study was to research how three
different organizations have implemented the Regulation, different potential case
organizations’ DPOs were contacted by e-mail in January 2020. All organizations that
were contacted are operative in Finland. In the e-mail brief information about the
study, its aims and the characteristics of the potential interview were described. All
the potential interviewees who agreed to be interviewed received the interview
questions beforehand. The reason for doing so was because of several failed
attempts to get individuals to agree to be interviewed. This indicated that the nature
of the research topic generated some insecurities and comments such as “We do not
know or have anything to do with this”. Although all interviewees received the
interview questions beforehand almost all of them admitted that they had,
nevertheless, not reviewed them properly prior to the interview. One reason for that
could be that simply having access to the questions beforehand, made the
interviewees more comfortable with the thought of being interviewed.

The DPOs were contacted first as the research design’s criteria was to interview a
DPO in each case organization, a position that cannot be substituted by any other
function. In two of the cases, the DPOs were asked to provide a recommendation of
a person from the same organization informed of the Regulation and willing to be
interviewed. In the third case organization the DPO and a person considered

40

informed of the Regulation were contacted simultaneously but separately due to
recommendations from a contact operative in the organization.

The data collection itself occurred during a six-week period starting in February 2020
and ending in March 2020. The data collection was made through semi-structured
interviews, lasting from 30 to 45 minutes. Out of six interviews four were made face
to face and two by using Skype video calls. The interviews made face to face were
recorded using a dictation machine while the video calls were recorded through
Skype. The interviewees were aware of the recording and were all given the
opportunity to deny the recording of the interview. All interviews were made in
Swedish except one which was made in English due to the interviewees limited
language skills in Swedish.

6.3 Data Analysis

Analyzing quantitative data is not straight forward, according to Bryman and Bell
(2011) only broad guidelines can be provided on the topic. Lantz (2007) explains that
the prominent subjectivity and context-boundness in qualitative studies results in a
lack of clear descriptions for how successful qualitative data analysis can be
replicated. In many case studies the studies are commenced without knowing exactly
how the data will be analyzed, which also was the situation for this study.

Analyzing case study data can, just as quantitative data in general, be difficult
because there are no well-defined strategies or technicalities for how the evidence
should be analyzed (Yin, 2007). He advocates using the strategy of relying on
theoretical propositions. The objectives and research design that formed and led to
the study should be used as a baseline for coding the data collected and influencing
the analysis. Another option for analyzing data is the development of case
descriptions. The case description strategy is especially useful when no hypotheses
have been set as a basis for the study.

41

Reducing collected data is often the first step of the analysis and can be done in
several ways (Lantz, 2007; Widerberg, 2002). In order to make the data manageable
for analysis it is crucial to sort the data. One way of sorting interviews is to make
matrix summaries (Kylén, 2004). For this study, the first step of the analysis was to
create spreadsheet matrices for documenting the interview data in writing. Two
matrices were made, one for the interviews with the DPO’s and another for the
informed interviewees as their interview protocols differed slightly. The matrices
contained cells for each question and answer along with cells for summaries of the
answers to each question. The analysis itself began by relistening to the interviews in
their entirety in order to get a general overview of the interview. Comments and
general remarks for each interview were documented in the matrices. The second
step of the analysis was to listen to the recordings one answer at a time, the answers
were noted in the matrices in summarized formats. Since this study is not based on a
hypothesis or general assumption the results will be presented in case descriptions
which will help to identify the causal links of the study. The case descriptions are not
of cross-sectional character because of the significantly different characteristics and
starting positions of the case organizations.

6.4 Trustworthiness of the study

The concepts of validity and reliability cannot be applied to qualitative research in
the same way as to quantitative research (Shenton, 2004). In line with previous
statements about qualitative methodology, there are no established rules for the
assessment of quality in case study design (Bryman & Bell, 2011). It all depends on
the researcher’s judgement of appropriate evaluation methods. Bryman and Bell
(2011) advocate that case study analysis should be focused on the uniqueness of the
cases and their complexities. Theoretical generalizability, however, is possible to
achieve, especially in a multiple-case study.

Bryman and Bell (2011) suggest analyzing the quality of qualitative studies through
credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability. Credibility which equals
42

internal validity is one of the most important factors for ensuring trustworthiness
(Bryman & Bell, 2011). The data collection was completed in accordance with good
academic practice, all the interviewees participated voluntarily and were not
compensated for their participation. The interviewees were well informed about the
purpose of the interviews and how the recorded material was used. No measures
such as triangulation or member checks were performed in this study.

Lantz (2007) emphasizes the importance of an adequate description of the research
methodology for supporting evaluation and potential transferability of the study. The
transferability of context bound case studies is however limited due to the research
context’s time sensitivity. Replicating this study with similar types of case
organizations would not necessarily prove the same results as the time from the
critical date in this research context is getting is elapsing by every day. First,
interviewees might not be able to recall events in detail and second, operative
individuals in organizations are likely to change positions and organizations over time.

The changing nature of the study’s research context challenges the demonstration of
dependability (Shenton, 2004). Shenton (2004) advocates thorough description of
the research design and how it has been applied as a way of enabling future
researchers to repeat the study although the same results are not likely to be
achieved. Also thoroughly describing the data collection and giving a reflective
appraisal of the study supports the demonstration of dependability. In this chapter
both the research design and data collection has been described.

Confirmability can be translated to the researcher acting in good faith and not letting
his or her subjectivity and personal values influence the results of the study (Bryman
& Bell, 2011). One way of proving confirmability is to apply reflexivity which translates
to the researcher reflecting on his or her methods, analysis, interpretation of the
results and awareness of potential personal idiosyncrasies affect the study.
Nevertheless, no substantial measures were taken for proving confirmability.

43

7 Findings
In this chapter the findings of the study will be presented. The chapter is made up of
case descriptions of each case organization and is concluded by a summary of the
findings.

All case organizations are located in Finland, in different cities and municipalities. The
organizations are remarkably different from each other especially when it comes to
functions, size and turnover which is reflected in the findings. Because of the
sensitivity of the study the organizations and the interviewees are not named.

7.1 Case Organization: Public Authority

The public authority case organization has around 1800 employees divided into four
different departments. The public authority has a lot of different kinds of duties and
activities that require the collection and processing of personal data, many of these
duties are prescribed by law. As Finnish public authorities are not subject to being
fined by the supervisory authority this organization cannot be financially sanctioned.

The public authority’s DPO and an informed employee were interviewed for the
study. The DPO was not working for the public authority in question when the
Regulation was implemented. However, the DPO has experience of data protection
work and the Regulation from a previous employment and has detailed information
about the data protection measures taken before the current employment started.
The DPO does not work full-time with data protection.

The informed employee (herein after referred to as the informed) works with
marketing and communication which implies a lot of online communication and
website maintenance. The informed did not work in the organization on May 25th
2018, when the Regulation was enforced but had been an employee of the
organization prior to the enforcement.
44

7.1.1 Implementation

The DPO
The first step of the implementation of the Regulation was the establishment of a
data protection working group. The initial assignment of the working group was to
prioritize measures, assess the organization’s training needs emerged by the
Regulation’s provisions and consequently organize the staff GDPR courses. The
second step was to make an inventory of the personal data collected and processed
by the organization.

The working group initially included the DPO, a lawyer, an information officer, IT
experts and staff representing different departments, all and all the task force
included around 12 members. The task force was chaired by an executive senior
employee. Today the working group does not exist in its former constellation, it has
been downsized to four members: the organization’s DPO, Head of IT, a lawyer and
a data protection expert in charge of a department dealing with especially sensitive
personal data. The working group meets once a month and works hands on with data
protection issues. It reports to the organization management.

The challenges faced with the implementation in the organization were mainly
related to staff training and information overload. The staff needed to learn many
new things about data protection and there was generally a lot of emphasis put on
the enforcement date, May 25th 2018 and the impact it would have. The DPO
recalled: “Media almost pointed out the enforcement day as a doomsday”. The huge
attention of the enforcement date lead to a slight sense of panic.

The DPO stated that many were confused about the data subject’s consent but since
the organization is a public authority with legal obligations to perform certain data
collecting tasks consent is not required. The confusion led to the staff getting
uncertain about what they were allowed to do and not, within the scope of the
45

Regulation. This led to staff becoming anxious of data protection, the data protection
anxiousness is still notable but is something that is worked on in the organization.
The GDPR courses were useful for explaining what the Regulation really is about. The
first course was organized as an online course but there were also trainings held by
external experts. Based on the online training, which was mandatory for all members
of staff, the average employee has spent around one hour on GDPR familiarization.
The online course consisted of background information, smaller tasks and quizzes.

The DPO states that there was still a lot to be done at the time of the enforcement
date. Nevertheless, there was a stable starting point and a plan for what to do,
compliance with previous legislation contributed to already having privacy policy
documents in order. A little under a year from the enforcement date there are
established models and processes in use for the data protection work of the
organization. The DPO’s comment about the implementation process: “Now [just
under a year since the enforcement] I feel like we have gotten to a point where we
can draw a line”.

The informed
The informed encountered the Regulation for the first time in connection to the
launching of a new website. The new website needed a privacy policy document
written in accordance with the Regulation so the informed contacted the DPO to get
help with the composition of the document. Through different networks with
employees in similar positions in other organizations, the Regulation has been the
topic of many discussions and many peers wonder how they will handle it in their
work. All and all the informed has spent a couple of days on familiarization with the
Regulation. The informed participated in a one-day training in 2019, in addition to
that the informed has independently retrieved GDPR information online.

In the daily work of the informed the major challenges are related to visual personal
data. For the informed, it is hard to know how to be compliant especially when it
comes to handling photos containing faces and other types of personal data. The
46

informed exemplified: “How can we categorize thousands of photos so that we can
be aware of exactly which rights apply to which photos…This causes many challenges
to which we have difficulties finding solutions to”. Other encounters with the
Regulation are related to marketing campaigns and competitions that extract
personal data from contact forms.

7.1.2 Guidance

The DPO
To get more information and knowledge of the Regulation the DPO attended a
consultancy company’s GDPR courses. The DPO also took part in the Data Protection
Ombudsman Office’s training events and participated in a project supporting digital
security in public authorities. Guidance material was in the beginning of the
implementation process found by self-initiated retrieval but as the data protection
work progressed it became easy for the DPO to know where to look for specific
information. The Data Protection Ombudsman Office’s website has proved to be a
helpful source for data protection issues.

The staff of the organization are offered data protection guidance on the
organization’s intranet. However, it is challenging for the DPO to know if everyone in
the staff is aware of the information on the intranet. New employees receive data
protection information in connection with the employment.

The informed
The informed has received GDPR guidance from the data protection working group,
the DPO and the organization lawyer. Especially the lawyer has been important when
there has been a need for specific guidance. The guidance has not been systematic,
and in general that is one of the organization’s main challenges according to the

47

informed. When a new person is recruited that person will need to find the
information on his or her own.

The informed is of the opinion that the Regulation is an important thing for an
organization and that it could have been more emphasized in the organization but
that it is the case for many things. The informed recalls that there was some kind of
GDPR course, but that she might not have taken part in it because of being too busy
and overworked at the time.

7.1.3 Compliance

The DPO
In order to ensure compliance with the Regulation the organization has a data
protection plan and a data protection closure which are yearly updated and reported
to the management and the executive committee. The data protection closure, which
is examined by controllers, contains statistics about the quota of employees finishing
the data protection online course, for example. Furthermore, ensuring that privacy
policy documents are continuously updated supports the organization’s compliance.

The organization has started to use an introductory assessment scheme when
starting to use new systems and processes. The assessment contains short questions
on whether the system will handle personal data and its level of sensitivity. Based on
the results of the introductory assessment the making of a DPIA may be in order.
With the support of the DPIAs the DPO can keep track of the systems handling
sensitive data and have an action plan should the data be compromised.

The DPO stated that the organization’s executive committee has the highest level of
accountability towards the Regulation. The biggest challenge in terms of monitoring
compliance is related to a lack of time as the DPO is not working full time with data
protection responsibilities. With the time available for data protection tasks, it is not
possible for the DPO to perform check-ups with the organization’s supervisors.
48

Keeping the data protection information up to date is also challenging with the
continuously changing data protection practices. The DPO emphasized the
uncertainty of knowing if complete compliance has been achieved: “You only know if
things have been done the right way once something really does happen or goes
wrong, and it is only a question of when it happens, not if.”

The informed
For ensuring compliance with the Regulation the informed has no specific systems
but she is aware that the organization must be able to demonstrate that the personal
data registers are compliant, and that personal data can be extracted. Despite this,
the informed revealed that it is not possible based on how the registers are
constructed and that it is a big issue that needs to be corrected. Many systems should
be constructed so that it would be possible to achieve compliance.

The informed states that the ultimately accountable person of the Regulation’s
compliance is the director of the organization. However, she points out that the
manager of the DPO has public liability. The informed feels like there is a lot of
responsibility put on the single employee:

How can we build systems that enables the employee to do the right thing without
him or her being that knowledgeable about the issue? Sensitive information is such
an important thing and people are very alert about the GDPR - they will tell you if
something went wrong.

7.2 Case Organization: Political Organization

The political organization has around 25 employees and over 24 000 members. The
organization has three offices in different parts of Finland and over 100 local
departments situated in the country. The organization is rather decentralized with
49

many of their grassroot activities taking place in the local departments. The low
number of employees does not require the organization to have a DPO but due to
the nature of their activities and the collection and processing of sensitive data the
organization decided to establish the post of a DPO.

The DPO who was elected by the organization’s board, does not work with data
protection issues full-time. In the organization the DPO has an advisory and
surveilling role, the organization’s secretary takes care of the administrative work
related to the personal data. The informed employee (hereinafter referred to as the
informed) works with supporting the activities of local departments and facilitating
the work of organization members in various boards.

7.2.1 Implementation

The DPO
Prior to the implementation of the Regulation an investigation was made to assess
the need of changes brought by the provisions. At that stage it was noted that the
organization already complied with the most part of the provisions due to compliance
with previous domestic data protection legislation. The local departments were
especially informed of the effects since they oversee local data collection and
processing. In connection with the enforcement, the members of the organization
were informed about the effects the Regulation would have.

The main challenges faced in connection with the implementation were in line with
previous challenges the organization had faced. Questions regarding the ownership
of the personal data arose since the local departments deal with members’ personal
data. All this made it difficult to separate the roles. More emphasis was put on the
data subjects’ rights especially when collecting personal data through online forms.
Now data subjects are asked to answer a few more questions regarding consent for
how the organization is allowed to use their data.

50

The amount of time the staff has put on familiarizing themselves with the Regulation
varies according to the role and level the employee has. The DPO estimates that the
average employee has devoted around ten hours to get familiar with the Regulation.
The employees more actively in charge of registers containing personal data have put
in more time, around 20-30 hours each. Also, people volunteering for the
organization have taken part of the organizations’ GDPR information. However, the
DPO noted that the work with data protection in the organization is continuous and
is not limited to the enforcement of the Regulation.

At the time of the enforcement the DPO states that the organization was quite well
prepared although if felt like the enforcement date turned up quickly and there was
a lot of information about what it would imply. The huge amount of information was
by some perceived as too much which lead to people in general becoming slightly
uneasy with the Regulation. The DPO stated: “People were afraid of the GDPR, it was
perceived as a dangerous acronym”. In the end many necessary measures had
already been taken prior to the enforcement and only a few things needed to be
adjusted to comply with the Regulation. That included improving the tracking of how
and when personal data is collected and processed. The appointing of a DPO ensured
that the organization’s data protection knowledge was up to date and it was easy to
elaborate on how to handle the challenges.

The informed
To the informed the Regulation was first introduced during staff meetings and
through an extensive information package received by e-mail. The information
package contained information about the Regulation and how it would affect their
activities. There were also information sessions held by the DPO during staff meetings
in which the staff could ask questions about the Regulation. The informed pointed
out that the DPO provided information especially relevant for their activities. The
informed spent around six to eight hours familiarizing herself with the Regulation,
over time the time spent has increased.

51

At the time of the enforcement the informed was well prepared and felt like she had
received all the relevant information. For the informed there were no bigger changes
in her daily work since the organization had been compliant on many levels already
before the enforcement. In general, the Regulation might have received more
attention than what it finally needed.

The informed did not face any specific challenges with the Regulation in her daily
work. The most important reminder is not to collect personal data that is not needed.
The third-party systems the organization uses are compliant with the Regulation
limiting the need for self-monitoring. It has become known that some of the local
departments use registers of their own making it challenging to control how the local
departments handle the personal data. Since the local departments act as
independent associations the administration can only inform about the Regulation
but not control their activities.

7.2.2 Guidance
The DPO
The most important sources of guidance were the Regulation itself and the Finnish
Data Protection Act. Some employees took part in an information seminar about the
Regulation organized by an outside alliance. The organization has not used any
external consultants, but they have received help from lawyers within the
organization with the legal interpretation of the Regulation. The employees of the
organization are aware of the terms and conditions of services and products they
purchase. This allows them to provide correct data protection information about
their services to the members of the organization.

The employees have received guidance in the form of information packages which
were also sent to the local departments. The Regulation has also received attention
during some of the organization’s events and in publications disseminated to all the
members. Because of the appointment of the DPO, employees have had the
52

opportunity to individually ask for data protection guidance whenever needed; some
members of the staff exercised this opportunity.

The informed
The information package about the Regulation and the low threshold for contacting
the DPO contribute to the informed feeling like she has received all the guidance
needed. The informed states that the DPO is very accessible and that all the
information is customized to their needs.

7.2.3 Compliance

The DPO
In order to have the capability to demonstrate compliance with the Regulation, the
organization tracks and documents how the register containing personal data is used.
The register has automatic logging enabling a higher level of data security although
many employees and members can access the register. The biggest challenge with
monitoring compliance is tied to the decentralized nature of the organization; local
departments can only access personal data connected to their departments while
administrative staff can access the register in its entirety. The DPO of the organization
is responsible for compliance with the Regulation although the board has ultimate
accountability.

The informed
The informed does not follow any specific procedures for ensuring compliance with
the Regulation as all the systems she uses are compliant by default. According to the
informed, the board is ultimately accountable for the organization’s compliance with
the Regulation.

53

7.3 Case Organization: Global Company

The global company with around 13 000 employees operates in nearly 200 countries
of which many are situated in the EU. The interviewees representing the company in
this study are based in Finland. The nature of the company’s activities, products and
services result in the collection and processing of a great amount of sensitive personal
data both within the EU and abroad. Given the size of the company and its activities
the appointment of an EU based DPO was highly required by the Regulation.

In the organizational scheme the EU based DPO is under the company DPO who
reports directly to the board of the company. The DPO’s work closely with the Chief
Information Security Officer, the Legal and IT compliance departments. Beside
ensuring compliance with the Regulation, the EU DPO’s (hereinafter referred to as
the DPO) tasks include ensuring that the operations and business practices adhere to
other applicable data protection laws, monitoring compliance with the Regulation,
with other EU member states’ data protection provisions and with the data
protection policies of controllers and processors. The DPO works with data protection
issues on full time. The informed employee (hereinafter referred to as the informed)
works as an IT expert with quality and salary systems, as well as with some local
software.

7.3.1 Implementation
The DPO
At a corporate level, a project organization including legal experts, risk management
officers, IT experts, the HR and corporate compliance departments was put together
from October 2017 to July 2018. The purpose of the project organization was to
prepare the company for the enforcement of the Regulation. This was done through
putting together policies for employees, customers and partners, inventories of
processing activities, courses as well as updating the intranet with relevant
54

information. The employees were informed through several e-mails about the
Regulation and its implications. In addition, an online GDPR course was made for the
employees, over 90% of the employees completed the course.

The challenges faced with the implementation of the Regulation were mainly related
to training and the distance between high level policies and practices in daily
activities. The DPO commented that privacy is not a new thing for the company, the
size and potential financial damage of the Regulation’s sanctions however make the
stakes for compliance a lot higher. Also, the development of risk-based management
practices in respect of data protection and privacy proved to be challenging.
Furthermore, qualifying suppliers as compliant required tight cooperation between
the Legal, IT and Compliance departments which proved to be complex and timeconsuming at times.

The DPO states that the average employee needed about 15 minutes to get familiar
with the Regulation but that they all and all spent around one and a half hour with
the online course. However, the DPO emphasises that the familiarization with the
Regulation is continuous. At the time of the enforcement the DPO stated that the
company was rather well prepared for the Regulation’s provisions. The DPO affirmed
that she company is used to complying with many strict regulations on a global scale
thus having a stable foundation for adapting to changes such as the Regulation: “We
just need to develop our practices rather than creating a whole new set of processes.”

The informed
The informed first encountered the Regulation on television but because the
informed works with salary systems he rapidly received information about changes
in the system that were caused by the Regulation’s provisions. This happened about
a year to six months before the enforcement of the Regulation.

The informed attended a GDPR-course organized by the company and recalls
spending around one working day on familiarizing himself with the Regulation along
55

with shorter moments here and there, whenever needed. The informed stated that
he did not feel a need to be especially prepared for the enforcement of the
Regulation. He explained that the systems he uses are purchased from other parties
and should therefore be compliant by default. The Regulation is nothing that he
actively thinks of. He described the Regulation as one in the crowd of many legal
frameworks he has come across during his career. He also stated that there will
always be new policies.

In the daily work of the informed the Regulation has not caused any specific
challenges. However, he points out that it happens that peers forget about the
Regulation. Especially when new systems are ordered the provisions may require
adjustments that cause extra work.

7.3.2 Guidance

The DPO
To get more information about the Regulation the DPO has used the Regulation itself,
and other material such as different kinds of documents and templates for risk and
gap analysis as well as for making an impact assessment. The material was mainly
found online and, in some cases, provided by external experts. In addition to that the
management of the company wanted the DPO to attend a course for becoming a
certified GDPR practitioner. The course lasted for five days and was held by an
accredited training organization.

Beside the information on the company’s intranet and the online course the
employees are may be offered direct guidance on data protection issues through
contacting the DPO. Two different mailboxes were created, one for reaching the DPO
and another for more general data protection issues. The employees also receive
data protection guidance by reading the company’s Standards of Business Conduct
under the sections data privacy and confidential property information.

56

The informed
The informed states that the main source of guidance was the online course provided
by the company that he took. According to the informed the course contained
multiple tests making it necessary to properly go through the information provided
in the course.

The informed is quite satisfied with the guidance provided and thinks he almost has
received enough information, however he stated that there are always situations that
come up that could have required more guidance in order to be solved. If the
informed needs more guidance he turns to the DPO of the company.

7.3.3 Compliance

The DPO
Compliance is monitored through several measures and procedures. The company’s
data privacy and security policies support the compliance of the Regulation both for
internal and external personal data. There are, for example, Employee Privacy Notice
and Employment Applicant policy documents that describe what the company will do
with the personal data and for what purpose it is collected. On the IT privacy and
security side there are policy documents for data classification, encryption, cyber and
corporate security.

In terms of monitoring compliance, the biggest challenges are aligning one global,
corporate privacy policy and approach with applicable privacy laws that may differ:
“Not only may they differ on a country level but even on a regional basis like the case
is with the German States.” The DPO constantly follows the International Association
of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) website for news about data protection compliance
praxis and precedents. The DPO states that the (EU based) DPO is ultimately
accountable for compliance in the company.
57

The informed
The informed has not needed to apply any formal procedures to his work in order to
comply with the Regulation. He states that the DPO is ultimately accountable for
compliance with the Regulation in the company.

7.4 Summary of findings

The findings of the study show that the implementation of the Regulation in the case
organizations varies while there are similar features that can be identified between
the case organizations. Because the prerequisite for the study’s case organizations
was the appointment of a DPO, it is one of the most natural and clearest similarity
between the organizations. The public authority and the global company had both
established a working group respectively a project organization with specialists from
different domains in order to prepare the organizations for the Regulation’s
provisions and the implementation itself. The political organization, being much
smaller, did not form a task force or similar for the implementation of the Regulation.

The challenges faced, in connection with the implementation, were of slightly
different character for all case organizations. It can be explained with the
organizations’ starting positions and previous needs for data protection measures.
The global company, for example, has a very different need for data protection
processes than the political organization since they collect and process data at very
different rates and for different reasons. The DPOs of the public authority and the
political organization both mentioned that people at the time of the enforcement
had been distressed about the Regulation and what they thought it could bring.
Especially in the public authority the great amount of information that had to be
given to the employees and the general perception of the Regulation was perceived
as a challenge for the implementation. The informed interviewee stated that the
58

handling of visual personal data is especially challenging in her work. In the political
organization the organizational scheme and structure made it challenging to set
straight the ownership of the personal data.

At the time of the enforcement of the Regulation the DPOs of the political
organization and the global company stated that the employees were rather well
prepared. The DPO of the public authority was not in office at the time of
enforcement but stated that measures had been taken in order to prepare the
employees. The informed interviewees of the political organization and the global
company both ascertain that they trust that the systems they use are compliant thus
minimizing the need for preparedness.

The DPOs of the public authority and the global company both attended a GDPR
training course provided by external experts. The DPO of the global company took
part in the most extensive training among the interviewed DPOs while the DPO of the
political organization did not mention attending any course or training.

All case organizations provided their employees with guidance on the Regulation,
both the public authority and the global company took use of their intranets to create
online courses and provide information to the employees. The political organization’s
employees put significantly more time on familiarizing themselves with the
Regulation than in the other case organizations. All case organization DPO’s
emphasized that guidance is something that is constantly ongoing.

The case organizations’ processes for handling compliance vary. The public authority
puts emphasis on their annual data protection closure and the internal revision of it
along with having testing procedures for new systems. The political organization
focuses on keeping their register containing personal data compliant by tracking the
logging activities. The global company on the other hand, steers and monitors the
compliance through numerous policies regulating how the company deals with
privacy, data protection and data security. Because of the different approaches to

59

handling compliance and the general differences between the case organizations
they have different challenges with monitoring compliance.

Both the global company’s DPO and informed interviewee stated that the DPO is
ultimately accountable for compliance. The public authority’s and the political
organization’s interviewees stated that the organizations’ boards are ultimately
accountable for compliance with the Regulation.

60

8 Discussion
The aim of the discussion chapter is to answer the research questions based on the
findings and discuss the outcome of the study. This chapter is commenced by a review
of the answers found to the research questions and factors influencing the
implementation of the Regulation.

8.1 RQ1) How did organizations prepare for the implementation of the
Regulation?

A study done in 2018 predicted that 80% of businesses affected by the Regulation
would not be compliant by the enforcement date, May 25th 2018 (Dimensional
Research, 2016). The political organization’s DPO and the global company’s DPO
stated that their organizations were quite well prepared for the Regulation.
Preparedness in this context is however something that is hard to quantify and
defining what being sufficiently prepared is something that must be legally tried in
order to have relevance. Also, the consequences for not being prepared at the time
of enforcement were hard to predict since the new Regulation lacked previous
precedents with similar scope and sanctions.

It is suggested that organizations begin their implementing process by learning about
the Regulation and the effects it will have on them (Tikkinen-Piri et al., 2018). GDPR
courses organized by external experts is something all case organizations have taken
advantage of. The DPOs of the public authority and the global company personally
both took part in such courses. The case organizations’ employees mainly received
information about the implementation through the organizations’ internal channels.

According to IT Governance Privacy Team (2017) implementing the Regulation
requires both technical and practical measures. The proposed implementation
roadmap for organizations by Lopes and Oliviera (2018) includes mapping the already
61

existing personal data, analysis of the data and implementation of necessary
measures and mechanisms. The public authority DPO described an implementation
process very similar to Lopes and Oliviera’s (2018). Public authorities often want to
demonstrate compliance with laws and regulations in order to maintain good
relationships with the citizens. Following a clear plan for implementation may have
supported the public authority in demonstrating compliance both to the citizens and
the supervisory authority.

Furthermore, organizations with prior experience of data protection processes have
an advantage compared to organizations with no previous experience. For example,
being accredited with the ISO/IEC standard 27001 for information security
management has been identified as an adequate ground for implementation. None
of the case organizations are at the time of writing accredited with ISO/IEC 27001
although the global company follows its guidelines. The global company DPO’s
statement very much confirms this; because their activities already before the
Regulation were impacted by laws and regulations on a global scale, they are more
agile and used to adapting.

Out of all informed interviewees, the IT expert working in the global company had
the most relaxed approach to the implementation of the Regulation. The IT expert
described the Regulation as just another legal framework that did not require much
action from him. The informed interviewee’s long career as an IT expert may
influence his attitude towards the implementation of laws and regulations impacting
his work.

In connection to the implementation of the Regulation, the informed interviewee
working in the public authority raised the issue of photos and visual personal
information. For photos to be compliant and publishable, a person in a photo must
agree to be photographed and give his or her consent for publishing the photo. As a
result, photos that lack the required information may no longer be usable for the
organization. One alternative for keeping them compliant, would be anonymization
of the persons in photos, which in turn would change the visual outlook.
62

8.2 RQ2) What kind of guidance is used for supporting compliance with the
Regulation?

The Regulation makes each EU Member States’ supervisory authority responsible for
providing guidance both to organizations and data subjects, in this study only the
public authority DPO mentioned the supervisory authority as a source of guidance.
Based on the data collected for this study, it is not possible to draw any general
conclusions for why the other DPOs did not mention the supervisory authority.

The DPO’s role as an information source both for data subjects, internally in the
organization and for the supervisory authority is emphasized in the Regulation and in
the literature. For the DPOs to have the ability to fulfill this responsibility they need
to receive training themselves; the Regulation itself and courses held by external
experts were mentioned by all DPOs of the study as sources for guidance. The DPOs’
cooperation with lawyers also came up as a vital part of supporting compliance
especially at the implementation stage. This demonstrates that the Regulation’s
demanded the case organizations to allocate resources for training the DPO who in
turn has the responsibility to provide guidance to the employees.

The guidance to the employees was an important part of preparing for the
implementation. The public authority and the global company used their intranets
for creating a platform for the employees, a probable reason for the political
organization not gathering the material online in a similar fashion is because they do
not have an intranet. Also, the sizes of the case organizations play a significant role
in the need of gathering material online. The political organization is rather small
compared to the other ones and it the threshold for personally contacting the DPO
might be smaller. The informed interviewee in the political organization was content
with receiving tailor-made information about the Regulation suggesting that despite
not attending an internal course, there was sufficient guidance.
63

The informed interviewee in the public authority stated that she because of being
overloaded with work did not manage to complete the course at the time of it being
launched. This demonstrates that although there is guidance available it is not selfevident that employees find the time to take advantage of it, the DPO of the public
authority was also concerned about the issue of not being sure if the guidance has
reached all the employees. The concerns of the DPO were legitimate. For example,
there is a contradiction between how the DPO, and the informed interviewee
described the guidance new employees receive about data protection. According to
the DPO, a newly employed person receives data protection information in
connection with the employment. In contrast, the informed interviewee stated that
a newly employed person needs to find data protection information on his or her
own. It is possible that an explanation for this can be found in the organizational
structure and management. In an organization with many functions, departments
and managers, the recognition and prioritization of data protection guidance to
employees will vary. Hence, not all employees will receive data protection guidance
as expected by the DPO.

8.3 RQ3) How is compliance of the Regulation monitored?

Non-compliance with the Regulation might result in significant fines for
organizations. Therefore, the ability to demonstrate compliance is important for
organizations wanting to prove their conformity with the Regulation. Supervisory
authorities have the right to request documentation that proves compliance from
data collectors and processors. As previously mentioned in this study, public
authorities are by Finnish law exempted from fines. Nevertheless, infringements are
something that public authorities want to avoid to not lose the trust of citizens and
other cooperation partners. In addition, they might be subject to other sanctions such
as warnings, reprimands or suspension of personal data processing.

64

Each case organization monitors compliance through processes that match their
overall activities and ways of working, another aspect which influences is the amount
of personal data the organizations collect and process. The public authority applies
annual reporting and evaluation of new systems while the global company relies on
several internal policies for monitoring compliance. The political organization
emphasizes documentation and tracking of how their personal data register is
handled. Looking from a bottom-up perspective it became clear that at least two of
the informed interviewees trust that the systems they use are compliant and thus
their need for monitoring compliance is minimized. This especially applies when the
systems are bought from externals.

Scrutinizing the accountability of the DPO is important because of the special position
the Regulation puts the DPO in. The DPO is obliged to report the organization he or
she is working for in case of infringements without that being a ground for
organizational reprimands although the reporting could cause large fines and
negative publicity for the organization. According to the European Data Protection
Supervisory (n.d.f) the organization employing the DPO is ultimately accountable for
compliance as they need to make sure they hire a DPO with sufficient knowledge of
the Regulation, alternatively training the DPO for the task. This interpretation would
thus make the DPO responsible but not accountable. In this study both the
interviewees from the public authority and the political organization stated that the
organization board was accountable. The interviewees of the global company, on the
other hand, mentioned that the DPO was accountable. The DPO’s special role as a
data protection intermediary makes it complicated to clearly define the areas of
responsibility.

8.4 Factors Influencing the Implementation of the Regulation

The organizational factors influencing the findings deserve to be discussed as they
largely impact the results of this study. These factors are cannot be classified as
65

unexpected findings but the extent to which they influence the organizations’
adoption of the Regulation is significant.

8.4.1 Time and Resources

Especially in the public authority it became clear that a lack of time impacted
compliance monitoring and ability to take part of guidance. The lack of time affected
the DPO’s possibility to make sure that the employees had gotten enough
information and it also led to the informed interviewee not having the resources to
take part of the information at the time of the enforcement. No general conclusions
can be made based on these findings but it is possible that the DPOs’ limited time
allocated for data protection issues could derive from the public authority’s financial
situation; the DPO is primarily employed for another role and handles data protection
issues on top of the other tasks. Depending on the other tasks’ urgency and
prioritization it could potentially lead to data protection issues coming in second hand
regardless of the DPO’s own preferences.

In a contrast to the public authority DPO, the global company DPO works full-time
with data protection issues and took part in the most extensive training compared to
the other case organization DPOs. What is also clear is that the global company has
more at stake in terms of personal data compared to the other case organizations.
This makes them more likely to encounter substantial fines in case of noncompliance. Therefore, the global company cannot easily compromise on the
resources allocated for data protection.

8.4.2 Organizational Structure

A decentralized organizational structure makes it challenging for the management to
control the data protection measures taken on lower levels of the structure. The
decentralization of the political organization resulted in challenges working out the
66

ownership of the personal data. Similar issues could occur for instance in companies
with several affiliates and subsidiaries. The legal form of the company, the
organizational structure and the number of employees it could impact the
appointment of a DPO or even DPOs along with defining the roles of collector and
processor. The global company solved this by having two DPOs, one for the company
as a whole and one responsible for the EU situated in an EU member state as is
required by the Regulation.

67

9 Conclusions
In this chapter the study is concluded. The chapter begins with a general conclusion,
it continues with a reflection on the limitations and contributions of the study. The
chapter is finalized with suggestions for further research.

The Regulation has been implemented in organizations through various measures
depending on the Regulation’s provisions, the case organizations’ starting positions
and needs. The implementation depends on factors such as the time and resources
devoted to the implementation as well as organizational structures. There are
however elements of the implementation that can be identified in more than one of
the case organizations. These are the establishment of a working group, trainings and
information about the Regulation for employees as well as DPO’s taking part in
training organized by external experts.

9.1 Reflections and Limitations of the Study

The main limitation of this study is the number of interviews, with only six interviews
the amount of data collected is small. Also, the small number of case organizations in
this study makes it difficult to draw any general conclusions making the findings of
this study representative for only the participating organizations. It is however
possible that the findings could come up in a similar kind of study that would not
research the implementation of the Regulation but the adoption of another legal
framework of the same magnitude and significance or another type of organizational
change. Also, the organizational cultures of the case organizations heavily influence
the findings. When an organizational culture values conformity with laws it is more
likely that the people working in the organization will make a higher effort with
compliance regardless of the law or regulation.

68

Because the data collection took place around one year after the enforcement of the
Regulation, important details might have been forgotten when the interviewees
reflected on the events. On the other hand, the interviewees could give review of the
events without being caught up in them at the same time.

There is a lot of criticism towards the Regulation, legal loopholes and grey areas
heavily influence how organizations choose to implement the Regulation. Although
some of them were mentioned, the study did not focus on them as the purpose was
not to examine the Regulation through its flaws. Although data subjects and their
rights are the very core of the Regulation the focus of this study has not been on the
data subject perspective of the implementation.

9.2 Research Contribution

This study has contributed with descriptions of how three organizations in Finland
have implemented the Regulation; how they prepared for the implementation, the
kind of guidance they used and how they deal with compliance. The study provides
an understanding of how organizations act when an external legal change with
significant consequences for non-compliance is enforced.

9.3 Suggestions for Further Research

Based on the findings and limitations of this study further research could be done on
how organizations align themselves with data protection and their data protection
agility. It could be fruitful to test employees’ knowledge of data security and the
threat it could potentially cause organizations in attempts of data breaches or similar
situations. Another suggestion for further research is the services and systems sold
to organizations meant to make their activities compliant with the Regulation and
their actual performance.
