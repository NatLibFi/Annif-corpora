reaction

Lactic acid and methyl lactate are platform molecules that hold great potential within the biorefinery industry.
They are currently produced through a combination of enzymatic and fermentation processes within the
industry, but the inefficient and costly nature of the procedure makes the catalytic route an interesting
alternative. In this work, the catalytic one-pot transformation of glucose to lactic acid and methyl lactate
using tin-loaded beta and faujasite catalysts was studied. The catalysts were produced using four different
metal grafting methods and a broad range of characterization methods were performed on fresh catalysts to
study the impact of the methods on both the catalyst properties and yield of reaction products. The
dealumination of both beta and faujasite resulted in higher product yields and treatment with alkali ions
should increase it further. Challenges with the analytical methods rendered the major part of the results
unusable, so the results were inconclusive and further optimization of the catalysts are needed for a sufficient
product yield to be achieved.

1. Introduction
Fossil resources have been staples of both the fuel and chemical industries for the past century and have
played a crucial role in accelerating economic growth. Due to their limited nature, potential future shortages
and the associated release of CO2 during processing and combustion, finding alternatives to these resources
is a requirement for the guaranteeing of future availability of raw materials and the economic and
environmental sustainability of the related industries. Nonedible biomass, such as lignocellulose, is a
promising substitute, thanks to its abundant availability, renewable nature and the more benign impact on the
CO2-levels [1].
One of the appealing ways to utilize biomass is to first convert it to either second generation biofuels
or platform molecules, such as monosaccharides, polyols, furans and acids. While the furans, such as furfural
and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), are currently viewed as promising steppingstones from biomass and
the biorefinery industry [2], the wide selection of available carbohydrates and the fact that they represent the
largest fraction of biomass hints at the untapped potential of carbohydrates within the field. An important
way of utilizing the potential of biomass is to transform the carbohydrates that can be derived from it into
lactic acid and alkyl lactates, which in turn can be converted into a multitude of important chemicals and
intermediates [3] [4]. The route from carbohydrates to lactic acid and then to acrylic acid is of particular
interest for a multitude of reasons that shall be discussed further in this thesis.
This thesis begins with a chapter about the molecules produced and used as feedstock for the reaction, after
which the relevant types of catalysis are described. Furthermore, the efficiency of the used catalysts are
summarized and how previous works on the topic have strived to produce catalysts with the desired properties
is explored. Thereafter the experimental procedure will be explained, starting with the methods used to
produce the multitude of interesting catalysts and how their characterization was performed. As the final part
of the experimental section, the procedure for the reaction itself is discussed, followed by the used analysis
methods and the challenges related to said methods. Finally, the achieved results and what conclusions and
indications can be made based on the findings will be discussed. Unfortunately, the time period available for
the research into the work related to this thesis was cut short due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and the
majority of the product analysis results were rendered unusable due to challenges related to the analysis
methods. Therefore, the amount of presented results will be somewhat lacking, but the quality of the achieved
results and what conclusions can be made based on previous research into the topic will be discussed.

1.1 Chemicals
It is important to be familiar with the chemical properties of both the feedstock carbohydrates and the
produced lactic acid to understand the reaction patterns relevant for this work. The following sub-chapters
describe both the use of the compounds in industrial applications and how their chemical properties can
present both advantages and disadvantages in different steps of the reaction.

1.1.1 Glucose
Glucose, visualized in Figure 1.1, is a good choice of feedstock because of its relatively simple structure
compared to other bulkier carbohydrates. This is an important attribute since complex carbohydrates may
interact in a negative manner with certain catalysts, which will be discussed further in the chapter about
zeolites. Glucose is also readily available in most forms of biomass since it is a monosaccharide and also
present in the structures of most di- and polysaccharides. Appendix A (Figures A.1 – A.3) contains the
structures of some carbohydrates to visualize this relation between glucose and the more complex
carbohydrate molecules.

Figure 1.1 – Glucose molecule [5]

The first step in the process is to transform glucose to fructose through aldose-ketose isomerization [6],
visualized in Figure 1.2. This is because glucose is too stable to readily be converted to for example alkyl
lactates and HMF, while fructose is better suited for the reaction [7]. Previously, the glucose isomerization
has been performed through enzymatic catalysis using D-xylose isomerase, but even though the bio-catalytic
route is highly selective it demands strict operational conditions, leading to a process with a low degree of
flexibility [7]. Moliner et al. [8] have reported that the catalyst Sn-Beta is able to catalyze the isomerization
process at conditions at which the enzymatic process would not be feasible and is hence an attractive
alternative to the traditional production routes. Bermejo-Deval et al. [9] proposed that the catalytic process

-2-

Simon Engblom
occurs in the manner that the Lewis acidic Sn-centers catalyze first the ring opening of the glucose chains
and thereafter the intramolecular hydride shift from the C2 to the C1 carbon atoms followed by the ketose
ring-closure. This reasoning was also shared by Choudhary et al. [10] who visualized the process in even
further detail and argued that the hydride shift was the rate-limiting step for the reaction. Further details of
the

properties

are

discussed

in

the

corresponding

chapters.

1.1.2 Lactic acid
Lactic acid (abbreviated LA) is the most widely occurring hydroxycarboxylic acid in nature and is used in
the production of biodegradable polymers, solvents and oxygenated chemicals [12] [13]. Currently, it is
mainly produced at an industrial scale through anaerobic fermentation of sucrose and glucose using microbial
fermentation [12], which circumvents the major issue of the thermal instability of carbohydrates thanks to
the biochemical nature of the procedure [14]. This process has a few complications that restrict the efficiency
of the fermentation. The acidity increases when LA is produced, which slowly deactivates the bacteria unless
a base is continuously added to neutralize the reaction mixture [11] [13]. Furthermore, the separation of the
LA from the fermentation broth is very energy-demanding since large amounts of salt waste are produced,
which require complex purification and separation steps to be removed [11] [13]. Due to these drawbacks
there is a need to develop cheaper and more efficient production routes for the LA, for the process to adhere
to the policies of green chemistry and economic feasibility.
Another group of acceptable products similar to LA are the alkyl lactates, with a special focus on
methyl lactate (abbreviated ML). In a continuous pilot plant study, Kamble et al. [15] described how it is
possible to hydrolyze ML to LA with a purity of 99.81 weight-%, using the produced LA itself as a catalyst.

Simon Engblom
Due to this potential pathway of simple autocatalyzed conversion of ML to LA and the amount of studies
that have focused on the transformation of sugars to ML, which will be described later in this thesis, this
work will mainly focus on ML as the desired final product.
The transformation of fructose to ML occurs through four main steps, visualized in Figure 1.3. Retroaldol condensation first converts the fructose to the C3 compounds glyceraldehyde and its isomer
dihydroxyacetone. These C3 compounds are thereafter transformed through sequential dehydration into
pyruvaldehyde followed either by methanol addition into pyruvaldehyde dimethylacetal (PADA) or a redox
step into the very thermodynamically stable ML [13] [16]. These PADA molecules can further be converted
into ML through a 1,2-hydride shift [16] also shown in Figure 1.3, but they can also unfortunately be
transformed to the side product 1,1,2,2-tetramethoxypropane [14]. During the retro-aldol condensation,
which is favored at high temperatures, the rate-determining step is the formation of a six-membered ring as
a transition state by one Sn active site bonding to an oxygen atom each on the C2 and C4 carbon atoms of
the fructose molecule [17].

1.1.3 Acrylic acid
Acrylic acid (abbreviated AA) is commonly used in the synthesis of a multitude of functional materials, such
as superabsorbent resins [18] and is currently being produced on an industrial scale through two-step
oxidation of propylene [19]. Due to the previously mentioned potential shortage of fossil resources, the
alternative route of sustainable one-step dehydration of LA to AA has garnered much attention in the past
years and is currently one of the most promising potential production routes for the future [20].
This work will not go into further details regarding AA, but it is important to emphasize the potential of the
chemical and the importance of researching new and more efficient ways to produce it, which highlights the
important role of LA in those scenarios.

1.2 Catalysis
Due to the issues connected to the biological approaches to convert renewable resources to high-value
chemicals, the usage of catalysts as an alternative would be an attractive approach. The catalytic route offers
relatively low production costs and no salt waste is produced [16], hence addressing the main concerns with
the traditional production route. This alternative also often presents improved process design options
compared to the biochemical routes, which results in relatively high yields and further reduced production
costs [16]. But this path is not without its own challenges. For example, according to Padovan et al. [21] the
solid catalysts that are currently being used on an industrial scale suffer from rapid deactivation. Naturally,
there are a multitude of factors that impact the efficiency of the catalysts. The used supports, metals and
additives, the preparation method and the reaction conditions to which the catalysts are exposed all interact
with each other and affect the attributes and performance of the catalysts [2]. To illustrate this matter, the rest
of the subchapters of chapter 1.2 are dedicated to describing the types of catalysts used in this work and what
attributes either hinder or promote the acquisition of the desired properties.

1.2.1 Heterogeneous versus homogeneous catalysis
Heterogeneous catalysis has been a key component in the development of the chemical industry and is by far
the largest segment of the current industrial catalyst market [22]. The often-solid nature of these catalysts
enables efficient separation of the reaction products from the catalysts in both batch and continuous processes
and offers the major advantage of high recyclability, unless they suffer from poor stability and subsequent
deactivation. This separability and recyclability have traditionally been the most distinguishing factors
between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Simply due to the fact that heterogeneous catalysts are
in a different phase than the reaction mixture they are catalyzing, they can utilize much simpler and less
costly separation methods than those that are available for the homogeneous alternative.
If proper separation of the catalyst and reaction mixture is not performed, the efficiency of the
chemical reaction will begin deteriorating. Hübner et al. [23] argued in their 2015 seminar study that the main
reason the pharmaceutical company at that time did not utilize immobilized transition metal complexes as
catalysts for the production of pharmaceutical compounds was the poor stability of the commercial
homogeneous catalysts. These old generation metal complexes would therefore suffer from notable metal
leaching, which in turn resulted in both contamination of the products as well as lower reaction rate and
selectivity compared to the results acquired under heterogeneous conditions.
Interestingly, this view of the commercial catalysts was in stark contrast to multiple studies on the
matter, which present how the newer immobilized catalysts tackle these issues and have been shown to
achieve high yields, very high recyclability and low levels of leaching [24] [25]. These new generation
catalysts bridge the gap between the conventional homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts and
subsequently have immense potential for the future development of the chemical industry. They have been
shown to act as a hybrid of a heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts by combining the possibility of easy
separation with the uniform active sites and high performance usually connected to homogeneous catalysis
[26]. Ciriminna et al. [22] therefore argued in their article Heterogeneous Catalysis Under Flow for the 21st
Century Fine Chemical Industry that this development will reshape the fields of fine chemical and
pharmaceutical manufacturing and catalyst development, especially due to the dramatically reduced
operation costs of reactions utilizing these new generation solid catalysts under continuous flow. Choudhary
et al. [10] presented similar arguments in their article Comparison of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous
Catalysts for Glucose-to-Fructose Isomerization in Aqueous Media and reasoned that learning from
homogeneous catalysis would assist in the future development of improved heterogeneous catalysts,

-6-

Simon Engblom
exhibiting both homogeneous and heterogeneous attributes. This indicates that homogeneous and
heterogeneous catalysis at some point would merge into this new seamless whole of catalysis, but since this
development is still quite futuristic, this work will focus solely on heterogeneous catalysis, simply due to its
topical value and the amount of research that has been conducted on the matter.

1.2.2 Zeolites
Zeolite is the designated term for aluminosilicates with three-dimensional structures consisting of cavities of
different sizes and highly porous and negatively charged surfaces [27]. These negative charges are displaced
by cations, when the zeolite is dissolved into an aqueous solution, resulting in the option of substituting the
cations with the desired cations of subjected metal solutions [28]. This option of tailoring a zeolite with
selected cations combined with the low production costs and high surface area make zeolites very attractive
catalysts.
The stannosilicate zeolite Sn-Beta has been observed to exhibit unique catalytic performance, due to
its Lewis acidic framework and Sn-sites, which are resistant to both polar and protic solvents, such as water
and alcohols [29] and the impacts which will be described later in this thesis. Thanks to these properties, SnBeta has been reported to perform exceptionally well specifically regarding the catalytic isomerization of
mono- and disaccharides to lactic acid and alkyl lactates, with both high activity and selectivity [13] [16]
[17]. It is important to note though, that Sn-Beta synthesized in a manner that creates large crystals (>1 μm)
and exclusive microporosity (<1 nm) suffers from diffusion limitations, since these structural attributes of
the catalyst limit the catalytic conversion of bulkier carbohydrates into target products [11]. Therefore, the
synthesis and metal modification methods have a profound impact on the final properties of the produced
catalyst and will be described in the following chapters in conjunction with the attributes crucial for the
transformation of glucose to ML.

-7-

Simon Engblom
1.2.3 Impact of metal modification methods
As has been previously hinted in this work, the incorporation of metal atoms into the zeolite framework is
essential for acquiring the desired properties of the catalyst. The zeolite framework and the metal atoms both
fill their corresponding roles and interact with each other in ways that produce catalytic properties not
achievable by using only one of them. Taarning et al. [13] described this in the article Zeolite-Catalyzed
Isomerization of Triose Sugars, where the incorporation of even low amounts of tin in the zeolite framework
of Beta lead to an increased activity in the formation of methyl lactate, in comparison to the usage of
homogeneous tin in the form of tin(IV) chloride pentahydrate (SnCl4·5H2O). Similarly, they concluded that
the usage of SnO2/Si-Beta and nanopowdered SnO2 also resulted in only trace amounts of formed methyl
lactate, further indicating that the incorporation of tin in the zeolite framework greatly improves the
selectivity

towards

ML.

Naturally, the methods used when incorporating the metal ions into the zeolite framework affect the
produced catalyst, some of which will be described in the experimental section of this thesis. This work will
mainly focus on post-synthetic metal grafting methods, since the majority of the articles that include modified
catalysts and have been referenced in this work have used that kind of methods. This post-synthesis strategy
has been the focus for multiple studies while exploring the potential of mesoporous Beta-based
metallosilicates in recent years [5] [30] [31]. The post-synthesis approach involves first either the
dealumination by acid treatment or desilication of aluminosilicate zeolites to create vacant sites and
mesopores, after which the metal ions are incorporated into the framework through condensation [5] [6] [30]
[31]. The resulting hierarchical Sn-Beta catalysts fit the description of a catalyst over which a high catalytic
efficiency can be achieved due to enhanced mass transfer. These suffer, however, from some negative
drawbacks, such as poor hydrothermal stability due to an abundance of hydrophilic silanols in the defective
sites in the framework and on the outer surface [32].
1.2.3.1 Structural and topological properties
Both the structural and topological qualities of a catalyst have a profound impact on the efficiency of catalysis
during reactions. The most immediate effect is the increased incorporation of metal ions in the framework
while using a mesoporous material compared to using a microporous zeolite, simply due to the increased
porosity [33] [34]. Similarly, the topology of the zeolite strongly affects the adsorption and diffusion of
carbohydrates in the pore structure [35].

-8-

Simon Engblom
A sufficiently large pore structure is needed to avoid mass transfer limitations and blockage of the
zeolite pores, while also retaining a regular distribution of the acid sites [36]. For example, during the aldoseketose isomerization of glucose to fructose it has been reported that catalysts with narrower pore structures
than Sn-Beta, such as MFI zeolites, exhibited lower activity than Sn-Beta [8] [37]. A possible way to increase
this limited reactivity would in that case be to introduce secondary pore systems and nanostructuring [38],
resulting in the type of zeolites referred to as hierarchical zeolites.
Zeolites with hierarchical porous structure have been reported to achieve catalytic performance
superior to the more conventional catalysts in a multitude of reactions and to have overall very promising
catalytic properties [37] [39]. This is partly due to the fact that the hierarchical structure enables an increased
level of Sn loading in the framework [6]. Hierarchical pores have also been reported to alleviate the steric
hindrance during the transition state from fructose to ML, due to their large diameters [11]. This facilitates
the cleavage of the carbon bonds in the fructose molecule, resulting in a more efficient conversion to ML
[11].
1.2.3.2 Lewis acidity and Brønsted acidity
Similarly to the incorporation of tin, the selectivity towards ML was also deemed to be tightly connected
with the Lewis acidity of the catalyst when using triose sugars as substrates in methanol [13]. Taarning et al.
argued in their article Zeolite-Catalyzed Isomerization of Triose Sugars that the conversion of fructose to ML
can achieve a high selectivity towards ML using a zeolite that features redox activity, since the formation of
ML molecules requires a redox step in the reaction pathway [13]. They similarly described how the redox
step resembles the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction with its opposite Oppenauer oxidation (combined
abbreviation MPVO-redox), where a ketone or an aldehyde is reduced by an alcohol in the presence of a
Lewis-acidic catalyst [13] [40]. This seems reasonable since catalysts that are known to exhibit highly active
MPVO-redox properties include zeolites with low or no Brønsted acidity, such as Sn-Beta. Taarning et al.
[13] also described how their experiments indicated that Brønsted acidic catalysts were selective towards the
formation of side products such as PADA instead of ML. Based on these findings Sn-Beta, which has strong
Lewis-acid Sn sites embedded in its framework, seems to be a promising catalyst for glucose transformation
to ML.
On the other hand, Wang et al. [41] demonstrated in one of their studies how a Brønsted acid showed
a high catalytic activity and selectivity for the transformation of trioses into ML. This is in strict contrast to
the previously mentioned studies that described how a lack of Brønsted acidity and high levels of Lewis

-9-

Simon Engblom
acidity result in high yields of ML. On the contrary, Guo et al. [42] recently described how Brønsted acids
catalyze fructose dehydration into HMF, which in this work is regarded as a side product. Thus, the main
focus in this work is to increase the Lewis-acidity of the catalysts, while striving to limit their Brønsted
acidity and studying its impact.
1.2.3.3 Hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity
The hydrophobic nature of the Sn centers in the Beta framework is essential for the catalyst to be active in
water medium during the transformation of glucose and LA to ML, because the water competes with the
sugar molecules for the adsorption onto the active sites [43]. This indicates that the hydrophobicity also
mitigates the inactivation of the Sn sites, since overall adsorption of water is hindered. The impact of this
hydrophobicity has been further emphasized in the work of Wang et al. [44], where they described how the
catalytic performance of metallosilicate zeolites containing isolated heteroatoms in their framework depends
on their hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. Tang et al. [11] similarly showed in their experiment how
the catalysts with the highest hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity respectively both were amongst the top three
catalysts that exhibited the highest recorded yields of ML from glucose in methanol medium after 6 h. It is
worth emphasizing that the most hydrophobic sample in this specific experiment achieved the by far highest
yield of about 52 % at 160 °C and 0.5 MPa N2 atmosphere with 5 ml methanol, 80 mg catalyst and 124 mg
glucose, most likely due to the relative lack of defect silanol sites, hence hindering the conversion from
fructose to C3 molecules [11].
Dealumination and desilication of a zeolite result in an especially large increase in hydrophilic sites,
since they create large amounts of hydrophilic defect silanol nests, which function as grafting sites for the
metal in the zeolite framework [6] [45]. These methods similarly introduce mesopores into the zeolite
framework [45], the impact of which was described in a previous chapter. But Graaff et al. [6] argued that
dealumination of both the MFI-nanosheet and Beta zeolites and the subsequent increase in mesopores in
general do not strongly affect the zeolite texture, which was also indicated by their acquired physisorption
data after incorporating Sn into the frameworks. This would mean that both the zeolite structure and
crystallinity would be preserved during dealumination, which Graaff et al. also reasoned [6], indicating that
the dealumination would not lead to any deterioration of the framework if performed correctly.
In this thesis, the dealuminated nature of a catalyst will be referred to with the prefix deAl, indicating
that the acidic dealumination procedure that will be described in the experimental section has been performed.

1.2.3.4 Stability and the impact of water
As has been previously mentioned, solid catalysts used within the industry suffer from rapid rates of
deactivation [21]. This is a major issue, since a catalyst with bad stability and a subsequent high rate of
deactivation would not be widely usable on an industrial scale, no matter how high a selectivity towards the
desired product it exhibits, since it is often required to operate continuously over a sufficient period of time.
It is therefore crucial to explore potential ways of increasing the stability of a catalyst or finding stable
alternatives to it, while striving to not impair its properties to a degree that affects the selectivity.
The primary factors that affect the rate and extent of catalyst deactivation are the reaction conditions,
with particular emphasis on the temperature and choice of solvent [46]. As an example of this behavior, SnBeta exhibits higher stability during glucose isomerization when the reaction is performed in pure methanol
than in water [47]. Further emphasizing the importance of the solvent; a mixture of dioxane with 2.5 – 5
weight-% water has recently been reported to greatly improve the stability of Sn-Beta during glucose
isomerization, in comparison to reactions in pure dioxane [42]. It is therefore reasonable to argue that each
reaction setup - with its choice of catalyst, solvent, temperature and so forth - have its own optimal balance
of the parameters with regards to the catalyst stability.
Regarding the use of Sn-Beta in particular, Padovan et al. [21] suggested adding water to the reaction
mixture, specifically in the cases of glucose isomerization to fructose and the subsequent transformation of
fructose to alkyl lactates, to improve the overall stability of the catalyst. They reported that an addition of up
to 10 weight-% water to the mixture of methanol and sugars increased the catalyst stability by one order of
magnitude and resulted in a very limited loss of catalyst activity after 1366 hours of continuous operation
[21]. Furthermore, the overall reactivity was increased by a factor of 2.5 by this simple addition of water.
They argued that this behavior was due to the water impacting the reactions in four separate ways: (I)
decreasing the rate of restructuring within the organic matrix, (II) decreasing the rate at which the active sites
were poisoned by either inhibiting poison formation altogether or removing the poison in situ, (III) decreasing
the extent of coking and pore fouling by hindering the formation and accumulation of carbon-based residues
and finally (IV) improving the performance of a particular type of active site [21]. Regardless of the specific
reason why water has this positive impact on the reaction, this work aimed to also study the impact of
different amounts of water in this reaction and thereby strive to find the optimal balance between the reaction
parameters and the ratios of methanol/dioxane and water as liquid medium.

1.2.4 Catalyst suitability for methyl lactate production
After describing the properties required for a catalyst to produce a sufficient yield of ML during glucose
transformation in methanol, the logical question is: in what manner the metal modification method should be
optimized to tailor the synthesized Sn-Beta and its Lewis and Brønsted acidity? Based on the previously
presented material, the improvement of the catalytic properties requires the balancing of the amount of
defective sites, while also carefully regulating the divergence between the Lewis acid-related sites and the
silanols located on the defects, hence balancing the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties [48].
The article that initially described the highest achieved yield of ML by Iglesias et al. [49] was
subsequently used as the theoretical basis for this work. They reported that the previously mentioned postsynthesis strategy, consisting of dealumination and metal grafting, combined with treatment with alkaline
ion exchange produces Y-zeolites that could achieve over 45 mol-% yield of ML at 170 °C after 6 h with 1 g
catalyst loading and 4.8 g glucose in 100 ml methanol [49]. This is because the treatment with alkali metal cations

removes Brønsted acid sites by ion exchange, which in turn switches their selectivity from the formation of
side products, such as methyl levulinate, to the promotion of retro-aldol condensation pathways, yielding ML
as the main product. Tolborg et al. [50] have similarly described how alkali ions can be added directly to the
reaction mixture to achieve results similar to those obtained when using alkali metal treated catalysts. While
the exact manner in which alkali ions improve the selectivity towards ML is not clear, they compared their
obtained results of up to 75 % yield of ML using alkali salts with 30 % yield in the absence of alkali ions,
while converting 0.45 g sucrose to ML in 15 g methanol using 0.15 g catalyst at 170 °C for 16 h [50]. Due to
these promising results, the alkali ion exchange method used by Iglesias et al. has been studied in this work
parallel to the laboratory’s staple post-synthesis metal grafting methods of evaporation impregnation (EIM),
ion exchange (IE) and deposition precipitation (DP).

1.3 Scope
The aim of this work was to perform glucose isomerization to fructose and subsequent fructose
transformation to either ML or LA in a batch reactor setup using a one-pot approach to the reaction chain.
The catalysts used and analyzed were tin- and cerium-based on different supports, prepared by the postsynthetic metal grafting methods EIM, IE, DP or AIE and had varying metal loading. The supports used were
H-Beta- and H-Y-zeolites, seen in Appendix A (Figure A.7 - A.8), with varying ratios of silica to alumina,
since both of them have been used in the theory previously described in this work. The catalysts that were
prepared using the AIE-method were dealuminated and treated with alkaline ion-exchange according to the
methods described by Iglesias et al. [49], using different concentrations of aqueous sodium chloride solutions.
To be able to pinpoint the vital reaction parameters and attributes of the catalysts for the desired reactions
the following tests were planned:
•

Characterization of fresh, spent, washed and regenerated Beta and Y catalysts with different
Al/Si ratios, to determine the impact of both reaction and catalyst metal grafting method on
surface area, metal loading, particle distribution, Lewis and Brønsted acidity, etc.

•

Varying of the ratio of feedstock to catalyst, type of catalyst, type of solvent and reaction
temperature at 30 bar N2 pressure to determine the optimal reaction parameters.

•

Experiments with zinc oxide as a catalyst, due to the promising results of a parallel project.

•

Blank experiment to determine the impact of the catalyst.

•

Experiments with spent, washed and regenerated catalysts to determine the recyclability and
stability of the catalyst.

•

Hot filtrate test to determine the leaching of the catalyst.

•

Experiments with and without added water to determine its impact on the stability and
selectivity of the catalyst.

2.1 Catalysts
All metal dealumination, metal grafting and ion exchange were performed at the laboratory to be able to
investigate the impact of each preparation step on the attributes of both the incomplete and complete catalysts.
ZnO was included in this work to study its potential in comparison to the zeolites, due to the promising results
Dr. Atte Aho had achieved using the non-calcinated catalyst in his work parallel to this one.
2.1.1 Zeolites
Experiments using catalysts based on the Y-zeolite was the initial focus, since Iglesias et al. [49] had achieved
satisfactory levels of yield with it. Beta-zeolite was also included in the project, due to its state-of-the-art
properties described previously and analyzed and tested in parallel with the Y-zeolite to compare their
properties and overall results.
Since a central goal in the project was to identify the catalyst characteristics with the biggest impact
on the yield of produced ML and LA, the ratio between alumina and silica on the carrier material was also
varied. Therefore, the studied zeolites were Y-5.1, Beta-38 and Beta-300 in conjunction with dealuminated
Y-5.1 and Beta-38 in which the number denotes the Si/Al ratio.

2.1.2 Metal grafting methods
All metal grafted catalysts were produced in batches of approximately 11 g each and with a focus on postsynthetic metal grafting methods. The metal precursors used were stannous chloride (SnCl3) supplied by
Sigma-Aldrich and cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3) supplied by Honeywell Fluka. The amount
of each compound used in the metal grafting methods of evaporation impregnation, ion exchange and
deposition precipitation all followed the specifics described in Table 2 below, while the procedure used in
the alkaline ion exchange is documented in the corresponding chapter. The impact on the pH of the metal
precursors, the used zeolite and method has been documented in Table 4.

2.1.2.1 Evaporation impregnation (EIM)
The metal precursor was dissolved in distilled water, after which the zeolite was mixed into the solution and
the pH was measured. The mixture was then attached to a rotating evaporator, pictured in Figure A.10, and
mixed at approximately 50 rpm at 60 °C for 24 h.
After the reaction was completed the pH was measured and the water was evaporated from the
mixture using a separate vacuum rotary evaporator, using the setup of 50 rpm and 60 °C for approximately
1.5 h until the remaining precipitate was completely dry. The catalyst was then gathered and stored for future
calcination before being ready to use.

- 16 -

Simon Engblom
2.1.2.2 Ion Exchange (IE)
The metal precursor was dissolved in distilled water, after which the zeolite was mixed into the solution and
the pH was measured. The mixture was then put under a mixer, pictured in Figure A.11, where the reaction
occurred during stirring at 154 – 156 rpm for 24 h at room temperature.
After the completion of the reaction the pH was measured, and the catalyst was filtered from the
liquid using vacuum filtration with 589/1 filter papers of the manufacturer Whatman, after which it was
washed twice with 1 l of distilled water. The washed catalyst was left to dry at room temperature overnight,
after which it was collected and stored for future calcination.

2.1.2.3 Deposition Precipitation (DP)
The metal precursor was dissolved in distilled water, after which the zeolite was mixed into the solution and
the pH was measured. Similar to the ion exchange, the mixture was put under a mixer and stirred at 154 –
156 rpm. The key difference was that the pH was adjusted to approximately 10 by slowly adding drops of
32% ammonia solution during the stirring. When the pH had surpassed 9.84 the container was covered with
aluminum foil and the reaction was conducted at room temperature for 24 h while being stirred at 154 – 156
rpm.
After the reaction had finished the pH was measured and the catalyst was filtered from the liquid
using vacuum filtration with 589/1 filter papers of the manufacturer Whatman and thereafter washed twice
with 1 l of distilled water. The washed catalyst was left to dry at room temperature overnight, after which it
was collected and stored for future calcination.

2.1.2.4 Alkaline ion exchange (AIE)
The alkaline ion exchange method differed drastically from the previously mentioned metal grafting methods
since it was far more complex and demanded both more time and larger amounts of chemicals. While the
other used methods consisted of metal grafting, filtration, washing with distilled water, drying and
calcination, the AIE-method consisted of three different reactions, all followed by filtration, washing, drying
and calcination, performed consecutively after each other. The three main reactions were as follows:

- 17 -

Simon Engblom
1. Dealumination
2. Metal grafting
3. Alkaline ion exchange

The dealumination was performed by mixing 10 g of the zeolite with 500 ml of an aqueous HNO3-solution
with the molarity of either 1 or 10 M, to study the impact of the dealumination on the attributes of the catalyst.
The pH of the mixture was measured, and the liquid was then stirred for 1 h with 154 – 156 rpm after which
the pH was measured again.
The metal grafting consisted of adding the dealuminated zeolite to 1.05 g SnCl3 per used gram of
zeolite and stirring them in 100 ml isopropanol per used gram of zeolite at 50 rpm for 7 hours. Note that the
washing in this step was done by using isopropanol instead of distilled water.
Finally, the alkaline ion exchange was performed by mixing the catalyst with an aqueous solution of alkaliearth metals with the concentration of either 1 or 7 M. The mixture was then stirred at 154 – 156 rpm for 4
hours.
Based on the data given by Iglesias et al. [49] we calculated that the obtained catalyst would have the
distribution of its compounds described in Table 3. Please note that the calculated amounts of K and Na
correspond to the Sn-levels described underneath, if that specific alkali metal was used. The Al amount would
remain the same in both cases.

2.1.3 Calcination
Calcination is the process were the catalysts were heat-treated in a way that caused the metal precursors to
decompose and the calcination temperature affected the catalysts dispersion and surface area in a way that
improves the catalysts’ activity. Since the calcination was performed in an air flow oven, the catalysts were
activated through oxidation.
The calcination followed a 5-step scheme, where the duration and temperature used in each step
corresponded to the type of catalyst being calcined. The schemes used for each studied type of catalyst can
be found in Appendix C.

2.2 Catalyst characterization methods
2.2.1 Liquid nitrogen physisorption
The specific surface areas (SSA) and pore size distribution of the catalysts were determined by liquid nitrogen
physisorption using a Micromeritics 3Flex Surface Characterization Analyzer of the model 3Flex
Physisorption and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory [51].

Before the characterization was

performed, a sample of 0.25 g of the catalyst was pretreated by outgassing at 150 °C ex situ under vacuum
for a minimum of 18 hours, after which it was outgassed at 150 °C in situ under vacuum for a further 4 hours.
After the pretreatment was completed the automated characterization commenced and the computer program
calculated the surface area using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller formula for porous materials and DubininRadushkevich equation for zeolites.

2.2.2 Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
Pyridine FTIR was used to determine the Brønsted and Lewis acidity of the surfaces of the catalysts using
pyridine as a probe molecule [52]. The equipment used was the model ATI Mattson FTIR while the amount
of acid sites were calculated based on the molar extinction constant by Emeis [53].
All samples were pressed into disks of 0.02 – 0.035 g after which they were pretreated in the in-situ
cell by heating to 450 °C in vacuo and held at that temperature for 1 h. After the pretreatment the wafer was
cooled to 100 °C and the background spectrum of the sample was produced by combining two consecutive
background measurements. The pyridine was then introduced to the cell and adsorbed on the sample during
a 30 min period, after which the desorption occurred at 250, 350 and 450 °C and held for 1 h. The sample
spectrum was recorded between each of the 3 temperature ramps and the scanning was performed at 100 °C
under vacuum conditions. From this result, the spectral bands at 1450 cm-1 and 1545 cm-1 were used to
identify the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites for each sample.

2.2.3 Temperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD)
Temperature programmed desorption of CO2 was used to determine the amount of basic sites on the catalysts.
This is possible due to the acidic nature of CO2, meaning that the equipment registers the rate of desorption
of the CO2 molecules from the catalyst, resulting in a shift in the gas-levels corresponding to the level of
basicity. The analysis was performed using an instrument of the model Micrometrics AutoChem 2910.

- 20 -

Simon Engblom
The program used for CO2-TPD consisted of first heating the sample to 600 °C at 10 °C/min, after
which the temperature was held for 1 h. The adsorption of CO2 on the sample was then conducted during 30
min and the program finished by flushing the system with helium to remove the physisorbed CO2.

2.2.4 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
Transmission electron microscopy was performed using a microscope of the model Jeol JEM-1400 Plus
located in the Laboratory of Electron Microscopy at the University of Turku. The equipment was used to
measure the metal particle distribution and size as well as the structure of fresh catalyst.

2.2.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy-Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX)
Scanning electron microscopy was performed in conjunction with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
using a system comprising of a Zeiss Leo Gemini 1530 microscope equipped detectors suited for detecting
backscattered and secondary electrons, such as silicon drift detectors. Using this setup, the morphology and
elemental composition of the catalysts was analyzed [54]. For the method to be successful, each sample was
first coated in a thin layer of carbon particles to introduce a conductive material to the otherwise nonconductive catalysts.

2.3 Reactor system
The glucose transformation was carried out in a 300 ml batch reactor system, pictured in Figure A.9, of the
manufacturer PARR Instruments. The autoclave was equipped with a mechanical stirrer, which was set to
600 rpm during the flushing and heating of the reactor and 1200 rpm during the reaction itself.
The autoclave was fitted with a 1 μm filtered sampling outlet, which was meant to prevent the catalyst
particles from passing through it, but all samples were nonetheless filtered in a manner that will be described
in the experimental procedure. A waste sample was taken before each sample to clean the sampling line of
any residue. The autoclave was heated by connecting a separate heating mantle to it. The temperature and
stirring speed were measured using a thermocouple of the manufacturer Brooks Instrument and controlled
automatically to fit the input settings.

2.4 Experimental procedure
The catalyst was first placed in a 70 °C hot air oven for a minimum of 18 hours for drying, after which 0.5 g
of it was measured and placed in the reactor. As anhydrous D-(+)-glucose was used as feedstock for the
reaction, 2.4 g of glucose was similarly measured and placed in the reactor. The exact ratio between catalyst
and glucose was documented throughout the experiments but was kept as close to 1:4.8 as possible, except
when the influence of the ratio was investigated. The catalyst had been milled to particle size below 90 μm
and was dried in a hot air oven before being used. As solvent either ≥ 99.9% methanol or 1,4-dioxane was
used and in some experiments 6.93 weight-% ion exchanged water was added to the methanol or 5.33 weight% to the dioxane, to test the impact of water on the reaction.
After the mixture was prepared, the reactor was sealed and purged by flowing nitrogen gas (ACA
99.999 %) through the system at 10 bar for a minimum of 10 minutes, while 600 rpm stirring was applied.
Thereafter the gas vents were shut off and the reactor was heated to the desired temperature at approximately
7.65 °C/min, while the mixing was still being applied.
After the temperature had stabilized the stirring speed was increased to 1200 rpm and the pressure
was adjusted to 30 bar by introducing nitrogen gas into the reactor. This naturally lowered the temperature a
bit, which was allowed to stabilize once again at the desired temperature for a few minutes. Due to the
difficulty of precisely controlling the pressure during the heating of the reactor the final pressure varied
slightly between the experiments. The pressure fluctuated similarly after each sample but stabilized after a
few minutes.
After the temperature had stabilized the experiment commenced by taking the first sample at minute
0. The remaining samples were taken after 20, 40, 60, 120 and 180 minutes, after which the mixing speed
was lowered to 600 rpm and the reactor was cooled down by introducing room temperature water to the
reactor mantle. All samples were filtered using Acrodisc LC syringe filters with 0.45 μm PVDF membrane
from the manufacturer PALL to get rid of any residue catalysts and diluted with ion-exchanged water at a
ratio 1:3. The resulting concentration of each diluted sample was documented for all experiments.

2.5 Analysis of products
Due to the limitations and challenges corresponding to each piece of analytical equipment used for analyzing
the liquid samples, we used a combination of LC, NMR and GC-MS to identify the unknown products and
strived to develop a suitable analysis method for the reaction. Similarly, the samples were pretreated in
different manners to adjust them to the conditions required by each analysis method; in ways such as dilution
and silylation, which will be described in further detail later in this thesis.

2.5.1 Product identification
As was indicated by the list of chemicals used for LC calibration shown in the beginning of chapter 2, there
was a high diversity of possible compounds in all samples. This is natural, due to the multiple reaction steps
necessary for glucose transformation to ML and is also to be expected from the use of catalysts with both
acidic and basic properties.
2.5.1.1 Liquid Chromatography (LC)
Liquid chromatography was initially the primary method of identifying the products. The chromatograph
was equipped with a 300 x 7.8 mm HPX-87H column from the manufacturer Aminex and both refractive
index (RI) and ultraviolet (UV) detectors were used to identify and quantify the compounds in each sample.
While these detectors used different methods for performing these tasks, their unifying attributes are that they
both expressed their findings as chromatograms, where each compound was shown as a peak at an unique
retention time (RT), and used 0.005 M sulfuric acid as an eluent. To pinpoint what RT corresponded to what
compound and to be able to quantify them, 35 calibration curves were made by analyzing samples taken from
50 ml vials containing 10, 5 and 2.5 mg/ml of the molecule analyzed. A few drops of methanol were added
to the vials in cases where the compounds were insoluble in ion-exchanged water but did not affect the
resulting calibration curves notably. The calibration curves that were made using the RI analysis method are
shown in Appendix B, while the UV calibration curves were deemed unnecessary due to challenges explained
in chapter 3.2.1 Challenges with product analysis.

- 23 -

Simon Engblom
2.5.1.2 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a method to identify and quantify the compounds of a sample,
by excitation of the nucleus of the compounds with radio waves. This results in nuclear magnetic resonance
unique to the intramolecular magnetic field of each atom and thereby allows the identification of the
functional groups of each molecule.
A few of the samples used in this work was analyzed by Jani Rahkila of the Laboratory of Organic
Chemistry at Åbo Akademi University to identify some of the unknown compounds. The NMR spectra were
recorded using a Bruker AVANCE III spectrometer equipped with a BB/1H SmartProbe operating at 500.10
MHz (1H) and 125.8 MHz (13C). Before each analysis, the samples were dissolved in deuterated methanol
and all chemical shifts are referenced to the internal standard tetramethylsilane (δ1H / δ13C = 0 ppm). Each run
lasted 1 h, all spectra were recorded at 25 °C and a standard set of 1H, 13C, DQF-COSY, HSQC (multiplicity
edited, CH/CH3 signals positive, CH2 signals negative) and HMBC was recorded.
2.5.1.3 Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
Gas chromatography was used in combination with mass spectrometry at the Laboratory of Natural Materials
Technology at Åbo Akademi University to identify the compounds in the samples. The equipment used a
HP-1 column from the manufacturer Agilent and used 100 % dimethylpolysiloxane as the stationary phase.
The functionality of GC-MS relies on the difference in affinity for different compounds towards the
stationary phase, resulting in the separation of the different chemicals as they elute along the column. The
analysis method is usually not applicable on carbohydrates since sugars break down through caramelization
during the process, but this can be overcome using derivatization, which will be described in the following
chapter.
Annika Smeds and Jarl Hemming of the Laboratory of Natural Materials Technology at Åbo Akademi
University provided guidance regarding the derivatization and analyzed some of the samples in an effort to
develop an analysis method suitable for the reaction.

- 24 -

Simon Engblom
2.5.1.3.1 Silylation
Since sugars break down through the process of caramelization before they can vaporize at high temperatures
it is not possible to analyze them in GC-MS in their normal state. Similarly, the FID detector often used
during GC-analysis often has a low response rate for carbonyl and carboxylic compounds, since these
moieties do not form ions in a flame [55].
One way of overcoming these challenges is to derivatize them via silylation – the introduction of a
substituted silyl group to the hydroxyl group. By etherification of the hydroxyl groups the sample becomes
more volatile. detectability is increased and caramelization is inhibited, thus making the use of GC-MS
possible. Trimethylsilyl ethers are popular silylation agents for saccharides and polyalcohols but possess the
drawback of reacting with water. Therefore, it was crucial that the samples obtained in this work were
evaporated in a manner that the silylation agents could be added to completely dry samples.
The way that the silylation was performed was through five steps: dilution of sample, addition of
internal standards, evaporation, addition of silylation agents and finally the reaction itself. Since the majority
of all samples had the initial concentration of glucose feedstock of 48 mg/ml, 1 ml of each sample was diluted
in 47 ml methanol to produce a mixture with 1 mg/ml of sample. From this solution 1 ml was taken and
mixed with 50 μl of a premade standard solution, containing 1.014 mg/ml resorcinol and 1.05 1,2,3,4tetrahydronaphtalene (THN). This mixture was thereafter evaporated in a water bath of 40 °C under nitrogen
flow to remove all traces of methanol and water.
After all liquid had been evaporated 20 μl pyridine, 20 μl trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) and 80 μl
bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) were added to the sample and the container was shaken
vigorously. Finally, the sample was kept in 70 °C hot air oven for 40 min for the desired silylation reaction
to occur. The obtained sample was analyzed within the day to minimize the impact of compound
deterioration.

3. Results and discussion
Based on the theory presented in chapter 1, the laboratory specialist on catalyst synthesis Narendra Kumar
recommended the studying of 43 different catalysts with varying combinations of used zeolites, Al/Si ratios,
metal loadings and metal grafting methods for one-pot transformation of glucose to ML. Out of these 43
catalysts 22 were successfully produced, 6 were used for performing the reaction with different parameters
and 5 had 3 or more properties successfully characterized before the work had to end due to previously
mentioned reasons. These catalysts are described in Table 5.

Note that the alkaline ion exchange metal grafting method includes some steps deemed unfeasible
both regarding their basis in questionable reasoning and due to them not being executable with the available
laboratory equipment, such as mixing at 500 rpm. The questionable steps included procedures such as treating
the zeolites with potassium ions, the precursors of which in most cases break down the zeolite framework.
This was proven in this work when treating both the Beta- and Y-zeolites with KOH of a concentration as
low as 1 M dissolved the zeolites completely. Therefore, these steps were adapted in accordance with the
equipment and knowledge provided by the laboratory to aim to improve the results further.

3.1 Catalyst characterization results
Based on the previous research described in chapter 1 there are a handful of catalyst attributes that seem to
correspond to a high ML yield. The characterizations were therefore performed to find catalysts exhibiting
these properties, the results of which would work as the basis for synthesis of further optimized catalysts.
The desired attributes are as follow:
•

High mass transfer

•

Hydrophilic silanol nests, that could work as efficient metal grafting sites on unloaded catalysts

•

Hydrophobic metal sites on loaded catalysts

•

High Lewis acidity

•

Low or no Brønsted acidity

•

High mesopority, preferably forming hierarchical structure

•

Low or no microporosity to hinder blockage by coking

3.1.1 Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmission electron microscopy was performed on nine different fresh catalysts, described in Table 6. All
studied catalysts had been calcinated according to their respective calcination schemes, described in
Appendix C, before analysis. TEM images and their corresponding histograms of the studied catalysts are
shown in Figures 3.1 – 3.9. Additional TEM images are shown in Appendix D.

At minimum of two images of each catalyst were studied using the analysis software ImageJ, developed by
the National Institutes of Health and the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation at the
University of Wisconsin, to obtain data regarding the metal particle size distributions and channel size
distributions. To minimize potential inaccuracies due to the vague visibility of the fine details in the pictures,
the used images were of different scales and a minimum of 80 measurements per catalyst – with the exception
of Sn-H-Beta-300 where not enough particle agglomerations were visible and deAl-Sn-H-Y-5.1 where barely
any channels were visible - were taken at randomly chosen locations, both for the metal particle and channel
sizes. Using this information, histograms were created to depict the distributions of said sizes of metal
particles and channels, shown in Figures 3.1 – 3.9. In an effort to make the reasoning behind potential
conclusions drawn from these results easier to follow in text medium and to minimize the space needed for
text in the histograms, the size distribution of metal particle agglomerations will be called “metal particle
size distribution” for the remainder of this chapter.

The first observation that can be made from these results is the difference in the shape of each catalyst. Betacatalysts have rounded shapes while the Y-catalysts consist of more polygonal shapes. Secondly, it is
apparent that the different metal modification methods produce catalysts with vastly different metal particle
sizes, while the channel sizes vary to a much lesser degree. While only one catalyst produced using DP was
studied, its metal particles varied in size much more than those of EIM- and IE-catalysts and were overall
less numerous. It seems like the adjustment of pH performed during DP heavily restricts the deposition of
metal particles on the zeolite, since the procedure is otherwise identical to that of IE. The IE metal grafting
method produced catalysts with the narrowest metal particle size distribution, resulting in more uniform
morphology, while the EIM-catalysts had a slightly wider metal particle size distribution. Both the IEcatalysts and EIM-catalysts were observed to have an even distribution of the abundant metal particle
agglomerations, while the agglomerations observed on the DP-catalyst were much fewer and more spaciously
distributed.
The dealumination of zeolites and catalysts seemingly does not affect the channel size distribution to
any notable degree. The metal particle size distribution, on the other hand, differs heavily from the nondealuminated samples that were produced using EIM or IE. While the observed metal particle sizes seem to
fluctuate around 3.40 nm, numerous observations of both smaller and larger metal particle agglomerations
concentrated in local centra were made. The impact of this very wide metal particle size distribution on the
results of the experiments remains to be studied later in this work. It would similarly be interesting to study
the impact of the experiment on the morphology of the catalysts.

The amount of desorbed pyridine at the different temperatures denote the acid sites of different strengths:
•

Signals at 250 °C denotes weak, medium and strong acid sites

•

Signals at 350 °C denotes medium and strong acid sites

•

Signals at 450 °C only strong acid sites

The resulting spectra consisted of bands of particular interest at 1608, 1490 and 1447 cm-1, since these are
associated with pyridine adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites of the catalyst [11]. If these bands are clearly visible
and distinguishable, it indicates that the incorporation of metal species into the zeolite framework resulted in
the generation of Lewis acidity, according to Tang et al. [56]. The results from the pyridine FTIR are
described in Table 9.

3.1.4 Liquid nitrogen physisorption
Liquid nitrogen physisorption was successfully performed on five different catalysts, described in Table 10.
The analysis of dealuminated catalysts in particular caused issues with the in situ outgassing of the samples:
while the outgassing ex situ was successful, the analysis equipment was not adjusted to the outgassing of
dealuminated samples, leading to prolonged duration of the process and in most cases automatic cancellation
of the analysis. Therefore, only one dealuminated catalyst was successfully studied.

According to Beck et al. [57], a material is typically classified as having large pores if it has a surface area
above 700 m2/g. Similarly, it is classified as microporous if it has a pore width of less than 2 nm (20 Å) and
mesoporous if it has a pore width between 2 nm and 50 nm (20 - 500 Å) [57] [58]. Based on these
classifications all studied catalysts can be deemed microporous.

While the sample size is too low to find comprehensive patterns, the results give some indications to
the influence of the metal grafting methods. It is immediately apparent that the metal grafting method has a
decisive impact on the surface area of the catalyst. The acid treatment used in deposition precipitation (DP)
resulted in much lower surface areas than those of the catalysts synthesized through evaporation impregnation
(EIM) or ion exchange (IE). DP resulted in 23.43 % lower surface area than IE, when comparing Sn-H-Y5.1-DP to Sn-H-Y-5.1-IE. Similarly, DP resulted in 42.01 % lower surface area than EIM, when comparing
Sn-H-Beta-300-DP to Sn-H-Beta-300-EIM.
But the catalyst with the lowest measured surface area was the dealuminated samples synthesized
through alkaline ion exchange (AIE). The surface area of deAl-Sn-H-Y-5.1 treated with 1 M HNO3 was
73.67 % lower than that of the catalyst with the second lowest surface area, Sn-H-Beta-300-DP. This is
logical due to the both chemically and mechanically intensive treatment of the catalyst that AIE includes,
since they would wear down the outer structure of the catalyst framework, resulting in both the lower surface
area and pore volume.

3.2 Sample analysis
By calibrating the RI-detector of the LC for the molecules that theoretically could be produced during glucose
transformation to ML, a library of RT was obtained, described in Table 12. Using this library, each reaction
sample was studied, but due to reasons explained in chapter 3.2.1 Challenges with product analysis no exact
yield of ML or LA could be calculated. The presence of glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone and
pyruvaldehyde in the samples indicated that the proposed reaction pathway of Holm et al. [16] in Figure 1.3

The obtained chromatogram using the RI-detectors for the initial tests with Sn-H-Beta and Ce-H-Beta
consistently confirmed the presence of over 15 different compounds (up to 50 in some cases) in all samples
taken after the 20 min mark, during the reaction. This vast amount proved the significant need to further
optimize the catalyst and reaction parameters. Naturally, the risk of contamination is always present, but
since all samples were handled identically and the number of compounds remained unchanged on multiple
occasions of repeated reactions and subsequent analyses the logical conclusion is that the majority of these
compounds were results of side reactions. A few of the regularly appearing compounds remained
unidentified, but by consulting previous research within the field some indications to the nature of these
molecules were obtained. Furthermore, a detailed reaction pathway scheme, shown in Figure 3.34, was
proposed based on the GC-MS results of a sample extracted with dichloromethane obtained from glucose
transformation over Sn-Beta detailing the potential presence of the novel molecules α-methyl
glucopyranoside, methyl formate, erythrose, hydroxyacetaldehyde, glyoxal, glycolaldehyde dimethylacetal,
methyl glycolate, methylvinylglycolate, 1,1,2,2-tetramethoxypropane (TMP), 1,1,2,2-tetramethoxyethane
(TME), 1,1-dimethoxyethane and methyl-2,2-dimethoxypropanoate. Murillo et al. [14] emphasized the
formation of erythrose and the subsequent transformation to methyl glycolate since glucose suffers from
retro-aldol reactions to form carbohydrate products with lower number of carbon atoms in alcohol medium,
which could therefore be a notable side reaction in this work.

Figure 3.35 – GC-MS chromatograph of DCM extracted sample from Ce-H-Beta-300-EIM reaction
Analysis of a dichloromethane (DCM) extracted sample from an experiment using Ce-H-Beta-300-EIM
confirmed the presence of a multitude of side products. While for example the presence of glyoxalic acid
confirms the formation of glyoxal shown in Figure 3.34, multiple compounds not shown in the reaction
pathway scheme were detected. This indicates that the side products reacted further to compounds, previously
not deemed feasible. While it is unclear how many different compounds remained within the water-phase,
the number of visible compounds in the extracted sample indicates that the produced Ce-H-Beta-300-EIM
lacks the properties necessary to steer the reaction towards the formation of LA or ML.
Analysis of multiple samples with NMR further confirmed the presence of side products, shown in
Figure 3.36. Samples 4 and 5 used Ce-H-Beta-300-EIM and Sn-H-Beta-300-EIM respectively, while all other
samples were produced using ZnO as catalyst. All samples were taken 180 min after the start of the reaction.

Figure 3.36 – NMR results of samples taken after 180 min of reaction
The samples produced using ZnO as a catalyst mainly consisted of glucose, regardless of whether methanol
or dioxane + water had been used as liquid medium. The sample from using Sn-H-Beta-300-EIM had the
highest amounts of ML, but it is clear that side reactions were prioritized similarly to how they were while
using Ce-H-Beta-300-EIM due to the high amounts of side products, such as methylglucosides. All samples
contained relatively high levels of glucose, which indicate that a large portion of feedstock either does not
react or first converts to fructose and then reverts back to glucose through a reversal of the aldose-ketose
isomerization. Regardless of the reason, the NMR results indicate that the selectivity towards ML and LA
are very low for Sn-H-Beta-300-EIM, Ce-H-Beta-300-EIM and ZnO. The most probable reasons for this

While studying the NMR results from the experiment using ZnO in methanol, seen in Figure 3.37 above,
small amounts of ML are detected. The two spikes at 1.38 ppm (named a) indicate the presence of a methylgroup, while the spikes at 4.25 ppm (b) and 3.72 ppm (c) represent the presence of a methoxy group and a
CH-group respectively. These results therefore indicate the presence of ML and confirms that it is produced,
albeit in very low amounts.

Dr Atte Aho continued the experiments after the break caused by the pandemic using the catalysts Sn-HBeta-300-IE, Sn-H-Y-5.1-IE, H-Beta-300 and deAl-Sn-H-Y-5.1 in water medium. Each experiment
produced samples taken at min 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180 and 360, which were analyzed using a 300 x
7.8 mm HPX-87H column from the manufacturer Aminex, the results of which Atte compiled into Figure
3.38 - 3.43.
A question that appeared while analyzing the samples produced before the break caused by the
pandemic was if the sulfuric acid used as eluent in the LC would react with the compounds in the sample and
thereby be the cause for a part of the unidentified compounds in all results from the LC. A probable reaction
would be dehydration of the glucose and fructose, since sulfuric acid is a dehydrating agent. But this reaction
would mainly result in black solid carbon-based compounds, which logically would cause a multitude of so
far not detected issues with the equipment and not explain the variety of detected compounds. Another
possible reaction would be the formation of organic aerosols by reacting the formed methylglyoxal react with
the acid [59]. This reaction would result in both hydration and polymerization of multiple compounds present
in the samples, but the authors state that the reactions decrease with acidity. Therefore, it is unlikely that a
notable number of compounds would be formed by this reaction, since the used sulfuric acid was diluted to
a mere 0.005 M.

Figure 3.38 – The obtained yields of identified compounds,
Sn-H-Beta-300 at 180 °C, glucose transformation in water
As can be seen in Figure 3.38, the glucose isomerization to fructose was prevalent in the beginning of the
reaction while using Sn-H-Beta-300-IE at 160 °C in water medium. As the reaction progressed, the fructose
level decreased, while the yields of HMF and glucose increased, indicating that some of the fructose reverted
to glucose, as has been previously speculated, while a part of the rest converted into side products such as
HMF and furfural. Since no compound was added to the reaction mixture after the start of the experiment,
the accumulation of glucose would logically happen by transformed compounds reverting back to the
feedstock form. The LA yield was negligible and reached its highest observed level of 1.3 mol-% at 360 min.
This indicates that the Sn-H-Beta-300-IE catalyst still has a considerable amount of Brønsted acid
sites, which steers the reaction to a greater extent than the Lewis acidity of the catalyst. This is in strict
contrast with the pyridine FTIR-results described in Table 9, where Sn-H-Beta-300-IE showed both high
Lewis acidity and very low Brønsted acidity. Further information is needed on the matter and Dr Atte Aho
performed multiple other experiments with the catalyst.
The continuously increasing levels of glucose also indicate that the reversal of the aldose-ketose
isomerization of glucose to fructose is heavily prioritized compared to both the Brønsted and Lewis acid
catalyzed

transformations.

Table 3.39 - The obtained yields of identified compounds,
Sn-H-Beta-300 at 180 °C, glucose transformation in water
Figure 3.39 visualizes the reaction using Sn-H-Beta-300-IE at 180 °C in water medium. The reaction
progressed in a similar manner to how it did at 160 °C, except that the reversal of the glucose isomerization
to fructose was prioritized to an even higher extent and dominated the reaction completely. The HMF yield
reached its highest level of 42.7 mol-% at 90 min after which it steadily decreased, indicating that the HMF
either deteriorated or transformed into new compounds. The LA yield was again negligible and reached its
highest observed level of 2.4 mol-% at 180 min. These patterns add to the previous reasoning that the
produced Sn-Beta catalysts have a prominent lack of the desired Lewis acidity, as other attributes affected
the reaction to a much higher extent.

Figure 3.40 - the obtained yields of identified compounds,
unloaded H-Beta-300 at 160 °C, glucose transformation in water
Figure 3.40 shows how the usage of unloaded H-Beta-300 at 160 °C in water medium resulted in high yields
of glyceraldehyde, HMF and fructose during the first 45 min of the reaction. All three compounds had yields
exceeding 50 mol-% during the first 30 min of the reaction, but they steadily decreased as the experiment
progressed. As the furfural level peaked at 45 min and the formation of glucose was slow throughout the
experiment there are strong indications that the formation of compounds not visible in the analysis were
favored. No LA was detected before 360 min, when a LA yield of 1.4 mol-% was obtained, further
strengthening the reasoning that unloaded H-Beta-300 favors the formation of side products. This is also
logical since the unloaded H-Beta-300 exhibited very low Lewis acidity and low to medium levels of
Brønsted acidity while analyzed with pyridine FTIR.

Figure 3.41 - The obtained yields of identified compounds,
Sn-H-Beta-300 at 160 °C in Teflon reactor, glucose transformation in water
When performing the experiment in a Teflon-covered reactor at 160 °C using Sn-H-Beta-300-IE in water
medium the formation of fructose and glyceraldehyde was prioritized during the first 20 min of the reaction,
after which they decrease steadily. These results are shown in Figure 3.41. The yield of HMF reached its
peak of 33.8 mol-% at 90 min while furfural had its highest yield of 13.2 mol-% at 360 min. Compared to
the previously mentioned experiments performed using Sn-H-Beta-IE the maximum observed glucose yield
was slightly lower, at 28.5 mol-% compared to 37.8 using a stainless steel PARR autoclave. The main
difference compared to these experiments was the much higher initial yield of glyceraldehyde of >15 mol-%
during the first 30 min of the experiment. But overall, the catalyst exhibited similar properties to its previous
experiments with side reactions being favored.

Figure 3.42 - The obtained yields of identified compounds,
Sn-H-Y-5.1-IE at 180 °C, glucose transformation in water
Figure 3.42 depicts the usage of Sn-H-Y-5.1-IE at 180 °C in water medium. Similar to the other experiments
performed at that temperature the reversal of the glucose isomerization was prominent, resulting in
continuously increasing levels of observed glucose until a maximum of 83.5 mol-% at 360 min. The main
difference between the usage of metal grafted Y- and Beta-zeolite seems to be the yield of HMF; during the
previously described experiments the HMF yield reached a maximum of 42.7 mol-% while using Sn-H-Beta300-IE at 180 °C while Sn-H-Y-5.1-IE continuously yielded over 65 mol-% HMF during the first 45 min of
the reaction. While this could indicate that the Brønsted acidity of loaded Y-zeolite is higher than that of its
Beta-counterpart, this remains to be confirmed since no successful pyridine FTIR-analyses were performed
on non-dealuminated Sn-H-Y-5.1 catalysts. LA reached its highest observed yield of 2.4 mol-% at 180 min,
which was similar to the results of Sn-H-Beta-300-IE. This implies that Sn-H-Y-5.1-IE has similar levels of
Lewis acidity as Sn-H-Beta-300-IE.

Figure 3.43 - The obtained yields of identified compounds,
deAl-Sn-H-Y-5.1 at 180 °C, glucose transformation in water
The only studied dealuminated catalyst deAl-Sn-H-Y-5.1 was produced using the method described in
chapter 2.1.2.4 Alkali Ion Exchange (AIE) but was not treated with alkali ions before being studied. Figure
3.43 above depicts how the so far highest LA yield of 8.1 mol-% was obtained at 360. While this level is still
very low, it indicates that the dealuminated versions of the catalysts exhibit more promising qualities for
glucose transformation to ML or LA than its non-dealuminated counterparts. The yield of HMF was still
concerningly high, reaching its peak of 70.9 mol-% at 20 min, indicating that the dealumination of H-Y-Beta5.1 did not impact the Brønsted acidity of the catalyst. The continuously increasing levels of glucose once
again pointed to the fact that further catalyst refinement is required, since the reversal of glucose
isomerization was still prominent during the experiment.
These results contradict the pyridine FTIR-results of the catalyst, where the results pointed to deAlSn-H-Y-5.1 having both notably low Brønsted acidity and Lewis acidity. While the FTIR-results align with
the experimental outcome for unloaded H-Beta-300, the mismatch between the results of these methods for
Sn-H-Beta-300-IE and deAl-Sn-H-Y-5.1 indicate that there either is a previously undiscussed parameter that
dominates these reactions or that the results obtained from the pyridine FTIR analysis were faulty.

Table 13 above depicts a summarization of the experiments performed by Dr Atte Aho, with an emphasis on
the highest observed yield of LA and the corresponding yields of other notable compounds at that time. As
has been previously touched upon, all non-dealuminated catalysts achieved similar LA yields to unloaded HBeta-300. From these six experiments it seems like the reaction temperature has a higher impact on the LA
formation than the difference in Lewis acidity between our loaded and unloaded catalysts, which is somewhat
reasonable since retro-aldol condensation of fructose is favoured at higher temperatures. The fact that the
initial levels of glyceraldehyde are lower in the experiments performed at 180 °C than 160 °C and decreased
steadily would therefore logically mean that the high temperature also resulted in the transformation of
glyceraldehyde into side products before it accumulated in the reaction mixture. While the use of deAl-SnH-Y-5.1 resulted in the highest yield of LA, the dealuminated nature of the catalyst is by itself not enough to
achieve satisfactory yields.
Since both the glucose and HMF yields were concerningly high in all experiments, the decrease of
Brønsted acidity and increase of Lewis acidity is required for the reaction pathway to be skewed towards the
formation of LA or ML. Currently the reversal of the glucose isomerization seems to be the most favored
reaction pathway, since there is a clear accumulation of glucose as the reaction progresses.

Simon Engblom
Comparing these results to previous works on glucose transformation to alkyl lactates yields multiple
interesting points. While many studies focus on the production of ML instead of LA, the reactions follow the
exact same pathways while the solvent is the deciding factor for which compound is the final product, which
has been implied in the majority of referenced articles as well as in our own experiments. This indicates that
the yields or ML and LA are somewhat comparable on a theoretical level and will therefore both be discussed
below to compare the results of previous works with ours.
As was previously mentioned, Taarning et al. [13] achieved LA yield as high as 90 % at 125 °C after
24 h while converting an assortment of triose sugars in 4 ml of distilled water at ambient pressure, when SnBeta was used as catalyst. While performing the experiment at 80 °C in 4 ml methanol instead of water they
similarly achieved a ML yield of over 99 %. While these results are not completely comparable to the ones
achieved by Dr Atte Aho, due to the differences in feedstock and pressure, they are still usable as indications
that results far superior to ours can be achieved with more cost-efficient parameters. The lower temperatures
are also notable since reaction temperature was the parameter with the highest influence on the LA yield in
the experiments performed by Dr Atte Aho, not taking into account the usage of the dealuminated catalyst.
As a more comparable examples we can look at the work of Sun et al. [60], who reported achieving
a sugar conversion of 98.5 % and a LA yield of 57.9 % after 30 min with parameters very similar to the ones
used in this work: a PARR 30 ml stainless steel autoclave, 0.15 g glucose, 0.2 g Sn-Beta catalyst and 7.35 ml
ultra-pure water at 200 °C, 4 MPa helium pressure and a stirring speed of 600 rpm. The same level of
conversion was reached with the same parameters after a mere 10 min, whereas the LA yield at that time was
51.6 %, indicating that the LA formation is rapid and decreases as the feedstock is consumed and time
progresses. When they performed the same reaction with 130 °C temperature on the other hand, it yielded a
glucose conversion of 81.9 % and a LA yield of 20.1 % after 30 min, confirming that the temperature is
crucial even while using catalysts of confirmed high quality. It is also worth noting that the yields of HMF
never exceeded 7 % in any of these experiments, while our lowest observed level of HMF was 23.7 %, seen
in Figure 3.38 - 3.43, at the time of the highest obtained LA-yield while using unloaded H-Beta-300. Though
it is worth mentioning that the observed levels of HMF fluctuated to a great degree throughout the reaction
while using unloaded H-Beta-300, to the extent that the catalyst yielded the highest average level of HMF.

Simon Engblom
These consistently high reported levels of LA, regardless of the temperature and reaction time, point
to the used catalyst being the main difference between the experiments depicted in this work and those
performed by both Taarning et al. and Sun et al. The properties of the synthesized Sn-Beta are reasonably
the cause of such vast differences in obtained product yield.
As has been previously stated, the catalysts synthesized in this work and used by Dr Atte Aho
provided results that correlate with low Lewis acidity and high Brønsted acidity. Though Sun et al. [60] also
specified the important role of Brønsted acidity of moderate strength for the conversion of the intermediate
glyceraldehyde into pyruvaldehyde during the reaction. While LA itself somewhat fills this role and thereby
induces a minor level of autocatalysis, it is also necessary to supply the reaction with moderate Brønsted
acidity through the catalyst. Therefore, the main focus of further catalyst improvement should be put on the
increase of the Lewis acidity.
The main differences between the catalyst synthesis methods described in this work and the one used
by Sun et al. [60] were their incorporation of the metal grafting step in the synthetization of Beta catalyst. In
short, they mixed tetraethyl orthosilicate with tetraethylammonium hydroxide, forming a two-phase system
and added SnCl4·5H2O drop-wise to form a viscous gel. The desired ratios of the components were then
adjusted by evaporation, after which the gel was left to stabilize at 140 °C in oil bath for 3 to 36 hours. The
final catalyst could thereafter be recovered by filtration and washing with deionized water. This method
differs drastically from those used in this work and would reasonably be the cause for the vastly different
properties of the catalysts.
Liu et al. [61] reported obtaining a ML yield of 17.59 % without the use of any catalyst. These results
were achieved using a 50 ml stainless steel autoclave while performing a blank experiment using 0.2 g
glucose, 0.1 g naphthalene as internal standard and 40 ml methanol at 200 °C for 20 h. Since the highest
documented yields of LA in the experiments performed by Dr Atte Aho were lower than 2 % for half of the
studied catalysts it would be interesting to perform blank experiments to study whether or not higher yields
could be obtained without the use of the defective catalysts. While no blank experiments were performed in
this work, multiple other studies have investigated the matter.
Murillo et al. [62] obtained a ML yield of 1.4 % and a glucose conversion of 88.6 % while using
0.225 g glucose, 0.03 g naphthalene as an internal standard and 10 ml methanol in 40 ml stainless steel
Teflon-lined autoclave at 160 °C for 24 h. The difference between their obtained product yield and that of
Liu et al. [61] during their respective blank experiments is noteworthy; 1.4 % yield of ML in comparison to

- 71 -

Simon Engblom
17.59 % yield of ML. This difference in product yield seems to be mainly caused by the difference in
temperature, 160 in comparison to 200°C, indicating that relatively high yield can be achieved even without
the use of any catalyst as long as sufficiently high temperatures are reached. While a blank experiment with
the exact parameters used by Dr Atte Aho might yield different results from those described above, they are
still clear indications that relatively high yields of ML and LA can be achieved both with and without the use
of catalysts. The accumulation of glucose in the experiments performed by Dr Atte Aho is also notable, since
all previously presented theory indicate that the feedstock should rather be depleted as the reactions progress.
This was further confirmed by Chambon et al. [63], who reported the glucose conversion reaching 95 % after
6 h in a blank experiment using 1.6 g glucose in 65 ml distilled water at 190 °C and 5 MPa helium pressure.
Liu et al. [61] obtained results further emphasizing the importance of the reaction temperature while
studying the impact of the reaction time on the product yield of blank experiments. While the used catalyst
MgO is not relevant for this work they showed how the mere heating of the reactor from 25 °C to 200 °C, a
process which took approximately 1 h, resulted in a ML yield of 10.73 % using 0.2 g glucose, 0.05 g catalyst
and 40 ml methanol.
Liu et al. [61] also studied the impact of the stainless steel surface on the inside of the reactor by
comparing the results from a 50 ml stainless steel autoclave and a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave using the
same setup as described for their blank experiment, but with 160 °C temperature instead of 200 °C. The
obtained ML yield was 12.80 % for the stainless-steel autoclave and 11.75 % for the Teflon-lined reactor,
implying that the stainless steel surface of the reactor showed no significant catalytic activity in the system.
While they studied the impact of the inner surface material of the reactor, they concluded that Teflon-lined
reactor has an effect on the LA yield identical to that of one with an inner surface of stainless steel, which
was also indicated by the experiments performed by Dr Atte Aho.

3.2.1 Challenges with product analysis
One of the major challenges related to the product analysis, referenced in the introduction chapter in this
work, was the occurrence of high levels of unindentified high-mass compounds in the LC results. These
molecules were deemed to be the unwanted polymeric compounds generally referred to as humins. Fu et al.
have reported that humin precursors (for example oligomers) are easily formed in the transformation of
glucose to HMF [64], which bears many resemblances to the reactions relevant for this work both in pathways
and types of compounds present. Therefore, it is reasonable that the suppression methods they propose would
be at least somewhat effective if applied to this work. Dee et al. showed that these unwanted side reactions
heavily impact the efficiency of the HMF production, due to the decrease in selectivity towards HMF and
loss of valuable carbons [65]. It is in other words crucial for the economic viability of biomass transformation
to a multitude of compounds that the humin formation is limited as thoroughly as possible. To improve the
efficiency of the reaction it is essential to increase the carbon utilization from the glucose conversion by
limiting the subreactions in a manner that favors the pathways towards our desired small-molecule products.
The factors that are generally accepted to be the main reasons behind humin formation are
uncontrolled cross-polymerization reactions of HMF and other highly reactive intermediates and/or products
in aqueous solutions [66]. During the transformation of glucose to ML these processes could reasonably
occur in the form of cross-condensation of HMF and levulinic acid or self-condensation of HMF in
conjunction with the degradation of glucose and fructose [64].
To suppress the humin formation I tried using the organic solvent dioxane as the liquid phase during
some of the reactions, since one of the effective strategies reported was to perform dehydration in either an
organic solvent, ionic liquid or biphasic system of aqueous and organic solvents [67] [68] [69]. Dioxane fits
this criterion, has recently been reported to inhibit the formation of oligomers [42] and has a positive impact
on the stability of the Sn-Beta catalysts during glucose isomerization, as has previously been described in
chapter 1.2.3.4 Stability and the impact of water. Unfortunately, the success of this method remains
undetermined due to the sudden stop of the experiment when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out.
The use of LC for product analysis was also challenged by another issue. The RT for ML at 19.292
min while using the RI-analysis method was too close to the RT of methanol at 19.652 min, resulting in the
analysis spikes merging due to the vast amounts of methanol used during the reaction. This merging made
the results indistinguishable from each other, meaning that we were not able to determine whether the yield
of ML in any sample was for example either 0 or 80 weight-%. The analysis temperature and flow had already

- 73 -

Simon Engblom
been optimized for the used compounds and could therefore not be adjusted to further separate the molecules
from

each

other.

To circumvent this issue, we tried utilizing the UV-analysis method of the LC since the RT specific
to each molecule may differ slightly from them obtained by the RI method. We thereby obtained the new RT
for ML at 18.664 min clearly distinguished from any other resulting spikes. Unfortunately, this UV-analysis
method did not offer a way to precisely calculate the amount of each compound present in a sample. This
was due to the observation, during the calculation of the new UV-specific calibration curves, that all resulting
spikes were smaller than those obtained by RI-analysis to a degree that the calculations would include a large
margin of error. Therefore, we could only utilize the UV-analysis method to argue whether or not ML had
been produced during any reaction, while also taking into account that some of the previously mentioned
unidentified compounds could have RT similar to ML in the manner that methanol did.
Similar to the issue regarding the RT of ML, the RT of LA at 13.088 min was unfortunately almost
identical to that of the side product lactaldehyde at 12.944 min. To further add to the issue, using the UVanalysis method in an effort to distinguish the spikes from each other revealed that there was a third unknown
compound, the result of which also merged with the results of LA and lactaldehyde. Since relying solely on
the UV-detector of LC had already been deemed unfeasible I had to neglect my own results from LC in
relation to LA and strived to develop a more practical method of product quantification.

3.2.2 Reproducibility and mass balance
Both the reaction setup and conventional production methods for the synthesized catalysts used in this project
are simple and cost-efficient and should therefore be easy to reproduce. Since I have not obtained any valid
results regarding the reaction products in my own experiments and the achieved characterization results for
the catalysts are too few and spread amongst too many different catalysts to be able to draw any conclusions
there are not any valid results to speak of to reproduce.
Regarding the mass balance, the humins in the product analysis rendered the conclusions based on
my primary analyses unusable, but the results obtained by Dr Atte Aho can still be analyzed. With only a
handful of exceptions, the results visualized in Figure 3.38 - 3.43 consistently had a total yield of over 100
mol-% and even up to 257.4 mol-% in the case of H-Beta-300. This pattern, visualized in Table 16, indicated
that the reaction intermediaries had reacted heavily with either the reaction solvent or the eluent used in the
LC analysis and could also be observed continuously in my own results. It is therefore more likely that the
analysis eluent would be the reason, since the pattern is present regardless of the solvent used during the
reaction. This would also explain the wide selection of unidentified compounds found in the analyses,
compared to the more limited selection presented in the reaction pathways of Figure 3.34.
The unifying factor for the results from the Beta catalysts was that the total yield seemed to decrease
as the experiment progressed, indicating that some compounds would be volatile and that more of the reaction
mass was expelled to the gas-phase as time progressed. This was also indicated by the carbon balance,
described in Table 15, where the higher reaction temperature of 180 °C resulted in carbon balances at 360
min of around 50 %, while the lower reaction temperature of 160 °C had corresponding carbon balances of
between 82 and 92 %.

3.3. Catalyst deactivation and regeneration study
Due to the lack of time, catalyst recycling and reusage was not investigated properly in this work. Calcination
of used Sn-Beta catalysts, following the heat treatment described in Table C.3, returned their appearances to
their original unused state, indicating the removal of deposited products on the catalyst and a subsequent full
recovery of catalytic activity according to previous research [42]. But how this recycling affected the
morphology and other properties of the catalysts in actuality was not investigated and could therefore only
be theorized. Similarly, there is a need to further investigate the potential leaching of the catalysts with
different reaction parameters and in different mediums. The potential difference in leaching between the
different metal modification methods DP, EIM and IE would be of particular interest, due to their overall
similarity and low cost.

4. Conclusions
While Sn-Beta has shown great potential for glucose transformation to ML in previous research, proper
tailoring of reaction parameters and catalyst properties is required to limit the formation of side products.
The limitation of Brønsted acidity and increase of Lewis acidity are especially required to favor the desired
reaction pathways, while the reaction parameters need to be adjusted according to the used solvent. The
dealumination of the catalysts seem to limit the Brønsted acidity but while the Lewis acidity should
theoretically be promoted by treatment with alkali ions, further research into the catalyst production methods
are needed to confirm the matter.
The methods and previous research presented in this work seem to hold much potential for the
development of the process and its related catalysts and further research into the field to either validate or
disprove the arguments referenced within this thesis is encouraged. It is important to emphasize though, that
the complexity and cost of the AIE synthesis method, described by Iglesias et al. [49], far outweigh the
contradictory results they report to have obtained. There seem to be merit in utilizing alkaline treatment in
the production of Sn-Beta catalysts, but Docent Narendra Kumar recommended that this should be
implemented in the simpler synthesis methods of DP, EIM and IE rather than forcibly creating a convoluted
metal modification method solely based on AIE, if the method is to be economically feasible.
An emphasis should be placed on the product analysis method, as the formation of a wide selection
of unidentified compounds was prevalent throughout the performed experiments. While the majority of the
articles referenced in this thesis do not cover the potential conversion of the intermediates to humins and
other side products, this phenomenon should not be disregarded. Naturally, it is a possibility that this process
was only prevalent in this work due to the used catalysts possibly being substandard, but in that case the
question is how all produced catalysts could differ from those produced in previous research to such a degree,
while adhering to similar production methods. On the other hand, for example the article Sn-Al-USY for the
valorization of glucose to methyl lactate: switching from hydrolytic to retro-aldol activity by alkaline ion
exchange produced by Iglesias et al. [49] lacked description of the used product analysis method to a
concerning degree, while similarly not reporting that the use of methods not suited for analysis of sugars
would have yielded any complications with carbohydrate analysis. Malfunctioning of the analysis equipment
used in this thesis is of course a possibility, but this prevalent lack of important information regarding how
the analysis of the products from glucose transformation to ML was performed should be noted.

5. Svensk sammanfattning
Detta arbete fokuserade på att studera omvandlingen av glukos till mjölksyra och dess ester metyllaktat i så
kallad ”one-pot” uppställning. Både mjölksyra och metyllaktat är kemikalier som för tillfället är i fokus inom
sektorn för grön kemi och bioraffinering tack vare att de kan omvandlas till ett mångfald av värdefulla
kemikalier. Sockerarter såsom glukos är å sin sida av stort intresse tack vare deras tillgänglighet och behovet
av att hitta alternativa råmaterial till material med fossilt ursprung.
Reaktionen sker genom två steg; först omvandling av glukos till fruktos genom aldos-ketos
isomerisering och sedan omvandling till antingen mjölksyra eller metyllaktat genom flera steg, varav retroaldol kondensation är steget som bestämmer reaktionens hastighet. Tidigare forskning har påvisat att
katalysatorerna Sn-Beta och Sn-Y har lovande egenskaper för dessa reaktioner och att de kan skräddarsys
ytterligare för att uppnå högre avkastning av de önskade produkterna. Därför fokuserade detta arbete på att
studera olika metallympningsmetoder av dessa katalysatorer, vilken inverkan dessa metoder har på
katalysatorernas egenskaper samt hur reaktionens effektivitet kan ökas genom justering av
reaktionsparametrarna. Metallympningsmetoden ”alkaliskt jonbyte” som beskrivits av Iglesias et al. [49]
fungerade som teoretisk bas för arbetet, tack vare det lovande resultat som rapporterats.
Dessvärre tvingades labbarbetet avbrytas på grund av COVID-19 pandemin som bröt ut under våren
2020, men de preliminära resultaten tydde på att de producerade katalysatorerna hade för hög Brønsted surhet
och för låg Lewis surhet för att styra reaktionen mot de önskade produkterna. Istället erhölls ett mångfald av
oidentifierade föreningar som studerades med hjälp av vätskekromatografi (LC), kärnmagnetisk
resonansspekstroskopi (NMR) och gaskromatografi i kombination med masspektrometri (GC-MS) för att
erhålla ett utvecklat reaktionsschema. Under arbetets gång framkom det även att flera av metoderna och
resultaten som Iglesias et al. erhållit var ifrågasättbara och kunde inte återskapas under upprepade försök.
Arbetet försvårades ytterligare av tekniska svårigheter med utrustningen för vätskekromatografi och
majoriteten av analysresultaten ansågs oanvändbara tack vare att flera av signalerna på de erhållna
kromatogrammen överlappade, vilket i sin tur innebar att reaktionens effektivitet inte kunde fastställas. För
att kringgå dessa utmaningar studerades möjliga alternativa analys- och derivatiseringsmetoder av
produkterna och silylering i kombination med gaskromatografi-masspektrometri gav lovande resultat.
Även om inget avgörande resultat erhölls rekommenderas fortsatt forskning inom ämnet eftersom
speciellt katalysatorn Sn-Beta har rapporterats av flera källor att ha väldigt lovande egenskaper för
omvandling av glukos till mjölksyra och metyllaktat. Speciell fokus borde isåfall läggas på utvecklingen av
tillförlitliga analysmetoder eftersom förekomsten av tekniska utmaningar i detta arbete har påvisats att inte

bero på enbart otur eller mänskliga faktorer. Bristen på detaljerade beskrivningar av analysmetoderna i
tidigare publikationer är besynnerlig och tyder på att tillvägagångssättet inte är så enkelt som ursprungligen
antogs. Upprepningen av ett flertal olika tidigare rapporterade tillvägagångssätt erhöll vanligtvis oanvändbara
resultat, vilket delvis kan bero på de dåliga egenskaper de producerade katalysatorerna visade.
Experiment utförda av Dr Atte Aho, var han jämförde flera av de producerade katalysatorernas
inverkan på mjölksyreproduktionen, påvisade alla resultat relaterade till hög Brønsted surhet och i synnerhet
låg Lewis surhet. Det högsta observerade produktutbytet var 8.1 mol-% mjölksyra vid experiment med deAlSn-H-Y-5.1 vid 180 °C, medan samtliga övriga produktutbyten var under 3 mol-%. Dessa resultat är väldigt
låga i jämförelse med andra experiment utförda med samma reaktoruppställning, speciellt de som Taarning
et al. [13] och Sun et al. [60] rapporterat; 90 % respektive 57.9 %. Bägge projekten erhöll kontinuerligt
utbyten av sidoprodukten 5-hydroxymetylfurfural på mindre än 7 %, medan den lägsta motsvarande nivån
av kemikalien i våra experiment var 23.7 mol-%, vid användningen av den icke-metallympade katalysatorn
H-Beta-300. Detta stöder ytterligare den tidigare diskuterade teorin att de producerade katalysatorerna inte
hade de egenskaper nödvändiga för reaktionen. Metallympningen av både H-Y och H-Beta katalysatorerna
verkar snarare ha försämrat deras egenskaper än förbättrat dem, i avseende av mjölksyreproduktion. Därmed
bör den verkliga inverkan av de använda metallympningsmetoderna studeras närmare och jämföras med de
mera avancerade metoder som beskrivits av bl.a Sun et al. [60]. På så vis borde katalysatorer optimerade för
