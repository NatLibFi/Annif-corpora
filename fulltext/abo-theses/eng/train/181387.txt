ABSTRACT
The main goal of this study is to determine changes in mechanical properties using
principal component analysis. This project included the main concept of principal
component analysis and its implementation in determining changes in mechanical
properties over time.
The study is made using wind turbine as a user case in order to determine the changes
in mechanical properties. Two Different data cases were used to address the different
changes in mechanical properties failure. In this paper we used a fully functional and
a broken 3MW wind turbines vibration measurements.
MATLAB software was used to carry out the project. Mathematical algorithms were
programmed and tested for the result to find the necessary output. In this project
statistical analysis was the basic core.
In order to find the main indicators of the changes of the specific mechanical wear,
principal component analysis was used. Principal component analysis reduces the
dimensionality of the datasets and retains the variation presented on the original
dataset. In this paper statistical features from time domain and spectral kurtosis from
frequency domain were extracted. Then Principal component analysis was used for
dimension reduction and feature fusion.
This study also used the principal components as health-indicators in order to
determine the remaining useful life of the wind turbine. This project also suggested
more research have to be done in many other fault detections in other rotating
machineries to show the importance of principal component analysis in those
implementations

Key words: PCA, Principal Component Analysis, Wind turbine, Mechanical wear,
Fault detection, High -speed prognosis, RUL, Remaining useful life.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
Early humans used different technologies to gather foods and to survive predators.
In order to survive, humans created different tools that could be used to hunt foods and
protect themselves. These tools have evolved through time. Since the early days of
humans, the tools made have either worn out or become useless. This property of
materials has been the major problem
.
Today, engineers who build materials or components are trying to minimise the
change in mechanical properties of materials. These changes can be detected by
different methods. One of them is collecting data from the machineries and analysing
the data and identifying the cause of the failures.
Fault detection on rotating machineries includes diagnosis of items such as shafts,
gears and pumps. There are different types of faults and the diagnoses are made in
different ways. Some of the diagnosis methods include vibration analysis, modelbased techniques, and statistical analysis [1].
The goal of this thesis is to use principal component analysis to determine changes
in mechanical properties. The wind turbine is used as a user case in the study to
determine the changes in mechanical properties. To address the various changes in
mechanical properties failure, two different data cases were used. PCA is used as a
dimension reduction and feature fusion tool in this work to detect faults and determine
the RUL of the bearings.
For this thesis, high-speed wind turbine pinion data was used. The measurement
was taken on a 3MW wind turbine with radial vibration for one week and a fault was
found on the pinion gear. Similarly, other measurements were taken from two other
machines and with no known faults [2].

2. VIBRATION ANALYSIS ALGORITHMS AND ROTATING
MACHINERY
2.1. Background
Rotating machineries, such as turbines, are key components to power plants and
manufacturing industries. Since they are usually subjected to harsh environments, they
are easily prone to defects or faults. Faults in these machineries could cause damages
to the power-generating plants or other manufacturing industries. These damages
could be economic, or even worse, life threatening. For example, a system failure in
transportation machines such as cars, trains or airplanes could be deadly. Therefore, it
is essential to identify the causes of faults and defects.
The causes of faults in rotating machineries could arise from different components
of the machinery, such as the gear, the shaft or the pinions. Once the faults in these
components are identified, it could be easy to identify symptoms related to the faults
analysis and detect the faults before they occur.
Machine breakdowns generally are undesired for many reasons. As mentioned
above, it causes additional cost for the machine owner by requiring materials and
manpower. Efficiency loss, equipment downtime and customer service or comfort
consume resources and even damages reputations. Faults could occur suddenly,
gradually or due to incorrect set system. Preventing faults, detecting faults beforehand
and designing a fault tolerant system are among the approaches taken to prevent the
problem.

2.1.1. Fault prevention

Faults can be prevented through periodical maintenance during a statistically
determined period of time. This periodical maintenance helps to minimise faults
between those periods, ensures the correctness of the machine’s settings and minimises
unexpected economic and life costs. These periodic maintenances require resources
and downtime incurring costs. However, making the proper maintenance in
accordance with manufacturers recommendations will actually increase energy
savings and boost productivity.
2.1.2. Fault detection

In order to detect faults different measurement methods are used to monitor the
conditions of machineries. Acoustic, vibration and temperature measurement are
among the different techniques used. The signals collected from the machineries are

9

pre-processed and analysed for the presence of faults. Acoustic and vibration
measurement methods are the most common in detecting faults in rotating
machineries. Time and frequency domain vibration measurements, sound pressure and
intensity, shock pulse, and acoustic emission methods are some of the methods used
to measure the response from a defective machinery.
Time and frequency domain methods are the most widely used methods for fault
detection. Research shows that time domain methods were being used before the birth
of frequency domain methods. Some of the well-known examples of time domain
methods are root mean square (RMS), crest factor, peak value and kurtosis.

2.1.3. Faults in rotating machines
Faults in rotating machineries can be described as any change in the machine
components that causes the machine to work inefficiently or puts it to a complete stop.
These faults can be caused in one or more components of the machine.[4] Gomaa and
Khader, in their article on fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, explain the causes for
the failure in a rotating machine. They mention weakness in material design, misuse
and mechanical wear of components as the causes.
Faults in rotating machines are due to damaged gears, damaged bearings, bent shaft,
and vibration of the machine itself. These faults should be detected as soon as they
occur in order to minimise any damages and losses. For this purpose, different
mechanisms are put forward by different researchers and scientists and are still being
suggested.
Different condition monitoring and fault detection systems are used for monitoring
and fault detection in rotating machineries. These methods use measurements such as
temperature, pressure, noise, vibration and oil analysis in order to monitor the
condition of the machines. However, the most effective systems, both for condition
monitoring and fault detection, use vibration measurements using transducers such as
accelerometers, velocity pickups and displacement probes.[5]

2.2. Signal processing techniques for fault detection

This section discusses different signal processing techniques that are applied to
rotating machineries. These different methods include the most widely used feature
extractions from time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain and find
patterns that are related to faults. Similarly, other methods that are more advanced
signal processing techniques such as wavelet transform (WT), classification methods,
envelop analysis and cyclostationary analysis are available.

10

2.2.1. Time domain methods

Time domain feature extraction for fault detection is a traditional and most
commonly used technique in rotating machineries. It is a simple method which
involves the extraction of statistical features in order to analyse the changes in trends
which is related to faults.
Root mean square (RMS) is the most common statistical feature extracted in
vibrational signals. RMS can be mathematically defined as:

"

!

𝑅𝑀𝑆 = &" #" ∫" ! [𝑥(𝑡)]$ 𝑑𝑡
"
!

"

(2.1)

where 𝑥(𝑡) is a signal between the instants 𝑇! and 𝑇$ [17].
Energy is another statistical feature extracted from the time-frequency domain. It is
the measure of true energy in the area defined by the signal curve. It is defined
mathematically as

%

𝐸 = ∫#%|𝑋(𝑡)|$ 𝑑𝑡

(2.2)

where 𝑥(𝑡) is the signal [17].
Peak-to-peak is another feature extracted from the time domain. It is the distance
from the top of one peak to the bottom of another or it can be generally explained as
the maximum voltage value in the signal [17].
Crest factor (CF) is also a feature that is derived from peak-to-peak divided with
the RMS. This feature is not effective when the degradation is significant in the rolling
machinery. It is mathematically expressed as follows [17]:
𝐶𝐹 =

|'|#$%&
''()

(2.3)

11

2.2.2. Frequency domain methods

Fast fourier transform is a frequency domain spectral analysis technique that is used
for detection of faults in vibrational signals. It is an extension of the fourier transform
signal analysis method where we transform a time-based signal f(t) to a frequencybased spectrum F(w) including all frequencies.

%

𝐹(𝑤) = ∫#% 𝑓(𝑡)𝑒 #($)*+,+

(2.4)

FFT might be the most popular numerical algorithm in science and engineering,
however, it has its own limitations since it is only applicable to stationary signals. Due
to these limitations, many more non-stationary signals analysis methods were
introduced. Short-time fourier transform (STFT) was later developed to determine the
frequency content of a local section in terms of change in time [14].
Spectral kurtosis is a frequency domain feature extraction technique. It is the most
powerful and most commonly used method for detecting degradation in rotating
machineries. It is defined as the fourth-order spectral moment. It can be defined
mathematically as:

𝑆𝐾(𝑓) =

〈./ * (+,2).〉
〈/ * (+,2)〉!

−2

(2.5)

For a signal of x(t), where 𝑋 5 (𝑡, 𝑓) is the fourth order and 𝑋 $ (𝑡, 𝑓) is the second
order of the band-pass filtered signal x(t) [14].

2.2.3. Wavelet transform
Wavelet transform is a new and powerful technique which is applicable to
nonstationary signals. Wavelet analysis can be done by multiplying a wavelet function
to a signal that is going to be analysed. Then, the transform is computed for each
segment created. The advantage of wavelet transform is that it helps us to use short
time interval where there is a high-frequency information or a long-time interval with
precise low-frequency information. This behaviour helps us to perform local analysis
without losing spectral information. The disadvantage of this technique is that the
frequency resolution might be poor for high-frequency signals. This simultaneous
time-frequency representation of a signal helps us to identify faults in machineries.

12

2.2.4. Cyclostationary analysis

Rotating machinery vibration signals feature modulations; thus, the cyclic
correlation and cyclic spectrum are well suited to analyse their modulation
characteristics to detect faults in their components. The cyclic correlation and cyclic
spectrum for Amplitude modulation and frequency modulation (AM-FM) signals are
derived and summarised [18].
The cyclic statistics is used to for signals with periodicity and multi-periodicity with
respect to time. Cyclic correlation and cyclic spectrum are effective methods to extract
features of cyclostationary signals. The cyclic function can be defined as:

%

7 ∗

7

𝑅'6 (𝜏) = ∫#% 𝑥 <𝑡 + $> 𝑥 <𝑡 − $> 𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑗2𝜋𝛼𝑡) 𝑑𝑡

(2.6)

where 𝑥(𝑡) represents the signal, 𝜏 is time lag and 𝛼 is the cyclic frequency [18].

2.2.5. Envelope analysis

Envelope analysis is a technique of extracting the modulating signal from amplitude
of the signal and detects periodic variations in the amplitude of the signal. It is used
for detection of faults in machineries, such as gearbox, turbines and induction motors
where faults have an amplitude modulation effect on the characteristic frequencies. It
is also a tool for diagnosing local faults like cracks and spalling in rolling element
bearings. This technique is the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) frequency spectrum of
the modulating signal. This technique uses the following steps:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.

Band pass filter
Signal rectification
Hilbert transform
Spectral analysis

In general, there are many other fault detection methodologies that are suggested
by different scientists and researchers. The above-mentioned methods are the most
important and the most applicable ones. In this paper, only time domain and frequency
domain spectral kurtosis are implemented.

13

2.3. Principal component analysis (PCA)

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimension reduction technique without
losing much of the information and the variation within the original dataset. This
technique is used for different purposes in high dimensional data, such as data
compression, feature extraction, signal analysis, and fault diagnosis.
Data with n number of samples and k -attributes can be represented as a matrix X,
𝑥!!
X=D ⋮
𝑥:!

⋯
⋱
⋯

𝑥!9
⋮ H
𝑥::

(2.7)

Once we represent the data as a matrix shown above, we then subtract the mean
from each dimension, and this would produce a dataset with a zero mean. This
subtraction of the mean is called mean-centring. The subtraction of the mean helps us
to remove bias.

M=I

𝑥!! − 𝑋!
⋮
𝑥:! − 𝑋9

⋯
⋱
⋯

𝑥!9 − 𝑋9
J
⋮
𝑥:: − 𝑋9

(2.8)

Then we can calculate the covariance matrix as,

𝐶𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑥 =

;∗; +

(2.9)

:

thus resulting,

𝐶!!
𝑆= D ⋮
𝐶9!

where 𝐶<= expressed as,

⋯
⋱
⋯

𝐶!9
⋮ H
𝐶99

(2.10)

14

𝐶<= ?

!⁄: {(', # /B- )C'. #/B. DE

(F,(?!,$,…9)

(2.11)

Different scale measures of variance and covariance will result in different results.
Since these results cannot be compared, we have to normalise the data by dividing
each matrix by its standard deviation. Hence this results in a normalized matrix
element 𝐶F( ,

𝐶F( =

H,.
IJKL(F) .JKL(()

(I,j = 1,2,……,k)

(2.12)

where 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑖) and 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑗) are the variance of ith and jth elements respectively. Both
variances are the maximum variations a variable can have, and the correlation can
never exceed S𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑖) . 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑗) . This will result in the maximum value of covariance
matrix (equal to one). For variables which are uncorrelated the covariance is zero i.e.,
𝐶F( = 𝐶(F = 0
As mentioned above, the main goal of PCA is to reduce dimensions of a data set
while keeping the variation of the original dataset. Covariance matrix defines both the
spread (variance) and orientation (covariance) of a dataset.

3. SYSTEM OVERVIEW AND FAULTS OF WIND TURBINES
3.1. System overview
A wind turbine is an electromechanical system that converts wind energy to
electrical energy. It is made of different subsystems and components such as blades,
rotor, gearbox, generator, yaw, tower, controller, anemometer and break.

Figure 3.1 Typical wind turbine system [9]

As we can see from the figure above, a typical wind turbine is made of different
parts. Its functionality can also be explained as follows. As the wind blows, it causes
the blade and the rotor to run and causes the main shaft to rotate and speed up the
gearbox to drive the generator and change wind energy to mechanical and finally to
electrical energy. The anemometer is used to identify the wind direction to help the
yaw system to align the turbine to the direction of the wind. The controller is used to
make sure the wind turbine generates the needed electricity [9].

Wind turbine components are vulnerable to faults due to short-lived malfunctions or
aging, causing system interruption. There is a difference between faults and failure. A
fault is when a system is in a mode where it keeps its functionality, but it is in an
unacceptable stage. However, failures in a system or its component mean a complete
inability to function. The figure below shows the different causes of failures and their
relative percentage of occurrences in wind turbines [9].

16

Figure 3.2 The total share of faults shown in percentage [9]

Table 3.1 Wind turbine fault types [11,12,13]

17

The percentages of typical faults in wind turbines are shown in the above diagram
(Figure 3.2). As one can see from the above pie chart, the faults in the wind turbines
are mainly caused by mechanical and electrical components [10].
Table 3.1 lists the main causes of typical fault types in wind turbines and causes for
the faults. As can be seen, all the faults mentioned are either mechanical or electrical
faults. The faults occur at different parts of the wind turbine, such as the blade,
gearbox, bearing, generator, tower and sensors.

3.2. Fault modes of wind turbines
Both onshore and offshore wind turbines have become one of the fastest growing
Both onshore and offshore wind turbines have become one of the fastest growing
sources of electricity production. There is a growing need and use of wind turbines all
over the world, especially in Europe due to its clean energy production. In Europe, it
has been recorded that it is the second source of energy next to gas and oil. With the
increasing use of wind turbines, an evolution in quantity and size of the wind turbines
has taken place. This has caused an increase in cost of maintenance due to failures in
wind turbines [5].
There are two types of maintenance: corrective and preventive. These are referred
to as traditional maintenance strategies by Abid et al., and they have a significant
disadvantage in that the fault is experienced by the system. The other strategies are
called prognostics and health management or predictive maintenance strategies that
provide an advanced maintenance strategy that can increase reliability and availability
while reducing unexpected fault and maintenance cost [5].
The performance of the wind turbine or the condition of components, especially
critical components such as rotating machinery (e.g., generator), are used to track the
health of wind turbines. Fault prognostic or predictive maintenance is a useful strategy,
since we are predicting when a failure will take place, or it estimates the remaining
useful life (RUL) of the wind turbine. RUL prediction estimates the time remaining
between the degradation detection and failure threshold. Most of the time, the
prediction of critical components is very difficult due to noise, system complexity and
prediction uncertainty caused by operating conditions of the wind turbines, such as
wind speed and direction [5].

18

Figure 3.3 General approach of prognostic [5]
Figure 3.3 depicts a general approach to prognosis. The figure suggests the steps
for the approach, i.e., health indicator (HI) construction, degradation indicator and
RUL estimation (prognostics). The health indicator is constructed by the preprocessing of the data and monitoring the evolution of the system performance. The
degradation indicator is then triggered as soon as the health indicator HI falls below a
predefined threshold. Finally, we predict the remaining useful life by forecasting the
degradation evolution and estimating the time when the system will fall below the
threshold [5].

3.3. Health indicator

A change in system performance is evaluated using a health indicator. The main
and the most important step toward achieving prognostic is the health indicator. If the
system’s performance deviates from its normal condition, we can say it is heading
towards failure. These indicators are drawn by studying the system pattern from the
collected data from the sensors. There are two types of health indicators: indicators
based on a single feature and indicators based on multiple features. Those with single
features, such as using sensor data, residuals-based features, and time domain or timefrequency features are extracted from data collected by monitoring sensors[5].
The other health indicator is based on multiple features. This health indicator
method helps to identify complex degradations. These complex degradations are
difficult to identify and construct a health indicator that follows the degradation over
time to allow a reliable remaining useful life. Therefore, we have to fuse different
features in order to identify and draw the health indicator. This fusion has its own
drawbacks, such as information loss, which can lead to a lack of interpretability of
health indicators to represent the virtual description of the system's health performance
[5].
Abid et al. in their literature proposed several methods for health indicator
construction on single and multiple features, as shown in the table below. Various
methodologies are proposed in the table based on the number of features. These
features, which are extracted from the vibration signals of damaged bearings,
frequently exhibit varying modulation characteristics. As a result, the features
extracted from one bearing may not correlate with the features extracted from another
bearing, which occurs due to different trends from different cases. As a result, we must
apply and validate various bearing fault indicators, such as Kurtosis and root mean
square, for various applications [14].

19

Table 3.2: Health indicator construction methods [14]

Different methodologies are suggested based on the number of features, as seen in
the table above. These features, which are extracted from the vibration signals of
damaged bearings, frequently exhibit different modulation characteristics. As a result,
the features extracted from one bearing may not correlate with the features extracted
from another bearing, which occurs due to different trends from different cases. As a
result, we must apply and validate various bearing fault indicators, such as Kurtosis
and root mean square, for various applications [14].

3.3.1. Feature extraction

The vibration signal is employed in the computation of features in the time,
frequency, and time-frequency domains. Different statistical features are generated
from vibration signals to indicate faults in bearings, shafts, and gears, which are
components of a gearbox. Bearings frequently operate in harsh environments and are
subject to various types of faults. The advantages of the time-frequency domain have
been demonstrated in numerous research papers and journals [15].

3.3.2. Time domain feature extraction

20

As previously stated, one of the most important methods for identifying faults in
bearings is time domain analysis. It is a simple and powerful tool for identifying faults
in mechanical vibrations by computing statistical features. These statistical features
are implemented in this paper and are shown in the table below.

Table 3.3 Time domain features [15]

In the table above, 𝑥 represents the sampled time signal, sample index, and 𝑁
represents the number of samples. As shown above, several statistical fault-indicating
features are used to diagnose faults using vibration signals. The most commonly used
fault indicators are RMS and Kurtosis. In this paper, we implement all of the features
for prognostic analysis.
3.4. Frequency domain feature extraction

In this paper, we used frequency domain feature extraction, which is one of the most
widely used methods in bearing fault diagnosis. Since it can be obscured by other
causes of vibration such as gears, shafts, and other mechanical faults, spectral kurtosis
(SK) is one of the most effective tools for detecting faults.

21

Ben Ali et al. define the SK signal as the normalised fourth-order spectral moment
and can be mathematically written as:

𝑆𝐾(𝑓) =

〈./ * (+,2).〉
〈/ * (+,2)〉!

−2

(3.1)

For x(t) signal, where 𝑋 5 (𝑡, 𝑓) is the fourth order and 𝑋 $ (𝑡, 𝑓) is the second order
of the band-pass filtered signal x(t).

3.5. Health indicator evaluation criteria

Lei et al. proposed various criteria for assessing the suitability of the constructed
health indicators for RUL estimation. Many researchers have proposed different
metrics for evaluation of prognostic health indicators. Lei et.al. have summarised those
in a table shown below.

Table 3.4. Summary of metrics of evaluating prognostics health indicators.

The most important health indicator criteria, according to Abid et al., are
monotonicity, prognosability, and trendability.

22

3.5.1. Monotonicity

Monotonicity is the property that evaluates the positive or negative trend of a health
indicator based on the assumption that the faulty component is unable to recover on its
own. Based on the derivatives of the health indicator, two metrics of monotonicity
were proposed. As shown below, the absolute difference between negative and
positive derivatives is used to calculate the first monotonicity.
𝑀𝑜𝑛! (𝑋) =

!
N#!

|𝑁𝑜. 𝑜𝑓 𝑑⁄𝑑𝑥 > 0 − 𝑁𝑜. 𝑜𝑓 𝑑⁄𝑑𝑥 < 0| (3.2)

where 𝑋 = {𝑥9 }9?!:N is the health indicator sequence, 𝑥9 is the health indicator value
at time 𝑡9 , 𝑑⁄𝑑𝑥 represents the derivative of the health indicator, K represents the total
number of health indicator values; 𝑑⁄𝑑𝑥 = 𝑥9P! − 𝑥9 denotes the difference of the
health indicator sequence. 𝑁𝑜. 𝑜𝑓 𝑑 ⁄𝑑𝑥 > 0 0 and 𝑁𝑜. 𝑜𝑓 𝑑 ⁄𝑑𝑥 < 0 represent the
number of positive and negative differences respectively. The monotonicity score
ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher score indicating better monotonicity performance.
The other metric is presented as

QR.R2 , ⁄,'ST

𝑀𝑜𝑛$P (𝑋) =
\
𝑀𝑜𝑛$P (𝑋) =

+

N#!
QR.R2 , ⁄,' UT
N#!

QR.R2 , ! ⁄, ! ' S T

+

N#$
QR.R2 , ! ⁄, ! '

(3.3)

N#$

where 𝑑 $ ⁄𝑑 $ 𝑥 denotes the second order derivatives of X; 𝑀𝑜𝑛$P (𝑋) represents
positive monotonicity and 𝑀𝑜𝑛$# (𝑋) represents negative monotonicity [6].
A function 𝑓 can be monotonically increasing or decreasing depending on its
values. It may be trivial to check the monotonicality of a single failure progression
sample by examining the difference between consecutive points. The function is said
to be non-decreasing, if all of the difference values are greater than or equal to 0.
However, rather than individual sample analysis, monotonicality over all samples
representing failure progression should be considered [7].

3.5.2. Prognosability

Prognosability is a measure of a feature’s variability at failure in relation to the
range between its initial and final values. The prognosability of each path is determined

23

by dividing the standard deviation of the final failure values by the mean range of the
path. This is exponentially weighted to achieve the best zero to one scale.
V+,(2KFW*LXJKW*XV)

𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 𝑒𝑥𝑝 <− (|2KFW*LXJKW*X#V+KL+F:YJKW*X|)>

(3.4)

This metric takes into account failure values that are well clustered, i.e., failure
values with a low standard deviation and wide parameter ranges [17].

3.5.3. Trendability

Trendability is a measure of the similarity of a feature's trajectories measured in
multiple run-to-failure experiments. It is the measurement with the smallest absolute
correlation. As compared to the other two metrics, determining the trendability of a
population of parameters is even more complicated. If the same underlying functional
type can model each parameter in the population, a candidate parameter is trendable.
Trendability can be expressed as follows:

𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 𝑚𝑖𝑛cd𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑒𝑓F( de

(3.5)

The trendability is determined by the smallest absolute correlation measured across
the entire population of prognostic parameters [17].

3.6. Degradation detection
As previously stated, the health indicator provides information about the system's
performance or health. When there is a degradation, the health indicator changes its
trend, causing the prognostic module to predict the remaining useful life. There are
various methods for detecting degradation. One method is to divide the health indicator
into two or more stages by using a threshold.

24

Table 3.5 Methods for detecting degradation and their drawbacks

The division of the health indicator allows us to improve the reliability of the
degradation and the estimation of the RUL.

3.7. Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation

When a degradation is detected using the health indicator with a change from
normal performance, the remaining useful life estimation begins. In general, the RUL
is the amount of time between the time we discovered the fault and the end of the
useful life. According to Lei et al., this time is expressed as 𝑙9 = 𝑡Z[\ − 𝑡9 , where
𝑡Z[\ is time at the end of life, 𝑡9 is the current time, and 𝑙9 is the remaining useful time
at 𝑡9 [7].
Forecasting a wind turbine's remaining useful life provides us with information on
how much time remains before the wind turbine loses its operational capacity. The two
main challenges in predicting the remaining useful time of wind turbines are how to
predict based on the given data and the accuracy of the prediction [7].

3.8. Degradation modelling

As previously stated, estimation or prediction is accomplished through the use of
various approaches. According to Abid et al., these approaches are broadly classified
into two types: experience-based approaches and degradation modelling approaches.
The experience-based approaches rely on maintenance and inspection data, whereas
the degradation approach relies on physical or data-driven approaches. This modelbased approach models degradation using physical and mathematical relationships.
The wind turbine condition monitoring sensors provide us with accurate information

25

about our system and assist us in developing data-driven approaches to predicting
system degradation. Statistical and artificial intelligence tools are primarily used in
these data-driven approaches [6].

Table 3.6 Different RUL prediction approaches [7]

The table above shows that different researchers used different approaches to
predict RUL. Lei et al., however, further subdivided the model-based approaches into
four categories: physics model-based approaches, statistical model-based approaches,
Artificial Intelligent (AI) approaches, and hybrid approaches.
3.9. Prognostic metrics
When predicting the remaining useful life, we need some metrics to compare the
various approaches mentioned above. These metrics are divided into three categories
because the remaining useful life prediction can be evaluated from a variety of
perspectives. The first metrics categories are based on RULs from the field. The
second metric is based on run-to-failure data, while the last is based on available
measurements. In the table below, Lei et al. summarised some of the metrics.

26

Table 3.7 A summary of the RUL prediction metrics [7]

The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
are the most commonly used metrics for RUL evaluation (MAPE). However, other
new and relevant metrics for evaluating prognostics performance were proposed.
Prognostic horizon, 𝛼 − 𝜆 performance, relative accuracy, and cumulative relative
accuracy are a few of them.

3.9.1. Root mean square error (RMSE)
The root mean square of the prediction in the interval between the first prediction
period and the end of lifetime is called the root mean square error (RMSE).

𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 = &/" ∑:+?!(𝑟 W (𝑡) − 𝑟∗W (𝑡))$

(3.6)

where 𝑛 is the number of observations in the interval from the first prediction time
and end of lifetime, 𝑡 is the time index, 𝑟 W (𝑡) is the predicted RUL, and 𝑟∗W (𝑡) is the
ground true RUL. A higher RMSE value indicates a larger prediction error [6].

27

3.9.2. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)

Similarly, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is a popular metric for
evaluating RUL as RMSE.

𝑀𝐴𝑃𝐸 =

"00%
/

L 2 (+)#L∗2 (+)

∑:+?! i

L 2 (+)

(3.7)

where 𝑛 denotes the number of observations between the first prediction time and
end of lifetime, 𝑡 denotes the time index, 𝑟 W (𝑡) denotes the predicted RUL, and 𝑟∗W (𝑡)
denotes the ground true RUL [6].

3.9.3. Prognostic horizon
The prognostic horizon (PH) or prediction horizon is the time between the detection
of degradation and the end of life (EoL). It can be expressed as

𝑃𝐻 = 𝑡ZR\ − 𝑡F45

(3.8)

where 𝑖6] =is the first-time index when prediction 𝛽 criteria for a given 𝛼 and 𝑡ZRW is
the predicted end of lifetime EoL [6].

3.9.4. 𝜶 − 𝝀 performance
𝛼 − 𝜆 is a binary metric used to evaluate RUL prediction where the result falls
within a specified limit at a given time.
𝛼 − 𝜆 performance = w

(3.9)

where 𝜆 is a time window modifier; 𝜋(𝑝c𝑙+6 )e|P6
#6 ≥ 𝛽 is the probability mass of the
prediction PDF in the 𝛼-bound [6].

28

3.9.5. Relative accuracy

Relative prediction accuracy is the relative prediction error between the predicted
RUL to the actual RUL at a specific time.
𝑅𝐴^ = 1 −

where 𝑙+∗6 is the RUL’s truth value and 𝑙+6 is the predicted RUL at time 𝜆 [6].

3.9.6. Cumulative relative accuracy

Cumulative relative accuracy CRA evaluates the RUL at multiple time instances by
aggregating the relative accuracy values at a specific time instance. It is computed as
a weighted sum of the relative accuracies at multiple time instances.
𝐶𝑅𝐴^ =

∑
𝑤(𝑙+& )𝑅𝐴^
|`6 | 9X`6

(3.11)

where 𝑤(𝑙+& ) is a weight function depending on the predicted RUL, Ω^ is the set of all
time indexes and |Ω^ | is the cardinality of the set [6].
According to Lei et al., two other metrics that rely on the ground truth URLs are
convergence and exponential transformed accuracy. Among the metrics that are
affected by run-to-failure results are predictability, mean prediction error and standard
deviation, overall average bias, overall average variability, and reproducibility.
Metrics based on available measurements, such as online root mean square error,
online coverage, online width, and Epilog, are also discussed.

4. WIND TURBINE HIGH SPEED BEARING PROGNOSIS
In this thesis paper, we use PCA to detect faults in a wind turbine and build an
exponential degradation model to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the wind
turbine. The chosen model helps us to detect the significant degradation of the wind
turbine. Generally, the general steps of prognosis include: Data import and exploration,
feature extraction, feature post processing, training data, feature importance ranking,
dimension reduction and feature fusion, building model, model fitting and analysing
performance.
4.1. Dataset
The dataset in this study is taken from a high-speed gear dataset by Eric Bechhoefer
and is licensed under a creative Commons attribution-non-commercial share Alike 4.0
international License. The dataset has two cases: case 1 with fault and case 2/3 with
good condition. The dataset is collected from a 3MW wind turbine high-speed shaft
driven by a 32-tooth pinion gear with a sample rate of 97656 Hz. A vibration signal of
6 seconds was acquired in both cases.
4.2. Data Import
The data used for this project are in the form of MAT files which are a binary
binary data container format that a MATLAB program uses. Therefore, in this
implementation we used MATLAB and implemented MATLAB codes.

Figure 4.1 Imported data

30

In the above figure, the shown dataset contains a constant vibration signal (gs),
sampling rate(sr), constant angular sampling(pp), number of teeth on pinion(teeth) and
tachometer signal (tach).

4.3. Data Exploration
Data exploration is one of the most important steps for data understanding,
preliminary data quality evaluation and learning from the domain. The visualisations
usually reveal patterns or exceptions that would suggest that there is something
interesting in the dataset. In our case we explore the data in both time domain and
frequency domain in order to figure out what features we need to extract for prognosis
purposes.

Figure 4.2 Vibration signal in time domain
The above figure shows the vibration signal in time domain. The dataset contains
24 vibration signals of 6 seconds measured on 24 different days. It shows some
exceptions and trends of signal impulsiveness. From the figure above, we can suggest
that indicators of statistical features such as kurtosis, crest factors, peak-to-peak value
are potential indicators of impulsiveness of signals in the wind turbine bearing dataset.

31

Similarly, kurtosis is the most powerful tool in frequency domain wind turbine
prognosis. The figure below depicts the evolution of spectral kurtosis over time.

Figure 4.3 Visualisation of change in spectral kurtosis
We can see from the above frequency domain visualisation that we used a colourbar to denote the magnitude of the fault, which is normalised into a 0 to 1 scale. The
kurtosis value around 5kHz gradually increases as the machine condition deteriorates,
as shown in the figure. This means that spectral kurtosis features such as mean standard
deviation and others could be potential indicators of bearing degradation.

4.4. Feature extraction
We used frequency domain and time domain visualisations to analyse the vibration
signals in the previous section. We have concluded that we will derive statistical
features from time domain and extract spectral kurtosis from the frequency domain.
The extracted statistical features are depicted in the diagram below.

32

Figure 4.4 Statistical features extracted from both time domain and frequency
domain
Mean, skewness, standard deviation, kurtosis, peak-to-peak, root mean square, crest
factor, shape factor, impulse factor, margin factor, and energy are some of the time
domain statistical features shown in the figure above. In contrast, we included
statistical features from the frequency domain, specifically spectral kurtosis. These
include mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of the spectral kurtosis.

4.5. Feature postprocessing
Typically, the above-mentioned extracted time domain and frequency domain
features are associated with noise. The occurrence of noise will harm our RUL
prediction. In the following section, we will discuss Monotonicity, a feature
performance metric. We must use the classic moving mean filter since this metric is
sensitive to noise. The feature is shown in Figure 4.5 before and after smoothing. In
this paper, we implemented a casual moving mean with a lag window of 5 steps. This
signal delay for smoothing can be achieved by selecting the appropriate RUL
prediction threshold.

33

Figure 4.5 Before and after smoothing features

4.6. Training Data and feature importance ranking
When designing the prognostic algorithm, keep in mind that some data was
obtained at the beginning of the entire life cycle. As a result, we must assume that
some percentage of the data will be treated as training data. In this paper we have used
66.67% of the data for training.
Figure 4.6 shows that the margin factor is the most important feature based on
monotonicity, and that we used a minimum of 0.3 feature importance score to select
features for feature fusion.
Similarly, figure 4.7 displays features that were chosen based on a feature
importance score greater than 0.3. This feature selection is critical for feature fusion
following dimension reduction with principal component analysis (PCA).

34

Figure 4.6 Feature selection scores based on monotonicity

Figure 4.7 Features with feature importance score larger than 0.3

35

4.7. Dimension reduction and feature fusion
Dimensionality reduction is a critical step in the selection of important statistical
features. This is also the primary focus of this research paper. We chose a few
important features in the preceding section by using a minimum feature importance
score value of 0.3. This has resulted in the removal of more than half of the statistical
features proposed for determining the detection of faults in wind turbine bearings.
These statistical features are always correlated and contain redundant information. We
have a higher computational complexity because of the correlations and redundancies
among the statistical features, so we must use principal component analysis for
dimensional reduction while retaining important data information, as explained in the
introduction of this paper section 2.2.3.
In this experiment, we normalized the features into the same scales before
implementing the principal component as dimension reduction and feature fusion.
These normalized PCA coefficients, mean, and standard deviation were derived from
training data and applied to the entire dataset.

Figure 4.8 Principal components
The plot in figure 4.8 shows that the second principal component increases as the
wind turbine approaches failure. Therefore, the second principal component is
considered as a promising fused health indicator.

36

The second principal component is then visualized, as shown in figure 4.9.

Figure 4.9 Visualisation of health indicator

4.8. Exponential degradation models for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation

The following step will be to create a model for high-speed bearing prognosis. It is
the second critical step in determining the remaining useful time (RUL) after a fault
has been detected. In this study, we used the exponential degradation model to
demonstrate the exponential degradation process and estimate the RUL. Degradation
models, in general, estimate the RUL by predicting when a signal exceeds a predefined
threshold.
The exponential degradation model can be defined mathematically as follows:
𝑆(𝑡) = 𝜙 + 𝜃(𝑡) 𝑒 (](+)P a(+) #

b!
)
$

where 𝜙 is a constant model intercept that can be a lower or upper bound depending
on the sign of 𝜃. 𝜃(𝑡) is a random variable with theta mean and variance that is
modelled as a lognormal distribution.𝛽(𝑡) can also be modelled as gaussian

37

distribution with beta mean and variance.𝜖(𝑡) is a noise modelled as a normal
distribution with zero mean and variance, 𝜎 $ is the called the noise variance [16].

Figure 4.10 RUL estimation using exponential model

4.9. Performance analysis
There are various performance metrics used for prognostic performance analysis,
as discussed in section 3.8. We used the 𝛼 − 𝜆 metrics in this paper, where we set the
𝜆 to 20% and estimated the RUL within the 𝛼 bound. In the figure 4.11 we have plotted
the prognostic performance analysis.

38

Figure 4.11 𝛼 − 𝜆 plot for prognostic performance analysis

The probability within 𝜆 to 20% bound is plotted in the figure 4.12 below. we have
plotted the probability within 𝜆 to 20% bound. As more data points become available,
the prediction becomes more accurate.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

5.1. Summary of the research

This paper generally discussed faults and fault detection in rotating machineries,
taking wind turbine high-speed bearings as a test case. In this work, PCA is used as
dimension reduction and feature fusion tool to detect faults and determine the RUL of
the bearings. A general prognostic approach with steps such as health indicator (HI)
construction, degradation indicator and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation is
discussed in section 3.2. This paper implemented this prognostic approach in real time.
In this paper, statistical features of time domain such as mean, standard deviation,
peak-to-peak, crest factor, skewness, kurtosis, energy, margin factor, RMS, shape
factor and impulse factor were used. Similarly, statistical features were extracted from
the frequency domain, specifically spectral kurtosis. After selecting the important
features, one of the features is selected as a PCA component. The selected PCA
component is used as HI and as a trigger for the degradation indicator, if the HI goes
below a predefined threshold.
Generally, the approach discussed in this paper is very important and applicable in
different real-life situations. Future works can be done using different machineries
depending on the availability of data. Further research can be done on different topics
such as:
•
•
•

Further investigation of the effectiveness of the implementation of PCA in
large datasets of wind turbines
Fault detection using PCA in other machinery datasets
Condition monitoring techniques and comparison among the techniques
