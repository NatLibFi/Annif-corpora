The European Green Deal, a policy initiative set by the European Commission, aims to reduce
greenhouse gas (GhG) emissions, and ultimately achieve an economy with net-zero GhG
emissions by 2050. Achieving these targets requires development of new and novel
technologies in the field of green chemistry. The focus in this work was evaluating the
feasibility of using unsupported catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignocellulosic
bio-oil. In the literature study, unsupported MoS2 was identified as a promising catalyst
candidate for HDO of lignocellulosic bio-oil. Unsupported (Co)-MoS2 catalysts were
synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis and by thermal synthesis of emulsion liquid precursors.
Activated carbon (AC) supported Mo and CoMo catalysts were synthesized as reference
catalysts. The catalysts were characterized by numerous methods and their performance was
compared to commercial supported hydrotreating catalysts in HDO of isoeugenol. Commercial
Ru/C and NiMo/Al2O3 catalysts yielded high selectivity to propylcyclohexane. Clear
differences in performance were observed for the unsupported catalysts, while the performance
of both unsupported and carbon supported catalysts was enhanced by the introduction of Co as
a promoter, yielding higher selectivity to deoxygenated compounds.

Introduction

1 Introduction
As the world shifts from the use of fossil resources for chemicals, energy, and fuels, towards
renewable resources, new and innovative technologies are important to ensure a smooth
transition. Lignocellulosic biomass has been identified as a potential replacement for fossil
crude oil in the production of fuels and platform chemicals (Y. Zhang et al., 2020).
Lignocellulosic biomasses can be liquefied by different methods to produce bio-oils (Ambursa
et al., 2021; Dabros et al., 2018b). However, the resulting brown bio-oil differs greatly from
traditional fossil crude oil due to its high acidity and oxygen content and subsequent low
heating value (Dabros et al., 2018b). As such, the biocrude can be used as a heating oil;
however, in order to be used as a transportation fuel, the oxygen content needs to be reduced
significantly (Mortensen et al., 2011).
The oxygen content of the biocrude can be lowered by a catalytic hydrotreatment
process called hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) (Mortensen et al., 2011). Unfortunately, the
instability of the biocrude along with the impurities it contains can quickly deactivate
traditional hydrotreatment catalysts (Mortensen et al., 2016). For this reason, a slurry reactor
allowing for the removal of deactivated catalyst and subsequent introduction of fresh catalyst
could potentially be a superior option for bio-oil HDO than traditional fixed-bed reactors used
in hydrotreating of fossil crude oil (Bergvall et al., 2021). Slurry reactors have mainly been
deployed for hydrotreatment of so-called bottom of the barrel fossil-based crudes or residue
fractions (Bellussi et al., 2013). These heavy fractions usually contain higher concentrations of
heteroatoms such as sulfur and nitrogen as well as metal impurities (Bellussi et al., 2013). The
possibility of adapting this kind of reactor setup for hydrotreatment of bio-oil is being
considered. Commonly used catalysts in commercial slurry-phase hydrotreatment processes
are unsupported transition metal sulfides (Bellussi et al., 2013).
In this work, a literature study was conducted, focusing on the use of unsupported
catalysts in HDO of bio-oils and bio-oil model compounds. Catalyst properties, reaction
conditions, and additives, among other factors affecting HDO performance, were studied.
Based on the findings in the literature part, the catalysts to be prepared and tested in HDO runs
were chosen. In the experimental part, unsupported MoS2 and Co-promoted MoS2 catalysts
were synthesized by different methods, namely a hydrothermal method as well as by thermal
synthesis of prepared emulsion catalyst precursors. The performance of the catalysts was
evaluated in HDO of isoeugenol, a bio-oil model compound, and was compared to
commercially available hydrotreatment catalysts.

2 Literature review
2.1 Catalytic slurry-phase hydrotreatment fundamentals
The catalytic slurry-phase hydrotreatment process involves a catalyst which is dispersed into
the liquid phase in the form of fine particles, which are usually submicron in size (Bellussi et
al., 2013). Small particles are used to minimize mass transfer effects and to speed up the
reaction rate (Al-Attas et al., 2019a). In the slurry hydrotreatment process, gaseous hydrogen
is fed into the reactor along with the liquid feedstock containing the catalyst or the catalyst
precursor (Bellussi et al., 2013). The catalyst can be prepared either in-situ, through converting
of a catalyst precursor which is introduced into the feed or ex-situ, where a catalyst is directly
dispersed into the liquid feed (Bellussi et al., 2013). In the reactor, all three phases, i.e., solid,
gas, and liquid, are subsequently present. An illustration of a simple slurry-phase
hydrotreatment process can be seen in Figure 1. One major advantage of using slurry-phase
processes for hydroconversion of heavy oil feeds is the catalysts’ ability to limit the formation
of coke and other undesirable by-products, such as gas and fuel oil (Bellussi et al., 2013).
Catalysts used in slurry-phase reactors typically exhibit high hydrogenation and low cracking
activity, with most of the cracking activity being thermal cracking (Bellussi et al., 2013).
Formation of coke typically occurs at temperatures above the thermal cracking temperature of
ca. 400 °C (Bellussi et al., 2013). Another advantage is a higher stability of the unsupported
catalysts typically used in slurry reactors compared to traditional supported hydrocracking
catalysts used in fixed-bed reactors, which are more prone to poisoning and deactivation caused
by impurities in the feed (Sahu et al., 2015). By using a slurry-phase hydrotreatment process,
the frequent shutdowns and pressure drops experienced in other reactor types could possibly
be prevented (Zhang et al., 2007). The different catalyst types and combinations used in slurryphase hydrotreatment processes will be discussed in more detail later. In addition to the
robustness of the process, very high conversion of the feedstock can also be achieved using
slurry reactors, with many industrial processes used for heavy oil processing reaching over
90% conversion (Bellussi et al., 2013). Slurry reactors can be operated on a once-through basis;
however, reaching high conversion rates usually requires recycling of unreacted fractions
(Bellussi et al., 2013).

2.2 Bio-oil properties and challenges
Bio-oil derived from lignocellulosic biomass is a dark brown, acidic, and oxygen-rich viscous
oil that, depending on the liquefaction method and composition of the biomass source, might
require mild to more severe hydrotreatment in order to lower its oxygen content and,
subsequently, to be used as transportation fuels in vehicles (Venderbosch and Prins, 2010). The
most typical liquefaction methods include fast pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, direct
liquefaction, and supercritical fluid extraction, with the choice of the liquefaction method
affecting such properties as the water content, the oxygen content and the heating value of the
crude bio-oil (Ambursa et al., 2021; Dabros et al., 2018b). Typical properties of crude bio-oil
are a low heating value, poor volatility, chemical and thermal instability, as well as high
polarity, which causes mixing problems with traditional fuels (Liu et al., 2014; Saidi et al.,
2014). Crude bio-oils undergo an aging process, where polymerization reactions take place,
subsequently increasing the viscosity and molecular weight of the biocrude (Venderbosch and
Prins, 2010). This process is further accelerated by high temperatures, oxygen, and UV light
exposure (Huber et al., 2006). As mentioned earlier, the oxygen content of bio-oil depends on
the liquefaction method, with hydrothermally liquefied bio-oil usually containing ca. 10-20 wt% oxygen while fast pyrolysis bio-oil usually contains ca. 30-50 wt-% oxygen (Sharma and
Kohli, 2020; Yang et al., 2016). Oxygen is bound in the form of many different functional
groups which are called oxygenates and include alcohols, aldehydes, esters, carboxylic acids,
ketones, phenols etc. (Boldingh & Bauer, 2010; Veses et al., 2016). The crude bio-oil can be
separated into two phases, an aqueous phase consisting mainly of monomers and an organic
phase composed mainly of oligomers from lignin (Sahebdelfar, 2017). Crude bio-oil contains
impurities such as chlorine, sulfur, nitrogen, and alkali metals, which can potentially poison
catalysts used in bio-oil HDO (Mortensen et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the main source of
catalyst deactivation in HDO of bio-oil is carbon deposition on the catalyst, causing
deactivation and reduced catalytic activity (Guo et al., 2018; Wildschut et al., 2009).

2.3 Catalysts for slurry-phase hydrotreating of different feedstocks
2.3.1 Classification of catalysts used in slurry-phase hydrotreatment
Catalysts that are used in slurry-phase hydrocracking can be divided into two major groups,
supported and unsupported catalysts (Al-Attas et al., 2019a). The supported catalysts can be
defined as systems where at least one metal is impregnated on a support material such as silica
(SiO2) or alumina (Al2O3) (Nguyen et al., 2016). Typical supported catalysts used in
conventional crude oil hydrotreating are sulfided CoMo, NiMo, and NiW supported catalysts
(Wildschut et al., 2009). Noble metal catalysts such as supported Ru and Pd catalysts show
high heteroatom hydrogenolysis activity at low temperatures and high hydrogen uptake, while
base metal catalysts must be used at higher temperatures to reach adequate activity, which leads
to formation of undesirable char or coke (Wildschut et al., 2009). Unfortunately, noble metals
are expensive, which makes them economically less feasible (Wildschut et al., 2009). A
disadvantage of using supported catalysts is the deposition of heavy hydrocarbons on the active
sites of the catalyst leading to blockage of pores, reduced activity, and shorter lifespan of the
catalyst (Boldingh and Bauer, 2010; Wildschut et al., 2009). For this reason, support materials
with larger pores are used when hydrotreating heavy oil and vacuum residues with supported
catalysts (Sahu et al., 2015). This should also be considered when processing bio-oil, where
larger pores would allow bulkier molecules easier access to the active sites (Tieuli et al., 2019).
Unsupported catalysts usually contain transition metals, e.g., Mo, Co, Ni, W, Fe, or
other group IV-VIII metals, typically present in the form of sulfides or oxides (Boldingh and
Bauer, 2010). The major difference between supported and unsupported catalysts is the absence
of a support material such as silica or alumina in latter case. One drawback of such catalysts is
that the acidity or basicity of support materials cannot be utilized to e.g., influence reaction
pathways (Deepa and Dhepe, 2014). However, due to the good availability of active metals in
unsupported catalysts, large hydrocarbons reach active sites easier than in porous supported
catalysts, where larger molecules might plug the pores (Bellussi et al., 2013). This along with
the limited coke formation and being relatively inexpensive makes unsupported slurry catalysts
suitable for use in hydrotreating more problematic feedstocks such as heavy fractions and
fractions with high concentrations of metals or carbon residues (Bellussi et al., 2013). The coke
that is formed in bio-oil HDO when using non-acidic unsupported catalyst can be described as
soft coke, as it is oxidized at temperatures below 400 °C, while coke that is deposited on acidic
supported catalysts can be described as a hard coke, which must be burned off at temperatures
above 400 °C (H. Zhang et al., 2020). The coke on unsupported catalysts can be burned off at

Emil Högnabba

lower temperatures or by washing with a strong solvent (H. Zhang et al., 2020). Unlike
supported catalysts, where deactivation of the catalyst is also caused by sintering of the active
phases, the mobility or decomposition of active phases plays a minor role in deactivation of
unsupported MoS2 (H. Zhang et al., 2020). Loss of sulfur can cause deactivation in unsupported
metal sulfides; however, activity can usually be recovered with a resulfiding process (H. Zhang
et al., 2020). Unsupported catalysts can be used under harsher conditions, leading to better
heteroatom removal, depolymerization, and conversion of biorenewable feedstock (Boldingh
and Bauer, 2010). Unsupported catalysts can be classified into finely powdered, ultradispersed
and soluble ones, which can be seen in Figure 2 and will now be discussed in detail (Al-Attas
et al., 2019a).

(2019a).
2.3.1.1 Finely powdered dispersed catalysts
Finely powdered dispersed catalysts can be classified into analytical/technical grade
synthesized catalysts and natural ores (Al-Attas et al., 2019a).
Natural ores
The finely powdered dispersed catalysts of natural ore origin are widely used in industry for
slurry-phase hydrocracking purposes due to their availability and low cost (Al-Attas et al.,
2019a). Commonly used ores include magnetite, limonite, molybdenite, hematite, ferrite, and
laterite (Al-Marshed et al., 2015; Ancheyta, 2013). The ores can be processed by different
methods including drying, grinding, milling, and sieving of minerals (Montanari et al., 2017).

A study on hydrocracking of vacuum residue using red mud (containing iron and other
metal oxides) as a catalyst was conducted by Nguyen-Huy et al. (2012). Experiments were
conducted in a batch reactor at various conditions. A catalyzed and a non-catalyzed run were
conducted at 490 °C and 150 bar (90 bar H2). A catalyst loading of 4.0 wt-% (1.2 g) and a
reaction time of 2 hours yielded coke formation of 1.1 and 14 wt-% for catalyzed and noncatalyzed runs, respectively. The gas yield was also lower for the catalytic experiment in
comparison to the non-catalyzed run with 9.9 wt-% compared to 15 wt-%. It was determined
through characterization of the spent catalyst that the hematite (Fe2O3) in red mud, is activated
in-situ by sulfur released by thermal cracking to form active pyrrhotite (FexSy) phases, boosting
hydrogenation reactions.
The use of Australian limonite (AL) and Brazilian limonite (BL) for hydrocracking of
Brazilian Marlim vacuum residue, with a conventional NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst used as a reference
was investigated by Matsumura et al. (2005). All catalysts were pulverized to a size below 150
µm. At reaction conditions of 440 °C, 100 bar, reaction time of 90 minutes, and a catalyst
loading of 3 wt-%, conversions of 88, 64, 77 and 78 wt-% were achieved for non-catalyzed
run, NiMo/Al2O3, BL and AL, respectively. Coke formation was lowest for NiMo/Al2O3 at 4.1
wt-% followed by BL at 5 wt-% and AL at 8.8 wt-%. All catalysts showed better coke inhibition
compared to the blank run, which yielded coke formation of 20 wt-%. In terms of activity,
hydrogenation reactions were favored over the NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst while hydrocracking
reactions were favored over the limonite catalysts, yielding higher amounts of lighter
compounds. The distribution of products generated using different catalysts can be seen in
Figure 3. In general, removal of heteroatoms such as S and V was also better with the
conventional NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst, while Ni removal was higher with the limonite catalysts.

Analytical or technical grade
Finely powdered dispersed catalysts based on synthesized particles usually consist of transition
metals including chromium, iron, molybdenum, nickel, and titanium (Al-Attas et al., 2019a).
The particles can be oxides, salts, or sulfides and the size order varies between micrometers
and nanometers, depending on the preparation method (Montanari et al., 2017). Such
preparation methods used include ball milling, hydrothermal synthesis, and precipitation
(Ancheyta, 2013; Montanari et al., 2017). Regarding the size of finely powdered dispersed
catalysts, Co-doped MoS2 with particle sizes around 13 nm determined by high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) statistical analysis were reported by Cao et al.
(2021). Upgrading of heavy oil utilizing finely powdered catalysts was studied by Al-Marshed
et al. (2015). The catalysts were different Fe, Ni, and Mo oxides and sulfides of varying sizes.
For Fe, it was expected that the smaller particles would show higher activity due to the higher
surface area-to-volume ratio, however variations of the size of Fe2O3 particles (≤50 nm and ≤5
µm) did not have a significant effect on the coke formation and product distribution. For the
molybdenum-based catalysts MoS2 (≤2 µm) and MoO3 (≤100 nm), a better yield of liquid
products was achieved with the larger sulfide particles (86 wt-% vs. 84 wt-%) while inhibition

of coke was also better with lower coke yield (4.4 wt-% vs. 5.9 wt-%). It can be concluded that
the sulfide form of the catalysts, which is formed in-situ from sulfidation of the metal oxides,
helps to enhance hydrogen uptake and hydrogenation due to sulfur-deficient sites in the sulfide
catalyst and thus helps prevent condensation and polymerization reactions initiated by free
radicals from taking place. The tested Ni-based unsupported catalyst NiO (≤50 nm), also
showed good coke suppression and a good product distribution compared to the blank run, with
a coke yield of 5.8 wt-% and a liquid product yield of 84.6 wt-% compared to 12 wt-% and 76
wt-% for the blank run, respectively.
NEBULA is a commercialized unsupported hydrotreatment catalyst, produced by
Albemarle (former Akzo Nobel Catalysts) and developed in close cooperation with
ExxonMobil (Eijsbouts et al., 2007; Gochi et al., 2005). The catalyst is a porous sulfided
trimetallic NiMoW sponge catalyst, which has shown better hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and
hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) activity than traditional supported NiMo/Al2O3 and CoMo/
Al2O3 hydrotreating catalysts (Gochi et al., 2005; Plantenga and Leliveld, 2003; Vroman et al.,
2001). The use of traditional supported hydrotreating catalysts for hydrodesulfurization of
aromatic compounds such as alkyl-substituted dibenzothiophenes involves a two-step
mechanism for sulfur-removal, with hydrogenation of the aromatic ring taking place before the
actual desulfurization step (Plantenga and Leliveld, 2003). With the NEBULA catalyst, the
direct hydrogenolysis pathway is preferred; thus, sulfur can be removed directly without
saturation of the aromatic ring (Plantenga and Leliveld, 2003).
2.3.1.2 Ultradispersed nanocatalysts
Ultradispersed nanocatalysts can be achieved through the liquid-phase synthesis of
microemulsions containing catalyst precursors (Prajapati et al., 2017). An emulsion can be
defined as a colloidal system of non-miscible liquids, e.g., oil and water, where one phase is
dispersed and the other one is continuous (Prajapati et al., 2017). A surfactant, which lowers
the surface tension between two liquids, is used to stabilize the system (Prajapati et al., 2017).
Utilizing this kind of catalyst preparation can provide better dispersion, controlled sizes, and
homogeneity of the dispersed catalyst in comparison to finely powdered dispersed catalysts
(Son et al., 2008). Another advantage of catalyst preparation using this method is the ability to
control nanoparticle size and morphology by adjusting the ratios between oil/surfactant and
water/oil (Alkhaldi and Husein, 2014). Usually, the emulsifying procedure involves mixing
the organic component containing the feedstock e.g., bitumen and surfactant, with the aqueous
solution at a high stirring speed (Galarraga and Pereira-Almao, 2010). There are several

Emil Högnabba

methods that can be used to form microemulsions of different types, with the microemulsion
types including emulsion liquid membrane (ELM), colloidal emulsion liquid (CEL) and reverse
micelle (RM) (Prajapati et al., 2017). According to a study by Prajapati et al. (2017) focused
on comparing different types of microemulsions for obtaining ultradispersed MoS2, RM proved
to be the best option for hydrocracking of vacuum residue (VR), with this type yielding the
smallest MoS2 particles with the average particle size of ca. 120 nm, the narrowest size
distribution among the different methods with maximum 65% of particles being in the size
order of 120 nm and the least coke formed. Additionally, the catalyst synthesized from the RMtype microemulsion contributed to the highest hydrogenation of the mentioned types,
confirmed by the hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratio of the liquid product and the lowest amount
of unconsumed hydrogen.
2.3.1.3 Soluble dispersed catalysts
The soluble dispersed catalysts can be classified into two categories, namely oil-soluble and
water-soluble (Al-Attas et al., 2019a). These soluble dispersed catalysts are formed from
precursors that contain the active metal, usually molybdenum, cobalt, chromium, nickel, or
other metals from the groups IVB-VIII, with the metals usually in the form of salts or ligands
(Al-Attas et al., 2019a). The catalyst crystals are formed in-situ by sulfidation with H2S, which
is released during HDS reactions or by a feed of a sulfiding agent (Du et al., 2015; Furimsky,
2007). In comparison to finely powdered dispersed catalysts, soluble unsupported catalysts
have a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio, leading to higher catalytic activity (Al-Attas et al.,
2019a).
Water-soluble dispersed catalysts
Water-soluble dispersed Mo-based catalysts are formed through two major types of watersoluble precursors, namely ammonium molybdates and phosphomolybdic acids (Al-Attas et
al., 2019a). Pretreatment such as emulsion, dispersion, and dehydration are needed when
preparing water-soluble dispersed catalysts (Al-Attas et al., 2019a). Water-soluble precursors
can be prepared by mixing a water solution containing the catalyst precursor with a surfactant
(Al-Rashidy et al., 2019). This aqueous phase can then be added dropwise to a heated organic
phase such as light vacuum gas oil (LVGO), after which the mixture is stirred and heated (AlRashidy et al., 2019). Finally, the mixture is heated and bubbled with nitrogen to remove water
(Al-Rashidy et al., 2019). Together with the water-soluble precursor, water or a heteropoly acid
can be added to the feedstock, to form organometallic compounds which improve catalyst

activity (Sahu et al., 2015). Advantages of water-soluble dispersed catalysts are the cheap
inorganic compounds from which the precursors are synthesized such as for example
ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATTM) and ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) (Al-Attas et
al., 2019a). Unfortunately, in comparison to oil-soluble dispersed catalysts, water-soluble
dispersed catalysts exhibit lower catalytic activity due to evaporation of water and sintering of
the formed active sites causing generation of large particles, which reduces the capability of
dispersing into the tiny particles (Al-Attas et al., 2019a). Examples of catalysts are molybdates,
MoS2, NiMo and CoMo complexes as well as ferrous salts (Quitian and Ancheyta, 2016).
Oil-soluble dispersed catalyst
Oil-soluble dispersed catalysts are more commonly used than water-soluble ones, due to their
higher activity and better dispersion in heavy oil (Al-Attas et al., 2019a). These catalysts have
a unique ability to disperse well in the heavy fraction, with a high surface area-to-volume ratio,
a property which is useful from the standpoint of catalytic activity (Sahu et al., 2015).
Compounds used to form oil-soluble precursors include organic amine metal salts, organic
acids, and quaternary ammonium compounds containing metals (Al-Attas et al., 2019b;
Furimsky, 2007). Examples of oil-soluble MoS2 precursors are molybdenum dithiophosphate
(Mo-DTP) and molybdenum dithiocarbamate (Mo-DTC) (Watanabe et al., 2002). Compared
to the water-soluble equivalents, oil-soluble precursors are more expensive to synthesize (Sahu
et al., 2015). Molybdenum is the preferred choice when it comes to active metals used in oilsoluble dispersed catalysts, due to its high hydrogenation activity and limited coke formation
(Du et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2016). Hydrocracking of Liaohe vacuum residue was
investigated by Chenguang et al. (1998), using different oil-soluble metal precursors. The best
catalytic performance was again achieved with Mo followed by Ni, Ru, Co, V, and Fe.
2.3.2 Catalyst combinations and synergies
2.3.2.1 Supported and dispersed dual catalyst system
As mentioned previously, the main properties of unsupported catalysts are related to their
strong hydrogenation characteristics and anti-coking properties, while their influence on
cracking is low. By introducing a second catalyst, for example a supported acidic catalyst with
cracking activity, a good combination of properties could be achieved (Al-Attas et al., 2019a).
In these catalysts, the support provides the acidity for cracking while the active metal is
responsible for hydrogenation (Al-Attas et al., 2019a). However, supported acidic cracking

Emil Högnabba

Literature review

12

catalysts are susceptible to deactivation, due to the presence of metals in the feed and coke
formation, when used on their own (Al-Attas et al., 2019a). The anti-coking properties of the
unsupported MoS2 catalyst could prevent this from happening (Al-Attas et al., 2019a). The
synergies of the catalyst combination could ultimately lead to a higher conversion of the feed
and better selectivity to the desired products (Al-Attas et al., 2019c; Chianelli et al., 2006).
In a study by Al-Attas et al. (2019c), the synergies of a commercial supported
hydrocracking catalyst (Ni-W/SiO2-Al2O3-(Y-zeolite)) and a metallocalixarene-based
dispersed catalyst (Ni-p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene) for the hydrocracking of heavy gas vacuum
oil (HGVO) was investigated and compared to the standalone cracking catalyst. The
combination of the two catalysts resulted in lower coke and gas formation by 35.9% and 13.9%,
respectively, while the yield of distillate and naphtha increased only slightly (ca. 1%). The coke
yield was low for both cases, with 1.5 wt-% and 0.9 wt-%, for the standalone commercial
catalyst and a combination of the catalysts, respectively. Conversion remained unchanged for
both cases at ca. 83% and generally, the yields of the different fractions were quite similar for
both cases. The quality of the liquid product was improved with the dual catalyst combination,
with a higher H/C ratio and a lower sulfur content achieved, proving the synergy of the
combined catalyst system.

2.4 Factors affecting catalyst performance in hydrotreatment of bio-oil
and its model compounds
In this section, factors affecting the performance of the catalyst in hydrodeoxygenation (HDO)
and other hydrotreatment processes will be discussed. Different properties of the catalyst, such
as the active phase, support, promoter, shape, and dispersion, affect the performance of the
catalyst. Other factors such as process conditions and additives will also be discussed, as they
have an impact on the catalyst and process performance. The catalyst performance can be
judged based on several metrics such as activity, coke formation, selectivity, and stability. The
efficiency, quality, and performance of a bio-oil HDO process can be expressed with the yield
of organic fraction (Yorganic) and the degree of deoxygenation (DOD) as follows:

𝑌𝑜𝑟𝑔𝑎𝑛𝑖𝑐 =

𝑚𝑜𝑟𝑔𝑎𝑛𝑖𝑐
× 100%
𝑚𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑑

𝐷𝑂𝐷 = (1 −

𝑂𝑜𝑟𝑔𝑎𝑛𝑖𝑐
) × 100%
𝑂𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑑

(2)

In equation (1), morganic and mfeed are the masses of the resulting organic fraction and the crude
bio-oil feed respectively, while in equation (2), Oorganic and Ofeed are the concentration of
oxygen in the organic product and the feed (Dabros et al., 2018b). The expressions for the yield
and DOD can be defined differently in different papers, depending on for example, whether
the aqueous phase of the biocrude is included in the experiments and calculations. It might be
good to keep in mind that 100% deoxygenation is not always the goal, with oxygen-containing
compounds such as methanol, ethanol, and dimethyl ether (DME) being also considered as
good fuel components. Furthermore, there is a trade-off between the oil yield and DOD, with
high DOD correlating with a lower oil yield, since other compounds such as water and gases
are formed (Dabros et al., 2018b). Conversion and selectivity can also be used to compare
different catalysts and their performance as well as product distribution. The equations for
conversion and selectivity are:

𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 = (1 −

In equation (3), the moles of the residual reactant or the unreacted reactant is compared to the
initial moles of the reactant (Wang et al., 2015). In equation (4) the moles of a certain product
are compared to the total moles of reacted substrate, i.e., the total moles of products (Wang et
al., 2015).
2.4.1 Active component
The active species used in HDO include sulfides, oxides, carbides, and phosphides of transition
metals as well as reduced transition metals (including noble and non-noble metals) (Dabros et
al., 2018b). Commonly used metals in HDO catalysts are Co, Fe, Ni, Mo, Pt, Pd, Ru, and W
(Dabros et al., 2018b). These different types of active species will now be discussed in more
detail.
Sulfides
Sulfides are a good choice for bio-oil HDO due to their activity and being tolerant to sulfur,
which is also present in bio-oil, albeit in lower concentrations compared to fossil crude oil
(Dabros et al., 2018b). A common sulfided catalyst is MoS2, which is widely used in oil
refineries in hydrodesulfurization (HDS) processes (Y. Zhang et al., 2020). MoS2 can be both
unpromoted and promoted (Dabros et al., 2018b), and the roles of promoters will be discussed
later. The active sites in HDO using MoS2 catalysts are widely accepted to be the coordinatively
unsaturated sites (CUS) on the edges of MoS2, where sulfur or oxygen from the oxygenated
compound can adsorb in a way that C-O cleavage can take place and the deoxygenated
compound and water can be formed (Dabros et al., 2018b). The coordinatively unsaturated sites
are converted into sulfur-saturated sites by the adsorption of H2S (Şenol et al., 2007). The exact
mechanism taking place during HDO is still debated thus it will not be discussed in further
detail (Dabros et al., 2018b). The use of sulfides as catalysts requires feeding of H2S, using
different sulfiding agents if there is not enough sulfur available in the liquid feedstock, in order
to enhance/maintain activity of the catalyst and prevent oxidation and subsequent deactivation
(Furimsky, 2000). One disadvantage is that the excessive use of sulfiding agent can
contaminate the product with sulfur (Furimsky, 2000; Popov et al., 2010).

Oxides
Oxides of Mo, Ni, W, V, or other metals can be applied as the active phase in HDO. When
using oxides, a lower H2 pressure should be used to prevent the oxide from reduction and thus
making it inactive (Prasomsri et al., 2013). A lower H2 pressure might be considered
economically favorable but might lead to a larger amount of coke, as higher H2 pressures
usually help in mitigating coke formation (Dabros et al., 2018b). Sulfur is also potentially
detrimental to activity of the oxide catalyst, due to its strong adsorption (Rodriguez and Hrbek,
1999). For these reasons, reaction conditions should be optimized to keep the oxide in its active
form. Oxide HDO activity correlates with the presence and strength of acid sites, with Lewis
acidity affecting the initial chemisorption step while Brønsted acidity affects availability of
hydrogen at the surface of the catalyst in form of hydroxyl groups (Dabros et al., 2018b).
The HDO of phenol using partially reduced W and Ni-W oxides on an active carbon
(AC) support was studied by Echeandia et al. (2010). The conditions in the fixed bed reactor
were 150-300 °C and 15 bar. All catalysts exhibited activity, however the bi-metallic Ni-W(P)
and Ni-W(Si) catalysts using different precursors during synthesis containing P and Si,
respectively, showed significantly higher conversion than the other catalysts with almost 100%
conversion to oxygen-free compounds at 300 °C.
Reduced transition metals
Using reduced transition metals (e.g., Ni, Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh) as an active phase in HDO catalysts
is possible, since they show activity in hydrogenation (HYD) and HDO reactions (Dabros et
al., 2018b). Reduced transition metal catalysts do not require a feed of H2S to maintain catalytic
activity such as sulfides but on the contrary, they are susceptible to sulfur poisoning; thus,
sulfur present in bio-oil could potentially poison the catalyst during HDO (Mortensen et al.,
2016). In reduced transition metal catalysts, the interaction between the active phase and the
support is important, with adsorption of oxygenates happening on the metal-support interface
and hydrogen donation promoted by the active metal (Mortensen et al., 2016). Reduced
transition metals can further be divided into noble (e.g., Pd, Pt, Ru) and non-noble metals (e.g.,
Ni). The use of noble metals for HDO of beech wood bio-oil in a batch reactor was studied by
Wildschut et al. (2009) at both mild and severe conditions of 250 °C, 100 bar and 350 °C, 200
bar, respectively. Of the catalysts tested, Ru/C and Pd/C yielded good results in severe
conditions, with a DOD over 85% and the oil yield over 53%. One drawback of the noble metal
catalysts is their relatively high price in comparison to other types (Ambursa et al., 2021). Nonnoble metals such as Ni, Co, and Fe are attractive due to their low price and high activity in

Emil Högnabba

HDO (Čelič et al., 2015; Olcese et al., 2012). Čelič et al. (2015) studied the use of Ni
nanoparticles from a metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor (MIL-77(Ni)) for HDO of
glycerol-solvolyzed lignocellulosic biomass. The experiments were conducted in a slurry
reactor at 300 °C and 8 MPa H2. Ni nanoparticles were formed in-situ as the precursor
decomposed and formed particles with the final size of 100 nm. The Ni nanoparticles showed
high activity at relatively mild conditions and exhibited more than 10 times higher mass activity
in terms of mass Ni metal for hydrogenolysis than commercially available Ni nanoparticles (10
nm) supported on SiO2-Al2O3. This was explained by the high purity and crystallinity of the
MOF, leading to a better control over the size, shape, and homogeneous distribution of the
formed particles.
Phosphides
Different metal phosphides can be used as the active phase in HDO catalysts (Whiffen and
Smith, 2010). Ni and Co phosphides on activated carbon (AC) support were studied in the
HDO of fast pyrolysis oil from hardwood sawdust by Guo et al. (2018). A commercial Ru/C
catalyst with 5 wt-% Ru was used as a benchmark. The experiments were performed in a batch
reactor at 300 °C and 50 bar H2, with the total pressure varying between 110-170 bar depending
on the catalyst used, for 3 hours. 40 g of pyrolysis oil and 2 g of catalyst were added to the
reactor, translating into a catalyst loading of 5 wt-%. Of the phosphide catalysts, the best results
were achieved with catalysts with a metal-to-phosphorous (M/P) ratio of 3:2 for both Ni and
Co. With the NiP/AC catalyst with a M/P ratio of 3:2 a 66 wt-% oil yield was achieved, while
a slightly under 60 wt-% yield was achieved with the corresponding CoP catalyst. Varying the
M/P ratio was detrimental for the oil-yield, which might be explained by formation of new
active species on the surface or due to changes in acidity of the catalyst. In comparison to the
Ru/C reference catalyst, the results of the NiP/AC with M/P ratio of 3:2 were comparable in
terms of the fraction yields, with a slightly higher coke formation with the NiP catalyst.
However, the properties of the oil fraction from the NiP catalyst were better than for Ru/C,
with a higher DOD of 65 wt-% compared to 42 wt-% and as a result better higher heating value
(HHV) at 37.2 vs. 32.5 MJ/kg based on the Dulong formula (Guo et al., 2018). The Dulong
formula for HHV is defined as:

𝑂
𝐻𝐻𝑉 ( ) = 0,3383 × 𝐶 + 1,422 × (𝐻 − )

where C, H and O are the amounts of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in terms of weight-% (Guo
et al., 2018). The DOD and HHV for the Co-based catalyst with the same M/P ratio were 62
wt-% and 36.2 MJ/kg, respectively. Catalyst characterization of the fresh and spent catalysts
showed lower Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas and larger average pore
sizes for all catalysts, which is likely explained by coke and solids formation leading to the
plugging of micropores. The commercial Ru/C catalyst showed least reduction of the surface
area of all tested catalysts.
Oxidation and deactivation of a Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst in HDO of guaiacol (2methoxyphenol) was noticed when a low pressure of 1 bar was used, while this was not the
case at 8 bar (Moon et al., 2014). Water was also found to contribute to the oxidation of NiP to
less active species such as oxides and phosphates (Li et al., 2011).
Carbides
Carbides were studied by Sharma and Kohli (2020) for HDO of bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of
pine sawdust in a batch reactor at 350 °C and 45 bar for 2 hours. The unsupported carbide
slurry catalysts used in the experiments were NiC, MoC and NiMoC and the catalyst loading
in the reactor during experiments was 0.57, 0.57 and 0.09 wt-%, respectively. It was determined
that the use of the catalysts yielded somewhat higher liquid product yield than the blank run,
however the large difference was in the amount of solids formed, with the blank run yielding
over 55% solids and all catalyzed runs all yielding under 40% solids. However, the
performance of the carbides was not as good as the sulfide slurry-catalysts tested in the same
study. In addition, carbides have been shown to be susceptible to oxidation caused by water,
which is inevitable in bio-oil HDO (Engelhardt et al., 2017; Mortensen et al., 2015).
2.4.2 Catalyst support
The role of the support in HDO is dependent on the active species in the catalyst system and
on the oxygen compounds to be hydrotreated (Dabros et al., 2018b). The effect of different
supports using the same active phase was investigated by Phan et al. (2015) in HDO of the biooil model compound guaiacol. The active phase of NiMo was impregnated on to γ-Al2O3,
CeO2, and SBA-15 (mesoporous silica) support materials. Experiments were conducted in an
autoclave at 250 °C and 50 bar H2 for 3 hours. The BET surface area of the SBA-15 support
material was clearly the highest at 853 m2/g, compared to 132 m2/g and 83 m2/g for γ-Al2O3
and CeO2, respectively. Consequently, the surface area for the NiMo impregnated on SBA-15
support was also the highest at 270 m2/g while on γ-Al2O3 and CeO2, the specific areas were

Emil Högnabba

Literature review

18

86 m2/g and 27 m2/g. In the experiments, 40 g of 3 wt-% guaiacol in n-hexadecane solution
and 2 g of catalyst was loaded into the reactor. The chemical composition of the catalysts was
the same in terms of the amount of active phase and support. The metal loading of the catalysts
was 30 wt-% MoO3 and 6 wt-% NiO. The SBA-15 supported catalyst yielded the best results
with a conversion of 90% and a DOD of 67.5%. However, the coke deposition was also the
highest for this support at 2.6 wt-%. Conversion and DOD for CeO2 support were 23% and
20% respectively, while for Al2O3 the corresponding values were 15% and 18.5%. Coke
deposition for CeO2 and Al2O3 was 0.7 wt-% and 2.3 wt-%, respectively. Clearly the
performance of the SBA-15 support was the best in terms of activity and conversion, which
can be explained by the good dispersion of NiMo on the SBA-15 supports, while the deposition
of coke was slightly higher than with the other two support materials. The results are
summarized in Figure 4.

deposition in HDO of guaiacol at 250 °C and 50 bar H2 for 3 hours. Adapted from Phan et al.
(2015).
A major difference when comparing supported and unsupported HDO catalysts is cracking
activity. The low acidity of unsupported catalysts such as MoS2 and MoO2 leads to a low
promotion of C-C bond cleavage in comparison to a catalyst with an acidic support such as

Emil Högnabba

19

alumina (Grilc et al., 2015). In a study by Grilc et al. (2015), hydrodeoxygenation of
lignocellulosic biomass with different unsupported Mo and W catalysts was compared. All
unsupported MoS2 catalysts led to high selectivity of hydroxyl group (-OH) HDO with
selectivity in the range 93-97% relative to decarbonylation and decarboxylation, which is
beneficial from the standpoint of carbon retention and the liquid product yield. It can be
concluded that there was limited catalyst activity towards hydrocracking, decarbonylation and
decarboxylation reactions when using the unsupported MoS2. It should however be kept in
mind that high acidity of support materials correlates with coke formation (Grilc et al., 2015).
For example, γ-Al2O3 support, which is commonly used in conventional hydrotreating, has a
high acidity which translates into high coke formation on the catalyst surface, consequently
leading to deactivation (Popov et al., 2010). High coke formation is particularly problematic
when using porous support materials, since solids and coke plug the pores and thus reduce
catalyst activity (Nimmanwudipong et al., 2011).
One often overlooked property of suitable support materials for bio-oil HDO is water
stability (Dabros et al., 2018b). The water content in bio-oil and the water that is formed during
HDO can in the case of γ-Al2O3, convert it into boehmite (AlOOH), decreasing activity since
active species can get trapped in the support lattice (Laurent and Delmon, 1994; Venderbosch
et al., 2010).
2.4.3 Promoter
Both in the case of supported and unsupported MoS2 based catalysts, Ni and Co are often used
as promoters to enhance catalytic performance by improving hydrogenation activity as well as
stability against deactivation (Dabros et al., 2018b). The increased activity can be linked to the
formation of highly active NiMoS and CoMoS phases (Zhu et al., 2016). It has also been
suggested that different types of active sites or phases are more suited to hydrotreat different
types of oxygenated functional groups (Dabros et al., 2018a). The reaction pathways in bio-oil
HDO can also be influenced by the promoter (Guo et al., 2019).
A study by Ruinart de Brimont et al. (2012) on HDO of ethyl heptanoate (at 250 °C and
15 bar) with an unsupported Ni-promoted MoS2 catalyst, showed an increase in selectivity
towards decarboxylation (DCO) in relation to HDO with an increase in the amount of Nipromotion.
As already mentioned, the role of promoters in supported hydrotreatment catalysts is to
improve catalyst activity, stability, and to influence reaction pathways. The effect of Ce and
Cu promoters on a NiMo/γ-Al2O3 supported catalyst in HDO of bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of

Emil Högnabba

Literature review

20

cassava rhizome was studied by Sangnikul et al. (2019). The effect of 4% Ce or Cu promotion
resulted in ca. 66% lower oxygen content in comparison to the untreated bio-oil. The
corresponding number for the unpromoted NiMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was 52.5%. The increase in
HDO can be linked to the ability of Cu to promote hydrogenation (Khromova et al., 2014) and
Ce to promote hydrodecarboxylation (HDC) (Liu et al., 2012) reactions.
Water stability of MoS2/Al2O3 and Co-promoted Co-MoS2/Al2O3 supported catalysts
was compared by Badawi et al. (2011). A decrease of H2S/H2O ratio (addition of water) led to
deactivation in both catalysts, however deactivation could be reversed in the Co-promoted
catalyst by decreasing the feed of water and returning to the initial water-free conditions.
Subsequently, 90% of the initial catalyst activity could be recovered. In comparison,
deactivation of the non-promoted catalyst could only be partly reversed and is likely explained
by a combination of the following phenomena: the formation of oxidic phase, sintering of the
sulfide phase, active site poisoning by water and exchange of S-O of the outer layer of sulfide
slabs.
Different promoters for unsupported MoS2, namely Co, Fe, and Ni, in HDO of p-cresol
(4-methylphenol), a phenolic model compound for lignin-derived bio-oil, were studied by Guo
et al. (2019). In general, the use of phenols as model compounds for HDO of bio-oil has to do
with the high bond energy of the Caromatic-O bond in comparison to other C-O bonds in bio-oil,
making HDO of this bond more difficult. In the study, the activity of the catalysts as well as
the effects of Fe/Mo molar ratio and hydrogen pressure on DOD and selectivity were
investigated. Optimal results were achieved with the Fe/Mo molar ratio of 0.7 resulting in
conversion of 96.3% and DOD of 95.7% at 250 °C and 4 MPa H2 after 3 hours. In comparison,
the mono-metallic sulfides MoS2 and FeS showed conversion of 32.5% and 1.6% respectively,
proving the low activity of FeS as a standalone catalyst. The improved activity could be
explained by the synergy of Fe sulfides and MoS2, with the former acting as a donor phase to
supply activated hydrogen and in this way enhancing conversion. The Fe-promoted MoS2 was
also compared with Ni- and Co-promoted MoS2, prepared according to the same principle and
with the same ratio of promoter-to-Mo of 0.7. The conversions at 250 °C, 40 bar H2 and 1.5 h
of reaction time for Ni-MoS2, Co-MoS2 and Fe-MoS2 were 28.1%, 73.5% and 78.6%
respectively. Differences in selectivity of toluene could also be noticed between the catalysts
giving 39.5% for Ni and 98.1% for Co. The toluene selectivity value for Fe was ca. 95%. For
Ni-promoted MoS2, higher selectivity towards methylcyclohexane and 4-methylcyclohexene
was observed, indicating that more saturation of the aromatic ring was achieved with the Nipromoted MoS2 as opposed to Co- and Fe-promoted MoS2. It can be added that the Fe-

Emil Högnabba

promoted MoS2 had the largest specific area at 81.3 m2/g compared to 29.5 m2/g and 25.3 m2/g
for Co and Ni.

Figure 5. Conversion and selectivity to toluene in HDO of p-cresol at 250 °C and 40 bar H2
for 1.5 hours of reaction time with Ni-, Co- and Fe-promoted MoS catalysts. Adapted from
Guo et al. (2019).
A similar study was conducted by Cao et al. (2021), also on HDO of p-cresol using Copromoted nano-MoS2 catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor. A non-promoted MoS2 catalyst resulted
in 17% conversion at process conditions of 220 °C and 3 MPa. Already small amounts of Copromotion at Co/(Co+Mo) ratio of 0.1 resulted in conversion of 85.6%. An optimal promotion
was reached at Co/(Co+Mo) ratio of 0.3, which led to conversion of ca. 99%. Higher ratios
than this led to excessive Co and subsequently the catalytic activity decreased.
2.4.4 Process conditions
2.4.4.1 Temperature
As it has been mentioned already earlier, cracking reactions in slurry reactors with unsupported
catalysts are mainly of thermal nature. Typically, bio-oil HDO is performed in the temperature
range of 250-400 °C (Mortensen et al., 2011). At higher temperatures more cracking reactions
take place, leading to a higher coke formation and gas yield while decreasing the oil yield

Emil Högnabba

Literature review

22

(Elliott et al., 2009). The temperature has also an effect on reaction pathways of bio-oil
components, with different reactions dominating at certain temperatures (Dabros et al., 2018b).
For example, certain undesirable reactions take place at higher temperatures while reaction
pathways can also become inhibited. One such example is the hydrogenation of aromatics
becoming unfavorable at elevated temperatures due to chemical equilibrium of hydrogenation
reactions (Ternan et al., 1979).
In a study by Elliott et al. (2009), HDO of bio-oil in a fixed-bed reactor was investigated
at 140 bar. An increase in temperature from 310 °C to 340 °C led to an increase in the DOD
from 65% to 70% while at temperatures above 340 °C, cracking started to take place. An
increase in temperature from 310 °C to 360 °C was detrimental to the oil yield, as it decreased
from 75% to 56% while the gas-yield increased threefold. Simultaneously DOD decreased
from 65% to 52%. Clearly there is an optimal temperature for HDO reactions, with too high
temperatures having a negative effect on the desired products and performance.
Temperature also influences the catalyst stability, with a lower reaction temperature
being beneficial for catalyst stability (Liu et al., 2017). In a study by Liu et al. (2017), it was
reported that a Co-promoted MoS2 could be reused 7 cycles (8 hours per cycle) without a loss
of activity when the reaction temperature was lowered to 180 °C from 300 °C (3 MPa H2).
Conversion for the Co-promoted single layer MoS2 at 180 °C and 30 bar H2, was 98% after 8
hours while the conversion was 84% after 1 hour when the temperature was set to 300 °C. A
Co-promoted few layer MoS2 yielded a conversion of 21% after 2 hours at 180 °C. Typical
sulfided Mo catalysts suffer from deactivation caused by sulfur loss at higher temperatures,
which was in this case prevented by the lower reaction temperature (Saidi et al., 2014).
However, performance was clearly sacrificed for stability in this case.
2.4.4.2 Hydrogen pressure
A high hydrogen pressure in HDO is beneficial for saturation of unstable species, limiting coke
formation and ensuring good solubility of hydrogen in bio-oil (Kwon et al., 2011; Venderbosch
et al., 2010). In a study by Mortensen et al. (2011), the hydrogen consumption and DOD
correlation was investigated. Hydrogen consumption increased as a function of DOD and when
reaching higher DOD, the slope became steeper. This was explained by the difference in
hydrogen consumption between bio-oil compounds and the different reactivity of different
compounds, including the least reactive phenolic ones.
The effect of hydrogen pressure in HDO of p-cresol using a Fe promoted MoS2 catalyst
with the Fe/Mo molar ratio of 0.7 was investigated by Guo et al. (2019). It was noticed that a

Emil Högnabba

23

higher pressure and thus a more severe hydrotreatment resulted in significantly higher
conversion of p-cresol. At 1 and 4 MPa H2, the Fe-Mo-0.7 catalyst yielded conversions of 28%
and 95%, respectively.
As mentioned earlier, a high hydrogen pressure can diminish coke formation by
saturating unstable species and coke precursors. Low atmospheric hydrogen pressure was
investigated for HDO of acetone with a MoO3 catalyst by Prasomsri et al. (2013). There was a
significant drop in conversion at lower hydrogen pressures as a function of time-on-stream
(TOS), while the drop in conversion decreased as the hydrogen pressure was increased. It was
determined that the H2 partial pressure had a significant effect on the performance and
deactivation of the catalyst, with a higher hydrogen pressure contributing to regeneration of
active sites and preventing coke from blocking active sites.
Similar observations were made in HDO of fast pyrolysis oil from rice husk using
ethanol as a solvent and a Pt/SO42-/ZrO2/SBA-15 catalyst (Dang et al., 2013). The initial
hydrogen pressure was varied between 5 bar and 20 bar at different temperatures and ethanolto-bio-oil ratios. At comparable conditions, coke formation was lower when a higher initial
hydrogen pressure (20 bar) was applied, indicating that formation of coke was better
suppressed at higher hydrogen pressure. Slightly better selectivity to the desired saturated
products was also achieved at higher hydrogen pressures.
2.4.4.3 Catalyst loading
The catalyst loading can have a significant impact on the catalytic performance in HDO of biooil. The loading of an unsupported catalyst is typically much lower than for supported catalysts,
with unsupported catalyst loading usually being in the 500-2000 ppm range (Liu, 2016;
Prajapati et al., 2017). The effect of catalyst loading on product properties, yields, oxygen
removal, and coke formation was studied by Y. Zhang et al. (2020), where an aqueous solution
of the catalyst precursor, ammonium paramolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24・4H2O), was
emulsified in light cycle oil (LCO) with the help of a surfactant. LCO was chosen as the
reaction medium and continuous phase in which the bio-oil was emulsified. The dispersed
unsupported MoS2 catalyst was formed in-situ as the precursor decomposed and a sulfiding
agent was fed to the reactor. By varying the feed of the catalyst precursor, the catalyst
concentration could be controlled. Experiments were conducted at 360 °C and 79 bar with a
hydrogen feed of 1000 L H2/L bio-oil feed and a liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of 0.60
h-1. By analyzing the results of different runs, it could be determined that the product quality
improved with increasing catalyst loading (g Mo/g bio-oil), as both degree of deoxygenation

Emil Högnabba

(DOD) and hydrogen consumption increased. Catalyst loading values of 0.003 and 0.008
corresponded to DOD values of 72% and 91%, respectively. The values for hydrogen
consumption were 316 and 723 L H2/L bio-oil for the respective catalyst loading values. The
results are illustrated in Figure 6. Other affected properties in the bio-oil were decreased density
and acidity in terms of the total acid number (TAN). Higher catalyst loadings led to a slight
decrease in CO2 formation, while an increase in CO formation could be noticed, indicating less
decarboxylation and an increase in decarbonylation reactions. The amount of formed coke was
relatively small, ranging from 0.8 to 1.8 g/100 g bio-oil and a value of 1.0 g/100 g bio-oil
obtained for the catalyst loading of 0.006. Coke formation did not decrease beyond this by
increasing the catalyst loading. Finally, the retention of carbon in the oil-phase was estimated
to be around 64% to 71% depending on the formation of CO and CO2.

consumption (right). Adapted from Y. Zhang et al. (2020).
The impact of catalyst concentration on HDO of hydrothermally liquified bio-oil from food
processing waste was studied by Sharma and Kohli (2020). An oil-soluble precursor for
formation of a MoS2 catalyst was used in a batch reactor at 350 °C and 45 bar for 2 hours. The
catalyst concentration was varied between 500 and 1700 ppm and a blank run without the
catalyst was used as a reference. All catalytic experiments showed higher activity than the

Emil Högnabba

25

blank one in terms of the liquid product yield, conversion, and coke suppression. The highest
liquid yield and the lowest solids formation was achieved with a catalyst loading of 1100 ppm
Mo. The highest HDO activity or DOD was achieved with a catalyst loading of 1500 ppm Mo,
however the formation of solids was also higher. With the catalyst loadings of 1100 and 1500
ppm Mo, the DOD were 58% and 69% respectively. An increase in the catalyst concentration
beyond 1500 ppm Mo, led to a decrease in DOD.
A similar finding was made by Bergvall et al. (2021), investigating co-refining of
pyrolysis oil with vacuum gas oil (VGO) in a slurry reactor, using in-situ formed MoS2
particles. At reaction conditions of 435 °C and residence time of 1 hour, the catalyst loading
was reduced from 900 to 180 ppm Mo between two runs. This led to lower DOD, decreasing
from 94% to 85%. The total gas yield was also the highest of all runs when the catalyst loading
was 180 ppm Mo, which could indicate that the low catalyst concentration could not provide
sufficient hydrogenation and thus suppress CO and CO2 formation.
2.4.5 Structure and morphology
The structure of the catalyst can play a large role in the activity (Yang et al., 2008). As discussed
in the previous chapter, unsupported catalysts can be prepared by different methods, which in
turn influences the formation and structure of the particles and subsequently such properties as
the specific surface, the pore volume, and the pore size. The morphology and structure thus
play an important role in HDO performance and selectivity of products (Yang et al., 2008).
The effect of different solvents used during catalyst synthesis on Co-MoS2 particle
morphologies and their performance in HDO of p-cresol were studied by Song et al. (2018).
The different morphologies could be analyzed using field emission scanning electron
microscope (FESEM) images. MoO3 was used as a precursor in the synthesis of MoS2 with
different morphologies. The use of ethanol as a solvent yielded MoS2 in the form of nanorods,
while ethanol as solvent along with urea additive resulted in MoS2 nanotubes with a stripe-like
feature on the surface. The use of hydrazine in conjunction with ethanol gave MoS2 with
nanoparticle morphology while hydrazine as an additive and water as a solvent formed MoS2
nanoflowers. In terms of HDO performance, all morphologies yielded a similar product
distribution with a high selectivity towards toluene (>90%). However, in terms of conversion
there were noticeable differences between the morphologies, with 99% conversion achieved
with the nanoflower morphology, 78% with nanotubes, 53% with nanoparticles while
conversion with nanorods was clearly the worst at slightly over 30%.

Similarly, the structure-activity relationship of unsupported catalysts was tested and
discussed by Grilc et al. (2015). Different MoS2 catalysts were compared in HDO of liquefied
lignocellulosic biomass, giving similar selectivity for HDO reactions in all cases, with
differences in the yield of organic and tar phases. There was also a difference in the time needed
for reaching the same hydroxyl group conversion for different shapes and morphologies of
MoS2. An urchin-like unsupported MoS2 catalyst exhibited higher HDO activity in comparison
to a MoS2(IF)/C catalyst, a type of inorganic fullerene interconnected by carbon. However,
both catalysts yielded a similar product composition under the same reaction conditions, which
might point to the existence of fewer active sites in the MoS2(IF)/C catalyst, which had a higher
specific surface are than the urchin-like MoS2. The urchin-like MoS2 with its high
concentration of active sites on the needles of the catalyst, will not suffer the same masstransfer limitations that the MoS2(IF)/C catalyst or traditional porous catalysts might have,
since it does not contain small tubular pores that might get blocked and thus result in
deactivation. In addition to the different MoS2 shapes compared, commercially available
MoO2, Mo2C and nanotubes of WS2 were tested as received. These catalysts exhibited lower
HDO activity than both the urchin-like MoS2 and the MoS2(IF)/C catalyst. The characteristics
of the tested catalysts are summarized in Table 1.

2.4.6 Additives
2.4.6.1 Surfactant
Surfactants can be used to lower surface tension between polar and non-polar liquids, as is the
case when using solvents in conjunction with bio-oil to enhance mixing (Y. Zhang et al., 2020).
An emulsion of bio-oil and LCO was prepared by Y. Zhang et al. (2020), for HDO of bio-oil
using a MoS2 catalyst. The non-miscible phases (polar bio-oil and non-polar LCO) were
successfully mixed by preparing a bio-oil-in-LCO microemulsion using a surfactant solution
with a Hypermer B246SF-to-methanol ratio of 2.5:1. It was noticed that no pressure build-up
took place, indicating that polymerization reactions of the bio-oil were well suppressed at the
reactor inlet. The effect of the surfactant concentration on solid formation was subsequently
investigated. With no surfactant the solids yield was 12.8 g/100 g bio-oil, while the formation
of solids dropped to 3.1 and 0.5 g/100 g bio-oil for 0.6 and 1.3 wt-% of the surfactant,

Emil Högnabba

Literature review

28

respectively. A further increase of the surfactant concentration did not lead to lower amounts
of solids. Clearly, the use of the surfactant distributed the polar bio-oil effectively into the nonpolar continuous LCO and had a positive effect on the suppression of coke and solids
formation.
Surfactants can be used to modify the morphology of the formed particles in
hydrothermal synthesis of MoS2 (Wang et al., 2014b). The use of surfactants and their effect
on the morphology and surface area of the particles in the synthesis of MoS2 catalysts for HDO
of p-cresol was studied by Wang et al. (2014b). The MoS2 catalysts were prepared by a
hydrothermal method with such surfactants as hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CTAB), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and sodium lauryl benzenesulfate (DBS). The catalysts
were prepared using 2.3 g of ammonium heptamolybdate, 3 g of thiourea and 0.3 g of a
surfactant in 250 ml of ultrapure water with subsequent synthesis taking place afterwards.
Catalyst characterization results can be seen in Table 2. The results show that the catalysts
prepared using surfactants have much higher specific surface areas than the catalyst prepared
without any surfactant. MoS-CT exhibited the highest surface area followed by MoS-DB and
MoS-PV. In comparison, MoS2 prepared without surfactant had a much smaller specific
surface area. The same trend could be seen for the pore volume also. The amount of stack layers
in the Rim-Edge model was also affected by the surfactants. HDO experiments were conducted
in batch autoclave reactor at 300 °C, 40 bar H2 and a stirring speed of 900 rpm for 3 h. The
amount of catalyst loaded into the reactor was 0.6 g while 13.5 g of p-cresol and 86.2 g of
dodecane were added, resulting in a catalyst loading of ca. 4.4 wt-% relative to p-cresol. A
correlation between the specific surface areas of the catalysts and the conversions could be
noted, with MoS-CT having the highest surface area and yielding the highest conversion. The
catalysts prepared with a surfactant clearly performed better than the catalyst prepared without
one. There were also clear differences in the reaction pathways and product distributions for
the different catalysts with varying hydrogenation-dehydration-to-direct deoxygenation
(HYD/DDO) ratios. This can be explained by the different structures of the catalysts, with a
lower stacking degree of 3.7 stacks for MoS-DB corresponding to higher HYD selectivity
while the higher stacking degree of 4.9 stacks for the MoS-PV catalyst corresponds to a higher
DDO selectivity. The DDO and HYD selectivity correlate with the number of layers in the
catalyst, which can be explained by the Rim-Edge model of MoS2. An improvement in HDO
activity and different product selectivity could be achieved by using surfactants in the synthesis
of the catalysts, influencing such properties as the surface area and morphology.

2.4.6.2 Solvent
Solvents or liquid hydrogen donors have been proposed as a potential solution to combat coke
formation during hydrocracking of heavy oil, by preventing condensation of large aromatic
radicals (Kim et al., 2017). Hydrogen donors can be classified into three different types
depending on their nature, namely radical hydrogen, anionic hydrogen, and molecular
hydrogen donors (Shi and Que, 2003). In a study by Kim et al. (2017), the roles of hydrogen
donors in upgrading vacuum residue (VR) were studied at 400 °C and 10 MPa H2. An
unsupported MoS2 catalyst with the size of 4-8 nm formed from a molybdenum hexacarbonyl
precursor was used. When used only with molecular hydrogen and without a hydrogen donor
solvent, the MoS2 catalyst yielded coke formation of 7.2 wt-%. The hydrogen donors used were
tetralin, naphthalene, decalin and 1-methylnapthalene giving coke formation of 1.2, 2.9, 4.6
and 5.0 wt-% respectively, which is significantly better than the run without a solvent. A higher
yield of the liquid products was also achieved when using hydrogen donor solvents.
Solvents/reaction media such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, dodecane etc. can also be
used to improve viscosity and flow properties of bio-oil (Xu et al., 2014). The role of 1-butanol
solvent in the HDO of bio-oil from pyrolysis of pine sawdust using a commercial Ru/C catalyst
in a batch operating autoclave was studied by Xu et al. (2014). 1-butanol as solvent was
investigated in both subcritical and supercritical conditions, with the latter achieved at 287 °C

Emil Högnabba

30

and 49 bar. Bio-oil and 1-butanol were mixed at 1:1 ratio with 50 g of each component together
with 5 g catalyst. The reaction conditions were varied between 250-300 °C and the
corresponding pressure was 88-115 bar (20 bar H2) with a reaction time of 3 h, with runs
performed both with and without solvents. Solvent addition had a significant effect on many
parameters. At 250 °C the viscosity decreased from 254 to 7 cSt with addition of a solvent.
Comparison of the upgraded bio-oils showed an increased carbon and hydrogen content when
the solvent was used, with the corresponding number increasing from 62% to 64% and 7.3%
to 10.5%, while the oxygen content decreased from 31% to 25%. Formation of solids was also
lower with a decrease from 2.5% to 0.3% in the presence of the solvent. At supercritical
conditions (300 °C), further improvement of parameters was achieved with even lower
viscosity and the oxygen content dropping to 14.5%. The role of 1-butanol in this experiment
was determined to serve 5 different functions, namely, to serve as a reaction medium, take part
in the reactions (esterification of carboxylic groups), enhance hydrogen dissolution, protect the
catalyst, and improve product properties. In the presence of the solvent, polymerization
reactions are limited due to a lower reactant concentration of oxygenated groups and thus a
lower chance of polymerization reactions. As 1-butanol takes part in reactions with carboxylic
acids, the acidity and corrosiveness of the bio-oil is reduced. The solubility of H2 can also be
improved with the presence of 1-butanol, promoting hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation
reactions. Characterization of the catalyst was performed after runs with and without the
solvent as well as for the fresh catalyst. Using XRD and the Sherrer equation, it was noticed
that the Ru crystallites in the catalyst without the solvent protection were larger than in the case
with the solvent protection. It was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that
the crystallites increased in size as a result of the experiment. For the catalyst in the presence
of solvent, the crystallites had grown slightly in comparison to the fresh catalyst. However, the
particles were distributed quite homogenously. The spent catalyst in the case without solvent
had significantly larger particles sizes than the spent catalyst used in the presence of a solvent,
likely due to carbon deposition. Increase of particle sizes was caused by metal particle
migration and sintering under high temperatures. The characteristics of fresh and spent
catalysts can be found in Table 3. BET specific surface area was 808 m2/g for the fresh catalyst
with 82% and 42% reduction for the spent catalysts used without and with the solvent (1:1 biooil-to-1-butanol) at 300 °C and 11.5 MPa for 3 h, respectively. A pore size reduction was also
noticed, following the same pattern. It can be concluded that the use of 1-butanol had a positive
effect on both the upgraded bio-oil and on catalyst performance. However, the use of large
amounts of solvents might not be feasible on a large industrial scale (Lee et al., 2016).

2.4.6.3 Sulfiding agent
Sulfiding agents are mainly used to form the active species in sulfided catalysts, by e.g.,
sulfidation of a metal oxide to a sulfide such as MoS2 (Al-Attas et al., 2019a). Sulfiding agents
are also used to improve catalyst stability during operation by stabilizing active centers
(Horáček and Kubička, 2017). Commonly used compounds include dimethyl disulfide
(DMDS), thiols or H2S (Horáček and Kubička, 2017). H2S is formed once the compounds break
down (Rana et al., 2007; Viljava et al., 2000). In a study by Horáček and Kubička (2017), the
effect of sulfiding agent flow was investigated in HDO of bio-oil from pyrolysis of spruce with
commercial CoMoS and NiMoS hydrotreatment catalysts supported on alumina. In this study
dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) was used, which in reaction conditions decomposed to form H2S.
DMDS was applied for both ex-situ catalyst activation as well as for stabilizing the active sites
during HDO operation. At a 0.01 wt-% DMDS feed (relative to the bio-oil feed) catalyst
deactivation and destruction of active sites was noticed with the CoMoS catalyst, with
increasing amounts of heteroatoms including nitrogen and sulfur in the products as a function
of time on stream. Nitrogen was said to originate from the bio-oil, which indicates a reduction
in HDN activity due to inhibition or destruction of active sites. Sulfur found in the products
was reported to have been caused by destruction of active sites in the catalyst, thus leading to
lower HDS activity. Sulfur leaching from the catalyst to the organic phase was also reported to
contribute to a higher sulfur content in the products. This was confirmed by elemental analysis,
with 122 ppm of sulfur present in the pyrolysis bio-oil and an increasing amount of sulfur
present in the products as a function of time on stream (TOS). Over 150 ppm sulfur was present
in the products after 40 hours on stream. An increase in DMDS dosing from 0.01 to 0.2 wt-%

along with a switch to the NiMoS catalyst was said to counter a rapid decline in the catalyst
activity. The contamination of products with sulfur and subsequent removal should be kept in
mind when using sulfided catalysts for HDO.

2.5 Industrial processes utilizing slurry-phase catalytic hydrotreatment
Industrial processes utilizing slurry-phase catalytic hydrotreatment have mainly been
developed for hydroprocessing heavy oil fractions of fossil origin, with quite a limited number
of commercialized processes (Bellussi et al., 2013). Turning heavier fractions such as bitumens
and asphaltenes into lighter fractions that can be used as transportation fuels is often the goal,
thus utilizing the entire crude oil makeup and improving process efficiency and economics
(Montanari et al., 2017). The progressive depletion of light crudes has also led to an increased
interest in residue upgradation (Montanari et al., 2017).
2.5.1 The Eni Slurry Technology (EST) process
The Eni Slurry Technology (EST) process developed by the Italian company Eni, is a
hydrocracking process for conversion of heavy oil feeds such as asphaltenes to lighter
distillates that can be used as transportation fuels (Bellussi et al., 2013). The EST process is
operated in a temperature range of 400-450 °C and a pressure of 15 MPa (Bellussi et al., 2013).
One problem with the modern slurry technologies is achieving high conversion of the
feedstock. In order to reach a high conversion, unreacted heavy fractions need to be recirculated
back into the reactor and this has proved to be a problem in many slurry technologies, as it has
caused performance and operational issues (Bellussi et al., 2013). A huge advantage of the EST
process is that nearly complete conversion can be achieved, with the EST process said to have
a conversion rate of 98-99%, high hydrodesulfurization (HDS) over 80% and
hydrodemetalation (HDM) over 99% yields (Ancheyta, 2013). This is achieved by recirculating
the unreacted heavy fractions back into the slurry reactor after fractionation. A small amount
of the unreacted heavy fraction is purged to remove coke precursors and different metallic
sulfides (Ni, V) from the recirculated heavy product (Bellussi et al., 2013). When removing the
purge, a small amount of catalyst is also removed which is then replaced by introducing new
catalyst precursor to the feed (Bellussi et al., 2013). However, the amount of catalyst that is
removed is small, since the amount of purge removed is about 1-3 wt-% of the fresh feed
(Bellussi et al., 2013). The components in the purge that are removed can be separated through
a decanter centrifuge to recover the solid fraction or cake, containing the heavy fractions, coke,
and metal sulfides and the liquid fraction which is recirculated back into the slurry reactor
(Bellussi et al., 2013). The components of the solid fraction can be further separated to recover
such metals as Mo, V, and Ni (Bellussi et al., 2013).
The catalyst used in the EST process is an unsupported molybdenum sulfide (MoS2)
with the shape of nanosized nanolamellae, which is sulfided in-situ from an oil-soluble

Emil Högnabba

34

molybdenum naphthenate precursor. In the EST process, hydrogen is activated on the edges of
a monodispersed (MoS2) layer (Montanari et al., 2017). This allows for quick addition of
hydrogen atoms to the free radicals which have formed as a result of thermal cracking, limiting
aromatic condensation reactions and minimizing the formation of coke (Montanari et al., 2017).
Different types of catalyst systems were studied by Eni during the development of the
technology (Bellussi et al., 2013). Dispersed catalysts based on metals such as Fe, Co, Ni, and
V were tested; however, Mo was chosen due to it exhibiting the highest catalytic activity from
the hydrogenation standpoint (Bellussi et al., 2013). The use of metal promoters such as nickel
to improve catalytic activity of the dispersed MoS2 particles was studied, with both in-situ and
ex-situ introduction of the promoter (Bellussi et al., 2013). The interactions of the catalyst and
the promoter were studied; however, only slight increases in hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and
hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) could be observed during ex-situ preparation of the catalyst and
the promoter (Bellussi et al., 2013).
2.5.2 HCAT/HC
The HCAT/HC technology also known as High Conversion Hydrocracking Homogeneous
Catalyst (HC)3 technology has been developed by Alberta Research Council for the upgrading
of heavy oil fractions such as crude oils and bitumens (Al-Attas et al., 2019a). The technology
is nowadays licensed by Headwater Technology Innovation (HTI) (Al-Attas et al., 2019a). The
process utilizes in-situ formation of the dispersed catalyst from oleo-soluble organometallic
precursors such as iron pentacarbonyl or molybdenum 2-ethylhexanoate, with the catalyst
being formed once the feed is heated up to the reaction conditions coupled with in-situ
sulfidation to form MoS2 or FeSx (Bellussi et al., 2013). The technology provides high
conversion (up to 95%) of the feedstock and excellent anti-coking properties by enhancing
hydrogenation reactions (Castañeda et al., 2012). The size of the catalyst particles was
determined to be close to the size of the asphaltenes in the heavy oil fraction (Zhang et al.,
2007). The technology has been implemented commercially at Neste’s refinery in Porvoo,
Finland in a Chevron Lummus Global LC-FINING ebullated bed reactor operating on a oncethrough basis (Bellussi et al., 2013; Chevron Lummus Global, 2007). The MoS2 catalyst acts
as a co-catalyst together with a supported hydrotreatment catalyst, complementing the
hydrocracking function of the supported catalyst with a high hydrogenation activity (Kunnas
and Smith, 2011).

2.5.3 Veba Combi Cracker (VCC)
The Veba Combi Cracker (VCC) process has been developed from the Bergius process, which
is used for liquefaction of coal (Bellussi et al., 2013). In the VCC process, the heavy oil residue
is slurried with a Bovey coal powder and red mud (bauxite residue from alumina production
by Bayer process) catalyst containing iron and other metals, with an iron concentration of ca.
5.0 wt-% (Al-Attas et al., 2019a). The role of the additive and the catalyst is mainly to prevent
the formation of coke. The VCC process is claimed to have conversion over 90% (Sahu et al.,
2015). Operating conditions of the process are usually in the temperature range of 440-485 °C
and the pressure range of 220-250 bar (Bellussi et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2007). The VCC
process typically operates on a once-through basis (Ziegelaar and Schleiffer, 2016).
2.5.4 UOP Uniflex process
The UOP Uniflex process has been developed from the CANMET Hydrocracking Process and
UOP Unicracking and Unionfining Process Technologies (Gillis et al., 2010). The UOP
Uniflex process is flexible with respect to the feedstock and can process feeds such as vacuum
residues and heavy crudes (Gillis et al., 2010). The process utilizes a nanoscale catalyst based
on molybdenum, which main functions are promoting hydrogenation of cracked products,
limiting saturation of aromatic rings, and limiting coke formation (Kapustin et al., 2021). In
the UOP Uniflex process, an upflow of hydrogen is bubbled through the liquid-filled reactor,
leading to back-mixing and near-isothermal conditions (Gillis et al., 2010). This allows the
process to be operated at a higher temperature and together with a partial recycling of the
unreacted heavy fraction, a high conversion exceeding 90% can be reached (Gillis et al., 2010).
Typical process conditions in the upflow reactor of the UOP Uniflex technology are in the
temperature range of 435-470 °C and a pressure of 13.8 MPa (Gillis et al., 2010).
2.5.5 PDVSA HDH-Plus process
The PDVSA HDH-Plus technology for upgrading of Orinoco Belt heavy crudes utilizes a
catalyst based on different compounds containing iron or molybdenum, which is dispersed in
the feed with the help of a catalytic emulsion (Bellussi et al., 2013). Typical operating
conditions in PDVSA HDH-Plus process are temperatures of 430-460 °C, total pressure of 170210 bar (H2 partial pressure of 125-150 bar) with conversion reported to be above 85%
(Bellussi et al., 2013).

2.6 Suitable catalysts for slurry-phase hydrotreatment of bio-oil
2.6.1 Recent bio-oil HDO experiments
This section aims to compare real bio-oil HDO experiments with both unsupported and
supported catalysts, by highlighting catalytic performance of different catalyst systems in terms
of DOD and formation of coke/solids. All reviewed experiments were conducted in batch
autoclaves using real bio-oil feeds, while most experiments also utilized a solvent. A summary
of experiments and corresponding catalysts, conditions, and results can be seen in Table 5.
2.6.1.1 Unsupported catalysts
Research papers on the use of unsupported catalysts for real lignocellulosic bio-oil feeds are
quite limited, while papers on model compound HDO are more readily available (Cao et al.,
2021; Song et al., 2018; Whiffen and Smith, 2010). Studies utilizing unsupported MoS2
catalysts for palm oil (Burimsitthigul et al., 2021) and bio-oil from liquefied food processing
waste (Sharma and Kohli, 2020) also exist; however, the composition of these oils, which are
rich in fatty acid derivatives and straight-chain oxygenated hydrocarbons, differ largely from
the compounds in lignocellulosic bio-oil, which include phenols, aldehydes, ketones etc.
(Burimsitthigul et al., 2021; Sharma and Kohli, 2020). Nevertheless, some promising results
have also been achieved in HDO of lignocellulosic bio-oil using Mo-based unsupported
catalysts, which can be seen in Table 5. A high degree of deoxygenation and relatively low
coke formation has been achieved with different Mo-based catalysts (Grilc et al., 2015; Liu,
2016; Yang et al., 2016).
2.6.1.2 Supported catalysts
The use of noble metal catalysts such as Ru/C (Xu et al., 2014) and Pt/C (Oh et al., 2017), have
been proven efficient in bio-oil HDO with high HDO activity and a relatively low coke
formation. Using supercritical 1-butanol as a solvent together with the Ru/C catalyst
contributed to a minimal coke formation (0.2 wt-%). A relatively low coke formation was also
achieved with Fe, Co, and Fe-Co on SiO2 support; however, HDO activity was lower than for
the previously mentioned noble metal catalysts even though the reaction time was longer
(Cheng et al., 2017). HDO experiments with NiMo and Cu or Ce-promoted NiMo on γ-Al2O3
yielded high formation of coke (over 40 wt-%) and can be linked to a high acidity of γ-Al2O3
but also to a relatively low hydrogen pressure (Sangnikul et al., 2019). Different Ni-based
catalysts on SBA-15 support were tested by (Oh et al., 2020). The tested active phases were

NiCu, NiMn, and NiZn, with all active phases yielding similar DOD (44.5-55.6 %) and coke

2.6.2 Suitable catalyst candidates for slurry-phase hydrotreatment of bio-oil and
corresponding properties
Catalyst properties and their effects on bio-oil HDO performance were discussed earlier.
Classification of the catalyst types, depending on their preparation methods, were discussed in
the beginning. Depending on the preparation method and additives used, different sizes,
specific surface areas, and morphologies of the formed particles can be achieved, having a
direct effect on the HDO activity and performance of the catalyst. The advantages and
disadvantages of different active species were covered, with high HDO activity obviously
already mentioned as one criterion. In addition, the active phase should result in low coke
formation and be resistant to deactivation caused by for example water, oxidation, or feed
impurities such as sulfur. The active phase should preferably also be readily available and
cheap, which makes the use of noble metal catalysts such as Ru/C less attractive. When using
supported catalysts, the support should preferably have low acidity, as acidic supports tend to
form more coke and lead to more cracking reactions. The low acidity of unsupported catalysts
is positive in terms of limited coke formation, low activity towards cracking reactions, and a
high liquid product yield. The lack of the support means that it cannot be used to influence
reaction pathways and selectivity; however, this can to some degree be achieved by modifying
the morphology of the dispersed catalyst or by promoting the catalyst with a suitable promoter.
The activity of the active phase can also be enhanced with the use of a promoter. External
factors such as reaction conditions should be optimized, considering the inverse relationship
between the performance and the catalyst stability, with harsher conditions leading to lower
stability. Based on the literature review, sulfided catalysts such as the unsupported MoS2 have
been identified as promising candidates for the HDO of bio-oil, since these catalysts have many
of the required features and properties. Low acidity of unsupported catalysts is beneficial for
low coke formation in HDO of bio-oil. For this reason, unsupported catalysts do not suffer
from plugging of the pores in the same way as supported counterparts. MoS2 catalyst has been
frequently used also in the recent research, yielding good results in terms of conversion and
deoxygenation while at the same time limiting coke formation (Grilc et al., 2015; Y. Zhang et
al., 2020). Coupling this catalyst with an appropriate promoter to further improve activity has
also been studied and has been shown to improve catalyst performance (Cao et al., 2021; Wang
et al., 2014a). Finding and developing suitable and efficient catalysts for bio-oil HDO is of
paramount importance for the feasibility of the technology.

3 Experimental
Unsupported MoS2 and Co-promoted MoS2 catalysts were synthesized by a hydrothermal
method as well as by preparing liquid catalyst precursors by an emulsion method. Cobalt was
chosen as the promoter in unsupported MoS2 as it favors the direct deoxygenation (DDO)
reaction pathway in HDO of p-cresol, removing the -OH group directly from the aromatic ring
(Wang et al., 2014a). In the case of nickel, the reaction pathway usually involves hydrogenation
of the aromatic ring before oxygen is removed (Wang et al., 2015). To compare supported vs.
unsupported catalysts, Mo and Co-promoted Mo catalysts on activated carbon support were
synthesized. Activated carbon was chosen as the support due to its low acidity, which is
favorable for mitigating coke formation (Grilc et al., 2015).

3.2 Catalyst synthesis
3.2.1 Synthesis of Mo/AC and CoMo/AC supported catalysts
The designed loading of molybdenum on the activated carbon support, i.e., Norit SA2 activated
charcoal was 11.2 wt-% and the catalyst synthesis was conducted using the incipient wetness
impregnation (IWI) method. In the CoMo on activated carbon (AC) catalyst, the planned
Co/Mo molar ratio was 0.5. Typically, synthesis was carried out by weighing 9.5 g of Norit
SA2 activated carbon support material into a double neck round bottom flask. The activated
carbon was then dried for 2 hours by heating the flask to 120 °C. After 2 hours, the flask was
vacuumed, and drying was continued overnight. Heating was turned off the next morning. The
impregnation solution was prepared by weighing 2.20 g of ammonium heptamolybdate
tetrahydrate (AHM) ((NH₄)₆Mo₇O₂₄ · 4 H₂O). AHM was dissolved in MilliQ water by magnetic
stirring and MilliQ water was added until the total volume of the solution was 8.5 ml, as this
was the total pore volume of the dried support material. The same procedure was used for the
CoMo/AC catalyst, with the difference that 1.81 g of cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2
· 6 H2O) was dissolved in MilliQ water in a separate measuring cylinder before mixing with
AHM. MilliQ water was then added until the total volume was 8.5 ml. The impregnation
solution, which can be seen in Figure 7, was added to the dropping funnel attached to the flask.

The vacuum tap was closed, and the dropping funnel tap was opened, allowing the solution to
enter the cylinder, and subsequently the pores of the support material. The flask was then
‘’clapped’’ in order to distribute the solution evenly and break down bigger pieces of the
support material that had lumped together. The impregnation solution was then allowed to
absorb into the pores overnight. The catalyst was thereafter dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 5
hours using a Buchi rotavapor. After drying was completed, calcination of the catalyst in
nitrogen was performed in a rotating calcination oven, shown in Figure 8, at 250 °C for 2 hours
with a temperature ramp of 5 °C/min and a nitrogen flow of 0.3 l/min. Both Mo/AC and
CoMo/AC catalysts were pre-sulfided using excess dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) prior to HDO
runs. Sulfidation was conducted at conditions of 30 bar H2 of initial pressure and 350 °C for 1
hour.

3.2.2 Synthesis of MoS2 and Co-MoS2 by hydrothermal method
Unsupported MoS2 and Co-MoS2 synthesis by hydrothermal method was conducted with a
one-step procedure based on literature from Wang et al. (2014a, 2016, 2017). The chemistry,
including the decomposition of compounds and formation of MoS2 in hydrothermal synthesis,
is described by equations (6)-(9) (Waskito et al., 2019).

At first, 0.61 g of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (AHM) ((NH₄)₆Mo₇O₂₄ · 4 H₂O)
and 0.8 g of thiourea (SC(NH2)2) were dissolved in 20 ml of MilliQ water. For the Co-promoted
MoS2, 0.50 g of cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2 · 6 H2O) was also added to the same
solution, yielding a Co/Mo molar ratio of 0.5. The pH of this solution was then adjusted to 0.8
with 37% HCl and was monitored using a Mettler Toledo SevenGo pH meter. Adjusting the
pH caused the solution to turn black. A lower pH is said to enhance the nucleation rate during
hydrothermal synthesis, producing MoS2 with smaller crystallites (Zhang et al., 2018). The
solution and a magnetic stirring bar were then added to a 40 ml in-house built autoclave
equipped with a Teflon cup. The autoclave and the heating setup can be seen in Figure 9.

autoclave was thermally insulated using insulation bandage.
The autoclave was then sealed and flushed with nitrogen three times while a pressure test at 30
bar was also conducted prior to synthesis. Synthesis was performed by heating the autoclave
to 200 °C and keeping it at this temperature for 20 h. Magnetic stirring during synthesis was
set to 260 rpm. During synthesis, the total pressure increased up to 25 bar. After 20 hours the
reactor was cooled, depressurized into the fume hood exit, and flushed with nitrogen to remove
excess gases such as H2S. The autoclave was then opened and the solution containing the black
catalyst was poured into a beaker, which can be seen in Figure 10.

The solution was filtered using a funnel and a filter paper and was subsequently washed three
times using Etax Aa 99.5% ethanol to remove residual water and water-soluble impurities. The
wet catalyst was weighed and then dried in vacuum at 50 °C for 5 hours using a rotavapor, as
can be seen in Figure 11.

3.2.3 Synthesis of MoS2 and Co-MoS2 by emulsion method
Liquid catalyst precursors were prepared by an emulsion approach, whereby metal salts and
optionally a sulfiding agent were dissolved in an aqueous phase. The aqueous phase was mixed
with the organic phase, consisting of an organic solvent and a surfactant or stabilizing particles.
Finally, high-shear mixing was used to mix the two phases. Thermal synthesis of the catalyst
from the prepared emulsion catalyst precursors can then be performed to form the catalyst
particles either in-situ or ex-situ.
Prior to preparing the final catalyst emulsions, a screening process was conducted (see
Appendix A). Screening included the testing of different compositions, surfactants, and
agitation methods. Tested surfactants and stabilizing particles included Span 80, Tween 80,
Wacker HDK H18 silica nanoparticles, and Wacker HDK H20 silica nanoparticles. The
hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) is a measure for the degree to which a surfactant is
hydrophilic or lipophilic (Kassem et al., 2019). A typical HLB value for water-in-oil (w/o)
emulsifiers is in the range of 4-6 while the typical value for oil-in-water (o/w) emulsifiers is 818 (Kassem et al., 2019). The HLB values of Span 80 and Tween 80 are 4.3 and 15, respectively
(Kassem et al., 2019). Emulsions prepared with Tween 80 were not very stable, which can in
part be explained by its HLB value, and consequently Span 80 was more suitable for use in
stabilizing the w/o emulsions. Of the tested Wacker HDK silica nanoparticles (SiO2), HDK
H18 provided more stable emulsions than HDK H20. The particles have similar surface area
(170-230 m2/g); however, differ in their hydrophobicity (Hohl et al., 2016). The amount of
silanol groups (Si-OH) attached to the particle surface affects hydrophobicity of the particles,
with low amounts of silanol leading to more hydrophobic particles (Hohl et al., 2016). The
residual silanol content can be defined as relative silanol content in relation to the hydrophilic
silica and the corresponding values for HDK H18 and HDK H20 are 25% and 50%,
respectively (Hohl et al., 2016). The viscosity of emulsions stabilized with HDK H20 particles
quickly increased as the concentration of nanoparticles was increased, which led to the
formation of thick slurries, whereas this did not happen with HDK H18 stabilized emulsions.
The emulsions were confirmed to be of w/o type by conducting dilution tests, in which ndodecane and water were used as the diluents. Dilution with water led to the formation of two
distinct phases while dilution with n-dodecane yielded a single phase.
The final liquid emulsion catalyst precursors were prepared with n-dodecane (C12) as
the organic phase instead of kerosene, with the latter used during screening. By using a pure
hydrocarbon such as n-dodecane instead of kerosene, a crude oil middle distillate containing

Emil Högnabba

different types of hydrocarbons including paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics, analyzing
product samples from HDO runs is easier, since the emulsion is added to the reactant solution.
Recipe development was partly based on the patent by Stanciulescu et al. (1996). Emulsion
preparation was conducted by first preparing an aqueous solution containing 10 w/v-%
ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate. In Co-promoted emulsions, cobalt (II) nitrate
hexahydrate was added in an amount corresponding to a Co/Mo molar ratio of 0.5. Dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) (C2H6OS) was added as a sulfiding agent to the aqueous solution in
stoichiometric amount. A Co-MoS2 emulsion containing no DMSO was also prepared in the
same manner. In this case dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) was used as a sulfiding agent and added
separately in a pre-sulfiding step prior to HDO of isoeugenol. The organic phase in the
emulsions was prepared by mixing either Span 80, a non-ionic surfactant, or Wacker HDK H18
pyrogenic silica nanoparticles, with n-dodecane. Span 80 was directly dissolved in n-dodecane,
while HDK H18 silica nanoparticles were added slowly to stirred n-dodecane. The water/oil
(w/o) emulsions were then prepared by dropwise addition of the aqueous phase to the organic
phase while being agitated by a IKA T18 Ultra-Turrax Homogenizer. After the aqueous phase
was added, the emulsions were agitated at 6500 rpm and 9500 rpm for 5 minutes at each rpm
speed. The emulsion compositions were chosen based on the most stable compositions during
the emulsion screening process. With Span 80 it was a composition containing 5 vol-% Span
80 in the oil phase and a w/o ratio of 50/50 vol-%. Using HDK H18 silica nanoparticles it was
a composition containing 5 w/v-% HDK H18 silica nanoparticles in the organic phase and with
a w/o ratio of 25/75 vol-%. Emulsions containing DMSO as the sulfiding agent can be seen in
Figure 12, while the emulsion pre-sulfided with DMDS prior to HDO run is displayed in Figure
13.

3.3 Catalyst characterization
3.3.1 Characterization of Mo/AC and CoMo/AC catalysts
Nitrogen physisorption with a Micromeritics 3Flex 3500 N2 physisorption instrument was used
to study the porosity of the synthesized catalysts by physisorption of nitrogen at -196 °C. The
samples were degassed at 200 °C using vacuum degassing for 18 h before experiments. The
morphology, the dispersion of metal on the support material, and the elemental composition
was characterized using a Carl Zeiss Merlin field emission scanning electron microscope
(FESEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The elemental composition was also
studied using a PANalytical Axios mAX wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF)
spectrometer. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was
utilized for determining the metal content using an Agilent Technologies synchronous vertical
dual view (SVDV) 5110 ICP-OES. The operating procedure used in ICP analysis of all
analyzed samples is documented in Appendix D.
3.3.2 Characterization of (Co)-MoS2 by emulsion method
A Nikon Ci-L fluorescence microscope was used initially to study emulsion droplet size,
providing information on the size of in-situ formed particles. The particle size distribution
(PSD) and the droplet size were determined using LD with a Beckman Coulter LS230 MW
Particle size analyzer using the Micro Liquid Module after dispersing it in dodecane. The metal
content of emulsion samples was determined using an Agilent Technologies synchronous
vertical dual view (SVDV) 5110 ICP-OES.
3.3.3 Characterization of (Co)-MoS2 by hydrothermal method
The morphology and structure of hydrothermally synthesized MoS2 and Co-MoS2 was
characterized using a Carl Zeiss Merlin field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM)
with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Nitrogen physisorption was used to study the
porosity of the synthesized catalysts using a Micromeritics 3Flex 3500 N2 physisorption
instrument by physisorption of nitrogen at -196 °C. The samples were degassed at 200 °C using
vacuum degassing for 20 h before experiments. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted to
study crystallinity of the synthesized catalysts while also providing information about the
existing metal phases. XRD measurements were performed on a PANalytical X’Pert Pro MPD
rotating anode X-ray diffractometer with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54060 Å) at
a voltage and current of 45 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The 2θ was scanned over the range of

3.4 Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) experiments of isoeugenol
Performance of the prepared catalysts was tested in a batch reactor in HDO of a model
compound. Isoeugenol was used as a model compound for lignocellulosic bio-oil in the HDO
runs. Isoeugenol is an aromatic compound containing three different functional groups
including allyl, hydroxy, and methoxy groups, therefore making it a quite representative model
compound for lignin-derived bio-oils (Gao et al., 2015). The proposed reaction pathway for
HDO of isoeugenol can be seen in Figure 14, where U represents unknown compounds which
are possibly oligomers or other compounds strongly adsorbed on the catalyst surface (Tieuli et
al., 2019).

Figure 14. Proposed reaction pathway in HDO of isoeugenol. Adapted from Tieuli et al.
(2019).
HDO experiments were conducted in a 200 ml Büchi stainless steel autoclave equipped with a
stirrer. The reactor setup can be seen in Figure 15 while a piping and instrumentation diagram
(PI&D) is given in Appendix C. For the HDO experiments, the reactor was typically loaded
with 100 ml of n-dodecane and 0.2 g of isoeugenol. The catalyst loading of the active phase
(MoS2, CoS2 and NiS) was typically 0.1 g (50 wt-%) except for Ru/C, in which case 0.005 g
Ru (2.5 wt-%) was loaded into the reactor. Catalyst loading and preparation procedures prior
to HDO runs for the tested catalysts are discussed in Sections 3.4.2–3.4.5. The initial hydrogen

pressure was set to 30 bar H2 and the stirring was set to 900 rpm to minimize mass transfer
limitations. The reactor was then heated to 300 °C, which increased the total pressure to
approximately 50 bar. Experiments were conducted for 3 h once the target temperature was
reached. The liquid samples were taken at the beginning of the experiment once the target
temperature was reached and with intervals of 1 hour thereafter. Two samples were taken every
hour, yielding a total of eight samples per HDO experiment.

Figure 15. The batch reactor setup used for HDO experiments.
3.4.1 GC analysis of liquid samples
The liquid samples were analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization
detector (GC-FID). An Agilent ULTRA 1 19091A-115 capillary column (50 m x 320 µm x
0.52 µm) was used for GC analysis. The following settings were used in the GC runs: injector
temperature of 320°C, detector temperature of 320°C, helium as the carrier gas, pressure of 82
kPa, total flow of 49.5 ml/min, column flow of 1.5 ml/min, linear velocity of 24 cm/s, purge

The concentrations of the products were calculated by correcting the peak area with a massbased response factor fi which is given in equation (10).

𝑓𝑖 =

where Ai is the signal (peak area) of the compound i, Ast is the signal of the standard (solvent)
and fst is the response factor of the standard. The corrected peak area was thus calculated as
follows:
𝐴𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟,𝑖 = 𝑓𝑖 × 𝐴𝑖

The mass-% of the compound i at time t in a sample was expressed as:

𝑥𝑖,𝑡 =

Conversion of the reactant at time t was calculated using the following equations:

where C0 is the initial concentration (mol/l) of isoeugenol and Ct is the concentration of
isoeugenol at time t. The relative amount of total carbon in each compound was calculated as:

𝑆𝐶,𝑖 =

𝑥𝑖,𝑡 × 𝑤𝐶,𝑖

𝑋𝑡 × 𝑤𝐶,𝑡

(14)

where xi,t is the mass-% of compound i at time t, Xt is the conversion of the reactant at time t
while wC,i and wC,t are the carbon content in the compound i and reactant, respectively. The
amounts were then scaled to percentages of the total amount. Products not recognized to
originate from isoeugenol were omitted. The selectivity of compound i was then calculated as
follows:

𝑆𝑎 (%) =

∑ 𝐶𝑎+𝑏+𝑐+𝑑…+𝑤,𝑡

(15)

where Ca,t is the concentration of compound a at time t and ∑Ca+b+c+d…+w,t is the concentration

3.4.2 HDO with Ru/C catalyst
A commercial Ru/C catalyst with 5% Ru was tested. The catalyst was crushed and sieved to a
particle size under 400 µm and was used without further treatment. 0.1 g of the catalyst was
loaded into reactor for the HDO run, yielding 0.005 g Ru and a catalyst loading of 2.5 wt-%
relative to isoeugenol.
3.4.3 HDO with NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst
A commercial NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst supplied by Ranido was used as a reference catalyst. The
metal loading on the catalyst was 23 wt-% MoO3 and 4 wt-% NiO. 0.33 g of the catalyst was
loaded into the reactor, with the assumption that all MoO3 and NiO reacted to MoS2 and NiS
during pre-sulfidation with DMDS, with this amount yielding 0.1 g of MoS2 and NiS in total.
Prior to the HDO run, the catalyst extrudates were crushed and sieved to obtain particles with
a size below 100 µm. The crushed catalyst was added to 50 ml of n-dodecane and sulfided
using 0.2 ml DMDS (excess S). Sulfidation was conducted under 30 bar H2 for 1 hour once the
target temperature of 350 °C was reached. The rest of n-dodecane (50 ml) containing
isoeugenol (0.2 g) was added to the reactor after sulfidation.
3.4.4 HDO with Mo/AC and CoMo/AC catalysts
Activated carbon supported Mo and CoMo catalysts were used in amounts corresponding to
0.1 g of sulfides in total. The catalysts were sulfided at 350 °C under 30 bar H2 for 1 hour with
excess DMDS in 50 ml n-dodecane prior to use. Isoeugenol (0.2 g) was then dissolved in the
rest of n-dodecane (50 ml) and added to the reactor after sulfidation.
3.4.5 HDO with MoS2 and Co-MoS2 synthesized from emulsion precursors
MoS2 and Co-MoS2 precursor emulsions were used in HDO runs by diluting the amount of
emulsion needed to form 0.1 g of MoS2 and CoS2. The organic content of emulsions was
accounted for when preparing the reagent solution containing isoeugenol. MoS2 (Span 80), CoMoS2 (Span 80) and MoS2 (HDK H18) were sulfided in-situ simultaneously during isoeugenol
HDO. The Co-MoS2 (Span 80) emulsion prepared without DMSO was pre-sulfided under 30
bar H2 using excess DMDS (0.2 ml) for 1.5 hours prior to isoeugenol HDO run.
3.4.6 HDO with hydrothermally synthesized MoS2 and Co-MoS2
Hydrothermally synthesized MoS2 and Co-MoS2 were used without further pretreatment. 0.1
g of catalyst was loaded into the reactor.

4 Results and discussion
4.1 Catalyst characterization results
4.1.1 Characterization results of Mo/AC and CoMo/AC catalysts
SEM-EDS results from analysis of the supported activated carbon catalysts indicate a particle
size of approximately 50 µm, which can be seen in Figure 17.

Figure 17. SEM-EDS images of Mo/AC (left) and CoMo/AC (right) catalysts.
The dispersion of Mo on activated carbons support in the Mo/AC catalyst can be seen in Figure
18. Evidently, Mo is quite evenly dispersed on the support material, although a slightly higher
Mo concentration can be observed on the edges of the support material. Quantifiying the
elemental composition of carbon catalysts with EDS is difficult, due to the light nature of the
carbon element. In addition, the use of carbon tape for preparation of the sample may also skew
the results. Nevertheless, the Co/Mo atomic ratio given by EDS has been included in Table 9
and is relatively close to the targeted ratio of 0.5. The sample size in this case is only 3 EDS
points and should, therefore, be viewed with caution.

Physisorption results of activated carbon catalysts are summarized in Table 9. Similar results
are seen for both Mo/AC and CoMo/AC catalysts, with a similar decrease of the BET surface
area for both catalysts compared to the activated carbon support material. Naturally, the
average pore diameter and pore volume are also similar for both catalysts. The activated carbon
catalysts were also characterized using XRF, however, due to carbon being too light an element
for XRF, the metal loading on carbon could not be quantified with XRF. The Co/Mo atomic
ratio from XRF measurements has been included in Table 9. The metals present were also
analyzed with ICP; however, as carbon is also too light an element for ICP, only the Co/Mo
atomic ratio has been included in Table 9. The Co/Mo atomic ratio given by XRF is quite close
to the planned ratio of 0.5, while a slightly larger deviation from this value is seen for the ratio
given by ICP.

4.1.2 Characterization results of (Co)-MoS2 by emulsion method
Fluorescence microscopy with magnification up to 40x was used for analyzing the droplet size
of the emulsions. The droplet size of the emulsions prepared with Span 80 was determined to
be ca. 1-5 µm, based on the images in Figures 19-20, which was also later confirmed by laser
diffraction (LD) analysis. The droplet size distribution is quite uniform with relatively small
droplets present. No noticeable difference in the microscopy images can be seen between the
non-promoted and Co-promoted emulsions prepared with Span 80.

the MoS2 catalyst emulsion, square-shaped particles were observed in the Co-MoS2 catalyst
emulsion, which are possibly undissolved cobalt particles. The large droplets in the Copromoted MoS2 as well as the square pieces, which have started to flocculate, are likely the
reasons for the emulsion becoming unstable and subsequently failing. In general, emulsions
with Span 80 surfactant were more stable than emulsions stabilized by HDK H18 silica
nanoparticles. The stability of surfactant stabilized emulsions could be further improved by
finding the optimal HLB ratio, by e.g., mixing Tween 80 and Span 80 in different proportions
(Kassem et al., 2019). The pH of the aqueous phase also affects the stability of the emulsion
and should therefore be investigated (Daaou and Bendedouch, 2012).

90 % of the particles are smaller than reported diameter.

The particle size distribution (PSD) of the emulsions is displayed in Figure 22. As discussed
previously, the relatively narrow droplet size distribution of the emulsions prepared with Span
80 and the broad size distribution of the HDK H18 emulsion are both confirmed by the laser
diffraction results. Peaks in MoS2-E-Span 80 and Co-MoS2-E-Span 80 between 5-10 µm as
well as 15-20 µm in the latter are likely due to coalescence, i.e., the fusion of two or more
droplets to form a larger droplet (Viana et al., 2014). Since the Co-MoS2-E-Span 80 DMDS
emulsion was prepared later than the other emulsions, the time between preparation and PSD
measurements was shorter. For this reason, it is likely that less emulsion degradation has taken
place and the coalescence phenomenon has not affected it in the same way. A narrow size
distribution is beneficial for the formation of uniform catalyst particles with similar surface-tomass ratios. A more uniform particle size would also make the catalyst recovery easier, since
processes such as filtration, sedimentation, and cyclonic separation are very dependent on the
particle size. Agitation of the emulsion plays a significant role in the size of the droplets in the
emulsion, with a higher energy input during the emulsification process reported to yield smaller
droplets (Iqbal et al., 2011). Other parameters affecting the droplet size in w/o emulsions are
the w/o ratio and the nature of the components used in the emulsions, including the aqueous
phase, the organic phase, and the surfactant (Lindenstruth and Müller, 2004). Parameters
affecting the droplet size should be further investigated and tested to improve emulsion
compositions.

Figure 22. Particle size distribution (PSD) of the prepared emulsions determined by laser
diffraction.
The metal content of the prepared emulsion catalyst precursors is given in Table 11. The
planned amount of Mo in all Span 80 stabilized emulsions was 27 mg Mo per ml of the
emulsion. The amount of planned Co in Co-promoted emulsions was 8 mg per ml of the
emulsion. In the emulsion stabilized using HDK H18 silica nanoparticles, the amount of
planned Mo was half of this amount due to its w/o ratio being 25/75 vol-% instead of 50/50
vol-%. Assuming that the density of emulsions is ca. 1 g/ml, double the amount of planned Mo
is present in all emulsions while the amount of Co is close to the nominal amount. Deviation
from the nominal metal concentrations is possibly caused by emulsion degradation and uneven
distribution of metals in the emulsions. The measured higher concentration of Mo also means
that the Co/Mo atomic ratio in Co-promoted emulsions is lower than the nominal ratio of 0.5.
The small sample size of 100 mg used in ICP analysis along with the dilute nature of the
emulsions also means that there is risk for error in measurements. As no control samples were
analyzed during ICP analysis, the accuracy of ICP results is not confirmed and should be
viewed with caution.

4.1.3 Characterization results of (Co)-MoS2 by hydrothermal method
XRD measurements of MoS2 and Co-MoS2 were conducted, with commercially available
MoS2 from Fluka used as a reference. XRD spectrums of commercial MoS2 as well as
hydrothermally synthesized MoS2 and Co-MoS2 can be seen in Figures 23-25. Commercially
available MoS2 showed intense, sharp peaks at 14°, 32°, 33°, 36°, 39°, 49°, 58°, and 60° with
less intense, smaller peaks also present. Hydrothermally synthesized MoS2 displayed peaks at
33°, 39°, and 58°, which correspond to the (100), (103), and (110) basal planes of MoS2 (Guo
et al., 2019). In addition to these peaks, Co-MoS2 also exhibited peaks at 28°, 36°, 46°, and
55°, corresponding to (111), (210), (220), and (311) CoS2 planes (Huirache-Acuña et al., 2006;
Liu et al., 2016). The sharp peaks in the commercial MoS2 sample can be explained by the high
crystallinity of the material, while the hydrothermally synthesized MoS2 and Co-MoS2 are of
amorphous nature, leading to broader and weaker peaks. Sharper peaks in Co-MoS2 than in
MoS2 could be explained by a higher synthesizing temperature, due to the uneven and
unpredictable heating of the heating element as well as the formation of different CoS phases,
leading to a higher crystallinity in the formed catalyst (Wang et al., 2014a). The amorphous
form of MoS2 has been reported to exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than the crystalline
form, and thus a high crystallinity is not desired (Rezaei et al., 2012; Yoosuk et al., 2012).

Figure 25. XRD pattern of hydrothermally synthesized Co-MoS2.
SEM-EDS images of MoS2 and Co-MoS2 can be seen in Figures 26 and 27 and show the small
size of the crystallites. Both MoS2 and Co-MoS2 consist of nanostructures with flower-like
morphology. In both catalysts, nanostructures forming clusters can be observed; however, the
size of the individual nanostructures appear to be smaller in the Co-MoS2 catalyst, which also
contributes to a rougher catalyst surface. One potential explanation for the formation of smaller
crystallites in the Co-MoS2 catalyst, is the higher precursor concentration in the solution due
to addition of cobalt nitrate. A higher precursor concentration has shown to affect the size of
the individual crystallites (Waskito et al., 2019). The bulk particle size, however, seems to be
larger for the Co-MoS2 catalyst compared to the MoS2 catalyst, with the size of aggregates
approximated to be ca. 10 µm and 3-5 µm for Co-MoS2 and MoS2 catalysts, respectively (see
Appendix B).

Nitrogen physisorption results of hydrothermal catalysts can be seen in Table 12. A similar
specific surface area was reported by Wang et al. (2014a); however, with the difference that
the specific surface area (SSA) of Co-MoS2 was higher in this case than the SSA of nonpromoted MoS2. In the literature, it has been reported that the surface area usually decreases
by introducing a promoter (Cao et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2014a). The current result could be
at least partially explained by the varying temperature during synthesis but also a higher
precursor concentration. During synthesis of Co-MoS2, the temperature stayed quite close to
205 °C, while the synthesizing temperature for MoS2 was closer to 195 °C. It has been reported
that an increase in synthesis temperature correlates with an increase in the specific surface area
of the formed catalyst (Luo et al., 2019), while an increase in the solution precursor
concentration (due to addition of Co) can increase the surface area due to a decrease of the
nanosheet thickness (Waskito et al., 2019). The Co/Mo atomic ratio of the Co-MoS2 catalyst
determined by ICP-OES given in Table 12 is quite consistent with the nominal ratio of 0.5.

4.2 Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of isoeugenol
Ten different catalysts were tested in HDO of isoeugenol, including two commercial catalysts,
namely NiMo/Al2O3 and Ru/C. Selectivity in HDO of isoeugenol has been calculated by
omitting compounds which were not considered to be originating from isoeugenol. Conversion
of isoeugenol and selectivity for tested catalysts are summarized in Table 13. Not surprisingly,
almost all catalysts reached close to full conversion of isoeugenol. This is because the double
bond in isoeugenol is easily hydrogenated; thus, dihydroeugenol is formed (Tieuli et al., 2019).

Figure 28. Conversion and selectivity of commercial reference catalysts and the catalysts
prepared from emulsion catalyst precursors in HDO of isoeugenol at 300 °C, 30 bar H2 and 3
h.
As can be seen in Figure 28, the emulsion catalyst precursors sulfided with DMSO in-situ
simultaneously during HDO run exhibit clearly worse performance than the other catalysts,
with a lower conversion of isoeugenol and a higher selectivity to dihydroeugenol. On the other
hand, the Co-MoS2-E-Span 80 emulsion catalyst precursor sulfided with DMDS prior to HDO,
performed clearly better. The difference in the catalyst performance is likely explained by the
difference in the sulfiding procedure of the emulsion catalyst precursors. Due to Co-MoS2-ESpan 80 DMDS being sulfided ex-situ prior to the HDO run, the metal sulfide catalyst particles
have already formed when the HDO experiment is started while this is not necessarily the case

when the emulsion catalyst precursor is thermally synthesized simultaneously during the HDO
run, as catalyst particles might not have fully formed due to inadequate time. The switch of
sulfiding agent is also likely to have affected the formation of MoS2. It may be added that
DMSO was added to emulsions according to the stoichiometry, while DMDS was added in
three-fold excess. The Co-MoS2-E-Span 80 DMDS catalyst precursor was also sulfided at a
higher temperature of 350 °C as opposed to 300 °C which was deployed during isoeugenol
HDO. Ex-situ presulfiding allows a more flexible temperature control compared to sulfidation
done simultaneously during HDO (Nguyen et al., 2016). A higher degree of sulfurization
achieved with ex-situ presulfidation is also associated with higher utilization of the metal
component, leading to higher catalytic activity (Gao et al., 2010). A further investigation of the
optimal sulfidation procedure and conditions is worthwhile considering. Concentration of
isoeugenol and products vs reaction time over the catalyst synthesized from the MoS2-E-Span
80 emulsion precursor are given in Figure 29 while Figure 30 displays the corresponding data
for the Co-MoS2-E-Span 80 emulsion precursor sulfided ex-situ with DMDS. The first sample
was taken once the reactor had reached reaction conditions and for this reason a majority of
isoeugenol has already reacted to dihydroeugenol during heating. As can be seen when
comparing the charts, in the beginning of the experiment dihydroeugenol is being formed in
the case of the in-situ formed catalyst while in the case of the presulfided precursor with
DMDS, dihydroeugenol is constantly being converted to 4-propylphenol. A low initial activity
with the in-situ sulfided catalyst precursor is likely due to formation of particles happening
simultaneously and was the case both for the non-promoted and Co-promoted emulsion
precursor. The non-promoted emulsion catalyst precursor is displayed here due to
inconsistency in the first sample of the in-situ synthesized Co-promoted catalyst. The catalyst
formed from ex-situ synthesis of emulsion precursor with DMDS has already converted a
majority of isoeugenol to dihydroeugenol and 4-propylphenol during heating to reaction
conditions.

The selectivity of hydrothermally synthesized MoS2 and Co-MoS2 catalysts in isoeugenol HDO
can be seen in Figure 31, with all solid catalysts giving close to full conversion. The Copromoted MoS2 yielded a lower amount of 4-propylphenol and thus naturally higher selectivity
to propylbenzene than the non-promoted MoS2, demonstrating higher deoxygenation and
improved catalytic performance with the addition of Co as a promoter. A similar trend is seen
for the AC supported catalysts. For the CoMo/AC catalyst almost no oxygenated compounds
were present at the end of the experiment after 3 hours. Regarding the commercial Ru/C and
NiMo/Al2O3 catalysts, a high selectivity to the fully saturated propylcyclohexane was achieved
with both catalysts. A low metal loading in the Ru/C catalyst should be considered when
analyzing the results confirming the excellent hydrogenation activity of noble metal catalysts
such as Ru/C. A higher catalyst loading or a longer reaction time would most likely have led
to the conversion of all dihydroeugenol and 4-propylphenol to either propylbenzene or
propylcyclohexane. Similarly, the NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst also exhibited high selectivity to
propylcyclohexane while a higher selectivity to propylbenzene was also achieved with this
catalyst compared to Ru/C. A commercial CoMo/Al2O3 would have been a more suitable
benchmark, as there would likely have been a selectivity bias towards propylbenzene instead
of the fully saturated propylcyclohexane as was the case with the NiMo catalyst.

4.3 Improvement suggestions and future research recommendations
The procedures for synthesizing unsupported catalysts can be improved by applying a few
changes. The emulsions acting as liquid catalyst precursors could be improved by refining the
compositions. Properties such as stability and droplet size could be improved by varying
parameters such as the surfactant used, agitation applied, w/o ratio, and the pH of the aqueous
phase. To compare in-situ versus ex-situ sulfidation of the emulsion catalyst precursors, the
same sulfiding agent should be used in both cases, to ensure a fair comparison. Regarding the
hydrothermally synthesized MoS2, the effect of different parameters, such as the promoter used
and its amount, the hydrothermal synthesizing temperature, as well as the concentration and
the pH of the precursor solution, on the formed catalyst and its subsequent HDO performance
should be studied. Improving the heating setup to ensure that the synthesizing temperature stays
constant for the duration of the synthesis is critical. The influence of catalyst properties such
as morphology, particle size, stack layers, and surface area on catalyst performance should be
investigated further. Different characterization methods for unsupported MoS2 should also be
explored, with e.g., HRTEM typically used to study morphology and stack layers in MoS2.
The experimental conditions used in HDO of isoeugenol could be improved by
implementing some changes. By increasing the concentration of reactant in relation to the
solvent, analytics could be made easier, as a small amount of reactant leads to small amounts
of products, making them difficult to identify in GC. A higher reactant concentration would
also allow for more flexibility in terms of catalyst loading, since it would be possible to lower
it to a more realistic value while the amount of catalyst would still be easily measurable. In
terms of the solvent, analytics of the liquid samples would be easier if the solvent peaks in gas
chromatograms were easily distinguished from the peaks of some products. Unfortunately, this
is not the case with n-dodecane, and it was also observed that the solvent undergoes some
reactions during HDO experiments. For this reason, a catalyzed run with the solvent only would
be useful to perform and analyze. A similar investigation was conducted within the CaSH
project with only the solvent and without catalyst (Gauli, 2021). Regarding liquid samples,
taking a liquid sample prior to heating the autoclave is also recommended, as reactions already
take place during heating of the reaction mixture. Quantifying gas formation with a gas sampler
during or after HDO runs would allow for analysis of gases formed and the amount of catalytic
cracking with different catalysts. Finally, HDO runs with real bio-oil feeds are recommended
to better investigate and understand the performance and feasibility of unsupported catalysts in
bio-oil HDO processes. Studying deactivation of the catalysts due to coking in HDO of real

bio-oil feeds could provide valuable information about the suitability of unsupported catalysts
in HDO processes.

5 Conclusions
Climate change and increased environmental awareness has increased the need for chemicals
and fuels from renewable sources. Lignocellulosic bio-oil is a promising source of
hydrocarbons but comes with its fair share of challenges. The main challenges are related to
the upgrading of these bio-oils, with their high oxygen content and chemical instability
contributing to rapid catalyst deactivation in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process. A
solution to this problem could be to use a slurry reactor, allowing for a fast removal and
replacement of deactivated catalyst. In addition, by using a non-acidic unsupported MoS2
catalyst, coke formation could be mitigated. To study the feasibility of utilizing this kind of
catalyst for bio-oil HDO, unsupported MoS2 and Co-promoted MoS2 were synthesized by
different methods and compared to commercial NiMo/Al2O3 and Ru/C hydrotreating catalysts
in HDO of isoeugenol at 300 °C and 30 bar H2 for 3 h.
Commercial NiMo/Al2O3 and Ru/C expectedly yielded close to full conversion of
isoeugenol (99.9 % and 98.8 %) and high selectivity to propylcyclohexane (85.9 % and 88.1
%). In contrast, hydrothermally synthesized MoS2 and Co-MoS2 exhibited lower selectivity to
propylcyclohexane (24.2 % and 25.8 %). Co-promoted MoS2 afforded higher conversion of 4propylphenol and subsequently significantly higher selectivity to propylbenzene than the nonpromoted MoS2 (59.3 % vs. 30 %). The same trend was seen for the supported activated carbon
catalysts, with Mo/AC yielding 4-propylphenol as the dominating product while CoMo/AC
gave almost exclusively fully deoxygenated compounds, primarily propylbenzene. The
incorporation of cobalt as a promoter clearly enhanced the deoxygenation performance of
mentioned catalysts. As expected, the cobalt promoted catalysts yielded a high degree of
unsaturated products, which can be explained by the preferred direct deoxygenation (DDO)
reaction pathway.
HDO of isoeugenol using MoS2 and Co-MoS2 catalysts synthesized from liquid
emulsion precursors produced varying results. The catalysts synthesized prior to isoeugenol
HDO using DMDS performed better than the catalysts synthesized in-situ with DMSO
simultaneously during isoeugenol HDO. As the particles are already in the active sulfide form
when the emulsion is sulfided prior to the HDO experiment, naturally higher initial catalyst
activity can be expected. Similarly to the Co-promoted hydrothermal and activated carbon
catalysts, the Co-MoS2 formed from ex-situ synthesis of the catalyst precursor with DMDS
resulted in propylbenzene as the main product (62 %). With the catalysts synthesized in-situ
simultaneously during the HDO experiment, dihydroeugenol and 4-propylphenol were

Emil Högnabba

Conclusions

78

obtained as the main products, indicating a relatively low catalytic activity in comparison to
other tested catalysts. This is likely explained by the in-situ formation of particles, leading to
lower catalytic activity initially while another possible reason is the use of DMSO as a sulfiding
agent instead of DMDS.
The activity of unsupported MoS2 catalysts in HDO of bio-oil model compound
isoeugenol has been demonstrated with varying but promising results on which to build upon.
Improvements to synthesizing procedures and parameters of both hydrothermally synthesized
catalysts and catalysts synthesized from emulsion catalyst precursors have been suggested and
should be investigated further. The effect of the catalyst properties such as morphology and the
particle size of unsupported MoS2 on HDO performance and selectivity should be studied and
optimized while methods for characterizing such properties in unsupported MoS2 catalysts
should be explored and implemented. HDO runs with real bio-oil feeds and lower catalyst
loadings should be conducted to evaluate catalyst performance. Coke formation should be
quantified to compare the difference in catalyst deactivation of unsupported and supported
catalysts.

Slurrykatalysatorer för vätebehandling av bioolja
Den globala övergången från fossila till förnybara källor av bränslen, kemikalier och energi,
betyder att framtagandet av nya och innovativa teknologier är centralt. Lignocellulosabaserad
biomassa har identifierats som en potentiell ersättare för fossil råolja i bränsle- och
kemikalieproduktion. Denna biomassa kan förvätskas genom olika metoder för att erhålla
lignocellulosabaserad bioolja. Den erhållna råbiooljan skiljer sig dock markant från fossil
råolja i och med att råbiooljan har oönskade egenskaper som hög surhet och hög syrehalt (10–
50 massaprocent), vilket leder till kemisk ostabilitet, lågt värmevärde och polaritet. Som sådan
kan råbiooljan användas som eldningsolja, men för att kunna användas som transportbränsle
bör syrehalten minskas avsevärt. Detta kan åstadkommas genom en process som kallas
hydrodeoxygenering (HDO), där råbiooljan utsätts för vätebehandling vid hög temperatur.
HDO har visat sig vara problematiskt på grund av råbiooljans kemiska ostabilitet och
föroreningar,

vilket

leder

till

en

snabb

deaktivering

av

traditionella

vätebehandlingskatalysatorer. En potentiell lösning är att använda en så kallad slurryreaktor,
som möjliggör avlägsnande och ersättning av deaktiverad katalysator. Slurryreaktorer har
främst använts för vätebehandling av bottenoljor i fossil råolja, ofta med höga halter
föroreningar såsom svavel och kväve men även metaller. Vanligtvis används metallsulfider
såsom exempelvis MoS2, som katalysatorer i slurryreaktorer. Dessa metallsulfider är

från

vätebehandlingskatalysatorer, som NiMo och CoMo på bärarmaterialet Al2O3. Användningen
av sura bärarmaterial som Al2O3 i katalytisk HDO har visat sig bidra till större mängd koks,
som sedan fäster sig på katalysatorytan och därmed leder till minskad katalysatoraktivitet.
Genom att använda sig av katalysatorer utan bärarmaterial kunde detta problem eventuellt
undvikas.
I diplomarbetets litteraturdel har främst katalysatorer utan bärarmaterial såväl som
egenskaper och prestanda hos dessa i HDO av råbiooilja och dess modellföreningar studerats.
Även andra påverkande faktorer såsom processförhållanden, lösningsmedel och ytaktiva
ämnen har studerats. Katalysatorer utan bärarmaterial kan klassificeras enligt typ och
framställningsmetod.

De

tre

huvudkategorierna

är

katalysatorbildande

lösningar,

katalysatorbildande emulsioner och finfördelade partiklar. Vidare kan de katalysatorbildande
lösningarna delas in i olje- och vattenlösliga lösningar medan de finfördelade partiklarna kan
delas in i syntetiserade partiklar och naturliga malmer.

Aktiva faser som kan användas i HDO har studerats. Exempel på aktiva faser som
använts i forskningen är övergångsmetaller som ädelmetaller (Ru, Pt och Pd) och ickeädelmetaller (Ni, Co, Fe) och deras olika former inklusive fosfider, oxider, sulfider och även
dessa i reducerad form. Metallsulfider utan bärarmaterial identifierades i litteraturdelen som
lovande katalysatorer vid HDO av lignocellulosabaserad råbioolja, tack vare deras höga
aktivitet i hydrogeneringsreaktioner, förmånlighet, relativt höga stabilitet och låga surhet. Den
låga surheten har visat sig främja låg koksbildning. Metallsulfidernas låga surhet leder till
obetydlig katalytisk krackning jämfört med katalysatorer på sura bärarmaterial såsom Al2O3.
Olika promotormetaller på metallsulfider (med och utan bärarmaterial) studerades, varav
kobolt, nickel och järn är bland de vanligaste. Katalysatorer med kobolt som promotor sägs
föredra så kallad direkt deoxygenering (DDO) varvid syre tas bort direkt utan saturering av
aromatringen, medan syreborttagning med nickel som promotor sker genom saturering av
aromatringen. Detta påverkar förstås i sin tur vilka typer av produkter som erhålls.
Processförhållanden såsom temperatur, tryck och katalysatormängd och deras inverkan
på HDO-prestanda undersöktes. I fråga om temperatur kan nämnas att en högre temperatur
leder till högre grad av syreborttagning till en viss gräns. Högre temperaturer leder även till
mer krackning, vilket i sin tur innebär högre gasbildning och ett sämre utbyte av
vätskefasprodukterna. En för hög temperatur kan även leda till att vissa reaktionsvägar
förhindras, och ett exempel på detta är saturering av den aromatiska ringen. En lägre temperatur
är positivt ur katalysatorstabilitetens synvinkel men ofta på bekostnad av HDO-prestanda. Vid
HDO är ett högre vätgastryck ofta fördelaktigt för stabilisering av radikaler och för att
säkerställa god vätgaslöslighet i vätskefasen. Mängden katalysator spelar en viktig roll i HDO
av bioolja eftersom en otillräcklig mängd katalysator kan leda till otillräcklig katalytisk
hydrogeneringsaktivitet. Andra faktorer som undersöktes i litteraturdelen var bland annat
lösningsmedlets roll vid HDO av råbioolja och inverkan av katalysatorstrukturen på katalytisk
aktivitet och produktselektivitet.
I den experimentella delen framställdes MoS2 och Co-MoS2 utan bärarmaterial med två
olika metoder. Den första metoden var en hydrotermisk metod där katalysatorpartiklarna
framställdes från en saltlösning som innehöll metallerna (Mo eller Mo och Co) och tiourea som
sulfideringsmedel. Ammoniumheptamolybdat tetrahydrat och kobolt (II) nitrat hexahydrat
användes som prekursorer för Mo och Co i alla metoder. I den andra metoden framställdes
vatten–olja-emulsioner som innehöll metallerna och i vissa fall även dimetylsulfoxid (DMSO)
som sulfideringsmedel i vattenfasen. En emulsion sulfiderades skilt med DMDS istället för
DMSO. Emulsionerna stabiliserades med antingen det ytaktiva ämnet Span 80 eller Wacker

långsam tillsats av vattenfasen i den organiska fasen. Dessa emulsioner fungerade som
prekursorer för katalysatorerna och syntetiserades termiskt antingen under själva HDOexperimenten eller skilt före experimentet för att erhålla de fasta katalysatorpartiklarna.

Mo

och CoMo på aktivt kol framställdes genom torr impregnering. Dessa katalysatorer
sulfiderades med dimetyldisulfid (DMDS) före HDO-experiment. Även kommersiellt
tillgängliga Ru/C- och NiMo/Al2O3-katalysatorer användes i HDO. Ru/C användes som sådan
medan NiMo/Al2O3-katalysatorn sulfiderades med DMDS före HDO-experimentet.
HDO av isoeugenol, som användes som modellämne för råbioolja, utfördes i en
satsreaktor vid temperaturen 300 °C och vätetrycket 30 bar i 3 timmar. Som lösningsmedel för
isoeugenol användes n-dodekan. Resultaten påvisade de kommersiella katalysatorernas
(NiMo/Al2O3 och Ru/C) höga hydrogeneringsaktivitet och därmed höga selektivitet till

propylcyklohexan.

mellan

katalysatorerna syntetiserade från emulsionerna observerades. Co-MoS2-katalysatorn
syntetiserad före experimentet med DMDS som sulfideringsmedel uppvisade klart bättre
prestanda både i fråga om isoeugenol konversion och produktselektivitet, än övriga
katalysatorer syntetiserade

från emulsionerna. De senare nämnda katalysatorerna

syntetiserades samtidigt under HDO-experimentet med DMSO som sulfideringsmedel. Av de
hydrotermiskt syntetiserade MoS2- och Co-MoS2-katalysatorerna uppvisade katalysatorn med
kobolt som promotormetall bättre syreborttagning i och med högre selektivitet till syrefria
produkter som propylbensen och propylcyklohexan. Mo och CoMo på aktivt kol uppvisade
liknande resultat och trender som de hydrotermiska MoS2 och Co-MoS2. Med Mo/ACkatalysatorn var den största produkten 4-propylfenol följt av propylbensen och
propylcyklohexan. CoMo/AC-katalysatorn ledde till hög selektivitet av propylbensen och även
en del propylcyklohexan. Mängden 4-propylfenol var minimal i fallet med CoMo/ACkatalysatorn, vilket påvisar katalysatorns goda HDO-aktivitet.
Aktiviteten hos MoS2-katalysatorer utan bärarmaterial i isoeugenol HDO har påvisats
med varierande men lovande resultat. Mer forskning gällande denna katalysatortyp bör utföras.
Förbättringsförslag för både katalysatorsyntes och själva HDO-experimenten har föreslagits i
diplomarbetet. Emulsionsegenskaper som droppstorleken och emulsionsstabiliteten kunde
förbättras genom att testa olika ytaktiva ämnen, vatten-till-olja-förhållanden, pH av vattenfasen
och omrörningstid samt hastighet. I framtida forskning gällande den hydrotermiska metoden
bör effekten av parametrar som syntetiseringstemperatur, saltlösningens koncentration och pH

samt promotormetall undersökas. För att få en bättre helhetsbild av katalysatorprestandan hos
denna typ av katalysator, bör experiment med högre koncentration av isoeugenol och mindre
mängd katalysator i förhållande till reaktanten utföras, medan även experiment med råbioolja
rekommenderas.

8.1 Appendix A
Catalyst screening with Span 80
The first emulsions were prepared using Span 80 (sorbitane monooleate) as the surfactant. Span
80 is a non-ionic surfactant with a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value of 4.3 (Kassem
et al., 2019). The surfactant was mixed with the organic phase, which was kerosene during the
tests. The aqueous phase consisting of Mo-precursor ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) and
sulfur donor dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was mixed with the oil-phase. DMSO was added
according to the stoichiometry to form MoS2. Aqueous and organic phases were initially mixed
using a Vortexer test tube shaker, but it was quite apparent that agitation with this method was
not sufficient and therefore an IKA T18 Ultra-Turrax Homogenizer was used for high shear
mixing of the two phases. With the homogenizer, agitation was performed by mixing at 6500
rpm and 9500 rpm for 5 minutes at each mixing speed. Parameters such as w/o ratio and vol% surfactant in the organic phase were varied during screening. Tested compositions can be
seen in Table A.1. The most stable emulsion was number 12, which comprised 5 vol-%
surfactant in the organic phase and a w/o ratio of 50:50 vol-%. The emulsion stability was
tested with vials and the phase separation over time was observed. The formula used to
calculate emulsion stability was:

𝐸𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 (%) =

𝑉
𝑉𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙

× 100%

(𝐴. 1)

where Vinitial is the initial volume of emulsion added to a vial and V is the volume of the heavy
phase after a certain time. A graph showing the emulsion stability over time can be seen in
Figure A.1.

Emulsion screening with HDK silica nanoparticles
Emulsions were also prepared using Wacker HDK H18 and HDK H20 pyrogenic silica
nanoparticles. The organic phase was prepared by adding silica nanoparticles to stirred
kerosene in different amounts. The aqueous phase consisted of distilled water, Mo-precursor
AHM and sulfur donor DMSO. The aqueous phase was added dropwise to the organic phase
during agitation with a homogenizer. Emulsions were once again agitated at 6500 rpm and
9500 rpm for 5 minutes at each mixing speed. Tested compositions are summarized in Table
A.2. Emulsions 1 and 2 were the most stable, both containing 5 w/v-% HDK H18 silica
nanoparticles. The w/o ratio in number 1 was 50:50 vol-% while number 2 had a w/o ratio of
25:75 vol-%. Emulsions 3, 4, and 6 turned into viscous slurries and were for this reason not
included in Figure A.3.

As can be seen in Figure A.3, compositions 9 and 10 were the least stable compositions, which
can be explained by the low concentration of silica nanoparticles in the organic phase. A sideby-side comparison after 24 hours of the least and most stable silica nanoparticle emulsions
can be seen in Figure A.4.

Operating procedure for ICP analysis of samples
ICP analysis was carried out using the following procedure:
1. Sample was added to digestion tube.
2. 9 ml of concentrated HNO3 and 1 ml of H2O2 was added to digestion tube.
3. The tube was closed and placed in a Milestone Ethos Up microwave digestion system.
4. The digestion program used comprised of:
i.

Temperature increase to 210 °C in 20 minutes.

ii.

Temperature hold at 210 °C for 15 minutes.

5. After the samples had cooled down, they were diluted to 50 ml with distilled water.
6. Prior to analysis with ICP-OES, the samples were further diluted to 1/10 or 1/100 with 1%
HNO3. Concentrations were measured with both the sample diluted to 50 ml as well as the
sample diluted to either 1/10 or 1/100.
7. Calibration was conducted using Merck IV and Labdig-19 ICP standard solutions.
