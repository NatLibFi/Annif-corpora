Title of thesis: “It’s only man that was made after His image, not shrubberies and things”:
Civilization, religion and ecophobia in The Man Whom the Trees Loved by Algernon Blackwood
Supervisor: Anthony Johnson
Abstract:
Algernon Blackwood was an author of the supernatural, especially adept at the awe-inspiring
representation of nature. This thesis will explore through a close reading how the concepts of
civilization and religion are represented in the novella The Man Whom the Trees Loved by
Algernon Blackwood, and how they relate to the fear and ecophobia of the characters. The
theoretical framework of the thesis is based on various concepts within the field of ecocriticism,
namely the hypothetical concept of ecophobia by Simon C. Estok and the seven theses on why
we fear the woods by Elizabeth Parker.
Mrs. Bittacy is the protagonist of the story and also the most conservatively Christian of the three
main characters of the story. Her worldview is based on religion and the order of civilization,
which also affects her perception of nature, which is full of ecophobia due to her difficult relation
with plants and the forest. Her husband, on the other hand, is very interested in the forest and
grows a close bond with the aid of the visiting artist Sanderson, who helps him close the gap
between man and the vegetal.
The analysis indicates that the ecophobia that Mrs. Bittacy feels is due to her anthropocentric
worldview which is caused by her religion. We see that it also relates to how she views
Sanderson and how she reacts to his wild statements about the order of things which clashes with
what she has learned from the Bible. Her worldview is challenged when Mr. Bittacy begins
amalgamating with the New Forest, slowly turning him away from civilization. This causes her
to re-evaluate her faith as that which she has learned turns out unsatisfactory.

1. Introduction

The three worlds that met and mingled here seemed to his imaginative
temperament very obvious, though it is doubtful if another mind less intuitively
equipped would have seen them so well-defined. There was the world of tourist
English, civilised [sic], quasi-educated, to which he belonged by birth, at any rate;
there was the world of peasants to which he felt himself drawn by sympathy – for
he loved and admired their toiling, simple life; and there was this other – which
he could only call the world of Nature. To this last, however, in virtue of a
vehement poetic imagination, and a tumultuous pagan instinct fed by his very
blood, he felt that most of him belonged. The others borrowed from it, as it were,
for visits. Here, with the soul of Nature, hid his central life.
(Blackwood 2002: The Glamour of Snow 192)

Hibbert, the protagonist of The Glamour of Snow by Algernon Blackwood (1869-1951),
sums himself up in a passage which could equally well have been a self-description of
the author. Blackwood was an animated spirit who, like Hibbert, felt himself belonging
to Nature, always with a capital N, more than his contemporary England, which was at
the height of its industrial revolution. Blackwood was a child in spirit throughout the
whole of his life, having a heightened imagination and remaining curious about the
unexplainable, which he engaged with through mysticism. His awe of Nature is translated
into his works, which span from the psychological to nature writing, the latter of which
he is arguably most known for in modern times.
During his lifetime, Algernon Blackwood became famous for his ghost stories,
appearing in the radio and the early days of broadcast television reading a selection of his
own stories. Though living with a meager economy for most of his life after leaving home,
failing miserably in many of his early endeavors, Blackwood lived a rich life full of
experiences which have translated into his works through the rewriting of events
surrounding him. Widely travelled, Blackwood enjoyed nature thoroughly, possibly even
more than he enjoyed telling stories. Often these stories revolved around his own
experiences, which sometimes ended up being published, usually with a touch of the
supernatural, which was another of Blackwood’s interests. Through his vivid
imagination, Blackwood was able to perceive, in a similar way to his likeminded
protagonist Hibbert, phenomena beyond the regular world, into the usually hidden world
of Nature, which was so close to his heart. It was a place he escaped to from the strict
religious life at his home, and also the place where himself found spirituality.

1

One tale by Blackwood with its fair share of supernatural awe is the weird fiction
masterpiece The Man Whom the Trees Loved (1912), which is the focus of this thesis.
The thesis will analyze how religion and civilization are represented in the story, and how
they relate to the fear and ecophobia of the characters therein. The Man Whom the Trees
Loved is a story about the influence and jealousy of the forest winning over a loving
husband, and the struggles of his wife to win him over and ultimately dealing with the
painful realization that she has failed amidst an ongoing crisis of faith. The story is full
of Blackwood’s fascinating takes on many concepts that were still under discussion in his
contemporary times, such as the faculties of plants, as well as some of his wilder ideas
surrounding the evolution of trees.
Blackwood remained without much critical attention until the turn of the century,
when Mike Ashley (2001) wrote a thorough biography of his life. A year later, Penguin
Books published a collection of Blackwood’s most notable works, edited by S.T. Joshi
(2002). As Ashley (2001) notes, however, many of Blackwood’s own documents were
unfortunately and tragically destroyed along with the rest of his London apartment by
several bombs during an air raid by the Germans in 1940. Blackwood was fortunate
enough to survive, saved by the sausages that were about to get burned in their air-raid
shelter, forcing him and his nephew to return inside. Fortunately, through the hard work
of Ashley (2001) who waded through the diaries and notes of many of Blackwood’s still
living relatives, we know much about Blackwood’s life and its many turns. He himself
also contributed by writing an autobiography named Episodes before Thirty (1923), in
which he describes his life up until his thirtieth birthday. The book includes his childhood
and his journeys in America and Europe. Most notably, he discloses details concerning
his relationship with nature, and the special place it has in both his worldview and as an
activity on the side.
As the field of ecocriticism began garnering more attention within literary
research, so too Blackwood began as an obvious writer of environmentally focused
fiction. The spark was truly ignited after Simon C. Estok’s (2009) groundbreaking article
Theorizing in a Space of Ambivalent Openness: Ecocriticism and Ecophobia, which
introduced the hypothesis for ecophobia, a concept about people’s resentful attitude
toward our environment. Ecophobia, though only a hypothesis rather than a proper
psychological phenomenon, has garnered much attention, especially for nature fiction
with elements of fear and horror, a categorization which most of Blackwood’s notable

2

pieces of fiction belong to, such as The Willows (1907), The Wendigo (1910) and the
aforementioned The Man Whom the Trees Loved (1912).
A heavyweight in the field of ecophobia relating to the forest-setting is The Forest
and the EcoGothic: The Deep Dark Woods in the Popular Imagination by Elizabeth
Parker (2020). The theoretical framework for this thesis is partly derived from the seven
reasons why we fear the forests, a series of hypotheses on which Parker has built her
book. It is arguably a central work in the field of ecophobia and the ecoGothic and it is
with much interest that we may see where further research based upon this title will lead.
Parker discusses some of Blackwood’s works in her book, one of which is The Man Whom
the Trees Loved. Though her analysis is very sound, the sheer scale of the field she
analyses in the book, from novels to films, means that she does not have the space for a
deep dive into any one title, thus acting more as a thorough springboard for further
research into the various titles therein.
Another monograph on the history of forests and their relations to civilization and
religion is the modern classic Forests: The Shadow of Civilization by Robert Pogue
Harrison (1992). It extensively examines how civilization and religion have ostracized,
yet simultaneously also romanticized, the forests that span the earth. The book is central
for the themes of the thesis, and as was said earlier, is an important framework for any
research relating to forests in history or literature.
The thesis consists of eight chapters, beginning with the introduction. In chapter
2 are presented the relevant theories and concepts for the thesis. The first subchapter will
focus on the more general theories falling under the ecocriticism framework, while the
second examines theories surrounding forests and their relation to civilization and
Christianity. Chapter 3 focuses on Algernon Blackwood himself and his fascinating
history with nature, civilization and spiritual matters. Because his writing is considered
to be largely autobiographical, or at the very least inspired by events in his own life, it is
also of interest to inspect Blackwood himself. In chapter 4, Mrs. Bittacy’s relations with
the themes are considered, especially her faith and how it affects her actions. In contrast,
chapter 5 discusses Mr. Sanderson as well as his different conceptions of nature and the
surrounding world along with the question of agency. Chapter 6 focuses on the cedar of
Lebanon and its unique position between civilization and the forest. The last chapter,
chapter 7, analyses the relation of forests and civilization, with an additional focus on Mr.
Bittacy’s movement away from civilization and into nature. In chapter 8 we will finally
conclude and discuss the analysis of the thesis and possibilities for further research on the

3

topic. A summary of The Man Whom the Trees Loved has been included as an appendix
to the thesis.

2. Methods and Materials

A close reading of The Man Whom the Trees Loved forms the basis for the analysis in this
thesis: as analysis which will draw upon relevant theory from the broader field of
ecocriticism and the newer areas of the ecoGothic and ecophobia within it. The main
focus of the research question is to analyze how the characters of the story perceive the
forest, civilization and religion, and how these perceptions affect the ecophobia of the
characters, especially Mrs. Bittacy.

2.1 EcoGothic and Ecophobia

The thesis will work within the broader field of ecocriticism. Environmental criticism, or
ecocriticism, “is the study of the relationship between literature and the physical
environment” (Glotfelty 1996: xviii). Rather than being a single, unified field,
ecocriticism is an umbrella term for a very broad scope of studies, that are joined together
by their approach to the environment. Cheryll Glotfelty defines that “all ecological
criticism shares the fundamental premise that human culture is connected to the physical
world, affecting it and affected by it” (Glotfelty 1996: xix). Elizabeth Parker turns this
statement on its head by proclaiming that “the very discussion of Nature and such
movements as ecocriticism are […] inherently paradoxical […] because there is an
implication that we – humanity – are somehow objective and distinct from the natural
world” (Parker 2020: 7-8).
The majority of Blackwood’s works belong to the Gothic fiction genre. The
Gothic fiction genre was established during the 18th century, most notably within the
works of authors Horace Walpole and Anne Radcliffe (Botting 2014). Over time, the
genre became perceived as a darker flavor of Romanticism. Novels of the genre were
“explorations of terror, mystery, and the supernatural which must be understood within
the context of a world growing increasingly confident that such phenomena can be
challenged or banished” (Wiseman 2019: 2). Wiseman further notes that “the Gothic
situates its particular affects, themes, and aesthetics within certain types of location,
places that manifest core concepts such as fragmentation, transgression, monstrosity,
contamination, and corruption” (Wiseman 2019: 2). In addition to being a Gothic story,

5

The Man Whom the Trees Loved also belongs to the Weird Fiction genre. Weird Fiction
transcends the conventional genre boundaries, China Miéville (2009) defines it as a
combination of horror and fantasy, and notes that “The focus is on awe, and its
undermining of the quotidian. This obsession with numinosity under the everyday is at
the heart of Weird Fiction” (Miéville 2009: 510). John MacNeill Miller also notes that
the genre “resists description” (MacNeill Miller 2020: 249).
EcoGothic is used to differentiate the terminology between the genre
‘Gothic’, and what Parker defines “a flavoured [sic] mode” of it (Parker 2020: 33). While
studying the ecoGothic, many of the general principles of the Gothic also apply, the major
difference being the ecocritical lense through which the Gothic is examined. The settings
of the literature being examined move from the castles and mansions of the traditional
Gothic to nature. Dawn Keetley and Matthew Wynn Sivils explain the advantages of
using a Gothic lens to examine ecocriticism: “Adopting a specifically gothic ecocritical
lens illuminates the fear, anxiety, and dread that often pervade those relationships: it
orients us, in short, to the more disturbing and unsettling aspects of our interactions with
nonhuman ecologies” (Keetley & Sivils 2017: 1). The ecoGothic also allows us to
spectate nature from different perspectives, giving us means to inspect “our thoroughly
mixed feelings about the forest, which are soaked in desire and horror in equal measure”
(Parker 2020: 275).
Central to the ecoGothic, and as an extension the Gothic, are the concepts
of space and place. Originating in the field of Human Geography, these two terms form
the division of all that is the earth and nature. Place denotes that which is known, familiar
and homely, contrasting space: the unknown, unfamiliar and unhomely. Most notably for
the Gothic, “the horror is bound to the transition from ‘Place’ to ‘Space’, and the happy
ending (if there is one) relies on a return to the former environment” (Parker 2020: 31).
Therefore, the concept of the ‘boundary’ between Place and Space, e.g. between the forest
and the settlement, is of interest in the Gothic. “Generally speaking, every human-made
boundary on the earth's surface— garden hedge, city wall, or radar "fence"—is an attempt
to keep inimical forces at bay” (Tuan 1979: 6). As boundaries are set between Space and
Place, a force or means to transgress said boundaries is needed to charge the story with
the Gothic. In many classic Gothic stories, e.g. Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus
by Mary Shelley (1818), transgressing the boundaries of what can be considered human
is at the center, but in the ecoGothic, we are often more interested in environmental
boundaries. The fear is lacking if the threat from the forest cannot overcome the fence

6

surrounding the mansion. This capability of affecting one’s surroundings is known as
‘agency’.
Hannes Bergthaller describes agency as follows: “Complex selforganization, reflexivity, consciousness, and the capacity to act spontaneously, that is, in
a manner not reducible to external determination” (Bergthaller 2014: 38). Agency is
naturally something associated with humanity. Bergthaller explains that agency in nature
works slightly different than with humans: “[agency], the new materialists argue, is
emergent and distributed – that is, it is not the property of concrete, isolable entities, but
manifests itself only as distributed through out [sic] the networks in which these entities
are embedded” (Bergthaller 2014: 38). Agency in nature is limited to location, as
Bergthaller explains; trees cannot grasp outside further than their branches reach as they
are literally rooted in place. Traditionally, this limitation has of course been broken by
borrowing the services of external agents to carry out the tasks required: animals to spread
seeds of fruits and insects moving pollen around. This is a simple example of the complex
network of agents in nature. When it comes to the Gothic, a source of fear is the
dismantling of these boundaries and limitations of agency.
While agency is a completely natural part of our surroundings, it can feel
threatening and terrifying. Simon C. Estok calls this phenomenon ‘ecophobia’:

We take agency outside of ourselves as threats. It is precisely these
nonhuman agentic forces that determine so very much of our environmental
ethics: the felt or imagined challenges to our existence (and forget the
obverse side, for a moment – the good, the sustenance, the pleasure, and so
on), the felt dangers of material agencies beyond us simply do not fit into
any friendly epistemological familial mesh we may design
(Estok 2014: 130-31)

This phenomenon can easily be exemplified by some of the irrationally frightful situations
that occur in most of our lives at some point: the ominous rustling of trees in the windy
night or the wind ‘howling’ by itself. These examples are completely harmless, but can
cause a strong sense of terror and dread in the observer. Estok explains that ecophobic
feelings are a strong part of our history:

7

a history of hostility to agentic forces outside of ourselves, variously
articulated as a will to live, as a pleasure principle, as existential angst.
Ecophobia is part of this history, of how we respond emotionally and
cognitively to what we perceive as environmental threats and as a menacing
alienness.
(Estok 2014: 131)

This history of ecophobia is most likely what has given birth to many myths and stories
of folklore due to the oftentimes unexplainable sense of dread and foreboding that
ecophobia can cause due to a loss of agency in solving the problem. Estok explains how
these feelings of fear are part of the human core: “[f]ear of a loss of agency does strange
things to people. Fear of the loss and fear of the loss of predictability are what form the
core of ecophobia, and it is a fear of a loss of agency alone that is behind our primary
responses, at least, to pain, death, and even sleep” (Estok 2014: 134). He specifies,
however, that “Often at the core of things such as ecophobia […] is the whole matter of
agency. Certainly a large part of what ecophobia is all about is an irrational fear
(sometimes, of course, leading to a contempt or hatred) of the agency (real or imagined)
of nature” (Estok 2013: 74).
As ecophobia is rooted in the physical environment of our surroundings, Elizabeth
Parker suggests that we should not forget to examine the concepts of Place and Space
when dealing with it (Parker 2020: 30). Many of the dreads of ecophobia originate from
Space, where we cannot control or perceive what is outside our view. This is clear from
Fred Botting’s description of the depiction of nature in Gothic literature: “Mountains are
craggy, inaccessible and intimidating; forests shadowy, impenetrable; moors windswept,
bleak and cold. Nature appears hostile, untamed and threatening” (Botting 2014: 4).
Ecophobia is thus an essential part of the wild Spaces in Gothic literature, in order to
induce fear in the reader, and create a feeling of dread. As Botting describes it, “Nature
appears hostile, untamed and threatening: darkness, obscurity, and barely contained
negative energy reinforce atmospheres of disorientation and fear” (Botting 2014: 4).
Another concept that relates to how we as humans define space is the duality of
modes of thought: “logos (rational and scientific thought) and mythos (superstitious and
intuitive thought)” (Parker 2020: 38). Parker argues that the “idea of myth is certainly of
relevance to the ecoGothic more generally. It is firmly linked to both Nature and to human
anxieties” (Parker 2020: 38). In modern times, myth has largely been abandoned
simultaneously with the advancement in technology and knowledge. This phenomenon is

8

described by the disenchantment thesis: “the more the world becomes thoroughly mapped
and understood in formalized scientific laws, the less personally and immediately
meaningful it seems to become” (Clark 2011: 143). It is frightening when something we
believe we know and understand behaves illogically, bordering on the realms of the
mythic, as is the case in many Gothic stories. “Nature is consistently constructed in our
stories as Other, excessive, unpredictable, disruptive, chaotic, enticing, supernaturally
powerful, and, perhaps most disturbingly, alive. It importantly threatens our very
definitions of ‘humanness’” (Parker & Poland 2019: 1). Botting also reflects on the role
of mythos in the Gothic, saying that “if knowledge is associated with rational procedures
of enquiry and understanding based on natural, empirical reality, then gothic styles disturb
the borders of knowing and conjure up obscure otherworldly phenomena” (Botting 2014:
2).
Forests have traditionally been spaces where the mythical resides, spaces which
induce fear in humans. Timothy Clark notes that “Throughout history, places such as
deserts or forests have been conceived as sites of identity crisis and metamorphosis, as
the domains of the monstrous and terrifying, places of religious insight or of rites of
passage” (Clark 2011: 25). As such, they are also tightly knit together with the Gothic.
Parker links the imagined and the real fears of the woods, explaining that

there is a symbiotic connection between our ‘natural’ fears of the woods
and our fictional creations about them. In other words: we present the forest
as Gothic in our stories because we think it is Gothic, because it frightens
us, but it also frightens us because of the fearsome ways we have portrayed
it in these stories.
(Parker 2020: 13)

Therefore, we can imagine that the real forests occupy a shared space in our minds with
the fictive, gothic interpretations that encompass our whole range of views on those
forests.
Parker has compiled a list of seven “reasons, or theses” why the forests induce
fear in us (Parker 2020: 47). The reasons are based on Cohen’s (1996) seven theses on
monsters and Murphy’s (2013) rules “for the ‘good’ and ‘bad’ families of backwoods
horror” (Parker 2020: 47). The seven theses are:

9

1. The forest is against civilisation.
2. The forest is associated with the past.
3. The forest is a landscape of trial.
4. The forest is a setting in which we are lost.
5. The forest is a consuming threat.
6. The forest is a site of the human unconscious.
7. The forest is an antichristian space.
(Parker 2020: 47)

She further notes that the forest is not one dimensional, but that there are always
multiple layers of values attached to it:

For example: if the forest is the frightening antithesis to civilisation, it is
also the idyllic retreat from society’s ills; if it is the place in which we are
lost, it is also the place in which we are found; and if it is an antichristian
site and the domain of the Devil, it is also the sacred space in which we find
God. Here, of course, we are concerned with these theses’ darker, original
sentiments. The Gothic forest, in order to be Gothic, must always carry the
discernable threat of at least one of these seven reasons.
(Parker 2020: 48)

Being against civilization is a crucial attribute of the Gothic forest, an attribute which
marks it as different than domestic landscapes associated with logos, and an opposite of
the Place as the sanctuary in Gothic fiction. As Parker mentions above, the forest is a dual
space, hosting both God and the Devil. Estok explains how the foreign, opposite of the
domestic and familiar, is key to our modern ecophobia:

Domestic landscapes are more mapped, predictable, and sustaining than
foreign landscapes. Domestic landscapes provide all that is necessary for
survival […] Meanwhile, anything foreign becomes a site and origin of
danger, an object of xenophobia and disdain, and a source of pollution.
(Estok 2018: 122)

We have thus been programmed through the ages to react with hostility to foreign and
wild spaces. Parker and Poland describe that “despite the ostensibly dwindling relevance
of the wilderness to our everyday and increasingly urban lives, fears of the nonhuman

10

world are as rampant as ever. […] In the cultural imagination, Nature has always
engendered fear, wonder, and fascination” (Parker & Poland 2019: 1). Urbanization has
led us further away from the wilds, yet we still uphold primal fears passed on from our
ancestors.
As humans have distanced themselves from nature for an extended period
in modern history, this alienation has conjured a new age of humanity being discussed
across many fields of study, including in much of modern ecocriticism. This new age is
coined the ‘Anthropocene’, which is derived from the term ‘anthropocentric’, as opposed
to ‘biocentric’. Clark describes how the term relates to the relationship between humans
and nature:

Anthropocentrism names any stance, perception or conception that takes the
human as centre or norm. An ‘anthropocentric’ view of the natural world
thus sees it entirely in relation to the human, for instance as a resource for
economic use, or as the expression of certain social or cultural value […]
Anthropocentrism is often contrasted with a possible biocentric stance, one
attempting to identify with all life or a whole ecosystem, without such
privilege to just one species.
Clark 2011: 3

Anthropocentrism is central to the ecoGothic, as the human sphere is out in the spotlight,
leaving room for what is outside of the light, the forest and the environment, to shine
through the application of mythos contrasting the logos of anthropocentrism.
Related to the biocentric stance is the concept of ‘biophilia’, which can be
understood as the opposite end of the scale from ecophobia. One of the pioneers of the
term, Edward O. Wilson, describes biophilia as “the innate tendency to focus on life and
lifelike processes” (Wilson 1984: 1). He also suggests that “the urge to affiliate with other
forms of life is to some degree innate” (Wilson 1984: 85). Furthermore, according to
Estok, both “biophilia and ecophobia are vying for control of how we live, and both are
deeply rooted” (Estok 2018: 23). Thus, all humans are inherently on the biophilia –
ecophobia spectrum, an orientation which influences our relationships with nature and
our environment. Estok, however, also emphasizes that both ecophobia and biophilia are
hypotheses:

11

What is hypothetical about the ecophobia/biophilia spectrum is first the
notion that it permeates everything that we do and second that this spectrum
is innate. If biophilia and ecophobia are on the same spectrum, and biophilia
is an adaptive strategy, then ecophobia exists on the opposite end of the
range as a maladaptive strategy.
(Estok 2018: 23)
While ecophobia is described by Estok as a maladaptive strategy, it is also a force
affecting our perceptions on civilization and its surroundings, and ultimately what we
understand as safety.

2.2 The Forest – Against Civilization

Among Parker’s seven theses of fear of the woods, the first one reads: “The forest is
against civilisation [sic]” (Parker 2020: 47). This thesis harkens back to the antique, and
further, emphasizing the cradle of civilization. Among the first things Robert Pogue
Harrison explains about the forests on earth is that as civilizations began to awaken and
clear the forests to build settlements, everything was forest (Harrison 1992). We find
human-built settlements at the heart of the definition of civilization. Its root lies in the
verb civilize: “To bring […] to a stage of social development considered to be more
advanced, esp. by bringing to conformity with the social norms of a developed society;
to enlighten, refine, [my emphasis] and educate; to make more cultured and sophisticated”
(OED). Furthermore, the definition of civilization itself is “the action or process of being
made civilized by an external force”, thus highlighting that civilization is created by
humans through a refinement of wilderness (OED). Another definition highlights the
settlement: “The comfort and convenience of modern life, as found in towns and cities;
populated or urban areas in general” (OED).
The forest-cover is inscribed in our primordial myths: “We gather from mythology that
their vast and somber wilderness was there before, like a precondition or matrix of
civilization, or that-as the epigraph to this book suggests-the forests were first” (Harrison
1992: 1). A condition for – or symptom of – the growth of human civilization was that
the forests were beaten back and conquered by the hunter-gatherers, giving way to the
agricultural revolution, which was possible only through the increasing area of farmland

12

offered by deforestation. By using Rome as an example, Harrison perfectly demonstrates
the relation between forests and civilization:

however implicated they may be in civilization's prehistory, the mythic
forests of antiquity stand opposed to the city in some fundamental way. We
will find that Rome can become Rome only by overcoming, or effacing, the
forests of its origins. Yet in the long run the city is overcome in turn by what
it subdued: in the forests to the north Rome's doom awaited its time.
(Harrison 1992: 2)

Thus, the ‘Gothic brutes’ of the northern forests spelled the fall of Rome, a show of the
historic tensions between traditional civilization and the outside.
The northern forests in the example of the fall of Rome exemplify the outside, or
the ‘Space’, contrasting the known and civilized ‘Place’ of Rome, a duality which still
exists between modern forests and urban areas. Parker notes that boundaries between the
Place and Space define human settlements: “The first thing that settlers do is to construct
boundaries: to demarcate territory, to name and map the land, and so to seemingly bring
it under control” (Parker 2020: 49). These boundaries do not only signify the change of
state between civilization and wilderness as Tuan (1979) notes that boundaries “are
everywhere because threats are ubiquitous: the neighbor’s dog, children with muddy
shoes, strangers, the insane, alien armies, disease, wolves, wind and rain” (Tuan 1979: 6).
Thus, boundaries define settlements, both inside and outside, drawing a line between
wilderness and civilization. Dawn Keetley (2016) also notifies us about how the
transgression of borders is something innate to plants: “Plant growth always breaks what
seeks to contain it, transgressing borders meant to confine and define” (Keetley 2016:
13). Thus, forests innately strive to increase their area of influence simply by naturally
growing and elongating their roots.
In the definition of civilize we also find “to make more cultured and sophisticated”
(OED). Thus, a line is again drawn, this time between where culture lies and where it
does not. The separation of cultured, civilized settlements and the cultureless, or acultural,
wilds, is an old one: “the wild as the acultural or even anti-cultural pervades much
environmental non-fiction. ‘Wild’ nature necessarily offers a space outside given cultural
identities and modes of thinking or practice” (Clark 2011: 25). Wildness also corresponds
with Parker’s second thesis: “The forest is associated with the past” (Parker 2020: 47).

13

This past was without civilization, and was also a time devoid of what we now associate
as culture.
The last of Parker’s theses also alludes back to the past: “The forest is an
antichristian space” (Parker 2020: 47). As Harrison notes, there is a long tradition of
hostility toward forests in the Christian tradition:

The Christian Church that sought to unify Europe under the sign of the cross
was essentially hostile toward this impassive frontier of unhumanized
nature. Bestiality, fallenness, errancy, perdition – these are the associations
that accrued around forests in the Christian mythology.
(Harrison 1992: 61)

Harrison points out that unhumanized nature, represented by the forests, was the enemy
met with hostility. It is interesting that none of the qualities that Harrison lists describe
the forests themselves. Rather, they are associated with that which lurks in the forest,
therefore displaying the anthropocentrism in the thinking of the Church. The forest is
outside of the Christian Place, and therefore houses that which is outside of the Christian
sphere:

As the underside of the ordained world, forests represented for the Church
the last strongholds of pagan worship. In the tenebrous Celtic forests
reigned the Druid priests; in the forests of Germany stood those sacred
groves where unconverted barbarians engaged in heathen rituals; in the
nocturnal forests at the edge of town sorcerers, alchemists, and all the
tenacious survivors of paganism concocted their mischief.
(Harrison 1992: 61-2)

Harrison notes that these fears are not totally unfounded, as they helped in preserving old
ideas and traditions from before the birth of Christianity:

The Church had good reasons to be suspicious of these havens. Age-old
demons, fairies, and nature spirits continued to haunt the conservative
woodlands, whose protective shadows allowed popular memory to preserve
and perpetuate cultural continuities with the pagan past.
(Harrison 1992: 62)

14

As it is with many other traditions, like holidays such as Christmas, these old, ingrained
fears have their origins in times before Christianity. The hostile entities of the uncivilized
shadows managed to remain alive and were carried over and kept alive by the Church.
Many of Christianity’s anthropocentric views originate from the Bible. In
Genesis, God orders Adam and Eve to rule over all the creatures and organisms of the
earth. Parker explains that Genesis “presents ‘good’ Nature as cultivated, ‘bad’ Nature as
wild, and all Nature under the domain of humankind” (Parker 2020: 60). She also
contends that this view of humankind’s superiority over nature contributes to
“contemporary ecophobic anxieties”, linking the Christian tradition with ecophobia
(Parker 2020: 59). Being in control over nature is also an issue that Estok raises in his
original article on ecophobia:

ecophobia, however, in its own terms for the time being means looking at the
constitutional moment in history that gives us the biblical imperative to control
everything that lives. […] Ironically, the more control we seem to have over the
natural environment, the less we actually have”
(Estok 2009: 208)

As per Estok’s argument we have become distanced from nature simultaneously as we
have ‘gotten it under control’. Even though we now control nature more than ever,
estrangement with nature is urban areas is rampant.
The forest’s opposition of religious civilization, however, stems deeper than
Christianity, and into the realm of what is considered sacred. Timothy K. Beal argues that
“religion is about the sacred and the sacred is about order, foundation and orientation over
against chaos and disorientation, which are demonized” (Beal 2002: 9). Further,
“Religion is about creating and maintaining a sacred cosmic order against chaos” (Beal
2002: 9). The ordering of all that lives is also present in religion, a classification which
usually places plants at the bottom of the chain, below humans and animal. This is known
as zoocentrism. In his research on the philosophical treatment of plants, Matthew Hall
(2011) identifies the ways in which vegetal matter is related to other living beings, and
finds that there are some differing views, both in the Bible and in history. When

15

discussing Genesis as described in the Bible, Hall notes that there is both kinship and
categorization present:

In particular, for a treatment of plants, it is of great significance that the excerpt
concerning the origin of zoological life, the animals of sea and earth are described
as “living creatures.” However, in the passage that deals with the origin of plants,
there is no description of plants as living beings. In fact, in this opening account
of creation, I would claim that plants are backgrounded as inanimate, nonliving
beings.
(Hall 2011: 58)

We have a different way of relating to inanimate things rather than those which we
consider alive. Hall notes how this ultimately stems from our conceptions of God and the
natural order: “Plants are deemed to be much further away and more unlike God. On this
premise, plants are placed at the bottom of a remarkably anthropocentric representation
of natural value” (Hall 2011: 62). This leads to us viewing plants as less valuable than
other life, which Hall argues affects our relationship with plants:

As a result, within Christian theological material, relationships with plants can be
characterized predominantly as instrumental relationships, based upon the
usefulness of plants to human beings. Plants are placed at the bottom of a
hierarchy of the natural world and are excluded from human moral consideration.
(Hall 2011: 8)

The moral consideration that Hall writes of also extends to God, as is exemplified by
Noah’s ark:

For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in
which is the breath of life under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall
die. But I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark,
you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you. And of every living
thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive
with you.
(Genesis 6: 17-19)

16

Hall notes how the ark proves that plants are considered nonliving: “This passage
simultaneously confirms, deepens, and justifies the biblical notion of plants as nonliving
beings. In this passage, the fundamental definition of a living being is one that has both
the breath of life and flesh” (Hall 2011: 59). Thus, there is ample proof that the Bible
contains passages that point toward the superiority and exclusivity of the zoocentric
species over the vegetal side of the divide.
A sense of superiority and mastership over nature is ultimately what has caused
humanity to distance itself from nature. Lynn White Jr (1996) notes how humans have
disregarded the evidence laid before them to prove our part in the larger whole and our
non-exclusivity:

Our science and technology have grown out of Christian attitudes toward man’s
relation to nature which are almost universally held […]. Despite Copernicus, all
the cosmos rotates around our little globe. Despite Darwin, we are not, in our
hearts, part of the natural process. We are superior to nature, contemptuous of it,
willing to use it for our slightest whim.
(White 1996: 12)

This conception has become increasingly problematic in the heart of the anthropocentric,
as we notice that everything around us is now part of a problem which humanity has
caused.
That nature is considered inanimate has played to the part that it has become the
background for the action, rather than being counted as a part of it. Keetley notifies us
that due to the backgrounding, the forest is not what we fear, but rather that which it hides
amidst itself: “While foregrounded visually, the woods are backgrounded thematically.
Plant life becomes terrifying only to the extent that it hides the dangerous predator”
(Keetley 2021: 24). Thus, our senses are caught off-guard when the threat is not the
predator, but we are still the pray:

What is crucial about both story and film is that the forests that absorb
each man are no more or less than just forests. They contain no predators,
fairies, witches, monsters, or ghosts. The horror is not humans’ encounter with
what is in the trees; the horror is the humans’ encounter with the trees.”
(Keetley 2021: 25)

17

We face a new, unsettling situation when the trees are what we fear, rather than what they
hide.

3. Blackwood and Forests

Since childhood, Algernon Henry Blackwood (1869-1951) was fascinated by nature.
Growing up near the English countryside, young Blackwood would sneak out during the
night to explore and indulge in the nocturnal yard of their mansion. In his autobiography
Episodes before Thirty, Blackwood describes how he “loved to climb out of the windows
at night with a ladder, and creep among the rose trees and under the fruit-tree wall”
(Blackwood 1923: 33). At this point, by accident, Blackwood had gained access to a
confiscated copy of Patanjali’s Yoga Aphorisms, which changed his view on religion
forever, further driving him away from his evangelical Christian upbringing.
Blackwood’s parents Harriet and Stevenson Arthur Blackwood were devout
evangelical Christians, which affected the life and upbringing of young Algernon.
Religious gatherings were frequently held at the Blackwood mansion. Religion became a
point of contention for Algernon, as it felt threatening to him due to a “fear of hell and
damnation [that] was almost tangible in the Blackwood household” (Ashley 2001: 9). The
religious home was problematic for Algernon, and it forever changed his perception of
evangelical Christianity:

Blackwood was always seeking to escape. If there is a memory that is
stronger than the evocative gardens and nursery, it is the memory of his
parents’ religious zeal and of the frequent visitors who would pounce on the
young boy and ask him ‘Have you been saved?’ The intensity of this
religious fervour overpowered everything else in Blackwood’s childhood,
and it brings into focus Blackwood’s father, whose influence on the young
and sensitive Algernon was immense.
(Ashley 2001: 6)

Algernon became frightened of mundane things while simultaneously opening his senses
to all the wonders of the natural world, stirred in part by his night time adventures in the
gardens of their Crayford manor, which Mike Ashley (2001) notes was just outside the
city, enough so that it felt rural and natural. The awe that Blackwood felt during those
nights outside came to change his relation to nature, which in a sense overtook the space
inside of him that was reserved for the Christian religion.

19

Blackwood traveled widely throughout his whole life, but especially in his early
adult years. He lived in Canada during the early 1890’s, trying to establish his fortune by
many different enterprises covering a wide field of activities. During his brief time there
he managed to have a cattle ranch and a hotel, both of which failed. What remained the
most with Blackwood, however, where the forests of the uncultivated regions of Canada.
In his autobiography Blackwood reminisces upon his time there and on near divine
relation with nature that he was developing:

There were no signs of men; no sounds of human life; not even a dog’s
bark—nothing but a sighing wind and lapping water and a sort of earthmurmur under the trees, and I used to think that God, whatever He
was, or the great spiritual forces that I believed lay behind all phenomena,
and perhaps were the moving life of the elements themselves, must be
nearer to one’s consciousness in places like this than among the bustling of
men in the towns and houses.
(Blackwood 1923: 50)

Blackwood made sure that he regularly visited the forests near Lake Ontario, devoting
his Saturdays to hiking. It is also of note that during these trying times in Canada, where
most of his business ventures failed miserably and burned away the funds he received
from his father, it was through nature that Blackwood managed to keep his sanity while
civilization attempted as best it could to gnaw it away. This was most visible during his
time in New York between 1892 and 1899, where he worked as a journalist. Ashley
(2001) fittingly named the chapter about Blackwood’s arrival to New York ‘The Depths
of Hell’, which accurately describe Blackwood’s struggles to fit into society. His
misfortunes included poverty, rotten friendships and sickness. Ashley fittingly
proclaimed that Blackwood had “survived New York” (Ashley 2001: 102). Blackwood
himself too raises this notion, contrasting his time in civilization with his time spent in
the wilderness: “It is an imaginary notion doubtless, though it applied to my life aptly
enough at this time apparently: the Toronto misery, the Island happiness; the New York
hell, the Backwoods heaven” (Blackwood 1923: 235). His appreciation is amply visible
in his capitalization of nature.
Blackwood had worked with writing throughout his time in America, ranging
from journalism to translation, but it was only after his return to Europe in March 1899

20

that his ventures into fiction properly began. Blackwood remembers this time in his
autobiography Episodes before Thirty as follows:

It had been my habit and delight to spend my evenings composing yarns on my
typewriter, finding more pleasure in this than any dinner engagement, theatre or
concert. Why this suddenly began I cannot say, but I guess at a venture that the
accumulated horror of the years in New York was seeking expression.
(Blackwood 1923: 223)

Blackwood began channeling the traumatic baggage he had gained overseas into fiction,
focusing on the supernatural. Switzerland was dear to him, and he regularly went there to
ski and enjoy the nature.
Spirituality was always a strong part of Blackwood’s life, even though he shied
away from evangelism. Instead, he turned his attention to nature, which remained a potent
source for his evident magic throughout his life. In attempts to understand this spirituality,
Blackwood took part in many different supernatural-seeking societies. After failing in
college, Blackwood was sent to the School of the Moravian Brotherhood in the Black
Forest, where he was awe-struck by the equality and novel spirituality of the Brothers.
The School showed young Algernon that religion could be more than simply a fear of hell
and oblivion:

the whole setting of the Moravian school was so beautifully simple that it lent just
the proper atmosphere for lives consecrated without flourish of trumpets to God.
It all upon me an impression of grandeur, of loftiness, and of real religion . . . and
of a Deity not specially active on Sundays only
(Blackwood 1923: 26)

Most importantly, Blackwood experienced spirituality intertwined with nature, as he
recalls the experience of an Easter morning sermon at dawn, singing hymns accompanied
by the rising sun: “The air was cool and scented, our mood devotional and solemn. There
was a sense of wonder among us” (Blackwood 1923: 25). The Schwarzwald around the
school was also a source of inspiration.

21

Having returned home from the Moravian school at seventeen years of age,
Blackwood encountered a book so powerful for his young senses that it turned his
worldview on its head, revealing a deeper truth to his delicate mind. The book was
Patanjali’s Yoga Aphorisms. Through happenstance, an acquaintance of his father had left
the tome in the plain view of Algernon, who took a peek inside the covers, and was
fascinated by what he saw. Startled by his approaching father, Algernon in his hurry
dropped the book behind the table, where it laid hidden in store for later. He later learned
that the book had originally been confiscated as a warning example of the influence of
Satan and “first proof of the Fiend’s diabolical purpose” (Blackwood 1923: 28). Once he
properly got to engage with the book, Algernon was truly enthralled, a deeper
understanding awakening inside:

Though the mind was too untaught to grasp the full significance of these electric
flashes, too unformed to be even intelligently articulate about them, there certainly
rushed over my being a singular conviction of the unity of life everywhere and in
everything – of its one-ness. […] Those Yoga aphorisms of a long-dead Hindu
sage, set between a golden September evening and a guttering candle, marked
probably the opening of my mind. . . . The entire paraphernalia of my evangelical
teaching thenceforth began to withdraw.
(Blackwood 1923: 29)

While Blackwood began to move away from Christianity, he notes that his view of his
father’s religiosity rose in his eyes: “my father’s Christianity became splendid in my eyes.
I realized, even then, that it satisfied his particular and individual vision of truth, while
the fact that he lived up to his beliefs nobly and consistently woke a new respect and
admiration in me” (Blackwood 1923: 32). Thus, a reverence for the noble religiosity of
his father still remained with Algernon, even though he himself had taken distance from
the faith.
It was in 1899, a while after having returned from America and a more recent trip
to Hungary, that Blackwood joined the London Lodge of the Theosophical Society, where
he became acquainted with author W.B. Yeats, who introduced him to another secret
society, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Through his studies in the Order,
Blackwood learned about astrology and the Kabbala. Blackwood’s time in the Order was
only a few years in length, although he never formally left. According to Ashley,
Blackwood had learned enough for his own taste, as his “interest had always been in the

22

mystical aspects of the Kabbala and this he had satisfied” (Ashley 2001: 113). S.T. Joshi
describes it with a slightly different tone: “these groups ultimately proved unsatisfactory,
as Blackwood realized that his own Nature-mysticism was too distinctive and
nondoctrinal to fit into their narrow dogmas” (Joshi 2002: ix).
The Man Whom the Trees Loved is a tragic short story that first appeared in 1912
in London Magazine, and was later the same year published as the opening story on the
collection Pan’s Garden, which included other classic Blackwood stories such as Sand
and The Glamour of Snow. Blackwood himself recollects writing the story at Holmesley
Lodge, located within the New Forest where the story also takes place, while both Joshi
and Ashley state that the story was largely written at the home of Blackwood’s friend
Graham Robertson in Sandhills (Joshi 2002; Ashley 2001). Robertson, an artist and
playwright, provided illustrations for many of Blackwood’s works at the time, including
The Man Whom the Trees Loved and the other stories in Pan’s Garden, and he was the
inspiration for Mr. Sanderson, the artist visiting the Bittacys in the story.

23

4. Sophia Bittacy and the Divine Order

Sophia Bittacy, the wife of David Bittacy and protagonist of The Man Whom the Trees
Loved, struggles with her relationships during the story. These struggles include both her
husband, and the New Forest that stretches around their mansion. As will be discussed,
her fears are fueled by ecophobia, the origins of which will also be investigated. Sophia
is, by all accounts, the most relatable character of the story, also taking the role of
protagonist as her husband fades into the background reaching for a closer connection
with the forest. It is through Mrs. Bittacy that we properly engage with the story of The
Man Whom the Trees Loved: “It is through Sophia, avatar of normality, that we
experience the real horror of the trees” (Keetley 2021: 26).
Sophia Bittacy is the daughter of an evangelical clergyman, something which
defines her character throughout the story; she is guided by the Bible and her faith in it.
As with many women at the time, the late 19th century, she is characterized as being in
her husband’s shadow, and living her life through him, rather than pursuing her own
goals. Blackwood describes it as thus: “Mrs. Bittacy, […] was a self-sacrificing woman,
who in most things found a happy duty in sharing her husband’s joys and sorrows to the
point of self-obliteration. Only in this matter of the trees she was less successful than in
others” (Blackwood 2002: 212). Her husband’s infatuation with the forest is thus the only
thing which she cannot lay aside in their bond. As is discussed later, there are many
different reasons for this.
First and foremost, in his explanatory notes on The Man Whom the Trees Loved,
Joshi (2002) explains the similarity between the upbringing of Sophia Bittacy and
Blackwood himself. Both come from a strict evangelical home, the difference being in
how they choose to relate to the religiosity: Bittacy by embracing it and Blackwood by
turning away from it. Thus, Mrs. Bittacy represents similar attitudes that were found in
Blackwood’s own home, which also serves as the locale for the story. Mrs. Bittacy also
shares many similarities with one of Blackwood’s closest friends at the time of writing
The Man Whom the Trees Loved, Maya Knoop (née Mabel Stuart-King). Maya was the
wife of Russian baron Johann Knoop, a violin enthusiast, who first became interested in
her due to her playing and her Stradivarius, which he later locked up in his collection and
refused to let her touch. Thus, their marriage became somewhat tragic and Maya a lockedup bird. She was later allowed to see other people, one of them being Blackwood. From

24

this description of her from a letter by Blackwood to author and friend of both Stephen
Graham, some similarities between Maya and Sophia Bittacy can be found:

Ah! She is a great soul and gives her life away for others as naturally as flowers
give their perfume, while in her private life – I can say this to you, my dear fellow,
she has daily cruelty and pain to bear that few other women could endure for a
month, let alone years and years.
(Ashley 2001: 167-8)

Both of them have to endure their husband’s whims, and both remained childless, as per
Ashley’s account: “Maya loved children, but was unable to have any by Knoop” (Ashley
2001: 169). Blackwood also dedicated Pan’s Garden, the collection which The Man
Whom the Trees Loved was first published in, to a certain ‘M.S.K’ who Ashley (2001)
intends is a reference to Mabel Stuart-King, the maiden name of Maya Knoop.
Mrs. Bittacy’s Christian faith is something which is brought up throughout the
story, and it influences how she reacts and interacts in various situations. It is first brought
up in relation to David’s interest in the trees, namely in relation to how incomprehensible
it feels:

This passion of his for the trees was of old a bone of contention, though very mild
contention. It frightened her. That was the truth. The Bible, her Baedeker for earth
and heaven, did not mention it. […] She liked the woods, perhaps as spots for
shade and picnics, but she could not, as he did, love them.
(Blackwood 2002: 217)

Mrs. Bittacy leans heavily on the teachings of the Bible, sometimes resembling a blind
obedience. This aspect of her may have been influenced by Harriet Sydney Blackwood,
Algernon’s mother. Much like with Mrs. Bittacy, the evangelical faith was an important
cornerstone in the life of Harriet Blackwood. Algernon tells us of her blind obedience to
some of the central scriptures, namely the Lord’s Prayer:

And this full confidence dated, oddly enough, from an incident in early childhood,
when I was saying the Lord’s Prayer at her knee. There was a phrase that puzzled

25

me even when I was in knickerbockers: “Lead us not into temptation […] I
stopped, looked up into her face, and asked: “But would He lead me into
temptation unless I asked him not to?” Her eyes opened, she gazed down into
mine with a thoughtful, if perplexed expression, for a moment she was evidently
at a loss how to answer. She hesitated, then decided to trust me with the truth: “I
have never quite understood those words myself,” she said. “I think, though, it is
best to leave their explanation to Him, and to say the words exactly as He taught
them.”
(Blackwood 1923: 259)

This blind obedience is also displayed later in some of the passages of the Bible which
Mrs. Bittacy takes literally and without much contemplation. While describing her
mother, Blackwood reveals other connecting qualities as well: “my mother, especially,
being a woman of great individuality, of iron restraint, grim humour, yet with a love and
tenderness, and a spirit of uncommon sacrifice, that never touched weakness”
(Blackwood 1923: 21). Restraint, although faltering at the end, love and sacrifice are all
at the core of Mrs. Bittacy’s person, and it is clear that some semblance of Harriet
Blackwood lives on in her.
Blackwood also makes it painfully clear that Mrs. Bittacy lacks in intelligence and
critical thinking: “Mrs. Bittacy rustled ominously, holding her peace meanwhile. She
feared long words she did not understand. Beelzebub lay hid among too many syllables”
(Blackwood 2002: 228). Blackwood further makes it clear by her description of the
vegetable menace that interrupts their teatime: “She declared afterwards that it moved in
“looping circles,” but what she perhaps meant to convey was “spirals” (Blackwood 2002:
232). She also misspells words which she does not fully understand: “I mean – isn’t he a
hypnotist, or full of those theofosical [sic] ideas, or something of the sort?” (Blackwood
2002: 235). This passage may also be a playful jest purposefully inserted by Blackwood,
as he himself had been involved with theosophy, though he had left the movement behind
during the period of writing The Man Whom the Trees Loved.
Like the misheard lyrics -trend of the modern age, Mrs. Bittacy also seems to
understand some things from the Bible wrong simply because she has not understood how
the original text is supposed to be written, nor how it is supposed to be understood:

For, like the child who thought that “suffered under Pontius Pilate” was “suffered
under a bunch of violets,” she heard her proverbs phonetically and reproduced

26

them thus. She hoped to convey her warning in the quotation. “And we must
always try the spirits whether they be God,” she added tentatively.
(Blackwood 2002: 236)

Mr. Bittacy also reveals that this behavior is to be expected of her, and that it is how she
usually behaves: “He was too accustomed to her little confused alarms to explain them
away seriously as a rule, or to correct her verbal inaccuracies” (Blackwood 2002: 235).
The messages from the Bible are misunderstood, and therefore raise the question whether
Mrs. Bittacy’s actions and values are based on the teachings of the Bible, or on how she
has understood the meanings, the two possibly being different as seen in the example
earlier. It is also possible to see some influences of Blackwood’s mother in the passage,
leaving some of the contemplation about meaning aside and believing blindly in the plain
content of the message.
A lack of understanding is also key to the character of Mrs. Bittacy. This is
especially true in relation to the trees, which are described as vague and terrifying, unlike
the pope, who is real and comprehensible:

For her mind still bristled with the bogeys of Antichrist and Prophecy, and she
had only escaped the Number of the Beast, as it were, by the skin of her teeth. The
Pope drew most of her fire usually, because she could understand him; the target
was plain and she could shoot. But this tree-and-forest business was so vague and
horrible. It terrified her.
(Blackwood 2002: 235)

This insight into her mind reveals, that at the least a part of her fear for the forest is due
to not understanding the trees, and to an extent not understanding why her husband is so
intrigued by them. Simultaneously, not understanding the true nature of her husband’s
amiable relation to their surroundings also takes on some religious connotations, as is
seen from her observations of the discussions between Mr. Bittacy and Sanderson: “They
talked trees from morning till night. It stirred in her the old subconscious trail of dread, a
trail that led ever into the darkness of big woods; and such feelings, as her early
evangelical training taught her, were temptings” (Blackwood 2002: 220-1). The lack of
understanding can be connected to logos and mythos. As most of the tree business is so

27

vague and difficult to understand, a lack of scientific understanding empowers the sense
of otherworldliness, a sense of mythos.
Mrs. Bittacy, though sometimes blinded by her faith, is also empowered by it, as
she shows when Mr. Bittacy announces that he simply cannot go abroad that year:

After the first shock of the announcement, she reflected as deeply as her nature
permitted, prayed, wept in secret – and made up her mind. Duty, she felt clearly,
pointed to renouncement. The discipline would certainly be severe – she did not
dream at the moment how severe! – but this fine, consistent little Christian saw it
plain; she accepted it, too, without any sighing of the martyr, though the courage
she showed was of the martyr order.
(Blackwood 2002: 248)

Mrs. Bittacy leans on her faith in matters which she cannot necessarily understand, both
the positive and negative. She is self-sacrificing to a fault, enduring countless pains in
order to fulfill her role as wife as she sees it, and even takes pride in her sacrificial nature:
“The love she had borne him all these years, like the love she had bore her
anthropomorphic deity, was deep and real. She loved to suffer for them both” (Blackwood
2002: 248).
The avenues where Mrs. Bittacy has made sacrifices are also connected to the
woods, in particular to the New Forest, where the story takes place. Obviously, her
husband is inclined to live near the forest due to his feelings for the trees, something
which pains Mrs. Bittacy:

Mrs. Bittacy had never liked their present home. She preferred a flat, more open
country that left approaches clear. She liked to see things coming. This cottage on
the very edge of the old hunting grounds of William the Conqueror had never
satisfied her ideal of a safe and pleasant place to settle down in. The sea-coast,
with treeless downs behind and a clear horizon in front, as at Eastbourne, say, was
her ideal of a proper home.
(Blackwood 2002: 246)

The woods induce feelings of claustrophobia, closing in on them as they sleep: “It was
curious, this instinctive aversion she felt to being shut in – by trees especially; a kind of
claustrophobia almost; […] towards their tiny cottage and garden, as though it sought to

28

draw them in and merge them in itself” (Blackwood 2002: 246-7). Therefore, it is clear
that her feelings of disdain toward the forest are deep, and as she further explains, related
to their time in India, when in “solitude the feeling had matured” (Blackwood 2002: 246).
Structure and order are important to Mrs. Bittacy. This does not only relate to
nature, but rather to all aspects of life. The cedar invokes feelings of uneasiness in her,
due to its ruggedness and disproportionality: “The way they studied that old mangy cedar
was a trifle unnecessary, unwise, she felt. It was disregarding the proportion which deity
had set upon the world for men’s safe guidance” (Blackwood 2002: 221). She goes even
further in her need for structure when Sanderson speaks of the mental capabilities of the
vegetables: “Or conscious either, Mr. Sanderson […] It’s only man that was made after
His image, not shrubberies and things” (Blackwood 2002: 229). The superiority of
humans over the vegetal is a fundamental belief of Mrs. Bittacy, which affects her feelings
of ecophobia against that which should not have agency. She also again deals in absolutes,
not being able to question the extent to which the Bible is correct, rather taking it as pure
unquestionable facts laid out plain.
Mrs. Bittacy is surrounded by agencies. Since her time living in India, she has felt
that the forest carries ulterior motives outside of its natural tendencies of proliferation, a
feeling which strengthens throughout the story. As she reminisces on her childhood
memories, Mrs. Bittacy recalls an event from her childhood, which relates to her feelings
about the woods:

That memory of her childhood sands came back, when the nurse said, “The tide
has turned now; we must go in,” and she saw the mass of piled-up waters, green
and heaped to the horizon, and realised that it was slowly coming in. The gigantic
mass of it, too vast for hurry, loaded with massive purpose, she used to feel, was
moving towards herself. […] The sight and sound of it had always overwhelmed
her with a sense of awe – as though her puny self were the object of the whole
sea’s advance
(Blackwood 2002: 260)

These memories of nature’s overwhelming agency, an unstoppable force, is something
which she feels again as the forest spreads its tentacles: “the same thing was happening
in the woods – slow, sure, and steady, and its motion as little discernible as the sea’s. The
tide had turned. The small human presence that had ventured among its green and
mountainous depths, moreover, was its objective” (Blackwood 2002: 260). MacNeill

Miller notes how this overwhelming realization that Mrs. Bittacy faces, that the sea is
vast and connected, is at the core of Weird Fiction:

The fact that weird fiction treats such a prospect with a sickening sense of dread
is not necessarily problematic: it is arguably the most natural response to the
realization that you are part of something far larger than you thought, and that you
are entangled in complex and even agonizing power relationships with subjects
whose significance you are only now belatedly beginning to understand.
(MacNeill Miller 2020: 250)

The memory of a vast, unstoppable force looms in the memory of Mrs. Bittacy, and
affects her relationship with nature in the unconscious back of her mind. Realization of
the agencies gnaws her mind throughout the latter parts of the story, ultimately breaking
her.
The agencies Mrs. Bittacy attempts to combat are difficult for her to grasp due to
the sheer alienness of their being and due to their place in the cosmic order. Greg Conley
(2013) describes that it is due to the concepts of good and evil, which are so central in the
teachings of religion, that the trees are difficult to understand for Mrs. Bittacy:

the Christian binary of good and evil fails to account for them, and Mrs. Bittacy,
kind Christian woman, has no tool that could lever her husband away from the
trees, because her tools are crafted for combating evil. The trees are not evil, as
evil is a human attribute. These entities remind one that one’s sense of ethics is a
human thing, rather than something innate to the world.
(Conley 2013: 440-41)

This is one of the reasons that Mrs. Bittacy speaks of principalities and devils, of difficult
concepts that are supernatural, in order to describe and categorize the opponent she is
facing. Thus, they are represented as something purely evil, rather than something with a
chance of redemption.
When Mrs. Bittacy follows her husband into the woods, divinity follows. Her
relationship with the divine, however, changes as a consequence of the revelation she
faces in the forest. Although she has been a faithful and humble servant her whole life,
she notices that the forest simply does not care, all the while she begins to doubt her own

30

deity and whether she is truly alone amidst an unrelenting sea of the vegetal. As she is
finally escorted out, she sees the finality of the event as an angel, a herald signaling that
a boundary has been crossed, transgression of which is forbidden:

But behind her, as she left the shadowed precincts, she felt as though some
towering Angel of the Woods let fall across the threshold the flaming sword of a
countless multitude of leaves that formed behind her a barrier, green, shimmering,
and impassable. Into the forest she never walked again.
(Blackwood 2002: 263)

It is curious that Mrs. Bittacy assigns some spirit of the divine to the forest, as she
condemns even the semblance of the idea many times over during the story. Yet, this is
the beginning of the turning point that signals a looming end of the story, and that she is
slowly losing the faith that has been her source of endurance against the corrupting
influence of the forest.
As the story progresses further, Mrs. Bittacy’s view on religion also changes.
What was once a strong support, becomes a weight as she struggles to understand the
world around her, which is utterly alien to how she has learned it to be. She is left on her
lonesome as the pillars that have supported her are vanishing: “Alone with her thoughts,
both her husband and her God withdrawn into distance, she counted the days to Spring”
(Blackwood 2002: 271). It is also revealed that her husband is not the only one who is
affected by the New Forest, but rather that she too has been drawn to the forest during
nighttime: “And she knew all this the instant that she woke; for it seemed to her that she
had been elsewhere – following her husband – as though she had been out! There was no
dream at all, merely this definite, haunting certainty” (Blackwood 2002: 268). Mrs.
Bittacy is thus both directly and indirectly the victim of the trees, unable to resist their
influence in her unconscious sleep. As she then tries to explain the incident to her
husband, he is not understanding. It is shocking to her, that she is left alone without his
love: “But it frightened me. I’ve lost my God – and you – I’m cold as death” (Blackwood
2002: 269). And as she later attempts to respond by verse to his pleading of sleep, she
herself parodies the meaning of the text she speaks: “Then sleep took her before she had
time to realise even that she was vilely parodying one of her most precious texts, and that
the irreverence was ghastly” (Blackwood 2002: 270). In her confusion, Mrs. Bittacy has

31

forgotten the meanings of her precious divine verses, thus only remembering their form
without the underlying function.

32

5. Sanderson – Against Ecophobia

Both Joshi (2002) and Ashley (2001) agree that Sanderson is based on Blackwood’s
friend Graham W. Robertson, who was an artist and playwright. Ashley describes him as
having “the same fey spirit as Blackwood” (Ashley 2001: 150). It was also at Robertson’s
house where Blackwood wrote most of The Man Whom the Trees Loved, and it is possible
that some of the discussions between the characters could be based on real discussions
between Blackwood and Robertson. In a similar manner that Sanderson guides Mr.
Bittacy on the subject of the trees, so too Robertson and Blackwood discussed the writings
of the latter, the former collaborating by supplying artwork for many of Blackwood’s
stories including The Man Whom the Rees Loved.
Arthur Sanderson is a painter who is specialized in picturing trees, something
which he is extraordinarily talented in. Blackwood describes him as eccentric, and that
“the way to reach his heart lay through his trees. He might be said to love trees”
(Blackwood 2002: 213). Trees seem to be his sole area of interest and he is an expert in
finding and portraying the personality of them. It is also noted that he does not come from
a painting background, quite the contrary: “How he managed it was sort of a puzzle, for
he never had painting lessons, his drawing was often wildly inaccurate, and, while his
perception of a Tree Personality was true and vivid, his rendering of it might almost
approach the ludicrous” (Blackwood 2002: 211). Blackwood makes it clear that
Sanderson has an unexplainable but deep connection with the trees, and that he would not
dabble with other areas of nature painting: “He kept to trees, wisely following an instinct
that was guided by love. It was quite arresting, this way he had of making a tree look
almost like being – alive. It approached the uncanny” (Blackwood 2002: 211).
Sanderson, the artist visiting the Bittacys during the story, is involved in
explaining the phenomenon surrounding the agency of the forest and the trees. Thus, he
is also involved in inducing the ecophobia that Mrs. Bittacy feels toward the forest. Partly,
this is due to the discussions between the artist and Mr. Bittacy, which first alarms Mrs.
Bittacy that her husband has changed: “And it came suddenly to her, while she watched,
that her husband had somehow altered these last few days – since Mr. Sanderson’s arrival
in fact. A change had come over him, though what it was she could not say” (Blackwood
2002: 221). This occasion is one which sparks the vague feelings of ecophobia in Mrs.

33

Bittacy, and it is arguable that Sanderson is also involved in sparking the events of the
story and some of the fear that Mrs. Bittacy feels.
Sanderson acts as a vessel that enables the development of a deeper bond between
the forest and Mr. Bittacy, due to the urges that he creates in the latter, including the
reawakening of the latter’s habit of sleep walking and talking. Mrs. Bittacy draws a link
between the two occurrences, putting all of the blame on the artist:

The words expressed some fringe of these alarms that had haunted her so long,
and that the arrival and presence of Sanderson seemed to have brought to the very
edge of a climax she could not even dare to think about. They gave it form; they
brought it closer; they sent her thoughts to her Deity in a wild, deep prayer for
help and guidance. For here was a direct, unconscious betrayal of a world of inner
purposes and claims her husband recognised while he kept them almost wholly to
himself
(Blackwood 2002: 239)

Mrs. Bittacy relates the events to the arrival of Sanderson. We are also informed that these
curious fits seem to recede once Sanderson has left the scene, apparently “because the
moods that had produced them passed away” (Blackwood 2002: 239). Thus, knowingly
or unknowingly, Sanderson acts as a conduit or catalyst for the influence the trees exert
on Mr. Bittacy.
On a metaphysical plane, it seems that the simple conversations that Sanderson
has with Mr. Bittacy draw nature closer and contribute to the overall change in the latter:

the words conveyed in too literal a sense the feeling that haunted all that
conversation. Each one in his own way realised - with beauty, with wonder, with
alarm - that the talk had somehow brought the whole vegetable kingdom nearer
to that of man. Some link had been established between the two. It was not wise,
with that great Forest listening at their very doors, to speak so plainly. The Forest
edged up closer while they did so.
(Blackwood 2002: 225)

Thus it seems that the plants of the forest are able to sense the feelings of the humans and
are able to act upon what they feel. Here we also see personification of the agency of the

34

forest, listening in on their conversation, and acting upon the knowledge, or perhaps
intuition, of the fact that they are speaking of it.
Sanderson also wakes feelings of unease in Mrs. Bittacy, partly due to his being
unfit in the strict category of the civilized gentleman that she has conjured in her mind:

Mrs. Bittacy was glad when he left. He brought no dress-suit for one thing, not
even a dinner-jacket, and he wore very low collars with big balloon ties like a
Frenchman, and let his hair grow longer than was nice, she felt. Not that these
things were important, but that she considered them symptoms of something a
little disordered. The ties were unnecessarily flowing.
(Blackwood 2002: 220)

We return to the issues of structure and civilization which Mrs. Bittacy clings to.
Sanderson does not fit the mold of a true gentleman, thus there is something off-putting
about him. Further, he is associated with the forest business, clashing even more against
Mrs. Bittacy’s beliefs.
Sanderson represents an un-Christian agent in the mind of Mrs. Bittacy. She sees
in him the devil, an unholy being, relating him to “Latter-Day things” and theosophists
(Blackwood 2002: 235). In her categorization, Sanderson falls into the category of the
unholy, unevangelical, and most importantly, the uncivilized. We understand why this
categorization induces fear in Mrs. Bittacy by returning to Parker’s theses on the forest:
Sanderson represents multiple theses all at once. He is, by Mrs. Bittacy’s definition,
against religion and Christianity, which extends to mean that he is also against
civilization. Sanderson’s relation with religion is also different to that of Mrs. Bittacy, as
is apparent from his attempts to convince her about the divinity present in the forest:

but there is ‘God’ in the trees, God in a very subtle aspect and sometimes - I have
known the trees express it too - that which is not God - dark and terrible. Have
you ever noticed, too, how clearly trees show what they want - choose their
companions, at least? How beeches, for instance, allow no life too near them birds or squirrels in their boughs, nor any growth beneath? The silence in the
beech wood is quite terrifying often! [...] all trees making a clear, deliberate
choice, and holding firmly to it? Some trees obviously - it’s very strange and
marked - seem to prefer the human.
(Blackwood 2002: 225)

35

Sanderson suggests a pantheistic presence in nature, but also that the pagan is alive in the
forest. The suggestion that the fearsome elements, dark, terrible, and silent, are all because
of the agency of nature points toward an implicit understanding of ecophobia. It is almost
as if he is coaxing it out of Mrs. Bittacy.
We can further draw conclusions based on what Sanderson relays about nature
during his conversation with the Bittacys, where he muses on the relationship between
humans and nature:

The whole gigantic vegetable kingdom, yes, “the artist took him up, all at the
service of man, for food, for shelter and for a thousand purposes of his daily life.
Is it not striking what a lot of the globe they cover . . . exquisitely organized life,
yet stationary, always ready to our hand when we want them, never running away?
[…] And, it’s curious that most of the forest tales and legends are dark,
mysterious, and somewhat ill-omened. The forest-beings are rarely gay and
harmless. The forest life was felt as terrible. Tree-worship still survives to-day.
Woodcutters … those who take the life of trees … you see, a race of haunted men
(Blackwood 2002: 231)

Preceding Sanderson’s answer is a remark by Mr. Bittacy that it was in fact God that
created the sea and the trees, in order to ensure his wife that their discussion has not
strayed too far from the orthodox. The beginning of Sanderson’s statement emphasizes
the anthropocentrism of Mrs. Bittacy, almost as if joking at her expense at how narrow
her view on the vegetal is. The latter part hints at something deeper, alluding to the
organization of the plants and the forests. He also brings up the mythos in the dark forest:
the folktales, disappearances, and forest-beings, not forgetting the pagan past associated
with the forests either. He even antagonizes woodcutters and calls them haunted.
Sanderson and the Bittacys also discuss the possibility as to whether plants and
trees can truly be called alive or not. Sanderson begins by stating that “in trees and plants
especially, there dreams an exquisite life that no one yet has proved unconscious”
(Blackwood 2002: 228). Sanderson’s thought is very modern, as the question of
consciousness in plants is a topic still being discussed in scientific circles. Mrs. Bittacy’s
answer is quite unconstructive: “Or conscious either, Mr. Sanderson […] It’s only man
that was made after His image, not shrubberies and things” (Blackwood 2002: 229). She
again brings the biblical into the discussion. Her answer lets us know that she does not

36

consider plants and people fitting into the same category of ‘living’ beings. Mr. Bittacy
attempts to tone down his wife’s hostility towards the idea by saying that it is unnecessary
to say that plants belong to the same category as people:

It is not necessary […] to say that they’re alive in the sense that we are alive. At
the same time, […] I see no harm in holding, dear, that all created things contain
some measure of His life Who made them. It’s only beautiful to hold that He
created nothing dead. We are not pantheists for all that!
(Blackwood 2002: 229)

From his answer too we find that it is considered unchristian to imagine plants as living,
at the very least in the same sense as people. Mrs. Bittacy’s reaction to the word
‘pantheist’ is also of note, as her internal alarms activate from it. “Oh, no! Not that, I
hope! […] The word alarmed her. It was worse than pope. Through her puzzled mind
stole a stealthy, dangerous thing . . . like a panther” (Blackwood 2002: 229). Again, Mrs.
Bittacy links the pope to evil, but he is a lesser evil than the pantheists, which is
understandable as they are further away from the evangelical faith than the catholic
church.
Sanderson again holds a different view to things compared to Mrs. Bittacy,
revealing how he feels life is abundant and widespread:

I like to think that even in decay there’s life […] The falling apart of rotten wood
breeds sentiency; there’s force and motion in the falling of a dying leaf, in the
breaking up and crumbling of everything indeed. And take an inert stone: it’s
crammed with heat and weight and potencies of all sorts. What holds its particles
together indeed? We understand it as little as gravity or why a needle always turns
to the ‘North’. Both things may be a mode of life.
(Blackwood 2002: 229)

Sanderson’s view is close to how materialist ecocritics view the world: a series of
agencies closely linked and intertwined, all organisms sharing with and affecting each
other. While his understanding of gravity and its relation to being alive is flawed and does
not align with modern day science, Sanderson understands the limits of not understanding
and the possibility that something may be thought of as alive even though it is

37

unconventional and even controversial. In the context of the ongoing discussion it
certainly is, as Mrs. Bittacy latches onto the idea of a compass, a clearly inanimate object
being alive: “You think a compass has a soul, Mr. Sanderson?” (Blackwood 2002: 229).
She is described as outraged by the thought, which may stem from the fact that a soul is
required to be considered alive, therefore including the religious aspect again into the
matter.
Mr. Bittacy again attempts to tone down the implications that Sanderson utters,
while stating that things may be otherwise than what they seem to us:

Our friend merely suggests that these mysterious agencies […] may be due to
some kind of life we cannot understand. Why should water only run downhill?
Why should trees grow at right angles to the surface of the ground and towards
the sun? Why should the worlds spin for ever on their axes? Why should fire
change the form of everything it touches without really destroying them? To say
these things follow the law of their being explains nothing. Mr. Sanderson merely
suggests – poetically, my dear, of course – that these may be manifestations of
life, though life at a different stage to ours.
(Blackwood 2002: 229)

The attempt to change the meaning of everything Sanderson said as mere poetical
language is an attempt to downplay the importance of his message. The different stage of
life that Mr. Bittacy speaks of refers to the idea that plants would have evolved in a
different direction from humans. Conley (2013) argues that the plants in some of
Blackwood’s stories, including The Man Whom the Trees Loved, have evolved further
than humanity, thus forming new ways of being and communicating:

Blackwood also explores what it means for nature to be able to produce various
forms of life, various branches on the tree of evolution. The trees in Blackwood’s
horror stories do not horrify just by reminding readers that nature does not care
about them […] though they do so; they also horrify by reminding readers that
human development was due to a chain of evolutionary events, and that an
alternative chain could result in alien intelligences, different from and separate
from the hominid line.
(Conley 2013: 432)

38

The evolutionary theorists Darwin and Spencer were Blackwood’s contemporaries, and
it is thus natural that Blackwood would draw inspiration from their research and theories.
Blackwood is also playful in his expression regarding the possibilities present, comparing
many different unknowns with each other, each in its own right outside of the scientific
realm of comprehension at the time.
For Mrs. Bittacy, the concept of being alive includes criteria. She is astonished by
Sanderson’s proposition that objects ordinarily considered lifeless could indeed be filled
with life that we simply have not been able to perceive thus far. Her concept of living
includes breathing and possessing a soul: “The ‘breath of life,’ […] ‘He breathed into
them.’ These things do not breathe” (Blackwood 2002: 229). Mrs. Bittacy thus defines
living as sacred, a right and privilege given by God solely and specifically to humans, as
is described in the Bible. It explains some of the reasons behind the outrage she feels at
being barraged with the possibilities that the two men in her company muse over,
considering the ideas themselves preposterous to her belief. Pantheism also gains some
of its infamy in her eyes from the fact that divinity can be spread out, much like how
agency is considered widely spread in nature by Sanderson. There exists thus a
fundamental clash of ideas between the two parties which cannot formally coexist, as
both parties claim to be right about the matter, especially Mrs. Bittacy. Sanderson seems
to be content in knowing that his take on the matter is correct:

Then Sanderson put in a word. But he spoke rather to himself or to his host than
by way of serious rejoinder to the ruffled lady. “but plants do breathe too, you
know […] They breathe, they eat, they digest, they move about, and they adapt
themselves to their environment as men and animals do. They have a nervous
system too … at least a complex system of nuclei which have some of the qualities
of nerve cells. They may have a memory too. Certainly, they know definite action
in response to stimulus. And though this may be physiological, no one has proved
that it is only that, and not – psychological.
(Blackwood 2002: 229-30)

Sanderson’s plants are clearly alive. They not only breathe, but also eat and move.
Although the science on nervous systems and the physiology of plants was still far from
where it has developed today, Sanderson’s views align quite well with modern science.
When it comes to adaptation, it seems clear that Sanderson is able to better accommodate
new ideas than Mrs. Bittacy, thus being able to grasp possibilities which seem wholly

39

impossible. This may also be a reason why, unlike Mrs. Bittacy, Sanderson is unfazed by
the influence of the forest.
While Mrs. Bittacy attempts to brand the Forest as a breeding ground of evil,
where the devil resides, Sanderson feels the opposite. His trees are forces of good, as he
describes his alignments:
They would draw you to themselves. Good forces, you see, always seek to merge;
evil to separate; that’s why Good in the end must always win the day - everywhere.
The accumulation in the long run becomes overwhelming. Evil tends to
separation, dissolution, death. The comradeship of trees, their instinct to run
together, is a vital symbol. Trees in a mass are good; alone, you may take it
generally, are - well, dangerous. Look at a monkey-puzzler, or better still, a holly.
[...] Did you ever see more plainly an evil thought made visible? They’re wicked
(Blackwood 2002: 226-27)

Thus, the New Forest in his eyes is purely a force of Good, attempting to merge and
amalgamate with its surroundings, rather than destroy and tear apart which is the
definition of Evil according to Sanderson.
The conversation between Mr. Bittacy and Sanderson essentially touches
upon the concepts of biophilia and ecophobia. Through discussing whether the gaps in
nature exist or not, the definition that Sanderson gives is a textbook example of biophilia:

It’s rather a comforting thought […] that life is about us everywhere, and that
there is really no dividing line between what we call organic and inorganic. [...]
The universe, yes […] is all one, really. We’re puzzled by the gaps we cannot see
across, but as a fact, I suppose, there are no gaps at all.
(Blackwood 2002: 228)

The utopian view Sanderson holds about the interconnectedness of all matter, though also
including the inorganic, marks his position as strictly biophilic. Simultaneously, he
comments on the inability of Mrs. Bittacy to see across the gaps, essentially saying that
he thinks that the ecophobia she is experiencing due to her inability is unnecessary and
wrong. Ecophobia, then, means that one cannot accept or appreciate that which is beyond
the gap, as it is felt as something foreign. This description of ecophobia echoes the relation
between ecophobia and racism that Estok (2009) raises, i.e. how both stem from

40

prejudices against another group, or in this case across a perceived gap, which, as
Sanderson points out, does not exist.

41

6. The Cedar – civilized nature

Of all the trees in The Man Whom the Trees Loved, one in particular rises above the else
in importance: the old Lebanon on the lawn. It is the only properly personified tree, and
it feels like one of the protagonists, albeit one of a tragic nature. That the tree happens to
be a cedar is also of significance, as we will see.
The true cedars or Cedrus genus, not to be confused with cypresses, some of which
are mistakenly called cedars, consist of four main “discrete taxa”: the Atlas cedar of the
Atlas mountain range in Morocco, the Cyprus cedar from the island Cyprus, the
Himalayan deodar and finally the cedar of Lebanon, or simply Lebanon (Hemery &
Simblet 2014: 53). The true cedars belong to the Pinaceae family and are native to North
Africa, the Middle East and India. Cedars are hardy trees that survive in harsh and dry
environments. They are, however, susceptible to frequent rainfall, which renders them
unsuitable for some of Britain’s damp areas. This explains why cedars are not grown in a
larger economical scale in England, and also explains why the old Lebanon in the yard
has been left alone without others of its kind, as Sanderson proclaims: “Cedars grow in
forests all together. The poor thing has drifted, that is all” (Blackwood 2002: 227).
Elizabeth Chang fittingly calls the Lebanon “a harmless, if wrongly cultivated, stray”
(Chang 2019: 174). As will be analyzed further, it is the fate of the tree to be between two
regions: the civilized garden of the Bittacys and the large, hulking menace of the New
Forest.
As Ashley (2001) mentions, Blackwood’s texts are largely autobiographical. It is
no coincidence, therefore, that the tree in story happens to be a cedar. Joshi (2002) links
the mansion of the story with the mansion in Crayford where Blackwood’s family lived
from 1871 to 1880 (Joshi 2002: 367). Ashley’s description of Blackwood’s home manor
in Crayford confirms what house the Bittacy manor is based on: “The house made an
indelible impression on young Blackwood. […] There is still a giant cedar in the front
lawn.” (Ashley 2001: 5) Therefore, the cedar is an obvious choice as a tall, majestic
sentinel.
Cedars have held high importance in several different mythologies. The deodar
tree means “wood of the gods” from Sanskrit “devad ru”, and it is considered holy by the
Hindus (Hemery & Simblet 2014: 54). In the Epic of Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh needs to cut
down a whole cedar forest. “According to the epic, the cedars of Lebanon were protected

42

by Humbaba, a frightening hulklike being” (Maloof 2021: 31). Gilgamesh defeats
Humbaba, and thus cuts down the cedar forest, resulting in a shortage of the trees which
is still felt in modern day Lebanon.
Christianity also includes myths of the Cedar of Lebanon. It is said to be one of
the four woods from which the Cross was built – along with cypress, box and pine (Watts
2007: 92). Some say that it stood for the body of the cross, probably due to its sturdy and
straight stem. Gabriel Hemery and Sarah Simblet also note that the “Cedar of Lebanon is
a symbol of power, prosperity and longevity in Christian scripture, appearing frequently
in the Holy Bible; it is also considered sacred in Islam” (Hemery & Simblet 2014: 54). It
is mentioned as the tree which was used for the carriage of King Solomon in the Song of
Solomon, a “carriage from the wood of Lebanon” (Song of Solomon 3:9). Blackwood
notes in Episodes before Thirty that the Song of Solomon was among his “chief personal
delights” when it came to the religious literature at his childhood home (Blackwood 1923:
27).
The symbols that Hemery and Simblet mention are also visible in the Lebanon
sentinel of Blackwood’s story. The cedar is using its power and agency to protect the
Bittacys from the influence of the forest outside: “That cedar will protect you here,
though, because you both have humanised it by your thinking so lovely of its presence.
The others can’t get past it, as it were” (Blackwood 2002: 227). As Sanderson notes
above, the tree is exerting its own influence to protect the couple and nurture the bond
between human and vegetable. A similar impression is also shared by Mrs. Bittacy: “The
cedar – this impression remained with her afterwards too – prevented, kept it back”
(Blackwood 2002: 233). It also shows how power, longevity and prosperity, or a lack
thereof, affects the mind of David Bittacy, as it is the downfall of the Lebanon that
ultimately leads to the spreading of the corruption from the trees in the forest beyond the
barrier that it acted as and maintained. As Mrs. Bittacy notes: “That cedar stood in their
life for something friendly; its downfall meant disaster; a sense of some protective
influence about the cottage, and about her husband in particular, was thereby weakened”
(Blackwood 2002: 243). In this sense it acts as a symbol of the resistance of civilized
nature against primal nature.
As we are introduced to the characters, we learn that the cedar also bears much
significance in their lives and their pasts. In the opening scene of the story, we meet
Sanderson, the artist, painting a picture of the cedar on the lawn, with some nearsupernatural qualities that catch the interest of Mr. Bittacy. He is awed by the

43

extraordinariness he sees in the painting and the abilities of Sanderson: “Why, you can
almost hear it rustle. You can smell the thing. You can hear the rain drip through its
leaves. You can almost see the branches move. It grows.” (Blackwood 2002: 211). Bittacy
himself agrees to the fact that there is something different in the painting contra others of
its kind, as he attempts to justify the price of it to himself: “half to persuade himself that
the twenty guineas were well spent (since his wife thought otherwise), and half to explain
this uncanny reality of life that lay in the fine old cedar framed above his study table”
(Blackwood 2002: 211).
Bittacy soon reveals why that certain cedar, which Sanderson has managed to
infuse into the painting of the present-day Lebanon, wakes such warm feelings of
nostalgia:

It reminds me of a certain day, Sophia, […] now long gone by. It reminds
me of another tree – that Kentish lawn in the spring, birds singing in the
lilacs, and some one in a muslin frock waiting patiently beneath a certain
cedar – not the one in the picture, I know, but […] It has me fond of all
cedars for its sake
(Blackwood 2002: 213)

While David shares his story from the past, we hear Sophia chiming in with her own
memories of the time, implying that she has her own views of the events with a
significantly more mundane touch. This sequence implies that the cedars initially mean
quite different things for the two characters.
That a difference between the old pair exists is not a matter of speculation. Rather,
it is something Blackwood also makes clear from the onset. A gulf exists, namely a gulf
in their relation to trees. While David loves the trees, Sophia cannot tolerate them, much
less so because her husband is so keen on them. This fear is initially explained as
originating from when the couple lived in India and David would venture into the jungle
for prolonged periods: “Her fear, he judged, was simply due to those years in India, when
for weeks at a time his calling took him away from her into the jungle forests, while she
remained at home dreading all manner of evils that might befall him” (Blackwood 2002:
212). The gulf is also apparent when David is musing about the painting:

44

He knew, for instance, that what she objected to in this portrait of the cedar
on their lawn was really not the price he had given for it, but the unpleasant
way in which the transaction emphasized this breach between their common
interests – the only one they had, but deep.
(Blackwood 2002: 212)

Sophia’s ecophobia urges her to dislike the connection between David and the cedar.
Mrs. Bittacy’s fears are partly realized when she hears her husband sleep-talking
a certain passage in his sleep: “O art thou sighing for Lebanon / In the long breeze that
streams to thy delicious East? / Sighing for Lebanon, / Dark Cedar” (Blackwood 2002:
251). Blackwood describes her reaction as “half charmed, half terrified” as Mrs. Bittacy’s
reaction turns into horror from the uncannily delivered passage (Blackwood 2002: 252).
It marks that the tree’s influence has reached, or maybe invaded, the mind of Mr. Bittacy.
Furthermore, it signals that the bond between the man and the tree has developed and that
the two share a mutual understanding. Therefore, it also signifies that the gulf between
the entities has been crossed or patched up, all the while the gulf between husband and
wife is increasing. The tree has emotions which it conveys to Mr. Bittacy: “My dear, I
felt the loneliness – suddenly realised it – the alien desolation of that tree, set here upon
our little lawn in England when all her Eastern brothers call to her in sleep” (Blackwood
2002: 252)
The passage Mr. Bittacy quotes is from Maud by Lord Tennyson. In a remark on
Blackwood, his fellow author of supernatural tales and member of the Hermetic Order of
the Golden Dawn, Arthur Machen (1863-1947), comments on Blackwood’s different
relation to nature:

He is a most interesting and amiable man. There is some difference perhaps in our
approach to our subject matter, although I realize that we are lumped together by
the reviewers. Tennyson, you remember, says ‘the cedars sigh for Lebanon,’ and
that is exquisite poetry; but Blackwood believes the cedars really do sigh for
Lebanon and that, Starrett, is damned nonsense!
(Starrett 1965: 248-9)

This remark by Machen given to weird fictionist Vincent Starrett paints a wondrous
picture about Blackwood’s perception of the world, especially how vividly he believes

45

the natural world works. In the original verse by Tennyson, the cedar fulfills a different
role as the object of similitude, the question of sighing being more metaphorical than what
Blackwood supposedly thought of it as. Mann (1856) describes how this passage
originally relates to the longing of the protagonist:

The soft murmur of the steady western breeze comes to him as if it were a sigh
from the tree expressing its sympathy with his state. The ‘gates of heaven’ have
but recently closed for him, and the cedar too, like himself, must be yearning for
some absent good, - for the slopes, perchance, of its native Lebanon. But why
should the cedar yearn for Lebanon, when its lot has been cast in such auspicious
environments!
(Mann 1856 in Jump 1967: 203)

Blackwood takes the metaphor literally, similarly to how Mrs. Bittacy understands the
Bible. Thus, this passage gets a new, literal meaning when muttered by Mr. Bittacy in his
sleep. Here, Mr. Bittacy communicates with the cedar, and the question is sincere. The
west wind amplifies this meaning, as Sanderson explains that it is through the winds that
the trees communicate, as witnessed by the reputation of Mr. Bittacy reaching from India
to England.
The fate of the Lebanon increases how we perceive the effects of the forests
influence. As a symbol for longevity and prosperity, the Lebanon should resist and
withstand the usual agencies that nature throws its way. Due to the link between the tree
and Mr. Bittacy, it has become the target of the agency of the forest, a massive force, and
something which even the splendor of the cedar is unable to resist, succumbing under the
pressure and losing its branches. Thus, we are reminded of the awesomeness and sheer
force of the will of the forest, adding to the dread that Mrs. Bittacy feels:

the first thing she saw, as she crept to the window and looked out, was the ruined
cedar lying on the lawn. Only the gaunt and crippled trunk of it remained. The
single giant bough that had been left to it lay dark upon the grass, sucked endways
towards the Forest by a great wind eddy. It lay there like a mass of drift-wood
from a wreck, left by the ebbing of a high spring-tide upon the sands – remnant of
some friendly, splendid vessel that once had sheltered men.
(Blackwood 2002: 274)

46

The cedar along with the personality, or possibly even sanity, of her husband have left
Mrs. Bittacy behind. The description of the once-majestic tree also reveals how the forest
has begun sucking it into itself, moving it inch-by-inch with the wind, the greater agentic
force of the forest. How Mrs. Bittacy perceives the Lebanon has also changed
considerably: it has become an old friend that now remains in spirit only, as its mortal
body has succumbed under the influence of the forest, leaving only the warm memories
behind. Its body, the trunk, has been sucked of all vitality, becoming a gaunt shell of what
it once was.

47

7. The Forest and Civilization

The New Forest that borders the mansion of the Bittacys is the main source of
horror throughout the story as it spreads its spiraling tentacles toward civilization and the
Bittacy mansion. Some of the horror it brings, however, is due to its uncivilized nature,
which Blackwood highlights in the story. The opposition to as well as the opposition of
civilization is important to the story all the way from the beginning, as acts as a vehicle
through which the increasingly polarized dialogue between the main protagonists
concerning the ‘civilized’ and ‘uncivilized’ may be articulated.
The two modes of being, civilized and uncivilized, are fundamentally represented
in all space, as all belongs to one or the other. Blackwood clearly defines how his
characters, especially Mrs. Bittacy, views this dichotomy. The opposite directions also
fuel the friction present between them, as both attempt to convert the other to its cause.
This is especially presented by the New Forest swallowing the nature of civilization:

He saw the great encircling mass of gloom that was the Forest, fringing their
little lawn. It pressed up closer in the darkness. The prim garden with its
formal beds of flowers seemed an impertinence almost – some little
coloured insect that sought to settle on a sleeping monster – some gaudy fly
that danced impudently down the edge of a great river that could engulf it
with a toss of its smallest wave. That Forest with its thousand years of
growth and its deep spreading being was some such slumbering monster,
yes. Their cottage and garden stood too near its running lip.
(Blackwood 2002: 214-15 [my emphasis])

The lawn is the ultimate form of civilized nature: an area devoid of any ‘unruly’ life,
every blade of grass aligned according to the will of the gardener. Most importantly, it is
distinctly other from the Forest, which Blackwood likens to a monstrous and uniform
being that is threatening civilization, and ultimately on a wholly different scale: a monster,
and a big one at that, compared to the tiny bug that the civilized garden represents. It also
harkens back to the idea of primal nature, a forest thousands of years old, from a time
when Christianity and civilization was but a small bug in the English landscape.
Blackwood does not shy away from expressing his views about civilization and
its effects on the state of nature, for example how the cityscapes of his time are destroying
the traditional civilized natures of the city:

48

But, once its leafy portals left behind, [sic] the trees of the countryside were
otherwise. The houses threatened them; they knew themselves in danger. The
roads were no longer glades of silent turf, but noisy, cruel ways by which men
came to attack them. They were civilized, cared for – but cared for in order that
some day they might be put to death.
(Blackwood 2002: 216)

The trees of civilization have become a resource, devoid of all value but the industrial, as
their only purpose is to grow and then serve as timber. Similarly through the lonely cedar
he signals how planted trees, belonging to a different region and different soil, become
alien and deranged. Sanderson shares that the Lebanon has grown jealous for the attention
of Mr. Bittacy over the New Forest. It has become a boundary between space and place,
between the Bittacy cottage and the New Forest. It also, ironically, becomes an instrument
for Blackwood, as he uses it to show the corrupting influence upon the separate entity.
Blackwood also indicates that the forest can sense the feelings of the trees that have been
captured in the civilized places, pitying them:

Even in the villages, where the solemn and immemorial repose of giant chestnuts
aped security, the tossing of a silver birch against their mass, impatient in the
littlest wind, brought warning. Dust clogged their leaves. The inner humming of
their quiet life became inaudible beneath the scream and shriek of clattering
traffic. They longed and prayed to enter the great Peace of the Forest yonder, but
they could not move. They knew, moreover, that the Forest with its august, deep
splendour [sic] despised and pitied them. They were a thing of artificial gardens,
and belonged to beds of flowers all forced to grow one way
(Blackwood 2002: 216)

The Forest is majestic compared to the single trees in their pitiful loneliness, covered in
the dust that the humans of civilization spread like pollen unto them. The latter are
monsters in the eyes of the Forest, some unholy experiment that should not exist naturally,
taken away from the peace of its forest home. Blackwood also indicates that the trees
trapped in civilization actively long for the forests, rather than the jails in which they
remain. He also implies that it is in part the progress of technology in the form of cars and
traffic that is the cause for the estrangement and exile of the trees from the messages
carried by the wind.

49

There exist many gulfs in the story, a fact which both of the Bittacys are eager to
repeat. The gulf between man and tree is the most pronounced one, but even more of
interest is the gulf between civilization and uncivilized nature. Throughout the story we
see both of the gulfs closing though the transformation of Mr. Bittacy as the Forests grasp
around him becomes increasingly stronger. At the same time we gain an insight on what
his wife feels and perceives during that time, and how her sense of religion and
civilization changes during the events. The first signs of Mr. Bittacy’s impending
departure from civilization do not go unnoticed by his wife. She recognizes that
something is not right during Sanderson’s first visit, but she cannot put her finger on it.
Finally, she sees the first signs: “He had neglected The Times for one thing, left off his
speckled waistcoats for another. He was absent-minded sometimes; showed vagueness in
practical details where hitherto he showed decision. And – he had begun to talk in his
sleep again” (Blackwood 2002: 221). These are of course all signs of a departure from
the customs of civilization: not dressing appropriately and not keeping up with the news
most notably. Being underdressed is something Mrs. Bittacy also notes about Sanderson.
She does not deem it important, but “she considered them symptoms of something a little
disordered” (Blackwood 2002: 220). She also compares his balloon tie to that of a
Frenchman’s, suggesting that his way of dressing connects in her mind to something
which is foreign and belongs to a different cultural category. It is also curious how she
regards his departure from the mansion: “With his removal, the world turned ordinary
again and safe. […] In the morning Mr. Sanderson had seemed ordinary enough. In his
town hat and gloves, as she saw him go, he seemed tame and unalarming” (Blackwood
2002: 240). Having properly dressed has changed Sanderson into an ordinary, civilized
person, and is thus tame and unalarming. The last adjectives confirm that his uncivilized
clothing and nature is something which raises emotions in Mrs. Bittacy.
During Sanderson’s visit, Mr. Bittacy begins to show symptoms of walking and
talking in his sleep, both of which his wife deems uncanny and dreadful. Like her
husband’s special infatuation with forests, this dread of the unconscious stems from the
couple’s time in India. Curiously, she describes sleep-talking as “the talking of the dead,
mere parody of a living voice, unnatural” (Blackwood 2002: 237). During the night time
episode, Mrs. Bittacy also notices how her husband’s eyes shine similarly to how
Sanderson’s eyes shone after being out in their garden and hearing the wind roaring in
the forest. Returning then from the edge of the forest, he declares “the wind had begun
roaring in the Forest . . . further out” (Blackwood 2002: 235). The roaring of the wind is
an ominous sign throughout the story, and it is the other similarity with the sleep-talking,

50

as it is the topic of choice for Mr. Bittacy: “They are roaring in the Forest further out . . .
and I . . . must go and see. […] They are needing me. They sent for me” (Blackwood
2002: 238). What becomes clear is that the trees, or rather the forest, are speaking through
the wind. It is also linked with sleeping, and further with unconsciousness.
As Mr. Bittacy’s transformation moves him further into the realm of plants we
also see how Mrs. Bittacy begins to see more treelike qualities in her husband, even
though he has not changed physically: “He moved with a restless, swaying motion that
somehow blanched her cheek and sent a miserable shivering down her back. It reminded
her of trees. His eyes were very bright” (Blackwood 2002: 256). Swaying is something
which is unusual in the context of movement, but it is not unheard of. However, it is often
a symptom related to some outer influence, e.g. inebriation or light-headedness. In the
case of intoxication or sleepwalking people tend to behave erratically. The
unpredictability is often something which causes others to stay away, or even feel fear
that something might happen from the person who is essentially considered uncivilized
through their behavior. The swaying of Mr. Bittacy is understood by Mrs. Bittacy in a
similar fashion: he is under the influence, though not by alcohol but the trees. As if
intoxicated, Mr. Bittacy now strays from that which is considered civilized through his
behavior.
Mrs. Bittacy exclaims that she is unhappy with the placement of their home, due
to its close proximity with the New Forest. Rather, she would have preferred an ordinary,
civilized location in a city or town. This may partially be a consequence of the infatuation
with trees that her husband exhumes, fearing that by being so close to the perimeter, the
border between his humanity may dwindle, as is seen happening throughout the latter
parts of the story. Parker argues that Mrs. Bittacy’s feelings about the matter are quite
universal and widespread:

Our unease with humans who settle in the wilderness is born of the idea that such
inhabitants are not distinct from their surrounding environment: if they are savage
and uncivilised, they are viewed as the consequences of a failure to maintain this
human-Nature dualism.
(Parker 2020: 270)

The last chapters of the story do accentuate Mr. Bittacy’s departure from civilization,
reinforcing the idea that he has left the human side of the dualism, embracing nature and

51

the forest. It emphasizes the idea that Parker gives, that inhabitants become a part of their
surroundings, melding into an indistinct part of a larger whole. Indistinctness is apparent
when the couple meets each other inside the Forest. It takes Mrs. Bittacy a considerable
while to notice her husband, who is as one with the trees, harmonious and serene. The
latter does not notice the irregular visitor, as he seems to be in total communion within
the Forest, barely noticing his wife even at their house. In the end, Mrs. Bittacy cannot
even feel joy near her husband as he attempts to reconciliate her, only sensing the husk
that is left of him beside her:

He whispered close to her ear. She felt his hand stroking her. His voice was soft
and very soothing. But only a part of him was there; only a part of him was
speaking; it was a half-emptied body that lay beside her and uttered these strange
sentences, even forcing her own singular choice of words. The horrible, dim
enchantment of the trees was close about them in the room – gnarled, ancient,
lonely trees of winter, whispering round the human life they loved.
(Blackwood 2002: 270)

The loss of civilization has made Mr. Bittacy hollow in the eyes of his wife, as she feels
essential parts of him have become lost.
An aspect of Mr. Bittacy’s transformation as the story progresses that is easily
overshadowed by his wife’s feelings, which are usually where the focus of the story and
the narrator are, is what he himself feels and experiences. Mrs. Bittacy becomes the
central character as the plot moves forward, while her husband moves further into the
background. Contrary to his wife, Mr. Bittacy seems to be at ease with the scenario that
is playing out in the story. Whereas Mrs. Bittacy attempts to turn away her husband from
the influence of the forest, Mr. Bittacy does the opposite, eagerly going into the woods
time upon time to care for it, and at the same time getting more and more lost within its
grasp. It is without doubt apparent that the transition between the human-nature boundary
is not a terrifying experience for Mr. Bittacy, nor something that he finds unnatural.
Parker observes that Mr. Bittacy becoming one with the forest is a unity between man
and an utterly alien nature, “where human and nonhuman are intermeshed in a way that
we simply do not understand – but in a way that challenges us” (Parker 2020: 134). The
utterly alien and strictly nonhuman nature of Blackwood’s New Forest is indeed
challenging, as are the moral implications behind Mr. Bittacy, which force the reader to
ponder who is right among the couple, and whether the decision made by Mrs. Bittacy to

52

finally lay down her arms and let her husband succumb to the forest in fact is the correct
one or not. It further raises the question whether Mr. Bittacy’s ending is a happy one or
not.
During the final night, Mrs. Bittacy experiences a hallucinatory dream where she
too merges with the vegetal. It is unclear, whether she is awake or not, but what she feels
is a nightmarish assault orchestrated by the trees of the forest:

She woke at night, finding it difficult to breathe. There seemed wet leaves pressed
against her mouth, and soft green tendrils clinging to her neck. Her feet were
heavy, half rooted, as it were, in deep, thick earth. Huge creepers stretched along
the whole of that black tunnel, feeling about her person for points where they
might fasten well, as ivy or the giant parasites of the Vegetable Kingdom settle
down on the trees themselves to sap their life and kill them.
(Blackwood 2002: 272)

It is difficult to believe this description as literal. Rather, it would seem to be a figurative
description of Mrs. Bittacy’s feelings as she is slowly losing her senses and her life with
it. Blackwood describes her state as “a dark confusion of the mind that was now becoming
almost permanent” (Blackwood 2002: 272). Thus, it seems that reality and dream are
becoming intertwined in these final moments, as she only waits for the reunification with
her husband in the afterlife: “The spiritual love that linked her to her husband was safe
from all attack. Later, in his good time they would merge together again because of it.
But, meanwhile, all of her that had kinship with the earth was slowly going” (Blackwood
2002: 271).
Blackwood often compares the trees of the New Forest with an army, creating an
organization which feels different from the spread-out agency that the forest naturally
holds. He especially describes them in terms of war as Mrs. Bittacy attempts to reclaim
the rights for her husband’s soul: “Their number was a host with endless reinforcements”
(Blackwood 2002: 255). As she enters the forest in search for her husband, the sense of
an opposing army grows stronger: “She realised that they gathered in an ever-growing
army, massed, herded, trooped, between her and the cottage, shutting off escape”
(Blackwood 2002: 257). The scale of the forest creates the illusion of rank upon rank of
soldiers taking the place of the fallen front line. The personified trees of the forest display
very human qualities as Mrs. Bittacy recounts their final victory over her for the rights to

53

her husband’s love. The forest becomes a large crowd, a host of warriors chanting their
victory all at once:

Alone in a shaking world, it seemed, she lay and listened. That storm interpreted
for her mind the climax. The Forest bellowed out its victory to the winds; the
winds in turn proclaimed it to the Night. The whole world knew of her complete
defeat, her loss, her little human pain. This was the roar and shout of victory that
she listened to. For unmistakably, the trees were shouting in the dark. There were
sounds, too, like the flapping of great sails, a thousand at a time, and sometimes
reports that resembled more than anything else the distant booming of enormous
drums. The trees stood up – the whole beleaguering host of them stood up – and
with the uproar of their million branches drummed the thundering message out
across the night. […] With trunks upright they raced leaping through the sky.
There was upheaval and adventure in the awful sound they made, and their cry
was like the cry of a sea that has broken through its gates and poured loose upon
the world. . . .
(Blackwood 2002: 273)

The trees are unmistakably and remarkably animated as they roar, shout, race, drum and
move about. Mrs. Bittacy again draws metaphors to the rising and moving of an
unstoppable and rebellious sea, her childhood memories reigniting. The forest in Mrs.
Bittacy’s description has become a host of raiders, descending upon the shores carried by
their great-sailed vessels, now surrounding the beleaguered cottage beside the New
Forest. Even in their victory, the trees are personified as uncivilized barbarians, only
concerned with touting out that the victory is indeed theirs.
The transformation of Mr. Bittacy is the culmination of ecoGothic in the story, as
the boundary between man and tree is transgressed. As has been discussed, it also blurs
the line between civilization and the uncivilized, as Mr. Bittacy loses the semblances of
human culture. His transformation brings up the question of ‘good’ versus ‘bad’ nature,
as described by Parker (2020), because Mr. Bittacy is undoubtedly moving to the
uncultivated side of the equation. As Parker (2020) also mentions, the forest is an idyllic
scenery for the one, yet it is also the frightening backdrop for the other, as is the case with
the Bittacys. The Gothic forest is truly conjured by the duality the reader confronts: on
the one hand, Mr. Bittacy is living his best life, while at the other, his wife is suffering in
the terror of unknowing. This weird element of the story, not knowing what we as the
audience are to believe in due to Blackwood’s clever alien nature, which he consciously
has left unexplained enough that we cannot completely grasp the meanings surrounding

54

it, creates a truly horrifying experience of realization at the Bittacys’ struggles. It is
arguably this tension created between the old couple that has kept it alive for generations
since its first writing.

55

8. Discussion and Conclusion

In this thesis, we have discussed how civilization and religion are tied to fear and
ecophobia in The Man Whom the Trees Loved by Algernon Blackwood. The aim was to
gain insight into how the concepts of civilization and religion are represented in the story,
how the characters relate to the concepts and how they relate to the fear and ecophobia of
the characters. We see that Mrs. Bittacy and Sanderson are on the opposite sides of the
ecophobia-biophilia spectrum, as was to be expected. Mr. Bittacy on the other hand has
a relatively complex relationship with nature and civilization, one which develops
throughout the story.
The difference between civilized and uncivilized nature is made clear by
Blackwood, highlighting the boundaries between the two in the form of the Lebanon
cedar. A clear friction is present between the two, which is seen affecting civilized nature
under the oppressive influence of the New Forest. We also see how civilization is
represented in the characters of the story, and how Mr. Bittacy and Mr. Sanderson deviate
from civilization throughout it. Mrs. Bittacy then plays the role of the civilized reporter,
who in the end is unable to affect the outcome of events. It is through her that we
experience the ecophobia that her anthropocentric Christian heritage entails upon
nonhuman agency, and how it is triggered by the unorthodox New Forest, which refuses
its traditional place, reaching outside of its boundaries. Most notably, it is through her
faith and her conviction of the Bible that her ecophobia manifests, as the scriptures form
the basis for her actions and her worldview.
We also see how Sanderson becomes a counterpart to the ecophobic relation to
nature that Mrs. Bittacy exhibits by being openly biophilic, representing the agencies that
she on the other hand cannot stand, nor understand. He openly suggests that nature has
agency, consciously provoking Mrs. Bittacy and planting seeds of suspicion about the
order of things as described in the Bible, feeding her with suggestions of the unknown.
Sanderson is also partly responsible for the transformation of her husband through the
attention to the trees that their discussion draws in, simultaneously attempting to describe
the phenomenon.
Mr. Bittacy shows us how frightful the transition away from civilization can be.
Though he himself shows no signs of regret nor fear as he moves closer to the vegetal,
we see the true horror of the situation through his wife, who comes to understand the

56

finality and hopelessness of the situation. The magnitude of the tragedy is manifold due
to the self-sacrificing nature of Mrs. Bittacy, who attempts to throw aside her own
prejudices in order to understand her husband and the vegetal menace she faces alone. In
the end, we see the would-be tragic heroine lose all hope and succumb as the boundaries
between civilization and uncivilized nature, the cedar of Lebanon, cracks under the
pressure of the winds from the New Forest.
The fate of the Bittacys is a gothic one as boundaries are transgressed left, right
and center. Mr. Bittacy transgresses the boundary between man and plant, becoming one
with the forest, as the iconic closing line of the novella tells us: “in the distance she heard
the roaring of the Forest further out. Her husband’s voice was in it” (Blackwood 2002:
274). While her husband is busy being cajoled by the trees, Mrs. Bittacy folds under the
immense pressure of the winds, the forest again transgressing its boundaries as the cedar
that acted as a protective agent has cracked and fallen. All of her fundamental principles
of the world have been shattered, even the faith that has been her ultimate support
throughout all her struggles runs out. The divine framework which she has believed in,
the order of things, especially the ordering of nature and the superiority of the human
species, has been proven wrong, all the while any divine guidance from her god is
nonexistent.
The fact that the ending leaves many questions unanswered also leaves some
question marks regarding civilization, and whether leaving it is a bad thing or not.
Considering how Mr. Bittacy perceives his departure from civilization remains
inadequately answered due to the vague nature of his character in the later stages of the
book. It blurs what he himself feels, whether he is overjoyed to leave civilization behind,
or if he possibly has some doubts about his future. The only definite answers for his case
are that he has left civilization behind him by taking tiny steps at a time. At the same time,
this is what highlights the tragedy of his wife Sophia, as she struggles with the same
questions, whether or not he can still be saved, or if what remains is the unification of
their souls in the afterlife.
There are still many different avenues left in The Man Whom the Trees Loved to
research. The psychological aspects of the slow separation that the Bittacys are
experiencing is almost completely left untouched. Civilization and its relation to nature
are themes that could also be researched in other stories by Blackwood, e.g. The Wendigo,
which also includes religious characters in the form of a priest-to-be, while at the same
time being at the mercy of utterly uncivilized nature, the pristine wilderness of backwoods

57

Canada. Overall, Blackwood’s progressive views on phenomena which were still in a
scientific gray zone during his time give birth to many interesting opportunities for further
scholarship on his fiction both within and outside of the ecocritical field.

Summary in Swedish – Svensk sammanfattning

“It’s only man that was made after His image, not shrubberies and things”:
Civilisation, religion och ekofobi i The Man Whom the Trees Loved av Algernon
Blackwood

Algernon Blackwood var en engelsk författare som främst var känd för sina övernaturliga
natur- och spökberättelser. Blackwood älskade naturen och tillbringade så mycket av sin
tid där som möjligt. För att komma naturen närmare reste han mycket runt i Europa. En
stor del av hans texter är självbiografiska eller har en stark koppling till Blackwoods egna
erfarenheter. Så är även fallet med The Man Whom the Trees Loved (övers. Mannen som
träden älskade). Trots sin evangeliskt-kristna uppväxt och sin tillhörighet i flera
teosofiska sällskap var Blackwood intresserad av mysticism. Det var i naturen han fann
sin andliga tillfredställning.
Syftet med den här avhandlingen är att ta reda på hur civilisation och
religion avbildas i The Man Whom the Trees Loved och huruvida huvudpersonernas rädsla
och ekofobi påverkas av dessa. Avhandlingen grundar sig på teorier inom ekokritik,
bland annat på den banbrytande hypotesen om ekofobi av Simon C. Estok (2009) och
Elizabeth Parkers (2020) sju teser om varför skogar skrämmer oss. Bakom båda teorierna
ligger tanken om att all materia runt omkring oss har handlingsförmåga.
Handlingsförmåga har traditionellt setts som något säreget för människor och andra djur,
vilket gör att det känns skrämmande ifall denna uppfattning bevisas felaktig. I det här
fallet kan handlingsförmågan knippas med den gotiska traditionen där gränser bryts
sönder och överskrids.
Skogar, civilisation och religion är alla förknippade med mänsklighetens historia.
Skogarna har traditionellt setts som ociviliserade och okristna platser. Av Parkers (2020)
sju teser om skogar är några av speciellt stor vikt för denna undersökning, nämligen
teserna som beskriver skogen som okristna rum som står i direkt konflikt med
civilisationen. Robert Pogue Harrison (1992) beskriver den kristna kyrkans relation till
skogen som problematisk, eftersom skogarna länge var ett ställe där okristen tro kunde
utövas utanför kyrkans räckhåll. Skogarna har alltså varit en plats för okristen trollkonst
och annan hednisk tro. Han menar att dessa traditioner, som är äldre än den kristna

59

kyrkan, har levt kvar i det kollektiva minnet och rentav hållits vid liv tack vare den kristna
kyrkans rädslor.
Många av kristendomens antropocentriska syner har sin början i bibeln. Bland
annat har växtriket ansetts vara mindre värt än mänskligheten bland annat på grund av
Noas ark, där växterna inte fick plats bland de tillvaratagna arterna. Mänskligheten har på
grund av denna uppfattade position av överlägsenhet tagit avstånd från växtligheten,
vilket har lett till det som Estok (2009) kallar för ekofobi: en känsla av rädsla och avsky
mot naturen utan någon förklarlig anledning.
The Man Whom the Trees Loved är en novell som utspelas i den nuvarande New
Forest-nationalparken i Hampshire i England. Berättelsens huvudpersoner är det gamla
paret David och Sophia Bittacy som bor i en stuga intill en stor skog. David är en
pensionerad skogsvårdare och har ett stort intresse för träd. Sophia däremot avskyr träd
och skogar på grund av den tid som paret spenderat i Indien, där David på grund av sitt
jobb var tvungen att vara ute i djungeln en längre tid åt gången. Under berättelsens gång
får paret besök av målaren Sanderson som har kommit för att måla av ett cederträd som
står i parets trädgård. Han är känd för sina trädmålningar som är kusligt verklighetstrogna
fast de inte ser ut exakt som träden de föreställer. Målningarna tycks avbilda något mera
än vad man kan se med bara ögat.
Sophia Bittacy påminner på många vis om Blackwoods mor, bland annat
på grund av hennes starka kristna tro samt tendens till ordagrann tolkning av bibeln. Den
ordagranna tolkningen av bibeln är problematisk, eftersom en del av dess texter lämnar
utrymme för tolkning. Hennes kristna tro påverkar starkt hur hon ser på världen. Enligt
henne har växtligheten en mycket lägre rang än människorna, bland annat på grund av att
de inte har en själ och därmed inte lever på samma sätt som människor. Detta påverkar
hennes känslor då det visar sig att skogen som gränsar till hennes gård har handlingskraft
och dessutom använder den. Då träden börjar påverka hennes man David står Sophia inför
en konflikt. Hennes kristna tro har gett henne verktyg att bekämpa onda makter, men
enligt hennes syn är träden inte levande varelser, vilket gör att de inte heller kan anses
vara onda. Denna konflikt är central i berättelsen.
Sanderson är en underlig karaktär eftersom han har ett djupt och mystiskt
förhållande till träden och kan väldigt mycket om dem, trots att hans kunskap är självlärd.
Han lyckas väcka ett ömsesidigt förhållande mellan David och träden. Sophia är svårare
att övertala och står bakom sin tro om att träden varken lever eller har en själ. Hon

försöker slå tillbaka genom att säga att träden inte andas, till vilket Sanderson svarar att
de visst gör det, utöver vilket de dessutom rör sig, äter och kanske till och med tänker.
Han menar även att goda krafter strävar efter att förena medan onda krafter bryter sönder.
Därtill klassar han träden som goda eftersom de försöker förenas med det de älskar.
Sandersons roll i berättelsen är att visa hur ekofobisk Sophia är samt väcka ett förhållande
mellan David och träden.
Cederträdet på parets gård har en stor betydelse i berättelsen eftersom den
skyddar paret från skogens krafter. Skogen försöker vinna över David medan cedern
också tävlar om Davids uppmärksamhet. Sanderson förklarar att cedern är vilse eftersom
den är ensam och långt borta från sina syskon i Libanon. Cedern tävlar därför emot skogen
och försöker vinna till sig uppmärksamhet, vilket tydliggörs genom dess gradvisa förfall
under berättelsens lopp. Detta är betydelsefullt på grund av cederns naturliga
motståndskraft vilken är högre än hos andra träd. Cedern är också betydelsefull eftersom
den fysiskt står mellan civilisationen och den ociviliserade skogen och symboliserar
därmed kampen mellan dessa två. Samtidigt som skogen slutligen lyckas ta över David
ser Sophia hur cedern har fallit. Detta symboliserar skogens vinst.
Enligt Blackwood längtar städernas naturobjekt efter sina syskon i skogen.
Han anser att den enda rätta naturen är den vilda och att naturobjekten i städerna är
onaturliga. Under berättelsen gång förflyttar sig David bort från civilisationen. Detta
fenomen syns på många sätt, bland annat glömmer han att läsa dagstidningen och att klä
på sig sin väst. Han börjar även röra sig på ett svajande, trädlikt sätt. Davids
transformation under berättelsens gång befinner sig i en moralisk gråzon eftersom det är
svårt att skilja åt det goda och det onda. David själv verkar vara lugn och strider inte emot
träden, medan hans fru aktivt kämpar emot, men misslyckas. Som läsare är det svårt att
avgöra vilkendera sida och åsikt man själv vill stå bakom.
Slutligen kan det sägas att Sophia Bittacy agerar ekofobiskt på grund av sin
tro. Det är genom sin tro som hon försöker rädda sin man, vilket i slutet leder till att hon
blir övergiven av sin gud. Skogen och civilisationen spelar varandras motsatser i
berättelsen, något som är synligt i David Bittacys transformation. Samtidigt symboliserar
cederträdet den civiliserade naturens kamp mot den stora ociviliserade skogen.
