Abstract
This thesis focuses on modelling and simulation of different firing conditions in
cowpers that are a part of a steelmaking process. The cowpers are regenerative heat
exchangers that preheat the blast air into the blast furnace. The model is fitted to match
process data with the nonlinear least-squares method. Mass- and energy balances are
produced and compared to actual process data to ensure that the model predicts the
process conditions appropriately. Flue gas measurements are used for the comparison.
The challenge in the thesis was to find the different firing conditions for the individual
cowpers due to the joint flue gas channel and measurements in the common chimney.
The aim is to reach more efficient firing conditions in cowpers by optimizing the firing
conditions. The model developed in this work considers input variables such as fuel
and combustion air flow rate and their composition. The model calculates the flame
temperature in the cowper based on the input variables, and different flame
temperatures can be obtained by adjusting these values. Past data was used to fit the
model since the process experiences continuous changes. The results of the analysis
yield a better understanding of the combustion process.
Simulations of different firing conditions were undertaken, and a theoretical model for
“optimal” flame temperatures in the cowpers was developed. A test period was
conducted based on the model, where excess air in the process was decreased. The
results showed that the model overpredicted the flame temperature, and the measured
dome temperature, against which the model is fitted, did not show a significant
temperature increase. This mismatch should be solved before other tests could be
conducted. The mismatch is expected to result from a sum of several unmeasured
variables and variables that were seldom measured, which were assumed to be constant
between the measurements in the model. The most significant variable was the
composition of a fuel gas, which was found to be frequently changing. This indicated
that more frequent measurements should be conducted on process variables to obtain
a better view of the actual circumstances in the process.

1 Introduction
Iron and steel have been produced for centuries. The industrial revolution was fueled
by steel, and it remains a crucial part of modern industrialized economies. Steel
products are part of our daily life; steel is used in construction, vehicles, engines,
machines, and numerous other applications. (Geerdes, Chaigneau & Lingiardi, 2020)
Steel is produced in two ways: the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF)
process and the electric arc furnace (EAF) process. The techniques differ in the types
of produced products, as well as the use of raw materials. The BF-BOF process uses
coal and coke as sources of energy and reductants while using sinter, pellets, and lump
ore as the iron-bearing components. In contrast, the electric arc process uses electric
energy to melt scrap iron or direct reduced iron (DRI). The BF-BOF process is the
primary source of steel production worldwide, supplying about 75% of all steel.
(Geerdes, Chaigneau & Lingiardi, 2020)
The SSAB plant in Raahe has two blast furnaces, the first of which started producing
iron in 1964. The Raahe plant produces heavy steel plates and strip products. (SSAB,
2021)
Further information about the working principles of blast furnaces and the hot stoves
that preheat the blast air used in the blast furnace is found in sections 1.1 and 1.2.

1.1 Blast furnace
The blast furnace is a tall, vertical shaft furnace that reduces iron from its oxide ores
using carbon, mainly coke, as fuel. However, the primary purpose of coke in the
process is to act as a reducing agent. The produced iron from a blast furnace is often
called “pig iron” when it is in solid-state and “hot metal” when it is in the liquid state,
and it is in the liquid state when it exits the process, making refining to steel easier.
Figure 1 shows a schematic of a blast furnace and the inflows and outflows of material
in the process. The main objective of a blast furnace is to provide a continuous steady
flow of hot metal to the steel shop. A critical parameter for constant and high-quality
output is maintaining temperatures higher than 1400 °C, keeping the material in a
molten state when tapped out from the process. (Peacey, Davenport, 2016)

The blast furnace is filled with coke and iron ore-containing burden from the top of
the furnace. Down at the tuyeres, heat and process gas are generated by the gasification
of coke and coal with the help of hot blast heated in cowpers (also called hot stoves).
In this process, the oxygen in the blast reacts with carbon to produce gaseous carbon
monoxide at high temperatures (1900–2300 °C). Coke and injected pulverized coal are
combusted in the process, and the hot gas is used to reduce and melt the ferrous burden.
The coke consumption and burden melting create voids, and the burden descends by
gravity. (Geerdes, Chaigneau & Lingiardi, 2020)
The scorching gas ascends through the blast furnace and has several vital functions
throughout the ascension. It heats the coke in the bosh area, which is the hottest part

of the furnace where the reaction between coke and oxygen occurs. It melts the iron
ores in the burden and creates voids when the iron ores melt. The ascending hot gas
heats the descending material in the shaft zone of the furnace. Oxygen is also removed
from the iron burden through reactions. The hot gas passes through the furnace in 5–
10 seconds, and it goes from 1900–2300 °C in the lower furnace to 100–200 °C in the
upper furnace. Its composition also changes throughout the process due to chemical
reactions in the different zones of the furnace. (Geerdes, Chaigneau & Lingiardi, 2020)
The different zones inside a blast furnace are illustrated in Figure 2. (Yang, Choi &
Chung, 2009)

1.2 Cowpers
Cowpers (or hot stoves) are counter-current regenerative heat exchangers used for
preheating the combustion air for the blast furnace. The preheated combustion air is
also known as blast. The preheated air enables higher reaction temperatures and less
fuel usage in the blast furnace due to the thermal energy it provides. (Kimura, Takatani
& Otsu, 2010)
The cowpers consist of a burner and a heat-storing matrix, also called checkerwork. In
the “charging phase,” fuel is combusted with sufficient quantities of air, giving rise to
hot flue gases that transfer heat to the checkerwork. The fuel used for the combustion
process is blast furnace top gas, possibly combined with coke-oven gas. The heat is
released by the hot flue gas as it passes through the heat-storing matrix. When the
checkerwork has absorbed enough heat, the fuel and combustion air inflow is shut off
and the process is reversed. Pressurized oxygen-enriched air is passed through the
checkerwork in the opposite direction and absorbs stored heat from the checkerwork.
This air is then blown into the blast furnace as combustion air, called blast. In this way,
very high blast temperatures can be reached at a lower cost than heating the process
with coal within the blast furnace. (Zhong, Liu & Wang, 2004)
These regenerative heat exchangers are used to obtain higher blast temperatures (900–
1300 °C) than normal recuperators can reach. The working principle is the same, i.e.,
two fluids exchange heat, but the difference is that in regular heat exchangers the hot
and cold fluids pass through different but adjacent channels simultaneously, whereas
in regenerative heat exchangers the two fluids pass through the same channels in the
matrix alternately. (Willmott, 2011)
An operation cycle consists of consecutive hot and cold periods, also known as the
heating and blast periods, and the necessary procedures for the reversals. After several
such cycles, the temperature profile of a cycle will settle to be identical to the previous
one. When this state is reached, the regenerative heat exchanger is said to have reached
“cyclic equilibrium” or “periodic steady-state”. If a change is made in the process in
one or more process parameters, such as the flow rate and the entrance temperature of
the fluid for the hot or cold periods, or the duration of the periods, the regenerative
heat exchanger has to undergo several subsequent cycles before the new equilibrium

4

is reached. The cowper itself is cylindrically shaped and is approximately 30 m in
height and 10 m in diameter. Figure 3 shows a schematic of a cowper. (Willmott,
2011)

Figure 3 Schematic of a cowper. (Willmott, 2011)

The checkerwork matrix in the cowper is fitted with fireproof refractories or ceramic
materials of special quality to ensure that the material can withstand the effects of
corrosive materials entrained in the hot gas. The packing in a cowper is frequently
zoned, where the materials at the top of the checkerwork can withstand high
temperatures and their effects. Further down in the cowper, materials that can stand
high compressive loads are used, e.g., silica brick. (Willmott, 2011)
The shape of the checkerwork matrix can vary based on the application of the
regenerative heat exchanger. The flue gases in cowpers are scorching but relatively
clean, and a hexagonal shape of bricks is commonly used. The hexagon creates
passages with a width of about 50 mm. The passages can be found in both the body of
the brick and in the corners, so when the checkerwork is installed in layers, uniformly
distributed tubular-shaped channels are formed through which the gases can pass. This
5

Janne Tiala

____________________________________________________________________
design is called the “Freyn checkerwork” and is illustrated in Figure 4. (Willmott,
2011)

Figure 4 Schematic of Freyn checkerwork design. (Willmott, 2011)

The BF process requires a continuous flow of hot blast, which is generated in the
cowpers. One cowper can only supply heat to a limited amount of hot blast until the
stored heat in the checkerwork is drained and becomes insufficient for maintaining the
high temperature of the hot blast. Therefore, three or four cowpers are needed for a
continuous flow of hot blast. Most of the BF processes use three cowpers, where one
of the three is on blast, and the other two are heating. Figure 6 shows a schematic of
the cowper heating cycle, where the first two cowpers are on heating (combusting fuel
gas), and the third cowper is on blast (providing hot blast to the BF). (Zetterholm et
al., 2015)
The heating and blast periods are separated by a change-over period where the cowper
switches its operation mode. This period includes regulation of the valves that allow
the flows of the combustion air and fuel gas into the cowper, purging the flue gases

and pressurizing the cowper when it is switched from heating to blast mode, and
releasing the pressure when the cowper switches from blast to heating mode. Figure 5
describes a typical operation sequence of one complete cycle in a three-cowper system.
(Shaliha, 2020)

Figure 5 Ordinary operation sequence of one complete cycle in a three-cowper system. (Shaliha, 2020)

At SSAB Raahe, the heating cycle for a cowper is 90 minutes, after which the cowper
is switched on blast for 45 minutes. It means that two separate cowpers are on heating
simultaneously for 45 minutes, as seen in Figure 5 by comparing the orange fields.
(These 45 minutes of simultaneous heating can be seen in Figure 9 as the period
between the highest peaks; the figure is discussed later in detail.)

2 Theory
2.1 Background
SSAB Raahe has two blast furnaces and three cowpers for each furnace. Each furnace
has its own chimney, where all the flue gases from its process flow out. In 2020,
measurement equipment was installed in both chimneys to provide more data on the
outflowing flue gas. The new measurements were SOx, NOx, temperature, pressure,
particle concentration, CO, H2O, O2, and flow measurement. Later, the flow
measurement turned out to be quite unreliable due to gas turbulence or non-uniform
flow over the chimney cross-section. (Mattila, 2021)
The automation system of a cowper receives data from the fuel and combustion air
flow measurements and the volume fraction of oxygen in the flue gas, to which a target
value can be set. The airflow of a single cowper is controlled by adjusting the speed
of a combustion air fan, which is based on the measurement of the residual O2 in the
flue gas. The blast furnace gas is directed to the burner through pressure and flow
control valves. A limit value can be set to the pressure control, which the automation
tries to comply with. The flow control valve has an upper limit value, which monitors
overflow, and if overflow occurs, the valve tries to compensate for it. The main
pressure of the blast furnace gas is sometimes insufficient, which makes the control
valves stay 100% open, and only sudden pressure changes in the blast furnace gas
might cause the control valves to react. This happens with a slight delay. The effect of
pressure changes in the blast furnace gas is seen in the combustion reaction, O2-rest in
the flue gas, and the CO measurements in the chimney. Every cowper has an O2
measurement placed in the flue gas line before the joint flue gas channel. They also
have a common oxygen measurement in the chimney. The individual oxygen
measurements may be disturbed by the flue gas flows from the other cowpers, e.g.,
when large amounts of gas are introduced into the common channel. (Mattila, 2021)
Other unmeasured gas flows directed to the flue gas canal are the ignition gas, the
pressure relief airflow after a cowper has been on blast mode, and the cold blast
through the snort valve. The ignition gas ignites the flame at the beginning of a
cowper’s heating period. The ignition phase also has a combustion airflow that is not
measured; it comes from a different place than the combustion air during steady
9

heating. When the heating period is over, the cowper is switched to blast. The cowper
is pressurized with oxygen-enriched air up to 2.9 bar gauge during the blast period,
and this overpressure is then released into the flue gas channel. This sequence is also
called “flushing” and is described in detail in section 3.1. The snort valve for the blast
furnace directs pressurized blast into the flue gas channel in the case of restriction
situations in the blast furnace. The function of the snort valve is better described in
section 3.3. (Mattila, 2021)
The main objective of this thesis is to find appropriate combustion circumstances to
reach maximal flue gas temperatures based on available data. Mass and energy balance
calculations are needed for this, and their documentation can be found later in this
thesis.

2.2 Calculation methods
The optimization of the cowper-specific adiabatic flame temperature is done by
finding the optimal air-to-fuel ratio. Each cowper has its best solution based on the
condition of the burner. Different wear down in the burners causes various issues, such
as deviated flows of air and fuel, which affect efficient mixing and contribute to
inefficient or incomplete combustion. It causes some carbon monoxide in the fuel to
remain uncombusted in the flue gas, even if the stoichiometric need for oxygen for the
reaction is exceeded.
The maximum adiabatic flame temperature is obtained by balancing air and fuel flows
on an optimal level. A model for calculating the adiabatic flame temperature was
developed based on a combination of molar and energy balances for the flame region.
The flame temperature is not measured but should correlate with the dome temperature
of the cowper.
To replicate the actual combustion conditions, the nonlinear least-squares method was
used to fit the model’s results to the measurements by minimizing the sum of the root
square error

3 Mass balance
The mass balance is constructed based on data of inflowing fuel and air. Based on the
law of preservation of matter, everything that flows into a process also flows out of
the process if accumulation terms are neglected (Comstock, 1908). In this case, the
inflow of components includes fuel and combustion air, and the outflow consists of
flue gas according to the mass balance
𝑚̇𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 + 𝑚̇𝑎𝑖𝑟 = 𝑚̇𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑔𝑎𝑠

(3.1)

Blast furnace 1 (BF1) in SSAB Raahe uses only blast furnace gas as fuel, whereas blast
furnace 2 (BF2) uses both blast furnace gas and coke oven gas as fuel. The blast
furnace gas consists of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, nitrogen, and
water vapor. Coke oven gas consists of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, ethylene,
ethane, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. The combustion air is, for simplicity, taken to
consist of nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor.
According to the reactions below, the oxygen in the air will react with the
hydrocarbons in the fuel and create water and carbon dioxide. Under ideal conditions,
the flue gas will contain only carbon dioxide and water from the reaction and nitrogen,
which is inert and, therefore, not reactive. Since ideal conditions are unreachable, some
components will remain uncombusted and flow out in the flue gas even if oxygen
levels would be sufficient for complete combustion.

The above reactions are the starting point for the material balances for the two regions
depicted in Figure 7.

al., 2015).

SSAB Raahe measures various variables in both inflowing and outflowing materials,
which are used to validate the calculated values. Vital measurements for this project
are oxygen, carbon monoxide, and water content in the flue gas. Other measurement
data were also crucial for modelling the process but will not be mentioned further in
this thesis.

3.1 Validation of calculations
To make the calculations more consistent, the mass balance calculations were
converted into molar balances. The calculation is done by first considering the ideal
combustion of components and the amount of air needed for complete combustion.
The net reaction of the components that participate in the combustion reactions can
thus be expressed as

where a certain amount of residual oxygen and only partially combusted carbon exist
in the flue gas.
Given information about the feed flow of fuel gases and combustion air to the cowpers
and an expression (or assumption) concerning the residual CO in the flue gas from the
individual cowpers. The molar balances can be used to calculate the flows of species
after the individual cowpers and in the chimney, where the flue gas flows from the
different cowpers are combined.
The data sets in the thesis are primarily from late May 2021 and verified with data
from earlier periods of the same month. The data for oxygen-, water- and carbon
monoxide amounts in the flue gas is mainly studied from this period, and the model is
tuned to fit the data.
For the purpose of illustration, we here focus on a short, approximately one-day, period
in late May 2021 for BF2, with results depicted in Figure 9. In order to get a better
understanding of the flue gas flows from the individual cowpers, the fuel gas flows to
the individual cowpers have been depicted in the lower part of the figure: this provides
a view of the rather complex and varying contributions to the total flue gas flow that
exits through the chimney. Under the assumptions that CO amounts in the flue gas are
dependent on the excess air amount in the combustion, the flow rate of residual oxygen
in the chimney (balance boundary II in Figure 7) depicted by the orange line in Figure
9 was obtained based on the measurement. Comparing this with the blue line, which
shows the flow rate based on the measured oxygen levels in the chimney, reveals a
substantial mismatch.
Using all the given data, it is seen that the calculations and measurements for the
residual O2 in the flue gas do not match. It is also observed that oxygen level during
the steady heating period (the time between large peaks) is considerably lower than
the actual measurements in the chimney indicate.

13

The total flue gas flow naturally varies along the cowper cycle (see Figure 5). To
provide a view of the changes in the total flow, the blue line in Figure 8 depicts it for
a 10-hour period, showing that the flow basically assumes two distinct values. The
individual flows from the cowpers are shown in orange, yellow and gray.

data.

____________________________________________________________________
3.1.1 Flushing
One matter to note in Figure 9 is that large spikes in the oxygen flow occur due to the
“flushing” of the cowpers. This flushing occurs as the pressurized oxygen-enriched air
is released into the flue gas canal after a cowper has been on blast mode. The cowpers
need to be depressurized to (practically) ambient pressure from approximately 2 bar
overpressure that prevails during the on-blast period. Thus, an air amount of
approximately twice the cowper’s volume will flow out through the flue gas channel
within the time of flushing. Detailed information about this phase is not available in
the automation system, so instead a simplified treatment is adopted here to at least
quantitatively consider the effect of the flushing.
As the pressure is lowered from about 3.5 bar to 1 bar (absolute), and assuming that
the temperature of the air is constant, the ideal gas law
𝑝𝑉 = 𝑛𝑅𝑇

(3.3)

𝑝1 𝑉1 = 𝑝2 𝑉2

(3.4)

gives

since the molar amount is preserved. With p1 = 3.5 bar and an approximated air volume
of V1 = 600 m3 inside the cowper, we get p2 = 1 bar
𝑉2 =

𝑝1 𝑉1
𝑝2

=

3.5 𝑏𝑎𝑟∙600 𝑚3
1 𝑏𝑎𝑟

= 2100 𝑚3

(3.5)

The excess air that will flow out of the cowper will be V2 – V1 = 1500 m3.
Therefore, the amount of air that will flow out from the cowper during flushing will
be
𝑛𝑎𝑖𝑟 =

1500 𝑚3
𝑚3
𝑚𝑜𝑙

0.0224

= 66964 𝑚𝑜𝑙 ≈ 66.9 𝑘𝑚𝑜𝑙

(3.6)

While regular air consists of approximately 79% of N2 and 21% of O2, the oxygenenriched blast air can be assumed to consist of 28% of O2, so the amount of flushed
oxygen is
𝑛𝑂2 = 𝑛𝑎𝑖𝑟 ∙ 0.28 ≈ 19 𝑘𝑚𝑜𝑙

(3.7)

15

Janne Tiala

____________________________________________________________________
To assess the delay between the outflow of flushing air and the measurements in the
stacks, the flow rate and geometry of the channels should be considered.
The distance from the cowpers to the chimney is about 20 m, 30 m and, 40 m for
cowpers 22, 23 and 24, respectively. With a cross-sectional area of the channel of A = 4
m2, the volume of the flue gas channel, Vchan, for each cowper is thus 80 m3, 120 m3
and, 160 m3, respectively. The time for the gas to reach the chimney can thus be
estimated
𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛 =

𝑉𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛
𝑤∙𝐴

(3.8)

if the gas velocity is assumed. For the moderate velocity estimate of w = 3 m/s, the
time for the flushing air to reach the chimney for cowpers C22, C23 and, C24 will be
6.5 s, 10 s and, 13.5 s. Considering these short times and the fact that the above
calculation simply neglects the simultaneous flue gas flow from the cowper on-gas,
the delay in the measurements must be considered minor. However, the air will not
flow out at a constant rate. The flow rate will decrease with time as the over-pressure
decreases. To consider the effect of the depressurization of the cowper in a simplified
way, the outflow of the oxygen-enriched air was modelled by an expression where the
oxygen is 28%. For the quantities mentioned above and a flushing period of 40 seconds,
the oxygen outflow depicted in Figure 10 was obtained.

3.1.2 Water content in the flue gas
The water content in both air and blast furnace gas is calculated using the Arden Buck
equation, from which the vapor pressure is obtained. The vapor pressure is further
divided with the ambient pressure to reach NTP conditions used in calculations. This
way, a dimensionless vapor pressure fraction is received, and based on the ideal gas
law, this fraction also represents the volume fraction of water in the fuel and air. (Buck,
1981) The equation is
𝑃𝑠 (𝑇) = 6.1121 exp ((18.678 −

𝑇−273.15 𝐾
234.5 𝐾

)(

𝑇−273.15 𝐾
𝑇−16 𝐾

)) 𝑘𝑃𝑎

(3.9)

By dividing this saturation vapor pressure with the ambient pressure, the desired
pressure fraction is obtained, which also is the volume fraction of water vapor, and can
be used in further calculations. The water vapor fraction in the air is thus given by
𝑃

𝑠
𝑐𝐻2 𝑂 = 101.325
𝑘𝑃𝑎

(3.10)

since it is not likely that the ambient air is saturated by water vapor, a specific relative
air humidity may be assumed.
Assuming relative air and blast furnace gas humidities of 70% and 100%, the resulting
molar flows of water in the flue gas in the chimney are depicted in Figure 11, where
the blue line represents the measured values and the orange the calculated values. The
variables are seen to match quite well, even though the actual air humidity is likely to
change depending on the ambient conditions. Another variable that affects the water
amount in the flue gas to a greater extent is the liquid water content in the fuel. If the
fuel gas is saturated by moisture, it may contain some water droplets. However, this
has not been considered in the calculations of the thesis.

Figure 11 Measured (blue) vs. calculated (orange) water vapor levels in the chimney.

The mass balance should be closed and validated before the study progresses to use
the energy balance, since the mass balance is the foundation for further calculations:
an incorrect mass balance propagates incorrect values to the energy balance. Therefore,
the reason for errors in the mass balance must be found before the next phase in the
calculations.

3.2 Air amount
A hypothesis on the source of errors in the oxygen balance was that the combustion
air measurements might be invalid or strongly inaccurate, since they had been altered
in earlier studies at the plant. By increasing the air supply, the measured residual O2 in
the flue gas can be reproduced. However, a remaining problem was that for periods
when only one cowper is on heating, i.e., when a new cowper is switched to be on blast
and the one that was on blast is switched to heating, the residual O2 in the flue gas
descends clearly below the measured values. Figure 12, which illustrates the revised
calculated oxygen flow in the chimney (orange line) after increasing the flow of
combustion air, shows the mismatch with the measured flow (blue line) at the cowper
switching events.

Figure 12 Measured (blue) and simulated (orange) oxygen flow rates in the chimney based on data with
adjusted amounts of combustion air.

Furthermore, this approach indicates that the measured combustion air flows would be
10–15 % too low, which seems unlikely. In addition, such an increase in the
combustion air flows results in considerably lower flame temperature. The calculated
adiabatic flame temperature can be seen in Figures 13-15, where the blue line indicates
the measured dome temperature, and the calculated flame temperatures are indicated
by orange.

In summary, it is considered unlikely that the root cause of the mismatch in the residual
oxygen in the chimney is an error in the reported supply of combustion air to the
cowpers. However, the analysis of this option led to some new and interesting findings.
While contemplating on possible explanations for the deviation in flue gas residual
oxygen, some inconsistency was found in the data. The combustion air amounts that
in the system were claimed to be reported at NTP conditions were found to be
temperature and pressure dependent. This error was corrected and the corresponding
procedures at the automation system were updated. It should be noted that these errors
were corrected before the data was extracted to be used in the studies and examples of
the present thesis.

3.3 Leakage
Leakages in the process are possible, or even likely, as the exhaust channel is
occasionally used to vent other gases. It is possible is that a flue gas valve or the
pressure relief valve would leak when the cowper is on blast and is pressurized. Since
the pressure in the cowper exceeds 3 bar and the valve diameters are about 1 meter,
small leakages can easily occur. The flue gas valve seals off the passage from the
cowper to the flue gas canal, whereas the pressure release valve is used to depressurize
the cowper after being switched off from the blast. To study a possible leakage, these
two alternative error sources are for simplicity modelled in the same way. The leakage
will only be referred to as a “flue gas valve leak” in the forthcoming analysis. Other
valves that may leak are the cold air valves, also known as blast air valves. These
valves may leak air into the cowper when it is on heating.
Different flows were adjusted to match the measured and calculated values because
when the residual O2 in the flue gas matches the measured value, also other values
should agree. Figure 16 shows a simulation where only the flue gas valve is modelled
to be leaking when the cowper is pressurized and on blast. In this case, the residual O2
in the flue gas matches the measured values when two cowpers are on heating mode
simultaneously. Still, an apparent mismatch can be seen when only one cowper is on
heating, and the calculated values are elevated momentarily. The red arrows indicate
the momentary elevation in Figure 16.

21

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
To compensate for this occasional deviation, a cold air valve leakage scenario is added
to the calculations. These cold air valves or blast air valves are closed during the
heating process of the cowper and may, therefore, leak during such periods. The results
of this simulation are seen in Figure 17, where the measured and calculated O2 flows
in the flue gas match relatively well.
Since a constant leakage from all three cowpers simultaneously would be unlikely, a
simulation of cowper-specific leakages was also undertaken by adjusting the
individual leakages until a good match between the simulated and measured residual
oxygen flows was achieved. The best match was obtained with a similar leakage flow
of about 5 kNm3/h. Since the “optimal” value is almost the same regardless of the
cowper, one may presume that the root cause is something else. This is why a so-called
“snort valve” leakage is simulated, as explained below.
The snort valve is used for redirecting the pressurized cold blast air into the flue gas
channel in case of malfunction or severe disturbances. The use of the snort valve is a
fast way to reduce a possible negative impact of the blast in the downstream channels
or in the blast furnace. Another situation where the snort valve is used is when the
production is restricted in the blast furnace and the blast air has to be redirected rapidly.
However, the usage of this valve is rare. Still, a continuous leak through the valve is
possible and, in this case, actually a probable explanation for the mismatch in the
residual oxygen levels observed in the chimney. Figure 18 shows a simulated scenario
where only one cowper is modelled to be leaking during both the heating and blast
periods. Simulations for a snort valve leakage give almost identical flows as if only
one cowper would leak continuously, and Figure 18 can also be showcased as to be
the snort valve model.

The “optimal” leakage flows for the different error scenarios studied are reported in
Table 1 and Table 2. The values in Table 1 concern leakages in each cowper
simultaneously, while the values in Table 2 are for scenarios where only one cowper
is leaking. The snort valve leakage is the same for all three cowpers and is modelled
to be constant through time. It should be pointed out that even though some offset in
the O2 values remains after introducing these corrective actions, the mismatch between
the simulated and measured flows is minor, considering the sizeable total flow of the
gases in the chimney.

3.4 Mass balance validation
The water balance for the system was also analyzed, but substantial deviations between
the simulated and measured water flow rates were not observed. As exemplified in
Figure 19, the calculated H2O flow with the flue gas matches the measured one
relatively well. A possible reason for the (small) discrepancy is changes in both the
ambient air humidity and moisture in the blast furnace gas since the calculated flow is
based on constant relative humidity.

Figure 19 Measured (blue) and simulated (orange) H2O flows in the chimney during a one-day period.

The previous section introduced four different scenarios of possible leaks of air in the
process. A leakage through the flue gas channel valves does not match the measured
values and can thereby be ruled out. By adding a leaking cold air valve, the observed
residual oxygen levels could be matched, as indicated in Figure 17 and Figure 18.
However, such a leakage inside the cowper would lower the flame temperature since
excess air would be present in the combustion process. The dome temperature
measurements speak against this explanation. Thereby the models with simultaneously
leaking flue gas and cold air valves can also be ruled out. This means that the snort
valve leak seems a likely explanation, further supported by the fact that the valve is
rarely used. The reconstructed continuous and constant air leakage of approximately

25

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
5.5 kNm3/h also indicates that the leakage originates from only one source instead of
several.
In the future, it is recommended to check where the leakage comes from and if/why
the valve is leaking. Cowpers 22 and 24 are operated by manually retrieved control
values and are not directly affected by the residual O2 measurements in the chimney
since the measurement only shows what has happened in the process. Cowper 23 is
today controlled based on the residual oxygen un its outlet channel and is thus neither
dependent on the main channel nor the chimney conditions. A solution would be to
upgrade the automation of cowpers 22 and 24 so also they are controlled based on their
individual residual oxygen measurements. This, however, can be challenging due to
delay and illogicality in the individual O2 measurements in C22 and C24. The
individual measurements need improvement and validation in order to be taken to
adjust the automation circuit.

3.5 Non-ideal combustion
Ideal combustion, where all the fuel components react completely, can only be
achieved in theory when the excess air factor is 𝜆 ≥ 1: the air factor is obtained by
dividing the real air inflow with the theoretical airflow needed for the complete
combustion of the fuel components, i.e.,
𝜆 = 𝑛̇

𝑛̇ 𝑎𝑖𝑟
𝑎𝑖𝑟,𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑙

(3.11)

If λ < 1, the inflow of air into the process is insufficient, so some of the fuel components
will remain uncombusted and flow out with the flue gas. This situation is not desirable
because the uncombusted components keep their reaction heat and therefore waste
energy.
If λ > 1, there is more air in the process than what is theoretically needed. This situation
is desired in reality, since no process can operate at λ = 1 without some uncombusted
fuel. This is due to several different complications, one of which is sufficient mixing
of the fuel and combustion air so that everything would react. Even if a λ = 1 may not
be the optimal condition for combustion, one should stay as close to this as possible to

26

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
minimize the cooling effect of additional air. In practice, an optimal excess air factor
exists for every process.
The cowpers in Raahe are operated at excess air factors between 1.0 and 1.2, depending
on several process parameters. Even if the process has sufficient air for complete
combustion of the fuel, some components still remain uncombusted. Measurements of
the carbon monoxide content in the flue gas have lately been realized in the process.
This enables the tracking of the combustion in the different cowpers. Large amounts
of CO in the flue gas indicate an insufficient amount of air in the process, while low
values of CO indicate a sufficient amount of air for the combustion process. Low CO
amounts usually result in lower flame temperatures since too much excess air cools
the gases. This can also be observed as more significant amounts of oxygen in the flue
gas.
One of the difficulties is to find the optimal excess air ratio λ for each cowper, where
the amount of CO and excess O2 present in the flue gas would be minimal, and the
adiabatic flame temperature for each cowper would be as high as possible.
3.5.1 Carbon monoxide
By determining how much of the fuel remains uncombusted at different excess air
values, conclusions about the combustion can be drawn. The measured carbon
monoxide content in the flue gas is here used to describe the combustion quality. A
challenge is to find the appropriate level of excess oxygen for each cowper. This task
is difficult since the CO measurements are made on the gas in the chimney, where the
flue gases of all three cowpers go. The carbon monoxide amount in the flue gas is
measured as a concentration and is converted to a molar flow to facilitate the balance
calculations.
The residual CO in the flue gas is heavily dependent on the excess air in the process.
Insufficient air supply causes higher levels of CO, while larger quantities of excess air
decrease the CO content. In modelling the residual CO, it was assumed that some of
the CO in the fuel would flow through the process uncombusted, even if sufficient air
for combustion were available and that the amount of unburned CO depends on the
excess air factor λ. With a larger λ, less unburned CO will result. For λ < 1, the amount

27

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
of CO will grow strongly, and for every missing O2 molecule, two CO molecules will
remain unburned, resulting in less released heat and lower flame temperature.
A factor for the amount of residual CO is modelled based on the excess air amounts in
each cowper. This factor is modelled individually for each cowper and validated
against the measured data.
By applying this model to data from the process, it was found that it could match the
measured CO content quite well, still showing some deviations occasionally. An
example is provided in Figure 20, where the blue line depicts the flow of CO (in
kmol/h) calculated from the measurements, and the yellow line depicts the flow
predicted by the model. These deviations may be due to, e.g., irregularities in the fuel
or airflow that cause variations in the combustion. For a total flue gas flow of
approximately 6000 kmol/h, a deviation of 1 kmol/h must be considered minor.

model of incomplete combustion.

4 Energy balance
With the mass balance as the base for the calculations, an energy balance can be stated
and solved. As in the mass balance, there is no production term, but energy can be
converted in several different ways. Next, the conditions of the flame at the
combustion of the fuel in the cowper are studied. To simplify the calculations, no heat
will be assumed to be lost from the process, which means that all of the incoming
energy also exits the process
𝐸̇𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 + 𝐸̇𝑎𝑖𝑟 = 𝐸̇𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑔𝑎𝑠

(4.1)

Neglecting flows of potential and kinetic energy, only enthalpy flows must be
considered. Therefore
𝐸̇𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 = 𝑚̇𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 ℎ𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙

(4.2)

𝐸̇𝑎𝑖𝑟 = 𝑚̇𝑎𝑖𝑟 ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑟

(4.3)

Under the assumption that the outflow of components can be calculated from the mass
balance (cf. chapter 3), the energy of the flue gas can be written
𝐸̇𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑔𝑎𝑠 = 𝑚̇𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑔𝑎𝑠 ℎ𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑔𝑎𝑠 (𝑇𝑓𝑙𝑎𝑚𝑒 )

(4.4)

i.e., as a function of the flame temperature. The flame temperature can now be
iteratively solved from Eq. (4.1).
In theory, the adiabatic flame temperature is highest when the supplied air equals the
air needed for complete combustion. In reality, however, complete combustion is not
achieved with a stoichiometric supply of air, so the highest theoretical temperatures
are never reached. In practice, sufficient air should be supplied to keep the CO content
of the flue gas acceptably low but avoid an excess airflow since this lowers the flame
temperature due to increased flue gas flow.

29

4.1 Energy balance validation
The energy balance must be considered accurately since even minor differences in
enthalpy values may significantly impact the result. The specific heat values, cp,
provided by SSAB Raahe were compared with cp values from other sources, such as
The Engineering Toolbox or National Institute of Standards and Technology
(Engineering ToolBox, 2021) (NIST Chemistry WebBook, 2021). Specific heat values
from the different sources were also tested in the calculations, leading to somewhat
different flame temperatures. Since there is an indirect measurement of the flame
temperature, i.e., temperature measurements of the dome, the two variables can be
compared. Figure 21 shows a simple schematic of the temperature measurement.

Figure 21 Schematic of the temperature measurement in a cowper.

Figure 22, Figure 23, and 24 show the measured dome temperature (blue lines) and
the calculated flame temperature (orange line) using the model. Based on these results
it may be concluded that the simulated flame temperature matches the dome
temperature very well. However, the calculated flame temperature is seen to be more
sensitive to changes in process parameters since any change in the reported flows of
30

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
fuel or air will affect the results. It is also seen that the dome temperature reacts to
changes in the process with a slight delay, which may be due to the inertia of the
measurement.

____________________________________________________________________

Figure 24 Dome temperature (blue line) in C24 and the calculated flame temperature (orange line).

In the figures, an abnormality in the process can be seen at approximately 12:00 hours
on May 25, when the coke oven gas inflow is disturbed, affecting the combustion. It
is also seen that the calculated adiabatic flame temperatures react more on this
disturbance in the process and drop more strongly in comparison with the dome
temperature.
All cowpers are driven at predetermined conditions at the beginning of their ramp-up
process until a specific timestamp of 8 minutes, after which they are switched on to a
heating mode, where the combustion conditions are corrected based on the residual O2
content in the flue gas channel from the cowper. This ramp-up procedure is adopted to
more efficiently heat the stove at the beginning of the heating cycle, which could be
achieved by feedback control. (Mattila, 2021) This is seen in the calculated flame
temperatures of C23 at the beginning of every heating cycle, but not in the other two
cowpers due to different ramp-up parameters. The flame temperature in C23 is seen to
be high in theory, but it should be remembered that the mixing of the gas is not taken
into consideration in the calculations.
According to Figures 22-24, it is safe to claim that the model predicts the adiabatic
flame temperature well enough for further testing. Since the process is driven with
relatively stable values, it is difficult to predict how the cowpers would react to
different firing conditions. The next section presents some ideas on how to find
appropriate firing conditions, with a test period on C23 with a changed excess air ratio.
32

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
C23 is chosen for the test as it is presently the only cowper controlled based on its own
residual O2 measurements in the flue gas channel.

4.2 Temperature profile
In this section, a predicted temperature profile is produced based on different
combustion air flows in the process. All other input parameters were kept unchanged.
Varying air amounts affects the combustion quality in several ways.
Less air in the process (eventually) results in insufficient O2 for complete combustion,
which yields more unburned CO and lowers the flame temperature. However, less air
also means less N2 in the system, which results in higher flame temperature when less
energy will be needed to heat up the inert part of the gas. By contrast, more air
contributes to better mixing and greater combustion efficiency but also results in more
gas in the system, which absorbs the energy from the combustion reaction and
therefore lowers the flame temperature. Figure 25 shows the adiabatic flame
temperature for different excess air factors, made based on data from 25.5.2021. The
temperature profile does not show peak temperatures since it is an average value from
several heating cycles. These values were achieved by changing the inflow of
combustion air while keeping other input parameters unchanged. In this way, the
excess air ratio changes, and the model calculates flame temperatures based on it.

Figure 25 Adiabatic flame temperatures for cowpers with different excess air factors.

33

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
From the figure, it can be seen that the highest adiabatic flame temperatures are found
slightly above λ = 1. This is due to the residual CO, considered by the model introduced
in subsection 3.5.1. C22 and C24, which are operated based on manually input process
parameters, require less excess air to reach the highest flame temperatures.
According to the figure, the highest flame temperatures for C23 can be obtained further
away from the theoretical air demand. However, it should be noted that the results are
only a prediction since there is a lack of data from different firing conditions. A test
was therefore carried out to study the conditions in more detail.

5 Results
5.1 Test period design
A test period was undertaken to assess the speculation that lowering the excess air
value would result in a higher flame temperature. The test drive is easy to execute since
only an automation value needs to be changed, and follow-up data will be collected
before, during and, after the modification is done. Still, the point at which the change
was made had to be evaluated carefully to avoid the interference of other changes or
disturbances in the process.
5.1.1 Modifications
According to the prediction in Figure 25, the highest reachable adiabatic flame
temperature is obtained when the excess air factor is slightly above λ = 1 or the residual
O2 in the flue gas is slightly above zero. At the starting point, the automation system
for C23 was set to operate with a residual O2 content of 1.3%, which is obtained for λ
≈ 1.13. The average adiabatic flame temperature for C23 is not optimal according to
Figure 25, and according to it, a lower residual O2 would result in a higher flame
temperature.
In a test of this hypothesis, the aim value of the residual O2 in the flue gas of C23 was
lowered to 1.0%. According to the model, the adiabatic flame temperature should
increase by approximately 20 °C, which should be seen in the measurement data. With
the increased temperature, an increased amount of CO in the chimney is expected due
to worse mixing of the air and fuels. The changed set-point was applied over a period
of five days.
Other factors that may affect the results could be the ambient temperature, differences
in fuel composition, and fuel flow. Finally, it should be noted that the model was
developed based on measurement data from May 2021, and the test was undertaken in
late August.

5.2 Test period results and analysis
The test period was started at 14:00 on August 20, 2021. Figures 26-28 depict the dome
temperature, the calculated flame temperature and the excess air factor for each cowper.
The drop in excess air is in Figure 27 seen to decrease the factor from λ ≈ 1.10 to λ ≈
1.05 (dark blue line, right-hand scale). It can also be seen that the model (orange line)
predicts a flame temperature increase at the same time, but the dome temperature (light
blue line) does not increase, or the increase is too small to be observed due to other
changes in the process.

Figure 28 Dome temperature (light blue line), calculated adiabatic flame temperature (orange line) and

Another observation is that the calculated adiabatic flame temperature is constantly on
a higher level than the actual measured dome temperature in C22 and C23 (cf. Figure
26 and Figure 27). The calculated temperatures depend strongly on the amount of
excess air in the system. Despite the offset, the trend shown by the calculated flame
temperature resembles the measured dome temperature (light blue) if the latter is
considered to be a filtered version of the calculated one. Figure 29 and Figure 30 depict
a filtered signal for the calculated flame temperature for C22 and C23, respectively,
according to Eq (5.1)
𝑇̃𝑖+1 = 𝛼𝑇̃𝑖 + (1 − 𝛼)𝑇𝑖

(5.1)

where 𝛼 = 0.8, 𝑇̃𝑖 is the filtered calculated flame temperature, and 𝑇𝑖 is the calculated
flame temperature.

and excess air factor (dark blue line) for C23 during the trial period.

A decrease in the air factor should affect the combustion and increase CO in the flue
gas. Figure 31 shows the amount of CO in the flue gas during the initiation of the test.
The changes in the CO levels can be seen more clearly in Figure 32, where the CO
levels are marked during the heating of C23.

Figure 31 Residual carbon monoxide flow (measured: blue, simulated: yellow) in the flue gas during the test.

Figure 32 Residual carbon monoxide flow in the flue gas during the test. Red lines have indicated the levels
for subperiods where C23 is on heating.

As can be seen in these figures, the residual O2 flow decreases at 14:00, and a slight
increase of about 1 kmol/h in the carbon monoxide flow in the flue gas can be noted
when the values are carefully analyzed. However, it may be challenging to detect such
minor differences in the CO levels. Despite the differences in the CO flows from May
to August, the calculated CO flows match the measured amounts astonishingly well.
Thus, the model predicts the changes in the CO values in the flue gas based on the
excess air amount relatively successfully.
A more considerable difference between the values in May and August is the overall
increase of CO in the flue gas. These elevated values can be seen particularly when
C22 is on heating (lowest of the three periods indicated at the bottom of Figure 32).
The reason may be an incorrect conversion of the volume flow (as a function of
temperature) or a leakage.

39

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
During the test period in late August, the combustion air temperature was more than
10 °C higher than in May. This change may impact the actual air flows through the
process due to the density change.
Another possible reason for the higher calculated flame temperatures can be found in
the coke oven gas composition, which is measured every second or third day, which
introduces some uncertainty. The nitrogen content in the coke oven gas was seen to
fluctuate from 6% to 10% in August and may change radically from one measurement
to another. To evaluate this source of uncertainty, Figure 33-35 show the calculated
flame temperatures after modifying the coke oven gas composition, where the H2 and
CH4 contents in the gas were decreased, simultaneously increasing the N2 content to
approximately 9% from the earlier 6%. These changes result in a clearly lowered flame
temperature to yield better correspondence with the measured dome temperature.
Other factors that may affect the flame temperature are the air humidity, the air and
fuel mixing, and upsets in the process, such as gradual clogging of pipes or fouling.

Other possible causes why the dome temperature measurements remain at the same
level were studied. The temperatures were plotted against the other process variables
that may influence the flame temperature (cf. Appendix 1). Some possible causes are
listed below:


Blast volume: an increased blast through the cowper would cool the
checkerwork matrix, resulting in high energy demand for heating the cowper.



Oxygen content in the blast air: higher oxygen content decreases the blast
volume, which means that the checkerwork cools down less during the blast
phase.



Blast pressure: a higher blast pressure gives a higher temperature of the “cold”
blast entering the cowper (because of the higher power demand of the
compressors).



Cold blast temperature (before the cowper): cooler air requires more energy to
heat up, which means more intense heat transfer from the checkerwork and an
overall lower cowper temperature.



Target automation value for residual O2 in the flue gas: less excess oxygen in
the process also means less combustion air, which should contribute to higher
flame temperature.



Gas cleaning water temperature: The water temperature reflects the blast
furnace gas temperature, affecting the flame temperature.



Target value for blast furnace gas flow: the blast furnace gas flow rate
contributes to heat transfer inside the cowper. More significant gas flows carry
more energy that can be transferred to the checkerwork, and larger flue gas
velocities increase the convective heat transfer coefficient.



Flue gas temperature (after the cowper): increased flue gas temperature
indicates higher temperatures inside the cowper and that the checkerwork is
more saturated with heat.



Target values for flue gas temperature: with targeted values for the flue gas
temperature, the automation controls the combustion parameters accordingly,
and therefore, implicitly decreases or increases temperatures inside the cowper.



Target blast temperature: the target blast temperature affects the blast flow
through the cowpers since the bypass flow is controlled to reach the target (if

42

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
possible). Higher target blast temperatures imply less bypass, which lowers the
cowper temperature.
The figures in Appendix 1 are taken from the end of the test period, where most
process parameters should be stable, and reasons for why the measured dome
temperature did not rise could possibly be found.
The next chapter discusses the questions that arose after the test and potential
explanations for the results.

6 Discussion
The previous section presented results from the test period and some corrections that
were made to some process parameters. To better understand what may have happened
during the test period and why, this chapter discusses the results and provides some
possible explanations for the findings. It also discusses potential focus points of further
studies and also new technologies that may become available.
As can be seen from the results from the test period, the changes in the process resulted
in both predicted and unpredicted outcomes. An interesting question is why these
seemingly conflicting (lack of) changes can co-occur. Calculated values that matched
the measured ones were the modelled CO content and the residual O2 content in the
flue gas, as presented in Figure 31 and Figure 36.
This means that the mass balance and the model for non-ideal combustion seem
accurate. The residual O2 content in the flue gas is calculated based on the air demand
for complete combustion. However, the measured residual O2 content in the flue gas
was higher compared to the calculated one in the data period in May and before the
test in August. This could indicate either a wrong measurement or a (further) leakage
in the process. The combustion air flows in the process were checked in conjunction
with this project and found accurate (despite a small error, a missing NTP correction
that did not significantly affect the residual O2 content). The model, therefore, studied
the effect of constant air leakage into the flue gas canal. A leakage into the combustion
chamber was ruled out as it would have decreased the flame temperature.

Figure 36 Flow of residual O2 in the flue gas in the chimney during the end of the test period (24.8.2021),
measured (blue line) and calculated (orange line).

A matching CO content was not expected because of the fairly approximated
expression of the uncombusted CO (cf. subsection 3.5.1). However, the model
performed exceptionally well under the different firing conditions in the test period.
Figure 32 shows a slight increase in the CO amount in the flue gas for both the
measured and calculated variables.
Since both the CO and O2 balances seem accurate, one would expect an agreement
between the measured and simulated temperatures. However, as can be seen in Figure
27, the model simulates a temperature increase at the same time as the excess air
amount in the process drops, but the measured dome temperature does not.
One explanation could be in the changed environmental conditions. The model was
built using data from May, and the test was undertaken in late August. Differences in
air temperatures and air humidity can be significant. The outside air temperature was
more than 10 °C higher in August during the test period compared to May. Warmer air
contains larger quantities of water at constant relative humidity. As seen in Figure 19,
the calculated H2O flow in the chimney matches the measurement relatively well, even
though the air and fuel humidity may vary, and the calculated values were based on an
assumed constant relative humidity. However, poor approximations of the H2O
content of both the combustion air and fuel may lead to unreliable results. Figure 37
shows the H2O flow in the chimney at the beginning of the test period, where the
calculated and measured values agree well with each other. Figure 38, which shows
45

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
the corresponding values at the end of the test period, illustrates that the values
occasionally show an apparent offset. Attempts to match the measured values
demonstrated little effect by altering the air humidity, while slightly larger effects were
seen by adjusting the blast furnace gas humidity. However, the model was initially
based on an assumption of a moisture-saturated (100% relative humidity) blast furnace
gas, so large deviations in the humidity are unlikely.

the test period.

period.

Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
Comparing Figure 37 and Figure 38, one can note that the fit of the H2O content in the
chimney varies. At the beginning of the test period, the calculated flame temperature
increased when the excess air decreased while the measured dome temperature
remained practically constant. At the same time (20.8.2021), the measured and
simulated H2O content (Figure 37) match well. At the end of the period, the calculated
H2O content and flame temperature values differ from their respective measured
values. This indicates that the H2O content of the flue gas does not significantly
influence the predicted flame temperatures.
Since the H2O content of the fuel and combustion air are not the (only) possible reason
for the discrepancy in the flame temperatures, other variables must be investigated.
The variables studied were mentioned in the previous chapter, and the figures are
presented in Appendix 1. The most relevant parameters, cold blast temperature, gas
cleaning water temperature, and flue gas temperature, are discussed here.
A low cold blast temperature implied that more heat from the cowper is required to
reach the desired blast temperature. Figure 39 shows the trend of the cold blast
temperature before the cowper, together with the calculated flame temperature and the
dome temperature. At first glance, the cold blast temperature seems to correlate with
the calculated adiabatic flame temperature, but considering the different scales of the
ordinates, the changes in the cold blast temperature are not a likely reason since the
cold blast temperature changes by only a few degrees.

measured dome temperature (gray).

47

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
The gas cleaning water temperature is directly correlated with the blast furnace gas
temperature because the gas passes through the scrubber in close contact with the water.
If the cooling system for the cleaning water functions improperly, the cleaning water
temperature will increase. The main problem is not the higher temperature but the
associated increase in the amount of water in the gas. This affects the water balance
and the flame temperature in the cowper. The blast furnace gas moisture content in the
model is calculated based on the blast furnace gas temperature. Figure 40 shows how
the gas cleaning water temperature follows a similar trend as the calculated adiabatic
flame temperature and may be one of several factors explaining why the calculated
flame temperature increases and the dome temperature does not. Still, the changes in
the water temperature are small.

Figure 40 Gas cleaning water temperature (orange), calculated flame temperature (blue), and measured
dome temperature (gray) in C23.

Temperature differences in the flue gas from the cowper that occur over time can
indicate some changes inside the cowper. Increased exit flue gas temperature may
reflect a higher overall temperature in the cowper resulting from a higher flame
temperature or lower blast flow through the cowper. Figure 41 shows a decreasing flue
gas temperature at the end of the test period when the target of the residual O2 in the
flue gas was increased back to what it was before the test (1.3%).

Figure 41 Exit flue gas temperature (orange), calculated flame temperature (blue), dome temperature
measurements (gray) in C23.

The previous chapter demonstrated that significant changes in the calculated flame
temperature could be obtained by changing the coke oven gas composition. The coke
oven gas composition is measured every two to three days, and the composition may
vary considerably between these points, which may give rise to errors in the calculation.
This may be the reason for the offset in the H2O content shown in Figure 38 at the end
of the test period, where the moisture in the flue gas is both under- and overestimated.
The composition heavily depends on the N2 content of the gas; with more N2, the H2
and hydrocarbon contents decrease. Higher amounts of N2 in the coke oven gas
decrease the flame temperature, since N2 is inert in the combustion process. In addition,
the H2O in the flue gas decreases due to the lower amount of combustible (hydrogenbearing) components. Thus, if the N2 content in the coke oven gas is underestimated,
the flame temperature and the H2O content of the flue gas will be overestimated, and
vice versa.
Figure 42 shows two periods in late August (labelled a and b and highlighted in red),
where the H2O flow in the flue gas is either over- (a) or underestimated (b). The
calculated H2O flow is relatively stable, since constant air humidity and coke oven gas
composition were assumed. Figure 43 shows the actual relative humidity of the air,
measured in the harbor of Raahe in the vicinity of the SSAB Raahe steel plant. By
comparing Figures 40 and 41, it can be concluded that the H2O content of the flue gas
follows the relative humidity of the ambient air. This means that the approximation of

49

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
constant air humidity and coke oven gas composition can give misleading information,
which affects calculated the flame temperature and the flue gas composition.

Figure 42 Measured (blue) and calculated (orange) H2O flow in the flue gas at the end of the test run showing
both over- (a) and under predictions (b) of the model.

Figure 43 Relative air humidity in Raahe Lapaluoto harbor 24.8.2021 – 25.8.2021. (Ilmatieteen laitos, 2021)

As the H2O inconstant of the flue gas is overestimated in area a, a change in the model
from a relative air humidity of 70% to 60% was undertaken, simultaneously also
increasing the N2 content of the coke oven gas from 6% to 10%: This leads to
considerable changes in the flow of H2O and in the calculated flame temperature, as
depicted in Figure 44 and Figure 45.

Figure 44 Overestimated H2O corrected with a decrease in the relative humidity of the combustion air and
an increase in the N2 content of the coke oven gas.

Figure 45 Overestimated adiabatic flame temperature corrected with a decrease in the relative humidity of
the combustion air and an increase in the N2 content of the coke oven gas.

For area b in Figure 42, the H2O content is underestimated. Changing the relative air
humidity from 70% to 90%, but keeping the coke oven gas composition unchanged
(6% N2) yields the flue gas moisture flows depicted in Figure 46 and Figure 47.

Figure 46 Underestimated H2O content in the flue gas corrected with an increase in the combustion air
humidity.

Figure 47 Underestimated adiabatic flame temperature corrected with an increase in the combustion air
humidity.

The figures show that corrections in the combustion air humidity and coke oven gas
composition can yield a better agreement between the simulated and measured H2O
contents of the flue gas. Since the model is sensitive to these variables, it is essential
to make reasonable assumptions. The most critical variable is the coke oven gas
composition, which is likely to change more than what is seen from the sparse
measurements. This is one of the few variables in this process that is not continuously
measured, and the approximations used may therefore be incorrect. As can be seen
from the timespan of the end of the test period, it seems likely that the coke oven gas
52

Janne Tiala

composition varies considerably within a day. Therefore, it is recommended that more
frequent coke oven gas measurements should be made in the future to facilitate better
control of the cowpers.

7 Summary
This thesis has studied the heating conditions of the cowpers, i.e., the regenerative heat
exchangers used for preheating the combustion air (blast) for the ironmaking blast
furnace process. The work focused on material and energy balance calculations in
order to gain a better understanding of the combustion conditions in the cowpers.
Recently installed measurements of the gas composition in the chimney, where the
flue gas from the three cowpers flow, provided new information used in the analysis.
A challenge in the work was to find suitable values of variables that are not measured
and using the balance equations to detect the root cause of inconsistencies noted in the
analysis. A significant part of the work was devoted to detecting the reason behind
differences between the calculated and measured residual O2 content of the flue gas.
According to standard calculations and conditions, the residual O2 level in the flue gas
in the chimney should be significantly lower than what was measured. Answers were
sought in the flows of combustion air to the cowpers as some inconsistencies in the
reported values were found. These errors turned out to be a lack of temperature
compensation of the air volume, which was corrected. However, a further increased
airflow would be needed to reach the residual O2 levels in the flue gas, but such
correction would yield a too low flame temperature compared to the measured dome
temperature of the cowpers.
In order not to affect the flame temperature but still reach the measured residual O2
content of the flue gas, it was concluded that excess air has to leak into the flue gas
channel. This could occur as leakage during the blast phase when the cowper is
pressurized or after the heating process, where a small amount of air could leak from
the cold air valve in the cowper. Such leakages were still considered unlikely because
the difference between calculated and measured oxygen levels was relatively constant
over the cowper cycle. This would require that every cowper leaks the same amount
of air or that one cowper leaks both when it is on blast and on gas. This also seemed
quite unlikely. Therefore, a third option was considered, where a snort valve would
leak. The snort valve is an emergency valve that can redirect the compressed blast into
the flue gas channel if something in the process malfunctions or if the operation is
restricted. The snort valve is rarely used and, therefore, a likely candidate for a leakage.
By assuming a steady leak through the snort valve, the calculated residual O2 content
54

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
in the flue gas could meet the measured one, with a calculated flame temperature
matching the measured dome temperature.
To reproduce the residual CO in the flue gas, a simplified model was introduced. It
was demonstrated to at least qualitatively estimate the uncombusted CO that remained
in the flue gas as a function of the excess air ratio.
At the end of the work, a test was undertaken at one cowper in Raahe, which applies
feedback control of the residual oxygen in the flue gas by manipulating the excess air
for the combustion. The excess air ratio was changed implicitly by setting a new target
for the residual oxygen. Even though the model was able to predict the decrease in the
residual oxygen content and the increase in the carbon monoxide content, the predicted
rise in the flame temperature that followed by the reduction of the excess air ratio did
not occur in practice since the dome temperature remained practically constant. Before
further tests are carried out, the reason for this discrepancy should be clarified. It was
noticed that the model’s results heavily depended on how some unmeasured process
variables had been approximated, including the coke oven gas composition and
combustion air humidity. This was clearly seen in the test period, where the measured
and observed H2O content of the flue gas showed an apparent mismatch, affecting the
flame temperature estimation. Several process parameters were investigated to
determine their possible role. An accurate estimate of the coke oven gas composition
was found to be imperative. Today, the coke oven gas composition is measured every
two to three days, and it was estimated that the composition might change considerably
between the measurements. Therefore, more frequent measurements of this gas
composition should, if possible, be undertaken to provide a sound basis for thermal
control of the cowpers.
The model developed in this thesis should be evaluated in further tests. In the present
form, it is suited for analysis of the combustion in retrospect based on past data since
some key variables that are not measured have to be estimated, but these are likely to
change in time. After further tests on the individual cowpers, the description of
combustion conditions in the different cowpers can be updated in the model to better
match the true state. This would form a better basis for a revised heating strategy of
the cowpers with the goal of maximizing the blast temperature.

55

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
It should be noted that the submodel of the residual CO content in the flue gas was
tuned based on the conditions in May 2021 but was found to predict the CO levels
reasonably well in the test conducted at the end of August 2021. However, if the
residual CO level is high in the flue gas, the measurement equipment caps at a certain
level, and the modelled values can no longer be used for comparison.
For a higher flame temperature, the heating of the checkerwork in the cowpers would
be more efficient, and higher blast temperatures could be achieved as long as the
heating is not constrained by the upper limit of the flue gas temperature leaving the
cowper. By incorporating the information about the combustion conditions found in
this thesis in a model of the thermal state of the cowpers (Shaliha, 2020), more detailed
studies of the operation strategy of the cowpers can be undertaken with the goal to
maximize the use of the energy in the fuel gas. By this procedure, the blast temperature
can be kept at a higher level, which is essential for maximizing the injection rate of
pulverized coal in the blast furnace. This is also a means of lowering the large carbon
footprint of the steelmaking industry.

8 Summary in Swedish
Balansbaserad analys av förbränning i masugnscowprar
Järn och stål har producerats i århundraden. Stål var den drivande kraften i den
industriella revolutionen och stål spelar fortfarande en viktig roll i moderna
industrialiserade ekonomier. Flera applikationer i vårt dagliga liv innehåller stål och
det används bland annat i byggnadsbranschen, i fordon, motorer och andra maskiner.
Stål produceras på två sätt: utgående från råjärn som producerats i en masugn och
utgående från skrot i en ljusbågsugn. Skillnader i processerna framkommer i de
producerade produkterna och användningen av råvaror. Masugnsrutten producerar
huvudsakligen stål i form av platta produkter, medan ljusbågsugnen ger stål för långa
produkter. Masugnen använder sig av kol och koks som bränslekällor och sinter,
pellets och styckesmalm som järnbärare i processen. I ljusbågsugnen används elektrisk
energi för smältning av skrot och DRI (direktreducerat järn). Masugnar är de primära
källorna för det producerade järnet i världen och står för 75 % av järnet i allt producerat
stål. (Geerdes, Chaigneau & Lingiardi, 2020)
Denna avhandling gjordes i samarbete med SSAB Brahestad som producerar stål med
masugnsprocessen och därför är masugnen och dess sidoprocesser centrala i detta
arbete.
Masugnen är en hög, vertikal schaktugn som reducerar järn från järnoxider med hjälp
av kol, främst koks, som bränsle. Det producerade järnet lämnar processen i flytande
form och kallas ofta ”råjärn”. Eftersom råjärnet är en smälta är det enkelt att bearbeta,
vilket underlättar vidare raffinering av materialet till stål. En schematisk bild av en
masugn och in- och utströmmande material ges i Figure 1. Eftersom det är viktigt att
järnet tappas ur processen i flytande form, krävs väldigt höga temperaturer, över
1400 °C. En jämn och kontinuerlig drift av processen är även viktig för att upprätthålla
hög kvalitet på produkterna.
För att nå de höga temperaturerna i processen krävs även förvärmning av
förbränningsluften som används i masugnen. Den förvärmda luften i processen kallas
för blästerluft eller bara bläster. Blästerluften värms i regenerativa värmeväxlare som
kallas ”cowpers”, där luften passerar genom en förvärmd tegelstruktur.

57

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
Tegelstrukturen värms med hjälp av förbränning av masugnsgas tillsammans med
koksgas. Figure 3 visar en schematisk bild av cowperstrukturen. Den här avhandlingen
koncentrerar sig på optimering av förbränningsförhållandena i en cowper för att uppnå
en så hög adiabatisk flamtemperatur som möjligt.
SSAB Brahestad har två masugnar, 1 och 2, varav båda använder sig av tre stycken
cowprar. Masugnarna har sina egna skorstenar, där ny mätutrustning monterats år 2020,
för att förbättra uppföljning av förbränningsförhållandena i cowprarna. Det här arbetet
koncentrerar sig endast på masugn 2 och dess cowprar. De centrala mätningarna är
koncentrationen av CO, O2 och H2O i rökgasen. Med mätdata av dessa koncentrationer
är det möjligt att bestämma förbränningens effektivitet i var och en av cowprarna. Ett
problem är dock att mätdata inte finns för varje enskild cowper, eftersom
mätinstrumenten är monterade i den gemensamma skorstenen. Rökgaserna som mäts
utgör därför ofta en blandning av avgaserna från två cowprar, som dessutom alternerar
under den s.k. cowpercykeln.
De tidigare nämnda bränslena innehåller CO, CO2, H2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, H2O och N2.
En ideal förbränning av dessa komponenter producerar koldioxid, CO2, och vattenånga,
H2O, samt kväve, N2, som går inert genom processen. Eftersom man endast idealt sett
har en fullständig förbränning, kommer även en del av bränslekomponenterna att
passera genom processen oreagerade. En massbalans för komponenterna uppställdes
för att analysera kvaliteten hos mätdata. Därefter uppställdes en energibalans på basis
av massbalansen för att bestämma den adiabatiska flamtemperaturen i cowpern.
Analysen avslöjade vissa felaktigheter i driftdata, som korrigerades: Bland annat
detekterades fel i konversionsfaktorer som beaktar temperaturens inverkan på
volymströmmar av förbränningsluft. Efter att några uppenbara fel hade korrigerats
visade balanserna ändå att den uppmätta syrehalten i rökgasen i skorstenen är avgjort
högre än den beräknade. Olika felkällor analyserades med hjälp av den
beräkningstekniska modellen, varvid vissa alternativ kunde uteslutas som osannolika.
Som den mest sannolika förklaringen fann man ett läckage, där ett flöde av
överskottsluft från blästerkanalen strömmar till rökgaskanalen efter cowprarna men
före mätinstrumenten i skorstenen. Denna slutsats drogs bl.a. på basis av faktumet att
ett läckage i ett tidigare skede skulle ha påverkat förbränningstemperaturen i

58

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
cowprarna. Med den antagna senare punkten för läckaget kunde syrebalansen
korrigeras utan skadlig effekt på energibalansen.
Den adiabatiska flamtemperaturen beräknas utgående från värmen som frigörs i
förbränningen, energiinnehållet hos inflödande bränsle och förbränningsluft, samt i
utflödet av rökgas. Parametrar som starkt påverkar den adiabatiska flamtemperaturen
är mängden förbränningsluft i förhållande till mängden bränsle. Ifall mängden
förbränningsluft är otillräcklig för stökiometrisk fullständig förbränning, kommer en
del av bränslet att flöda genom processen oreagerat, vilket leder till en ökning av COhalten i rökgasen, samt en lägre flamtemperatur. Ett stort överskott av förbränningsluft
i processen leder även till en lägre adiabatisk flamtemperatur i och med att en högre
halt av N2 i gaserna innebär ökade mängder rökgas som måste upphettas. Förhållandet
mellan mängden förbränningsluft och det teoretiska behovet för fullständig
förbränning kallas ”luftöverskottstal” och betecknas ofta med symbolen λ. Då en
förbränningsprocess får exakt den mängd av förbränningsluft som behövs för
stökiometrisk förbränning är λ = 1. Ifall λ < 1, fås en ofullständig förbränning, medan
om λ > 1, finns det ett överskott av luft i processen. Processer i industrin strävar efter
ett luftöverskottstal som är lite över ett: t.ex. körs en av cowprarna vid SSAB Brahestad
med luftöverskottstalet λ = 1,13.
Simuleringar med olika luftöverskottstal visar att högre adiabatiska flamtemperaturer
borde kunna nås i cowprarna vid SSAB Brahestad med lägre luftöverskott enligt
Figure 25. En provkörning arrangerades på basis av simuleringarna och luftöverskottet
för C23, som är en av de tre cowprarna för masugn 2, sänktes till λ = 1,1 och hölls på
denna nivå under fem dagar. Modellen indikerade att flamtemperaturen borde öka,
men detta kunde inte observeras i praktiken. Figure 27 visar skillnaden i beräknad och
uppmätt flamtemperatur i början av provkörningen. Innan vidare provkörningar görs,
måste orsaken till skillnaden mellan de beräknade och de uppmätta temperaturerna
undersökas. Skillnaden kan bero på vissa approximationer som gjorts av variabler som
inte uppmäts i processen, såsom luftens och masugnsgasens fuktighet. En annan
möjlighet är att koksugnsgasens sammansättning mellan tidpunkterna då den mäts,
vilket sker varannan eller var tredje dag.
Simuleringar med modellen visade att förändringar i sammansättningen hos
koksugnsgasen och luftfuktighet kan förklara avvikelserna, d.v.s. kan få modellen att
59

Janne Tiala
Masters Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
ge resultat som överensstämmer med mätdata. Modellen kan användas som
utgångspunkt för vidare provkörningar och för att bestämma den flamtemperaturen i
de övriga cowprarna. För att noggrannare bestämma sammansättningen hos
koksugnsgasen föreslås att mätningarna kunde utföras mer frekvent. För att uppnå
högre blästertemperatur krävs högre flamtemperatur och en hög temperatur hos
tegelstrukturen i slutet på uppvärmningsperioden. Detta kan åstadkommas med hjälp
av optimering av uppvärmningsperioden så att strukturella begränsningar, så som
överhettning av stödbalkar, inte beaktas. Optimeringen av uppvärmningsperioden hos
cowpers kunde vara ett intressant tema för vidare undersökningar. Begränsningar i
koldioxidutsläpp i framtiden kommer även att leda till forskning i och utveckling av
alternativa bränslen som kunde användas i stålframställningsprocessen.

Appendix 2
Figures from the whole test period are in order. Figures from the start and finish of the
test period are used in the analysis of this work and, therefore, not included in the
Appendix. The figures depict the calculated flame temperature as the orange line, the
measured dome temperature as the light blue line, and the excess air factor as the dark
blue line.

Figure A2.1 C23 measured dome temperature (light blue), calculated flame temperature (orange) and excess
air factor (dark blue) during the test period 21.8.21.

Figure A2.2 C23 C23 measured dome temperature (light blue), calculated flame temperature (orange) and
excess air factor (dark blue) during the test period 22.8.21.
