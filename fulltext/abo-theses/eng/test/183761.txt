A roll coater applies a coating to a substrate by two or more rotating rolls. The studied case is
a 3-roll forward roll coating system. The system's main objective is to apply the base coating
to sandpaper. This is done by having the paper rest on a web that travels through the web and
application roller. The continuous web lays on the web roller, and the coating is present on
the application roller. The distance between the rollers is called the gap and will be one of the
main controlling variables in managing that the correct amount of coating is applied to the
paper. There are two different kinds of gaps present, one between the web and application
roller and one between the metering and application roller. The one between the metering
and application roller is controlling that the right amount of coating is applied to the
application roller. This gap is usually run with a negative distance, meaning that the rolls are
pressed together. The outer layer of the application roller is made out of deformable material
to ensure that the rolls do not clash. The system is in a fully flooded regime when the gap
between the web and application roller is filled with coating, and a rolling bank is present
before the gap. Reducing the amount of coating in the gap will make the bank disappear, and
the system will be in a starved configuration. The data for the system is collected by a sensor
moving back and forth across the web’s width direction.
A feedback control system is built for the coating system in Simulink. The primary control
variables are the gaps between the rolls and the speed of the metering roll. A line
approximation is added to represent the geometry of the rollers. An estimator is used to
2

ensure that data is available when the sensor is not present. The model seems to fit well when
comparing simulated results to data from the plant.

Swedish summary – Svensk sammanfattning
I dagens läge är digitaliseringen av olika industrier ett väldigt intressant och eftertraktat ämne
i och med att alla steg i en produkts livscykel kan mer eller mindre digitaliseras för att förbättra
processens prestanda. Utvecklingen av modeller som ansluter den fysikaliska världen med den
virtuella ökar exponentiellt i dagens värld och 2018 klassficerades dessa modeller som en av
de topp tio mest eftertraktade teknologiska trenderna för kommande årtionde. Dessa
modeller kallas för Digital Twins (DTs) eller digitala tvillingar på svenska. Idéen bakom digitala
tvillingar är att kunna beskriva en fysikalisk process som en digital representation.
Utvecklingen av digitala tvillingar går hand i hand med andra teknologier som sakernas
internet (IoT, enligt engelskans ”internet of things”), molntjänster, sensorutveckling samt nya
simulerings och dataanalys metoder. Det är den stora tillväxten i dessa områden som har gjort
utvecklingen av digitala tvillingar möjlig. Fördelen med att ha digitala tvillingar är att kunna
göra smartare beslut angående produktens livscykel, genom att analysera stora mängder
digitalt framställd data istället för fysikaliska experiment. Några exempel på hur digitala
tvillingar kan användas är analytiska bedömningar, predikativ diagnostik, processoptimering
och för design av styrsystem. Analytiska bedömningar kan digitalt analysera processen och
kan sedan implementera resultatet i den verkliga processen för att förbättra produkten.
Prediktiv diagnostik kan på förhand spå när processens komponenter borde bytas ut för att
optimera produktionen. Hela processen kan också optimeras genom att köra digitala
simuleringar istället för att göra tester i verkligheten och detta sparar både tid och pengar.

Utvecklingen av en digital tvilling kan delas upp i fyra olika steg: (1) modellering, simulering,
verifikation, validering och ackreditering; (2) datafusion; (3) interaktion och kollaboration; och
(4) service. Först måste den fysikaliska modellen modelleras och simuleras för att kunna
verifiera och validera om modellen stämmer med verkligheten. Steg två går ut på att hantera
stora mängder verklig och virtuell data, samt sammanslagningen av dessa två. Data måste
förbehandlas för att kunna filtrera och konvertera data till det önskvärda resultatet. Den
processerade datan kan sedan analyseras med olika algoritmer för att undersöka systemets
beteende. Det tredje steget behandlar interaktionen mellan alla olika delar av processen. En
digital tvilling har interaktioner och kollaboration mellan det fysiska-fysiska, virtuella-virtuella
8

och virtuella-fysiska planet. Det fysiska-fysiska planet ser till att olika verkliga entiteter kan
kommunicera och samarbeta för att utföra uppgifter som inte kan utföras på en maskin. Den
virtuella-virtuella delen kommer att se till att olika virtuella modeller kan kopplas ihop för att
dela information. Slutligen ser det virtuella-fysiska planet till att den virtuella modellen kan
optimeras baserat på hur den verkliga maskinen beter sig. Dessutom kan det verkliga systemet
dynamiskt uppdateras av direkta ordrar från den virtuella modellen. Det sista steget fokuserar
på servicen av digitala tvillingar genom att optimera när och hur service borde utföras
beroende på klientens behov. Målet med detta arbete att börja uppbyggnaden av en virtuell
tvilling och kommer därmed att fokusera på steg 1. Arbetet har gjorts i samarbete med Mirka
och den undersökta maskinen är ett trevalssystem som stryker ut lim för sandpapper.

Valsbestrykning är en billig och mångsidig metod att bestryka ett substrat. Huvudidén bakom
bestrykning med vals är att ha två eller fler roterande valsar för att bestryka ett substrat, som
ligger på en kontinuerlig webb. Uppdelningen av valsbestrykningssystem kan delas upp i två
huvudkategorier beroende på om valsarna roterar åt samma eller motsatt håll. Om valsarna
roterar åt samma håll kallas de för framåtkörda och om de roterar åt olika håll för bakåtkörda.
I den undersökta fallet undersöks framåtkörda valsar, eftersom det är dessa som används i
fabriken. Pappret eller substratet kommer att ligga på en kontinuerlig web. De tre valsarna
som används kallas för tryck-, bestryknings- och doservals, beroende på vilken funktion de har
i systemet. Den kontinuerliga webben ligger på tryckvalsen och denna körs oftast med samma
hastighet som webben. Limmet finns på applikationsvalsen och överförs till pappret i gapet
mellan tryck- och applikationsvalsen. Gapet eller nipen mellan dessa två valsar och
limmängden på applikationsvalsen är de huvudsakliga styrvariabelerna som bestämmer hur
mycket lim överförs till pappret. Storleken på gapet kan ställas genom att styra höjden för
båda sidorna av tryckvalsen. Limmet finns i en reservoar ovanför nipen mellan bestrykningsoch applikationsvalsen. Mängden lim som överförs till applikationsvalsen beror därmed på
hastigheterna och nipavståndet mellan dessa två valsar. Dessa nip är väldigt små, oftast i några
tiotal mikrometer och därför har applikationsvalsen ett ytterlager av gummi för att skydda
valsarna från att krocka med varandra. Eftersom applikationsvalsen har ett gummilager kan
nipen också köras med negativa avstånd, genom att pressa valsarna mot gummit. Detta
används mellan tryck- och applikationsvalsen för att stoppa lim från att rinna igenom från
9

reservoaren. Flödesegenskaperna mellan applikations- och tryckvalsen kommer att variera
beroende på hur mycket lim finns på applikationsvalsen. Om mängden lim är större än
tryckvalsens nip kommer systemet att operera i en översvämmad regim, där ett lager av lim
kommer att byggas upp framför nipen. Däremot om mängden lim är runt samma höjd eller
mindre än nipen kommer systemet att köras i en svältande regim och därmed kommer
limbanken framför nipen att försvinna.

Systemet kommer att behövas styras för att behålla jämn tjocklek på pappret. Limmängden
ska kontrolleras både i maskin och tvärriktningen av pappret. Med maskinriktningen menas
vägen som pappret går igenom valsarna, d.v.s. papprets längdriktning, och tvärriktningen
innebär pappret bredd. Tvärriktningen är oftast svårare att styra i jämförelse med
längdriktningen. För att kunna styra systemet måste data samlas in och detta utförs av en
sensor åker fram och tillbaka i breddens riktning. Detta gör att data avläses i ett sicksack
mönster, eftersom webben som pappret ligger på åker konstant framåt. Därför behövs en
estimator för att beräkna vad limmängden är där sensorn inte finns.

I arbetet byggs först en simulink-modell upp för systemet för att virtuellt representera den
fysikaliska verkligheten med en estimator för att beräkna vad limmängden borde vara när
sensorn inte är där. Ett styrsystem konstrueras därefter för att kunna användas både för
modellen och verkligheten. En linjeapproximation används för att representera valsarna och
verkar bra beskriva hur systemet fungerar på grund av valsarnas geometri. Styrvariablerna
som används är de båda nipen mellan valsarna, samt hastigheten för bestrykningsvalsen.
Hastigheterna på de andra två valsarna inverkar också på hur mycket lim appliceras till
pappret, men dessa hålls konstant med hastigheten på webben. Börvärdet på
papperslimmängden styrs med nipet mellan applikations- och tryckvalsen genom att först
göra en variabeltransformation till vinkeln på limmet och limmängden. Dessa två styrsignaler
styrs med varsin PI-regulator och beräknas därefter tillbaka till höjden för höger och vänster
sida för valsen. Höjden på valssidorna kan också kvantifieras ifall mätdata eller fysiska
begränsningar finns i systemet. Med tanke på att modellen kan behövas kvantifieras har även
dödzon intervall lagts till för att stoppa regleringen från att oscillera mellan två värden.
10

Limmängden på applikationsvalsen bestäms genom att styra det andra nipet och
bestrykningsvalsens hastighet.

Modellen verifieras genom att jämföra verkliga mätningar från fabriken, genom att köra
modellen med samma inställningar som fabriken hade. Verkliga värden verkar passa bra
överens med vad den virtuella modellen uppvisar. Styrsystemet testas även med olika värden
i tillåtna intervall, samt olika stegförändringar i den eftertraktade limmängden. Om möjligt
skulle det vara fördelaktigt att göra mera tester i fabriken med förbestämda inställningar, men
på grund av Covid-2019 pandemin har besök till fabriken inte varit möjliga. Nästa steg för
digitala tvillingsmodellen är att börja bygga upp alla interaktioner mellan de verkliga
maskinerna och den digitala modellen.

1 Introduction
The digitalization of different industries is an exciting and sought-after topic in today's world
since most steps in the product's lifecycle can be improved and optimized with the help of
digital means. The development of models that connect the virtual and physical spaces is
increasing exponentially, and in 2018 these models were ranked in the top 10 most wanted
technological trends for the coming decade. A model that connects the physical and the virtual
spaces is called a digital twin (DT). The development of digital twins goes hand in hand with
improvement in other technological areas, such as the internet of things (IoT), cloud-based
services, sensor tech, and new and improved simulation and analysis methods. The advantage
of using a virtual twin is that it can analyze and make intelligent decisions for the whole
process by simulation instead of factory testing. A few areas where digital twins are used are
analytical decisions, predictive diagnoses, and process optimization. By using the simulations
and smart algorithms, the whole plant model can be optimized to the best settings for any
wanted configuration. Predictive diagnoses will predict when a process component needs to
be changed to maintain optimal performance but can also vary these decisions based on the
client's needs. In general, running anything in the digital space will save both time and money
compared to using factory testing. This hinges on making sure that the models used are correct
and accurately represent the real world (Tao, et al., 2019).

The development of a digital twin can be split up into four steps: (1) modeling, simulation,
verification, validation, and accreditation; (2) fusion of data; (3) interaction and collaboration;
and (4) service. The first step will model and simulate the physical system in a virtual
workspace. Furthermore, this model needs to be tested to verify and validate if it corresponds
to the real-world system. The second step will involve handling all the data that will be present
in different parts of the model. All the data first needs to be preprocessed by filtering and
converting it into its needed form. Following this, the data can be analyzed with different
algorithms to improve the system's behavior. In the third step, all different interactions
between the process parts will be handled. A digital twin will involve collaboration between
three different spaces, the physical-physical, virtual-virtual, and virtual-physical. The physicalphysical space makes sure that different real-world entities can communicate in order to
12

perform more complex tasks requiring more than one machine. In the virtual-virtual space,
different models can communicate and share information. Lastly, the virtual-physical space
will ensure that the virtual model is correctly based on the real-world process. The actual
physical system can also be dynamically updated based on information from the virtual model.
The fourth service part will handle both the virtual and physical entities' maintenance by
optimizing when maintenance should be performed. This thesis aims to start building a digital
twin model and will, therefore, focus on step one. The work has been done in collaboration
with Mirka, and the studied system is a three-roll coater, which applies adhesive coating for
sandpaper (Tao, et al., 2019).

Roll coating is a cheap and versatile method of coating a substrate. The main idea behind it is
to use two or more rotating rollers to apply the coating. A roll coating system can be split into
two categories, depending on the roll's rotations. A forward roll coater will have the rolls
rotate in the opposite direction and is the most studied configuration in literature. On the flip
side, if the rolls rotate in the same direction, the roller will be in reverse mode. The studied
Mirka case uses a forward roll coater, which will be the focus of this thesis. The paper rests on
a continuous web, which travels through the web and application roller in order to apply the
adhesive. The narrowest part of the rolls is called the gap or nip and will be the primary control
variable to ensure that the specified adhesive amount is applied. The third roll is called the
measuring roll and will apply the coating onto the application roller. The gap between the
measuring and application rolls and their speeds will be controlled to make sure that the
application roller has enough adhesive.

The system will need to be controlled to maintain an even coating on the paper. The coating
thickness needs to be preserved in both the machine and cross-direction. Machine thickness
is the length of the paper since this is the way the paper travels through the machine. The
cross-direction is the width of the paper and is usually harder to control compared to the
machine direction. In order to be able to control the system, a stream of data will constantly
be fed from the sensors. The system has only one sensor that traverses the paper back and
forth on a rail. This will mean that the data provided will be presented in a zigzag pattern due

13

to the constant movement of the web. An estimator is added to predict the data when the
sensor is not present.

In this thesis, a Simulink model is built to represent the physical system virtually. A control
system is then added, with the primary control variables being the two gaps between the rolls
and the speed of the metering roll. The setpoint of the coating thickness is controlled by
variable transforming the coating profile into the coating's angle and average thickness. A line
approximation is added to represent how the rolls will behave due to their geometry. PIregulators control the two signals before being transformed back into the rollers' left and right
side signals. The amount of coating needed on the application roller is controlled by the
metering roll gap and speed.

1.1 Background and control problem
The control of sheet and film processes is an exciting subject for today's industries. These
processes can be sorted into metal rolling, manufacturing of paper, polymer film extrusion,
and coating. For the metal industry, approximately 90% of all the produced copper, aluminum,
and steel are rolled. Paper manufacturing is a sheet process and a considerable part of the
paper and pulp industry. Polymer film extrusion is used in the making of different plastic
products. The main goal in this thesis is to build a control system and model for a 3-roll forward
roll coater that applies a base coating for sandpaper.

14

2 Literature review
The purpose behind coating operations is to apply an even layer to a substrate to improve the
substrate's functionality, appearance, or both. Examples of common ones are hydrophobic,
anti-corrosion, adhesive, and photographic coatings. Hydrophobic coatings will make a
product repel water and can be used, for example, in the food industry for packaging or to
make fabrics more repellant to water. Metals can be made more corrosions resistant by
coating them with an anti-corrosion agent. Metal coating can be helpful if the metal is exposed
to harsh climate or wet environments. Another common industry application is adhesive
coatings, which are used to fasten different objects together. Paper can be coated to increase
its printability or improve its visibility (Johnson, 2003).
There are many coating methods, and which one to choose depends on a variety of factors.
Firstly, some coating methods will not be possible depending on the coated part's shape, size,
and accessibility. For example, a more advanced three-dimensional product will not be able
to be roll coated. More factors such as the production speed requirement, labor and
equipment cost will need to be investigated when choosing the most suitable method. Fast
automated methods, like roll coating, will be superior to hand application if many products
are being manufactured. However, if the production volume is low and spread out, hand
applying might be cheaper than investing in a roll coating machine. Coatings will have different
open and curing times. Open time means how long the coat is still workable after it has been
applied. Flammability, noxiousness, and viscosity of the coating will also affect the choice of
coating method. Lastly, depending on the rheology and characteristics of the coating used,
some methods will be more suitable. Rheology is the study of the deformation and flow of
both solid and liquid materials (Cognard, 2006).

2.1 Roll coating
Roll coating is an inexpensive and versatile method of coating a specific substate. The main
idea behind roll coating is to use two or more rotating rolls to apply a thin coating film onto a
continuous web. Roll coating setups can be classified into two main categories, depending on
the rolls' rotation. In forward roll coating, the rolls will rotate in the opposite direction, and
15

the fluid motion through the nip is going in the same direction, illustrated on the left in Figure
1. The place coating rolls are closest together is called the nip, but gap is also used in literature.
Reverse roll coating occurs when the rolls rotate in the same direction and cause the two roll
surfaces to move in opposite directions, as seen on the right in Figure 1. Usually, reverse roll
coaters are more versatile than forward roll coaters due to handling more viscous coats at
higher speeds, but they are also more expensive and complex. In this thesis the object of study
is a forward roll coater (Kapur, 1999).

Figure 1: Forward and reverse roll coating (Johnson, 2003).

2.2 Forward Roll Coating
Forward roll coating is used for web speeds between 3 and 60 m/min with a usual coating
viscosity ranging between 1-50 mPas (Kapur, 1999). The forward roll setups are illustrated in
Figure 2, on the top as a pan-fed three-roller system (a) and on the bottom as a reservoir fed
four-roller system (b). The roll called the back-up or web roll is driving the substrate web and
is usually made from solid steel. The application roll's role is to pick up the coating from a
reservoir and move it to the nip region between the web and application roll. This roll can be
covered in an elastically deformable roll cover to avoid steel rolls from clashing. The advantage
will then be that the coating can be made much thinner without worrying about roll clashing.
In the upper figure (a), the pick-up or metering roll is partly submerged in the feed pan to pick
up the coating and apply it to the application roll. Comparatively, in the lower figure (b), the
coating is contained in a reservoir above the two outer rolls' nips (Carvalho & Scriven, 1997).

16

Figure 2: Forward roll coating examples (Carvalho & Scriven, 1997).

2.2.1 Positive gap and negative gaps

A roller system can run with a positive or negative gap. Positive gaps imply that both rolls'
center distance is larger than their combined radii. This gap is the most studied setting in
literature and is used in many industries. The gaps are usually larger than 25 micrometers for
rigid steel rolls to avoid clashing between the rolls, but this is not a problem for deformable
rolls because of the elasticity. For a deformable roll system, the larger the gap becomes, the
more like two rigid rolls, the system will behave since less force will be applied to the
deformable roll and the roll will therefore not compress as much. Reversely, the distance from
the center of the rolls is smaller than the combined radii for a negative gap. Negative gaps are
only possible with deformable rolls since otherwise, the rolls would clash together. The gap
between the rolls can either be a fixed gap or a load-controlled gap. A fixed gap means that
the gap is set to a specific height, while a load-controlled gap means that a specific load is
applied to one of the rolls and will then settle into a particular gap height depending on the
elastic properties of the rolls (Kapur, 1999).

17

2.2.2 Roll flow regimes

Furthermore, roll coaters can be classified depending on the rolls' flow regime. A roller
operating with a thicker inlet film than the gap (Hin > HGap) is called a flooded regime or classical
roll coating and will cause a rolling bank of coating fluid upstream from the gap. This operating
mode is the most studied and well understood. On the flip side, the rolling bank will disappear
when the coating input is lowered, which will cause the roller to operate in a starved
configuration (Hin < Hgap) (Abbott, et al., 2011).

2.2.3 Fully flooded regime

The pressure distribution for a fully flooded regime will be calculated using the lubrication
approximation. This is due to the fluid in the nip can be seen as one-dimensional because of
the converging and diverging nature of the flow. The inlet side will generate high pressure
from the squeezing motion of the fluid and the outlet side will cause sub-atmospheric pressure
due to the diverging flows. However, the flow fields are not one-dimensional and needs to be
determined with computational methods.
The flow in the gap for a fully flooded regime can be split into two parts, a rectilinear flow
through the gap and a two-dimensional flow further down where the film splits. In the gap
region, the pressure distribution is given by the lubrication approximation from (Carvalho &
Scriven, 1997)
𝑑𝑃

where P is the pressure distribution, μ is the liquid viscosity, X is the horizontal distance along
the gap, U is the average surface velocity of the rolls, H(X) is the clearance between the rolls
and Q is the flow rate through the gap. The average surface velocity can be calculated as
̅ = (𝑈𝐴 + 𝑈𝐵 )/2
𝑈
with 𝑈𝐴 and 𝑈𝐵 being the edge velocity of the web and application roll. The edge speed ratio
S depends on the edge velocities by S = 𝑈𝐴 / 𝑈𝐵 with S > 0 for forward roll coating and S < 0
for reverse rolling. The local clearance can be seen below

thickness L, elastic modulus E, and Poisson's ratio v.

incompressible materials with Poisson's ratios of v = 0.5. The roll's effective radius R is given
by

where 𝑅𝐴 and 𝑅𝐵 are the individual rolls radii (Carvalho & Scriven, 1997).

The flow field for a typical forward roll coater with a flooded regime can be seen in Figure 4.
The lines in the figure can be seen as "streamlines" meaning the path a particle travels along
with the flow. As seen below the flow close to the nip is very linear, while the flow before and
after the nip will recirculate.

Figure 4: Typical flow field for a fully flooded forward roll coater (Abbott, et al., 2011).

The flow rate for a fully flooded forward roll coater have been calculated to
𝑄𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙𝑦_𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑑 =

(𝑈𝐴 + 𝑈𝐵 )
∙ 𝐻𝑔𝑎𝑝 ∙ 𝜆𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑑
2

Where the 𝜆𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑑 ≈ 1.34 and 𝑄𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙𝑦_𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑑 is the flow rate between the rolls per unit
length (calculated in m2/s). Hgap is the nip distance and UA and UB is the speed of the rolls. To
preserve the mass balance, this means that 𝐻𝑖𝑛 > 1.34 ∙ 𝐻𝑔𝑎𝑝 . To preserve a continuous flow
balance the following flow equation per unit length is proposed for a flooded regime when
the incoming coating thickness 𝐻𝑖𝑛 is between 1.34 ∙ 𝐻𝑔𝑎𝑝 and 𝐻𝑔𝑎𝑝
𝑄𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑑 =

(𝑈𝐴 + 𝑈𝐵 )
∙ 𝐻𝑖𝑛
2

Here the 𝜆 term would then be 1. The film split ratio Hratio is the ratio between how much
coating is transferred to the web Hweb with regards to being left on the application roller Happ.
The following equation is used for film split ratio Hratio
𝐻𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 =

𝐻𝑤𝑒𝑏 𝑆(𝑆 + 3)
=
𝐻𝑎𝑝𝑝 (1 + 3𝑆)

Where S is the speed ratio between the rolls, as mentioned earlier. If the speed of the rolls is
the same (S = 1), the film split ratio will be 1, i.e., an even split of the film (Abbott, et al., 2011)
(Thompson, 1992) (Gaskell, et al., 1998).

2.2.4 Fully flooded forward roll coater operating window

The optimal operating window for a fully flooded forward roll coater with quite high viscosity
fluids was determined by (Coyle, 1997) and presented in Figure 5. The coating will have air
entrainment in the reservoir when the application roll speed is much faster than the web
speed due to the run-back. This is due to the excessive amount of coating that the application
roller will pick up. Ribbing will affect the process at high web speeds, which means that the
coat will not be even but have a sinusoidal wavy pattern instead. This is discussed more in
detail later in the thesis. Starvation will occur when the application speed is low in comparison
to the web speed (Abbott, et al., 2011).

Figure 5: Operating window for a fully flooded regime (Abbott, et al., 2011).

21

2.2.5 Starved regime

For a starved regime, the incoming coating thickness will be less than the gap between the
rolls. This will cause the rolling bank present in the fully flooded scenario to disappear. The
following flow rate equation is proposed for a starved regime, when 𝐻𝑖𝑛 is between 𝐻𝑔𝑎𝑝 and
𝑘−1

𝐻𝑔𝑎𝑝 ∙ 𝑘−0.3
𝑄𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 =

(𝑈𝐴 + 𝑈𝐵 )
(𝐻𝑔𝑎𝑝 − (𝐻𝑔𝑎𝑝 − 𝐻𝑖𝑛 )𝑘)
2

where the constant 𝑘 > 1 and will determine when the regime will change to an ultra-starved
𝑘−1

configuration, meaning that 𝐻𝑖𝑛 is smaller than 𝐻𝑔𝑎𝑝 ∙ 𝑘−0.3. For example, when k = 1.3, the
regime change between a starved and an ultra-starved regime occurs at 𝐻𝑖𝑛 = 0.3 ∙ 𝐻𝑔𝑎𝑝 .
The flow rate for the ultra-starved regime is based on (Gaskell, et al., 1998)

𝑄𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑟𝑎_𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 = 0.3𝐻𝑖𝑛

(𝑈𝐴 + 𝑈𝐵 )
2

The minimum 𝜆 = 0.3 is established by (Gaskell, et al., 1998) and it is the same term used in
𝑘−1

the denominator for the 𝑘−0.3 term to ensure that the flow changes linearly, when 𝜆 goes from
1 to 0.3.
The film split ratio is based on (Landau & Levich, 1942)
𝐻𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 =

𝐻𝑤𝑒𝑏
= 𝑆 2/3
𝐻𝑎𝑝𝑝

The typical flow field for a starved forward roll coater is shown in Figure 6 and is mainly twodimensional with recirculating flows. The streamlines are now recirculating more than the
fully flooded scenario and are also occurring in most of the flow area. The liquid is transported
to the web by transfer jets that whirl around (Abbott, et al., 2011) (Thompson, 1992) (Gaskell,
et al., 1998).

22

Figure 6: Flow field for a starved forward roll coater (Abbott, et al., 2011).

2.2.6 Starved roll coater operating window
The operating window for a starved forward roll coater was also determined by (Coyle, 1997)
and is shown in Figure 7. As seen in the figure if the application speed is too low the bead will
break and cause starvation. On the other hand, if the application speed is too fast the input
bank might become unstable. Lastly, if S is too large, i.e., the web speed is much higher than
the application roll speed, air entrapment could cause problems.

Figure 7: Operating window for starved forward roll coating (Abbott, et al., 2011).

23

2.2.7 Transition between starved and flooded regimes
A summary of the regimes based on the value of 𝐻𝑖𝑛 with k chosen at 1.3 can be seen below
Ultra-starved regime:

0.3 ∙ H𝑔𝑎𝑝 > 𝐻𝑖𝑛 ≥ 0

Starved regime:

𝐻𝑔𝑎𝑝 > 𝐻𝑖𝑛 ≥ 0.3 ∙ H𝑔𝑎𝑝

Flooded regime:

1.34 ∙ 𝐻𝑔𝑎𝑝 > 𝐻𝑖𝑛 ≥ H𝑔𝑎𝑝

Fully flooded regime:

𝐻𝑖𝑛 ≥ 1.34 ∙ 𝐻𝑔𝑎𝑝

Figure 8 illustrates the changes in the flow rate according to the flow equations mentioned
above. The units used are not of importance since the point is to show the general flow rate
changes when 𝐻𝑖𝑛 is increasing. The speed of the rolls and the Hgap are all set to 10, with the
Hin starting at 0 and increasing up to 20. The regimes in the figure are as follows
Ultra-starved regime:

3 > 𝐻𝑖𝑛 ≥ 0

Starved regime:

10 > 𝐻𝑖𝑛 ≥ 3

Flooded regime:

13.4 > 𝐻𝑖𝑛 > 10

Fully flooded regime:

𝐻𝑖𝑛 ≥ 13.4

This example assumes that the web is always in contact with the application roller, which
might not be the case when the difference between 𝐻𝑖𝑛 is small compared to Hgap. The flow
rate increases more or less linearly in the starved and flooded regimes. In the fully flooded
regime, increases in 𝐻𝑖𝑛 no longer increase the flow since it is limited by the size of the gap. If
the amount of coating on the application roller is not measured by any sensor, it can be hard
to determine what regime the coater is running in. An estimate of the application roller
coating thickness is presented in the following chapter (Abbott, et al., 2011) (Gaskell, et al.,
1998) (Thompson, 1992).

2.3 Negative gap model
As mentioned earlier, negative gaps are present when the distance from the center of the rolls
is smaller than the combined radii of the rolls. One of the rolls will have to have a deformable
layer b to prevent the rolls' clashing. The distance of the negative gap, i.e., how much one roll
is pressing into the other, will vary depending on the thickness of the deformable layer. The
following empirical model has been found for a forward roll coater using a negative gap
𝐻 ≈ 0.4(𝜇𝑉̅ )0.6 𝑊 −0.3 𝐸 −0.3 𝑅0.7

Where H is the coating thickness, 𝜇 is the fluid viscosity, 𝑉̅ is the speed of the roll, W is the
load on the rolls, E is the effective elastic modulus, and R is the radius of the rolls. The applied
load W is calculated from Hooke's law according to
𝑊 = −𝑘𝑥
𝑘=

𝐸𝐴
𝐿

25

Where k is the spring constant, x is the negative gap between the rolls, A is the affected area
and L is the length of the roll. From studies, it has been shown that the deformable cover
thickness b has a negligible influence as long as 𝑏 >

𝛿
2

where 𝛿 is the contact width. The

contact width is the height of the area pressing into each other and is presented in Figure 9
below (Cohu & Magnin, 1997) (Johnson, 2003) (Abbott, et al., 2011).

Figure 9: Forward roll coater with negative gap (Cohu & Magnin, 1997).

2.4 Cross-directional Control
The main control objective for the above-mentioned processes is to maintain the uniform
thickness and properties of the sheet or film. This can further be split into control in the
machine direction (MD) and cross direction (CD) of the product. The machine direction is the
way the film or sheet is traveling through the machine or the length dimension and is
illustrated in Figure 10. The product's width is called the cross direction and is usually more
difficult to control than the MD.

26

Figure 10: Typical description of film or sheet process (VanAntwerp, et al., 2007).

The most common processes using cross-directional control are papermaking, metal rolling,
coating, and polymer extrusion. These processes' control is handled in the distribution device,
called die in coating and polymer extrusion, work roll in metal rolling, and headbox in paper
machines. The actuators in the distribution device are usually evenly spaced along the CD. The
headbox will have multiple slice lip actuators evenly spread along the width for paper
machines to control the surface weight. Coating and polymer film applications use screws or
bolts as actuators to control the flow through the die. Metal rollers have varying pressure
across the width of the work roll to control the thickness of the metal sheet. In some processes
the coat thickness is set by lowering and increasing the height of the left and right side of the
roll. This will mean that the degree of freedom is lower than having actuators across the whole
width. For example, if the roll is not a perfect cylinder but more like a cone, this can be
controlled by setting the sides. However, if there is a local disturbance, for example, a dent or
manufacturing error in the roll, this will continue to cause an uneven coat. Comparatively,
local errors are more easily handled in a process with more actuators. On the flipside having
more actuators, in some cases, several hundred will cause the control problem to become a
lot more complex in comparison to just having a few actuators (VanAntwerp, et al., 2007).

2.5 Sensors
To control the specified characteristics of a wanted product, sensors are needed to gather the
necessary data. The sensors are high-cost items and often, only a few sensors are used. A good
27

result with only one sensor can be achieved by having the sensor move back and forth on a
rail orthogonal in relation to the direction of the sheet's MD. The resulting sensor data will be
presented in a zigzag pattern due to the movement of the sensor combined with the sheet
moving. An estimator can now be used on the collected data to get an estimate across the
whole sheet. The estimator used in this thesis is presented in Chapter 3.7. Another approach
is using multiple static sensors to gather the full profile instantly. This will be more expensive
but will yield a much more considerable amount of data. While a bigger pool of measurement
will give a more accurate profile, it will also require more computing power to be able to do
all the needed calculations to control the system between each sampling instance
(VanAntwerp, et al., 2007).

2.6 Instabilities
During the operation of any coating process, various instabilities or defects can occur.
Instabilities are usually classified as constantly reoccurring variations in the film thickness
properties instead of a more randomly spaced defect that might only appear on a specific part
of the film. One of the most common instabilities is ribbing, which will be discussed below
(Chong, et al., 2007).

2.6.1 Ribbing

As stated earlier, any coating process's goal is to produce a uniform flat film across the
substrate. However, it has been observed that the film is often applied in a wavy sinusoidal
pattern across the whole web width. This is called ribbing, but the literature also uses corduroy
or rake-line. The effect is present in both forward and reverse roll coaters, negative and
positive gaps, and is a challenge for the whole industry. Ribbing occurs because of differences
in the stabilizing surface tension and the destabilizing pressure gradient present on the nip's
downstream region. Most research regarding ribbing phenomena has been focused on finding
the critical capillary number Ca*, for which ribbing will occur. In other words, as long as the
capillary number (Ca) is lower than the critical capillary number Ca*, no ribbing should appear.
28

For positive gaps, faster roll speeds will increase the capillary number (Ca) and lead to more
ribbing. However, increasing the gap between the rolls will increase the value of Ca* and give
a bigger buffer before ribbing occurs. It has also been shown that using a rigid-deformable roll
pair will lead to higher Ca* values compared to using rigid steel rolls. This is mainly observed
at lower gap heights compared to more significant gaps. The reason is that the pressure on
the deformable roll layer will be lower at large gaps, and the roll will behave more like a rigid
roll. The pressure between the rolls will be higher at smaller gaps and change the coating’s
fluid profile. The downstream film split meniscus will move further away from the nip, giving
a stabilizing effect. Thicker elastic coverings can also handle larger deformations and will give
a higher Ca* value.
When roll pairs are operated with negative gaps, ribbing has been shown to always be
occurring and it is then a matter of controlling the wavelengths of the ribs. The more negative
the gap becomes, the higher the loading pressure will be between the rolls and this decreases
the ribbing wavelength and lead to narrower ribs. Regardless of what gap setting is used,
increasing the roll speed will lead to a larger rib wavelength and will take longer to level out.
Therefore, it is a decision between having a higher production rate with ribbing occurring
versus higher quality but a slower process (Chong, et al., 2007).

3 Method
3.1 Research objective
This thesis aims to represent and control the forward roller system in a virtual model to be
used as a digital twin. The model of the roller system is built on published literature, which is
presented in Chapter 2 of this thesis. Various control methods are applied to control the
system and are shown below. The model and control system is created in the simulation
software Simulink.

3.2 Mirka physical system
A three-roll setup is used with a reservoir fed system in the studied Mirka case. The application
roll is covered with a deformable layer with the neighboring metering and web rolls being
made from steel. To control the nips between the rolls, the application roll is locked into place
with the web and metering roll moving to set the correct gaps.
The gaps are fixed gaps, so a specific gap is set by controlling both sides of the web and
metering rollers. Both sides' height settings will usually be set to the same height to assure an
even coating, assuming that the rolls are flat and without defects. If the roll got manufacturing
defects, for example, if the roll is more like a cone than a perfect cylinder, the height can differ
between the sides to make the coating even. The gap between the application and web roll
operates with a positive gap, usually with a gap greater than 100 micrometers because of the
paper's thickness. The gap between the application and the metering roller is negative.
Utilizing a negative gap will prevent the liquid coating resting in the reservoir between both
rolls from flowing through the gap due to gravity. The specific gap will depend on the elastic
properties of the deformable application roll.
Only one sensor is used to measure the coating profile. The sensor moves back and forth on a
rail and will record the data in a zigzag pattern.

30

From a controlling point of view, the main objective is using different control strategies to
control the amount of base coat applied. In the studied case, the degrees of freedom are lower
than other cross-directional processes due to only controlling the right and left side heights
and the speed of the metering roll.

3.3 Model
The model for the above-mentioned system is built in Simulink to be able to control it.
Different control ideas are implemented based on whether the system is fully-flooded or
starved. Mika Adler from Mirka initially modeled the physical model. This thesis work is based
on his model, focusing on the control strategies. The model is based on the theory presented
earlier in the thesis. The control strategies will be presented below.

3.4 Control variables
For the control of the above-mentioned system, the main control variables will be the web
roller gap and will be set by two different actuators for the right and left sides. This will be the
main determining factor in achieving the correct coating thickness. The other essential
variables will be the speed of the metering roll and the gap between the application roller and
the metering roll to ensure that enough coating is on the application roller. The regime will
depend on how much coating is on the application roller compared to the web and application
gap.
Other variables that will affect the process are the speed of the web and the application roller.
These will often have the same speed to ensure that no shear forces are present. The web
speed will be controlled by a separate actuator and will also be set to match the speed of the
web and the application rollers. Lastly, the fluid properties will affect how the coat will behave.
The fluid viscosity will be the main one and will depend on what kind of coat is used and its
temperature. The fluid viscosity will be set as a constant for this model because a separate
system in the plant automatically controls it.

31

3.5 Line approximation
The first control strategy implemented is a line approximation of the base coat applied to the
web. Sensors will gather the coating profile and assuming that the rolls are flat, the coat can
be seen as a line. Instead of using the whole profile, a linear approximation will be
implemented. An offset of the starting and ending point will be used to stop side overflow
from affecting the result. The specific method used in this thesis is the least-squares and is
being solved in Matlab. A linear system can be seen as the following
𝑦 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑥
where 𝛽0 is the y-intercept and 𝛽1 is the slope of the line. With n observed values the system
can be presented in matrix form Y, X and 𝛽 as below
𝑦1
1 𝑥1
𝑦2
1 𝑥2 𝛽0
[⋮]=[
][ ]
1 ⋮ 𝛽1
𝑦𝑛

The least-squares method aims to minimize the sum of the squared residuals S. Residual r is
the difference between the data and the model.
𝑛

𝑆=

∑ 𝑟𝑖2
𝑖=1

𝑛

= ∑(𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦̂𝑖 )2
𝑖=1

Where 𝑦𝑖 is the observed data and 𝑦̂𝑖 is the fitted response for the model. The 𝛽 vector can
be solved by
𝛽 = (X T 𝑋)−1 𝑋 𝑇 𝑌
or in Matlab by the backslash operator 𝛽 = X\Y (Wells & Krakiwsky, 1971) (MathWorks, 2022).

3.6 Variable transform
After implementing the line approximation, the profile will be variable transformed. The start
and ending points of the line are variable transformed into average coating thickness and
height difference. An even coat can be achieved by setting the set point of the height

32

difference to 0. This will mean that one PI regulator will try to even the coat and the other will
control the desired coating thickness. For this to work, the assumption is that the rolls are flat.
Another thing to note is that even if surface defects affect the profile, not much can be done
if they are in the middle of the rolls. The average coating thickness is calculated as below:
𝑈𝐶𝑜𝑎𝑡_𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 =

ℎ𝐶𝑜𝑎𝑡_𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡 + ℎ𝐶𝑜𝑎𝑡_𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡
2

Where ℎ𝐶𝑜𝑎𝑡_𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡 and ℎ𝐶𝑜𝑎𝑡_𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 is the left and right side starting points taken from the line
approximation (Häggblom & Böling, 2013).

3.7 Estimator
As mentioned earlier, the measured coating profile will be presented in a zigzag pattern due
to the movement of the web and the sensor. This means that in order to get a complete
coating profile, an estimator is implemented. The idea is that the estimator will assume how
the coating profile will look when the sensor is not there, based on previous data. Assuming
the system is a first-order system with the following dynamics:
𝑦̂(𝑘 + 1) = 𝑎𝑥̂(𝑘) + 𝑏𝑢(𝑘)
𝑎 = 𝑒 −ℎ/𝑇
𝑏 = 𝐾(1 − 𝑎)
Where h is the sampling time, T is the time constant, and K is the gain. Then the following
estimator can be used.
𝑥̂(𝑘 + 1) = 𝑎𝑥̂(𝑘) + 𝑏𝑢(𝑘) + 𝑘(𝑦𝑚 (𝑘 + 1) − 𝑦̂(𝑘 + 1))
Where 𝑦𝑚 is the measured value, 𝑦̂ is the difference between the measured and estimated
value, and k is a constant between 0 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 1 (Häggblom & Böling, 2013).

33

3.8 Split Range
Split range control is implemented when the roller is operating in a fully flooded setup to
control the amount of coating transferred between the metering and application roll. This
means that one controller will control both the speed of the metering roll and the gap
between the metering and application roller. If the controller output is between 0 – 30 % the
gap will be controlled and the remaining 70% will operate the speed of the roll. This split is
designed to give a linear response to ensure good control properties.

3.9 Quantified data
In scenarios where the data or the physical system is quantified, i.e., when the physical
limitations of the system makes it only take specific values, dead zones can be implemented.
At the beginning of this work, it wasn't confirmed if the actuators setting the height of the
rolls was quantified or not. The solution was to add a dead zone to the controller. This means
that when operating in ranges between two quantified values, the difference between the
actual value and desired value, i.e., the error signal will be set to 0. The main advantage of this
approach is to stop the system from oscillating between values when the setpoint is between
two of the quantified values.

34

4 Results
4.1 Simulation results
The data results have been represented by running different simulations with different
parameters to ensure that the system is stable and behaving as envisioned. The parameters
used are mainly the same and will be disclosed to clarify the specific result. Simulations have
been the main focal point to test the viability of the model and controller. A bit of data has
been taken from the actual plant to compare it with the simulation result, but more data is
needed to reach more thorough conclusions.

4.2 Simulation assumptions
The results of these simulations are based on a few assumptions. Firstly, constant fluid
viscosity is assumed but may vary depending on the temperature and properties of the fluid.
This is mainly because a separate system regulates the temperature to keep the temperature
of the coat at a constant level. Therefore, assuming constant fluid viscosity should not
significantly impact the result.
Secondly, the rolls are assumed to be even and cylindrical. Minor defects may be present on
the rolls, but these are negligible in the grand scheme of things. The effective elastic modulus
and the thickness of the deformable application roller are also assumptions. Assuming the
layer thickness should be fine since the impact of the thickness is negligible, as explained in
Chapter 2.3. The effective elastic modulus assumption is based on the properties of the layer
material and should be close enough to ensure good results.
Another thing to note is that it is hard to say what regime the actual roller is being run in
because the coating thickness on the application roller is not measured but estimated from
the speed of the metering roll and the negative gap estimation presented in Chapter 2.3.

35

4.3 Simulation parameters
As mentioned earlier, the parameters are mainly the same throughout the simulation runs
and will be mentioned separately if changed. The speed of the web, application roller and
moving web is chosen to be 1:1 at a speed of 55 m/min. The metering roll speed is set to half
of the application roll speed for the starved configuration but varies in the fully flooded one.
The viscosity in the simulations is set to 0.097 𝑃𝑎 ∙ 𝑠, unless otherwise stated.

4.4.1 Startup simulation

The result of the first simulation is presented in Figure 11 and is based on the fully flooded
scenario with a coating thickness setpoint of 8 g/𝑚2 . The top left figure shows one width
profile taken by the sensor from one vertical sweep. The data point got Gaussian noise added
to each measurement to simulate general plant noise. The blue line is the line approximation
done by the least square method, as presented in Chapter 3.5. A three-dimensional plot of the
coating thickness on the paper is shown in the top right corner. The x-axis represents the width
of the track in centimeters, with the y-axis showing the time and the z-axis the surface weight
measured in g/𝑚2 . The middle figure shows the coating thickness on the application roller and
the web roller’s left and right side height, as one line due to them being the same height. The
application roller's coating thickness is set to be 1.7 times the height of the web gap to ensure
that the roller is running in a fully flooded configuration. The bottom figure shows the mean
coating thickness across the full-width profile.
A starved simulation is run in Figure 12 with the coating thickness setpoint of 6 g/𝑚2 . The top
left figure shows the negative gap between the metering roll and application roller. The top
right figure shows the coating thickness in a three-dimensional figure, just like in the fully
flooded simulation above. The middle plot represents the coating thickness on the application
roller and the web gap. Compared to the simulation above, the web gap is larger than the
application roller coating thickness since it is running in a starved configuration.

37

4.4.2 Uneven rolls
The data presented in Figure 13 is based on the fully flooded roll coater simulation. The speed
is the same as earlier, but the right side of the web roll got a height offset of 5 μm to represent
the roller not being a perfect cylinder. Therefore, the roller can be seen as more cone-like than
cylindrical. This offset is most likely too big of a discrepancy to appear in plant scenarios but is
used to illustrate the ability of the controller to handle uneven rolls. The top figure shows the
web roller’s side heights and the application roller coating thickness, with the bottom figure
showing the coating thickness profile. The figures show that the coating will be uniform, even
though the height varies on the left and right sides.

Figure 13: Fully flooded Simulink simulation with uneven rolls; right roll got a 5 μm offset.

38

4.4.3 Coating Thickness limits
The next simulation shown in Figure 14 is also based on the fully flooded configuration. The
top figure shows the gap and application roller coating thickness with the bottom showing the
mean coating thickness on the paper. This figure shows the minimum and maximum coating
thickness achievable with the max roller speed. The max coating thickness achieved here is
17 𝑔/𝑚2 and the minimum as 2.4 g/𝑚2 . For this scenario the most interesting result is the
max one since the minimum can be lowered by reducing the speed of the rollers. The metering
roll gap is operating between -3 mm and -0.2 mm, and these are the limiting factors on the
coating thickness. The web gap can always be made bigger or smaller but increases in the gap
at the maximum coating thickness will make the system run in a flooded setup instead of fully
flooded. At the minimum coating thickness, the web gap could be made smaller to make the
coating thickness even thinner, but this will overflow the sides of the gap since the amount of
coating on the application coater is at the limit.

Figure 14: The minimum and maximum coating thickness for the fully flooded configuration at approximately 2.4 and 17
g/m2.

39

4.4.4 Setpoint changes
The following simulation is shown in Figure 15 to illustrate step changes in surface weight for
a fully flooded roll coater. The surface weight step point is set to 6 𝑔/𝑚2 initially and is then
changed to 10, 16 and 4 𝑔/𝑚2 . The left figure illustrates the gap change and the application
roller coating thickness. After approximately one minute, the system is stable. The step
changes are fast in general when the value change is small. The system will take longer to
become stable when the change is more significant, as shown when changing from 16 to 4
𝑔/𝑚2 . Depending on the settings on the controller, even faster changes are possible but will
also produce more oscillating before reaching stability.

Figure 15: Fully flooded simulation with coating thickness setpoint changed from 6,10,16 to 4 g/m2.

4.4.5 Comparison of data between plant and simulation
Coating data from the plant is presented in Figure 16. The application and web roller's speed
are 21 m/min, with the metering roll set to half of that at 10.5 m/min. The gap between the
application roller and the web roller is 110 μm. The negative gap between the metering and
application roller is set to −2 𝑚𝑚. The viscosity varies a bit in the plant data but stays around
97 cP towards the end of the run. Both figures show the same data, but the lower one shows
the mean surface weight in a two-axis system, compared to the three-axis version above. The
jump in data at the start and middle of the data is due to the plant not running. The set point
40

the operator wanted is assumed to be between 5 − 6 𝑔/𝑚2 . It’s also not clear whether the
plant is running in a fully flooded or starved scenario. The paper thickness is approximately
80 − 100 μm.

Figure 16: Surface weight data from the plant.

A fully flooded simulation with the surface weight of 5.5 𝑔/𝑚2 is shown in Figure 17 to
represent a similar setpoint as the plant data above. The gap between the application and
web roller is presented at approximately 8 μm in the top figure. Important to note here is that
this does not include the thickness of the paper. This would mean that the combined paper
and gap height is around 88 − 108 μm compared to the 110 μm from the plant. The middle
figure shows the mean coating thickness on the paper, with the bottom one showing the
41

negative gap between the metering roll and application roller. The metering roll gap is around
-1.65 mm compared to the -2 mm in the plant data.

Figure 17: Fully flooded roll coater simulation with same setpoint as plant example. The application coating thickness is set
to be 1.34 bigger than the gap, and is therefore bordering the starved regime.

Another simulation is run in Figure 18 with the same surface weight set point as the plant, but
the gap is starved instead of fully flooded. The parameter k used for the flow to determine
when the starved regime changes to ultra-starved is set to 1.05. For this simulation, the web
gap is 5% larger than the application roller coating thickness. The figure uses the same layout
as the example above. The top figure shows the gap and the application roller coating
thickness, the middle the mean coating thickness on the paper, and the bottom the negative

42

metering roll gap. The results show that the combined web gap with paper is around 91 − 111
μm, while the negative metering gap is around -1.76 mm.

thickness.

5 Discussion and observations
The approximation assumes the rolls are more or less flat, which should be the case in most
plant scenarios. Another thing to note is that it is not the actual width profile presented in the
figure, but the zigzag profile, due to the movement of the web and sensor. The sensor will
only ever record data from the zigzag pattern, so any width profiles will always be an
estimation based on the line approximation and the estimator.
From plant data, it has also been shown that the outer edges of the web will have a thicker
coat than the inner parts. This is most likely from the extra coating that is pressed out to the
sides of the rolls. In order to get a more accurate representation of the coating thickness, the
line approximator is already ignoring the recorded thickness from the web's sides. This
thickness discrepancy is most likely to be present when the roller is run in a fully flooded setup
due to there being more coating to press out to the sides. The line approximator cuts out the
outer data in both the starved and flooded configurations, but this should not be a significant
issue because there are more than enough data points to get an accurate representation.
The noise level might also vary in plant scenarios, but there is always noise present, which will
impact the accuracy of the measurement. The simulated data points fluctuate a lot due to the
noise being Gaussian and added randomly. However, since it is Gaussian and added over a
data set, the mean should still be a good representation. The recorded data points from the
plant are probably closer to each other compared to the simulated data due to the interaction
and properties of the coating fluid.
The effect of the estimator is essential since, without it, there would be no data for most points
of the coat. Since the estimator compares data from the simulation with real data points, it
should give a good estimation. The only scenario where that is not the case is if the model
represents the plant poorly. The model has not been compared extensively with data from
the plant because only a small amount of plant data is available.
The line approximation seems to represent how the physical system nicely. This is because
there will always be a line between the left and right sides of the rolls and since these are the
main actuators affecting the coating thickness, this should be a good approach. A different
system might have actuators located in the web to change the local thickness of the coat. This
44

would give the problem more degrees of freedom and make it more complicated than the
studied case. For example, local imperfections from dented rolls could be fixed with such a
system. However, such problems are more or less impossible to fix here due to the limitations
of the system.
The general accuracy of the model can be assumed to be good from the results shown in
Chapter 4.4.5. Similar results are shown in both the fully flooded and starved model when
using the same parameters as the plant scenario. Therefore, it is hard to precisely say what
regime the plant was running in because both models fit the data. This is partly because there
are parameters in both models that can be changed to fit the data. For the fully flooded
regime, the amount of extra coating on the application roller was set to be 34% larger than
the web gap. This should give a best-case scenario for the fully flooded model. Increasing the
application coating thickness will mean that the negative metering gap gets larger and moves
further away from the -2 mm that was used in the plant data. On the flip side, making the ratio
smaller than 34% will mean that the coater is running in a flooded regime instead of a fully
flooded one. For the starved regime, the size of the web gap compared to the application
coating thickness can be set alongside the k parameter to make it fit the plant data. Note that
the starved regime would fit the plant run better since the negative metering gap is even
smaller in the plant data. From observations in the plant, the system is also usually operated
in a starved configuration. Comparing more data would be beneficial, but the available data
has been low, so more comparisons have been limited. This is mainly because plant visits have
not been possible due to the covid-19 epidemic, so gathering specific data applicable to this
thesis has been challenging.
For this thesis in particular, interesting data to gather from the plant is when the coating on
the application roll loses contact with the paper when operated in a starved setup. Since this
is an unknown, there is no system set to handle losing contact with the paper in the current
program. Having no system means that if the rollers lost contact, the system would try to
increase the amount of coating on the application roller because of the feedback response. A
solution to this could be first to investigate how large the web and application gap can be
before losing contact. Then this could be calculated backward to get a limiting ratio between
the metering and application system and the web and application system to ensure that the
contact is never lost. Procuring a ratio is needed because the amount of coating on the
45

application roller is not measured and can therefore not be used as a feedback response
unless estimated.
Another thing that could be beneficial from an academic point of view is to figure out is how
the gap behaves when swapping from one regime to another. The proposed flow equations
presented in Chapters 2.2.3 and 2.2.5 are implemented to ensure that the flow rate change is
gradual between the regimes. This seems logical since in reality, the changes in flow between
regimes are probably more or less continuous when going from one regime to another.
However, investigating this phenomenon might not be that interesting from an industry or
plant point of view since the plant is most likely run with either one regime or the other and
not going in between regimes.
An important note to remember is that even if the model does not exactly represent how the
system behaves, the controller will still achieve the desired setpoint due to how a feedback
control system works. That is one of the best perks of using a feedback system in any control
system in general.
Currently, the plant is using operators that manually control the plant's parameters. Using a
feedback control system instead has several advantages. Firstly, the controller output will
constantly try to reduce the error of the plant and will therefore reduce the plant’s dynamic
disturbances. A human operator will have a more challenging time keeping up with all the
minor disturbances that are constantly happening. Secondly, changing set points of the plant
should be much faster with a feedback loop. In most simulations, finding the correct gap
heights is usually done in around one minute. Manual operating takes a significantly longer
time to get the desired result.
This thesis focuses on the model implementation and control of the system. The next step
would be to continue building models for the rest of the plant and connect them to the
physical systems. This will then make it possible to get a full-scale digital representation of
how everything in the plant runs, or in other words, a digital twin. The advantage of using a
virtual twin is that it can analyze and make intelligent decisions for the whole process by
simulation instead of factory testing. Digital twins can optimize the whole plant to the best
settings to maintain optimal performance. Component replacement intervals can also be
optimized by running predictive diagnoses in the digital space.

6 Conclusions
The simulations show that the model corresponds well compared to plant data. Plant visits
have not been possible due to the Covid-19 epidemic, so gathering data have been difficult.
An interesting phenomenon that still needs to be studied is when the coating loses contact
with the web when operating in a starved configuration.
For the methods implemented to control the system, the line approximation is a good
representation of how the physical system will behave due to the geometry of the rolls. The
estimator is essential to ensure that data is available when the sensor is not present. The
feedback loop will make sure that correct setpoints are achieved, even if the model might
differ a bit from reality. It will also minimize the effect of plant disturbances and improve plant
productivity by making step changes faster than manual control.
The next step is to connect the model to the physical space and continue adding other pieces
of the plant to the model. This will create a digital twin of the whole plant and digitally
represent the physical system. Using digital twins as a testing environment will save both time
and money compared to running plant tests.
