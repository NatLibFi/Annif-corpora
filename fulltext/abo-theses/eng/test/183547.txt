Title: Non-numerical investor communication: Does the depth of non-numerical
communication in the financial outlook of an equity story impact investment decision?
Supervisor: Irene Kujala
Abstract
Today's investors not only want fact sheets; they want a deeper understanding of the company,
its business model, and opportunities to create added value. (Laskin & Laskin, 2017) This is
why most of the review produced by a company about its past and future performance is
communicated non-numerically, utilizing language (Hales, Kuang, and Venkataraman, 2010).
The objective of this thesis is to determine whether and how the use of in-depth non-numerical
investor communication in the financial section of an equity story impact investors’ investment
decisions on the Finnish stock market.
A qualitative in-depth semi-structured interviews were chosen as the method of this research,
and the research results have been chosen to be analysed thematically. The research group is
based on the demographics of Finnish investors, and disproportioned stratified sampling has
been utilized in the selection of the study group. In its brevity, the study will examine the
importance of non-numerical communication in investment decisions by presenting to the
research group the equity stories of two different companies, one using in-depth non-numerical
communication to support the financial information, while the other presenting mostly
financial information in numbers and only superficial information non-numerically.
The research revealed that the use of in-depth non-numerical communication to support the
financial situation and future goals of a company in its equity story increases the investability
of the company and this way impacts positively on investors’ investment decisions. The study
results also highlighted the importance of non-numerical investor communication in listing
communications, as it provides an opportunity to provide facts to investors they need when
making investment decisions that numbers alone cannot tell. In addition to telling facts, nonnumerical communication can also directly affect an investor’s image of a company, which
can be an essential factor in competing with rival companies on the stock market to stand out.
Furthermore, the findings also provide theoretical contribution and practical implications.

1 Introduction
The following chapter will present the background, problem definition, research aim and research
questions, research limitations and delimitations, structure, context, and definitions of this thesis.

1.1 Background
Investor communication is a broad concept that includes all the information content that a listed
company provides to its target group, i.e., investors. The goal of the information provided to
investors is to enable them to form a view of the company in question. Investor communication
can be divided into non-numerical and numerical information, and its contents can be divided
into non-financial and financial information (Westbrook, 2014). Investor communication is
essential especially for companies, as its primary purpose is to achieve a fair valuation of the
company's securities (Niri, 2020) and increase investors’ interest in the company. (Suomen
Pörssisäätiö, 2016) However, a listed company's communication and transparency obligations
differ significantly from private companies (Minilex, 2020), as existing laws, regulations, and
recommendations significantly restrict listed companies' communication. (Brysted et al., 2016)
These obligations exist and are essential for investors, as they ensure that investors have accurate
and up-to-date information about the company's operations and the situation on which investment
decisions are based (European Union. European Commission, 2020).
When discussing statutory disclosure obligations, we often reflect that financial reporting is
primarily numerical communication. However, today's investors not only want fact sheets; they
want a deeper understanding of the company, its business model, and opportunities to create
added value. (Laskin & Laskin, 2017) This is why most of the review produced by a company
about its past and future performance is communicated non-numerically, utilizing language
(Hales, Kuang, and Venkataraman, 2010). Listed companies release in addition to their financial
statements, such as equity stories, investor letters, and annual reports (Amer & Maris, 2003),
which contain much numerical communication, but most companies also benefit non-numerical
communication to support the numerical communication in them. (Baginski, Hassell &
Kimbrough, 2003) The purpose of the releases and marketing materials published by listed
companies is primarily to inform investors under the disclosure obligations. These publications
also have another purpose: to sell and market the company with a positive image to its potential
investors (Koskela, 2015).

Even though disclosure obligations aim to enable investors to make rational decisions based on
accurate and reliable information (European Union. European Commission, 2020), a fact is that
one person is by no means able to assess all possible uncertainties and risk factors fully and not
all people are rational decision makers (Baker & Ricciardi, 2014). Research in psychology shows
that directional preferences affect people's ability to process received information and make
decisions. (Kunda, 2004) In other words, people's emotions and cognitive impairments influence
investment decisions. (Teall, 2018) Because of this, numerous studies have emerged during the
past years focusing on non-numerical investor communication. (Baginski, Hassell & Kimbrough,
2003) Especially in financial investor communication, the attention has shifted from numerical
to linguistic and textual elements used in financial communication. (Whitehouse, Palmieri &
Perrin, 2018) In addition to researching non-numerical investor communication usage, the focus
has increasingly emphasized how investors react to non-numerical communication. (Hutton,
Miller & Skinner, 2003)
As research has increased in this field, it has been proven that a company can positively impact
investor behavior with non-numerical investor communication. This argument is supported by
various research which have shown that a company can positively impact both sophisticated and
less sophisticated investors with non-numerical qualitative expressions of magnitude such as
"minimal," "moderate", "remarkable", "substantial increases" or "sizable". (Amer & Maris, 2003)
It has also been proven that a company can benefit from using non-numerical communication to
support the numerical communication when communicating about a company's return
expectations (Baginski et al., 2003) and positively affect stock prices with IR and investor
communication. (Yongshin & Eyun-Jung, 2007) This is why investor communication, in a broad
sense, is an essential part of listed companies' daily processes as it provides possibilities to impact
a company's stock market performance. However, the use of non-numerical communication does
not always end up with a positive impact on investors if the communication is not done correctly.
Factor such as word choice, content, and tone in investor communication has an impact on
investors, which is important for companies to acknowledge. (Amer & Maris, 2003)
Non-numerical communication can be utilized in multiple ways when communicating about a
company's results both positive and negative. Research made by Hales et al. (2010) shows that
even if a company is communicating negative longer-term information, the reception of such
information can be influenced by the right word choices. The study found that if non-numerical
communication utilizes vivid language instead of pallid, the information is received and judged
more positively (Hales et al., 2010). In addition to word choices, how information is presented
also affects investors. Investors' weakness in the rational interpretation of information is also
7

supported by Moreno and Zhang's (2020) study, which found that if a company highlights higher
sales growth in a smaller sector instead of lower sales growth in a larger sector with percentages,
the willingness of investors to invest grows. While it is clear here that the percentage increase
does not reflect the company's actual monetary profit, the investor is nevertheless prone to the
image created for him or her (Moreno & Zhang, 2020). In conclusion, companies can impact
investors and their decision-making with non-numerical communication in various ways if done
correctly.

1.2 Problem definition
Based on my literature review the use of non-numerical communication in investor
communication has been extensively researched e.g. by Baginski et al. In 2003, Amer & Maris
in 2003, Yongshin & Eyun-Jung in 2007, Hales et al. in 2010, Elliot, Rennekamp & White in
2015, Teall in 2018, and Moreno & Zhang in 2020 and has been shown to impact investors’
decisions-making in several ways. It has been researched how the use of non-numerical investor
communication impact investors in annual reports (Amer & Maris, 2003), in news flashes (Hales
et. al., 2010), and in earnings warnings. (Chen & Chang, 2017) However, a research gap still
exists in relation to whether and how the use of in-depth non-numerical communication in equity
stories’ financial and future outlook impact Finnish investors’ investment decisions.
An equity story is a story about a company as an investment case (Ditlevsen, 2012) and its
purpose is to engage investors (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016), and provide the information
investors need for secured investment decisions (Salo, Marika & Jukka Oksaharju, 2019, pp. 418
– 446). Equity Story can be said to be an important part of a soon-to-be listed companies' investor
communication, as it is one of the first marketing materials a company publishes to its potential
investors in the listing process. (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016)
We can argue based on the previous research that the use of non-numerical communication in
investor communication is very relevant for listed companies. This topic is an interesting subject
of research, as we can assume that non-numerical communication has positive impacts when
used in equity stories. However, based on my literature review there is no evidence or deeper
insights on whether the depth of the non-numerical communication used in equity stories’
financial outlook has an impact on investors’ investment decisions. As previous studies have
shown, the use of non-numerical communication must be done correctly as many different
factors, such as the tone, matter and are important in achieving successful investor
8

Janette Murto

communication. (Amer & Maris, 2003) Therefore, it is important to gain solid knowledge of the
impact of the use of in-depth non-numerical communication in equity stories so that companies
can benefit from it the best way possible.
In addition to this, no studies have been conducted in the context of the Finnish stock market.
When discussing non-numerical communication, the tool used is language. (Nogueıra, 2020) The
Finnish Stock Market consists of Finnish companies, which are obligated by the Securities
Markets Act to use one of the official Finnish mother languages, Finnish or Swedish, as the
primary communication and reporting language. (Koskela & Heino, 2016) The language used in
non-numerical communication and the context may influence the impact on investors. Therefore,
this thesis's topic has been chosen to focus on the use of in-depth non-numerical investor
communication in the equity story’s financial outlook and specifically on the Finnish stock
market.

1.4 Research objective and Research questions
The objective of this thesis is to determine whether and how the use of in-depth non-numerical
investor communication in the financial section of an equity story impact investors’ investment
decisions on the Finnish stock market.

The following research questions will be examined to answer the research objective:
Q1: What factors impact investors’ investment decisions?
The objective with this research question is to review the theoretical concepts of how investment
decisions are made, which factors impact investors’ decision-making, what do we mean with
investor communication, its different forms, purpose and importance for both investors and listed
companies, and the relation between investment decisions and investor communication.
Q2: What is the role of non-numerical communication in equity stories?
The objective with this research question is to review the theoretical concept of why and how
non-numerical communication is utilized and can be utilized in equity stories.
Q3: Does in-depth non-numerical communication in the financial statement section of an equity
story impact investor’s investment decision on the Finnish stock market?
9

The objective of this empirical research question is to determine how in-depth non-numerical
investor communication is perceived among investors, whether a listed company can impact an
investor’s investment decision through in-depth non-numerical communication and whether it
gives added value to the investor.
Q4: What are the theoretical and managerial implications for investors and companies in using
non-numerical information to support the numerical information in the financial section of its
equity story?
This normative research question aims to develop recommendations for Finnish soon-to-be listed
companies about the use of non-numerical communication in its equity story.

1.5 Research limitations and delimitations

Empirical delimitation
The research will be limited to the context of the Finnish stock market, i.e., the research will be
carried out more precisely for Finnish investors. Therefore, the sections of the equity story used
as research material and the research questions will be in Finnish.
Although the different investor communication methods will be dealt with in this thesis theory
section, this research's primary focus will be on the equity story. More specifically, on the
financial section of an equity story. Therefore, all the other sections of an equity story will be
omitted in the research materials and questions.

Theory delimitation
This thesis' theoretical chapter focuses on listed and to-be-listed companies’ investor
communication and how investors process this information and what is the relation between
investor communication and investments decisions. As mentioned earlier, investor
communication is a very broad concept consisting of numerical and non-numerical
communication methods, as well as financial and non-financial information content. (Westbrook,
2014) Non-financial factors, such as environmental policies, in investor communication have
been proven to affect firms' market performance (Hoffmann, Fieseler, 2012) and are therefore a
crucial part of investor communication. However, this thesis main focus will be on the use of
10

Janette Murto

non-numerical communication in support of financial information. More specifically, how nonnumerical communication can be utilized in describing financial information. Although nonnumerical communication can be in addition to written text, videos, and photos (Nogueıra, 2020),
the focus will be on written text and so the other non-numerical communication methods, such
as photos and videos, will be excluded from the theoretical chapter. Also, the visual side of
investor communication, such as the use of visual elements, colors, and fonts, will be excluded
from the thesis.

Methods’ delimitation
The objective of this thesis is to determine whether and how the use of non-numerical
communication in the financial section of equity story impacts investment decisions on the
Finnish stock market. The purpose of qualitative research is to understand the significance of a
phenomena. Quantitative research is, of course, able to provide an answer whether the use of
non-numerical communication in the financial section of equity story impacts investment
decisions but is not able to answer the question of how nor give a broader understanding of its
impact. As qualitative research is said to provide a more accurate way to assess cause-and-effect
relationships (Ghauri et. al, 2020), a qualitative semi-structured interview has been chosen as
research method for this study. A qualitative research will enable the study to provide a broader
understanding of how the use of non-numerical communication in the financial section of an
equity story impacts investment decisions. For this reason, quantitative research methods are
excluded from this research.

1.6 Definitions
Listed company: A listed company is a public limited company whose shares are publicly traded
on a stock exchange. All limited companies listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange are public
limited companies in Finland (Minilex, 2020).

Investing: Investing is a process in which we put our desired and available resources to work
while hoping that their value will increase. (Williams, 2011)

11

Janette Murto

Investor communication: Investor communication includes all the communication a company
produces to its audience i.e., investors. According to the National investor Relation Institute’s
Board of Directors (2020), the most effective investor communication is a strategically managed
two-way communication that combines finance, communication, marketing and securities law
compliance.

Equity story: An equity story is a close look at a listed company's business, its operating
environment, growth and development opportunities, competitive position, financial situation,
future earnings development, and the listing's motives and purpose, which is published by the
listing company in the early state of the listing. Equity story’s purpose is to present the company
to prospect investors and to engage them (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016).

Non-numerical communication: Non-numerical information can be texts, videos, and qualitative
information. (Nogueıra, 2020) By qualitative information, we mean descriptive text that can
provide more detailed information about something than numbers. (Slone, 2009) Non-numerical
communication occurs in the communication of listed companies, for example, in their letter to
shareholders, in various analyses, in discussions of the management team, and in all reports that
discuss the company's operation (Amer & Maris, 2003). In other words, non-numerical investor
communication is a qualitative written expression of a company's situation. In addition to these
communication platforms and non-financial information, non-numerical communication is also
used, for example, in financial statements. (Hales et al., 2011) In the context of this thesis, nonnumerical communication refers to a qualitative investor communication, in which written words
are used as a means of financial communication.

Financial statement: Companies' financial statements are high-quality and detailed reports that
should provide a comprehensive and truthful picture of its economic development and position,
and cash flow operations. The financial statements should always include: The company's
income statement, Balance sheet, Cash flow statement, and Statement of equity changes (Aifuwa
& Embele, 2019). When a financial statement is executed in a high-quality manner, it provides
its reviewer with helpful information about the company's situation and thus serves as an essential
and effective tool in financial decision-making (Aifuwa & Embele, 2019).

1. 7 Thesis Structure
The thesis is divided into eight chapters, starting with an introduction chapter where the
background information including previous research, problem definition, research objective and
research questions, research limitations, and delimitations, and definitions of this thesis are
presented. This will be followed by a chapter presenting the contextual background of the thesis.
After the contextual background chapter, the related theory will be presented in more detail. The
theoretical chapter consists of three main sections, the first of which deals with investment
decisions i.e., what are the relevant factors for investors when making investment decisions, what
are the different investment strategies and styles, and what factors impact investors’ investment
decisions. The second section deals with investor communication – its history, purpose and
importance for both investors and companies, the different types of investor communication, and
the most common communication platforms used in investor communication. The final section
of the theoretical chapter focuses more deeply into equity stories. This section will present what
is an equity story, what is the role and importance of it in listing process, what does an equity
story usually contain, and what is the role of financial and non-numerical communication in it.
Chapter four will present the research methodology chosen for the thesis i.e., how the topic is
researched, how the research is carried out, how the research results are analysed, and how valid
the research made is. The research results are presented in chapter five which is then followed
by chapter six where the research results are analysed more in-depth. In the seventh chapter, the
conclusions, theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and future research possibilities
are presented. The last chapter contains a summary of the thesis in Swedish.

2 Contextual background
This chapter reviews the contextual background of this thesis. This chapter is essential as it
provides the basic information needed to understand the theoretical chapter and the research
made and gives the reader a possibility to reflect all the information to the context of the Finnish
stock market. This chapter consists of two sections; overview investing on the Finnish stock
market, and communication regulations of listed companies in Finland, which of the first section
introduces the fundamentals of investing, such as what it means, what different investment
methods and targets exist, why people invest, and an overview of the Finnish stock market - its
historical development, current situation, and significance. The second section reviews the
regulations of listed companies' investor communication. More specifically, which different
parties regulate listed companies' communication, and what these regulations are, which gives a
14

good basis for the theory of investor communication, the research made, and helps the reader to
understand the limitations there is regarding investor communication.

2.1 Investing on the Finnish stock market
In short, investing is often a long-term process in which we put our desired and available
resources to work while hoping that their value will increase. (Williams, 2011). Investment
options can be divided into direct and indirect investments. Direct investment means that a person
independently decides on an investment, which is usually a security. (Kontkanen, 2009, pp. 109
as cited in Kallunki, Martikainen & Niemelä, 2002). Security is a tradable claim, for example,
the assets of a company, institution, or individual. Many different types of securities exist, such
as debt securities, equity securities, derivative securities, commodities, and currencies. In this
thesis, when we discuss securities, we refer to equity securities, as these are the securities that
are bought and sold on the stock exchange. Equity security is, in other words, a holding in a
company or corporation (Teall, 2018).
The word stock market refers to a system in which shares, options and other similar instruments
of companies are issued, bought and sold. (Hoechlin, 2017) It is usually natural for Finnish
companies whose operations are located in Finland to list on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, as it
is beneficial for a company to list in a country where it is already familiar to prospective
investors. (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016) That is why we can claim that the Helsinki Stock
Exchange is very much at the center of the Finnish stock market.
The Helsinki Stock Exchange was founded in 1912. Over the years, many stock exchange
mergers have reached the current situation where the Finnish stock trading centralizes today
mainly on the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Stock Exchange, which was born in 2008 due to the
merger of OMX and NASDAQ (Pörssisäätiö, 2009). The Helsinki Stock Exchange can be seen
as very relevant to the Finnish stock market, both because the Finnish stock market is strongly
concentrated here, but also because of its size, as in December 2020, over 170 companies
(Nasdaq Nordic, 2020) with a total market value of EUR 289.4 billion were listed on the
NASDAQ OMX Helsinki. During 2020, 131,840 stock exchange transactions took place per day
(Nasdaq Nordic, 2021). The chart below shows the development of the market value of publicly
traded share issuers on the NasdaqOMX Helsinki Stock Exchange during 2020 and 2021. As the
chart shows, the NasdaqOMX Helsinki Stock Exchange's market value had fluctuated somewhat
in 2020, but there has been apparent growth in recent months. In conclusion, however, we can
15

Janette Murto

say that the NasdaqOMX Helsinki Stock Exchange moves much money, so it is an integral part
of the Finnish economy.

Finnish private investors and their investment behavior
The Finnish stock market is essential not only for Finnish companies but also for individuals
investing there. The Finnish stock market is a significant part of the daily lives and finances of
many Finns, as according to Euroclear Finland (2021), the Finnish National Central Securities
Depository, and the official Administrator of the digital share register, in March 2021, a total of
190,772 active share savings account were registered in Finland for Finnish individuals. From
these active share savings accounts, investments have been allocated to both Finnish and foreign
listed shares. However, the total market value of all accounts for Finnish listed shares was EUR
966,416,753. In other words, EUR 966,416,753 of the assets of Finnish individuals were invested
in Finnish listed companies. At the end of March, 906,499 shares in companies in the book-entry
system were owned by Finnish private individuals. (Euroclear, 2021a) Finnish households own
21% of all Finnish shares. In comparison, companies own only 13%, while financial and
insurance institutions own 9%. The most significant holding percentage is in the Nominee
Register, which owns 39% of all Finnish shares. (Euroclear, 2021d)
The investment trend in Finland can be described as growing, as the number of Finnish investors
has been only growing in the past year and four months. (Euroclear, 2021b) The chart below
shows how the number of Finnish investors has developed in 2020, as well as during JanuaryApril 2021.

Figure 3. Development of the number of Finnish shareholders (Euroclear, 2021b)
Finnish investors can be found in every age group, both women and men. However, at least still in 2021,
men dominate the investing by owning 67% in listed companies, while the number of Women's
investments is clearly at a lower level of 33% (Euroclear, 2021c). The largest age group of Finnish
investors is 18-29-year-olds in both men and women. The second-largest investor age group is 30-39year-olds, and the third-largest investor age group is 40-49-year-olds. In contrast, the minor investor age
groups are under 17 and over 60-year-olds (Euroclear, 2021a). More detailed information can be found
on the gender and age distribution among Finnish investors in the tables below.

(Euroclear, 2021a)

Although the figure above shows that the most significant investor groups are Finns aged 18-49,
the amounts invested still differ considerably from these amounts. The figure below shows how
17

Janette Murto

Finnish share savings accounts' market value varies according to different age groups and
genders. The graph shows that although more male investors are women in every age group,
there is an even more significant difference in the sums invested. There is also a clear difference
between different age groups. For example, investors over the age of 60, whose share savings
accounts' number is smaller than, those belonging to the age of 50-59. The market value of
investments over the age of 60 and over is higher than in the age group of 50-59 (Euroclear,
2021a). In other words, share savings accounts alone do not tell which age groups' investors are
more critical to listed companies, but the sum of these should be taken into account too.

Investment behavior of Finnish investors
The Finnish Stock Savers Association carried out a study for 1920 Finnish investors, which
examined the investment behavior of Finnish investors in more detail. According to this study,
Finnish investors have the most experience in listed shares and mutual funds. 50% of these
respondents' direct equity investments were geographically located in Finland. Finnish investors
also described their investment style, of which the most considerable investment style was Buy
and Hold investments, and the second largest was dividend investment (Suomen osakessästäjät
ry, 2020). In summary, we can state that the most familiar and central investment style for Finnish
investors is long-term buy and hold-style listed equity investments.

2.2 Communication regulations of listed companies in Finland
As it turned out in the previous section, investing has gained tremendous popularity among Finns
and is a significant issue in Finnish finances. Therefore, we can state that the safety of
investments and the safeguarding of investment decisions are also important, which can be
influenced by regulated investor communications. Therefore, the communication of Finnish
listed companies is significantly restricted by existing laws, regulations, and recommendations.
The purpose of which is to enable investors and market participants to receive correct, up-todate, and sufficient information about the company's real and accurate situation (Suomen
pörssisäätiö, 2016). The European Union has been for over the last thirty years one of the
significant forces regarding financial reporting of Finnish listed companies. The EU has set many
different regulations regarding financial reporting in member states, including Finland, with the
goal of achieving more consistent reporting between these states (Flower & Ebbers, 2018, pp.
198-201). In addition to the EU, five other parties regulate the reporting of Finnish listed
companies. The five parties that regulate the reporting in Finland are:
1. the EU Market Abuse Regulation MAR and Commission regulations issued
pursuant to Regulation 20 and other EU-level regulations supplementing the MAR
Regulation
According to MAR, the market can generally be abused in three ways:
1. with insider trading
2. by releasing information without correct permissions
3. by manipulating markets.
The purpose of the Market Abuse Regulation MAR is to protect investors by increasing
the transparency of financial markets and thereby prevent these three abuses that
weaken investors’ investment decisions (European Parliament, Council of the European
Union, 2014).
2. the Securities Market Act, 746/2012 and the Financial Supervision Authority Act,
878/2008
The Securities Markets Act is a Finnish law regulating public offering, disclosure
obligations in the securities market, public takeover bids, prevention, and control of
securities market abuse. (Securities Markets Act 2012/746 § 1) The Financial Supervision
Authority Act, 878/2008 is also a Finnish law. Its purpose is the stable operation of credit,
insurance, pension institutions, and other institutions subject to supervision required by
19

Janette Murto

the stability of the financial markets, the protection of the insured's interests, and the
general confidence in the financial markets' functioning (Financial Supervision Authority
Act 2008/878 § 1).
3. Ministry of Finance’s Regulation on regular disclosure obligations for securities
issuers 1020/2012
Regular disclosures include, for example, semi-annual reports, financial statements and
annual reports published by listed companies. This regulation issued by the Ministry of
Finance defines the content of these publications as well as the manner in which the
information should be presented (Ministry of Finance’s Regulation on regular disclosure
obligations for securities issuers 1020/2012).
4. Guidance from ESMA (the European Securities and Markets Authority),
Financial supervision and stock exchange
ESMA, the European Securities and Markets Authority, is a supernational securities
regulatory body that regulates EU securities markets. (Teall, 2018) ESMA aims to
improve investor protection and financial market stability, as well as their proper
functioning. (European Union, 2021). ESMA has the right to develop technical standards
and guidelines for both authorities and market participants. It has the right to obtain
information from competent authorities or market participants, as appropriate, whether
or not they comply with guidelines and standards set by ESMA (European Securities and
Markets Authority, 2021). In addition to investors, ESMA's activities also benefit the
economy, citizens, securities regulators, the financial services industry as a whole,
financial service providers, and users of financial markets. (European Union, 2021)
5. The Corporate Governance Code published by the Securities Market Association
As mentioned earlier, the disclosure of listed companies is governed by a number of
different laws and regulations. However, not all of these laws are complete, which is why
they are supplemented by the recommendations contained in the Securities Market
Association's Corporate Governance Code (Avopaperimarkkinayhdistys, n.d.).
Disclosure obligations
In Finland, companies are required to disclose information from the day they apply to the stock
exchange for permission to issue securities intended for trading. In other words, all the laws,
regulations, and recommendations of the regulators mentioned above apply not only to
20

Janette Murto

companies that have already been listed in the Finnish stock exchange but also to companies that
will soon be listed (Pörssisäätiö, 2016).
Companies' disclosure obligations can be divided into two main sections; Regular disclosure
obligations, and Ongoing disclosure obligations (Pörssisäätiö, 2016). Regular disclosure refers
to the company's regular financial reporting. (Pörssisäätiö, 2016) Finnish listed companies'
financial reporting is mainly defined by the Finnish Securities Market Act, which is based on EU
regulations. According to that law, all companies domiciled in Finland are subject to a regular
disclosure obligation (Securities Markets Act 2019/511 Chapter 7 §1). The regular disclosure
obligation specifies that the company is required to publish the financial statements and the Board
of Directors' report no later than four months after the end of the financial year. The Securities
Markets Act also stipulates that the published financial statements and the Board of Directors'
report must be accurate and give a true and fair view of its results of operations and financial
position (Securities Markets Act 2015/1278 Chapter 7 §5). In addition to the financial statements
and the board of directors' report, a listed company that issues shares, equity securities, or similar
securities must also publish a semi-annual report for the first six months of the financial year no
later than three months after the end of the reporting period (Securities Markets Act 2015/1278
Chapter 7 §10)
The ongoing disclosure obligations, on the other hand, determines the disclosure of inside
information. Inside information generally means information that has a direct effect on the
instruments traded by the company. Insider information can, for example, be issues of securities,
significant acquisitions, financial difficulties or credit losses of the company, changes in the
board or management of the company, research findings relevant to the business, or relevant
changes in expected results, financial position or future outlook. In addition to these, many
general recommendations exist which are not as binding as the law. However, listed companies
should also follow these recommendations the same way as the law in its investor
communications (Pörssisäätiö, 2016).
In addition to disclosure obligations, soon-to-be-listed and listed companies should also be aware
in their investor communication and marketing materials published that they should not disclose
information that is contrary to good practice, inappropriate, untrue or misleading. Such
information may include the publication of purely false information, the veracity of which can
be verified, the creation of misconceptions and perceptions about a particular matter, or the
emphasis on irrelevant matters (HE 157/1988).

21

Janette Murto

However, Finnish listed companies’ investor communication is not limited to the disclosure
obligations, as companies are entitled to decide whether they want to share more information
with their target group than is required by these laws, recommendations, and regulations.
Companies are also free to decide how the information is presented. For example, if a company
wants to present visual graphs, images, and written text in addition to numbers, this is allowed.
However, the regulations, laws, and recommendations needs to be followed also in the marketing
and other materials published by the company (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016).

2.4 Summary
This chapter presented the Finnish stock exchange market in more depth - where investing takes
place physically, the size of the Finnish stock exchange market, how much of Finns belong to
investors, and what kind of investor behavior can be found among Finns. In addition to this, this
chapter also dealt with the laws, regulations, and recommendations in use in Finland to define
the investor communications of listed companies while ensuring safe and truthful investment
decisions.
In summary, we can conclude that the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Stock Exchange, where Finns
mainly invest, is very significant and continues to grow all the time. The Finnish stock exchange
market is essential for Finnish companies listed there, enabling them to raise funding and for
Finnish individuals investing in these listed companies. This argument is supported by the fact
that in March 2021, EUR 966,416,753 of the assets of Finnish individuals were invested in
Finnish listed companies (Euroclear, 2021a).
Finnish investors' most familiar and central investment style is long-term buy and hold-style
listed equity investments, which are mostly targeted at Finnish companies. Therefore, we can
state that the safety of investments and the safeguarding of investment decisions are critical,
influenced by regulated investor communications. In Finland, five parties regulate the reporting
of Finnish listed companies, which are the EU Market Abuse Regulation MAR and Commission
regulations issued pursuant to Regulation 20 and other EU-level regulations supplementing the
MAR Regulation, the Securities Market Act, 746/2012 and the Financial Supervision Authority
Act, 878/2008, Ministry of Finance’s Regulation on regular disclosure obligations for securities
issuers 1020/2012, Guidance from ESMA (the European Securities and Markets Authority),
Financial supervision and stock exchange, and The Corporate Governance Code published by
the Securities Market Association. In conclusion, all of the laws and guidelines specify that listed
22

Janette Murto

companies must disclose all relevant matters that have any bearing on the company, its business,
and the market environment.
The information provided in this chapter helps us better understand what restrictions Finnish
companies have in their investor communications and what Finnish investors are like. When this
information is available to us, we will be better able to reflect on the theories of the following
chapter on the Finnish market and the Finnish investors and their investment behavior. The
information in this section also facilitates the conduct of the research, as we have precise
information on what kind of investor communications shall be published in the equity stories of
Finnish companies and what kind of target group should be selected for the research.

3 Theoretical framework
In this chapter, relevant theories and theoretical frameworks for this thesis will be presented. The
first section deals with investment decisions, i.e., the relevant factors for investors when making
investment decisions, the different investment strategies and styles, and what factors impact
investors’ investment decisions. After this, the concept of investor communication will be
presented. This section presents the history, the different types of investor communication, the
most common communication platforms used in investor communication, and the role and
importance of investor communication for companies. The final section of the theoretical chapter
focuses more deeply on equity stories. This section will present an equity story, the role, and
importance of it in the listing process, what an equity story usually contains, and the role of
financial and non-numerical communication in equity stories.

3.1 Investment decisions
The term investment decision, in this study, means an investor's decision to either invest or not
invest in a particular item, such as stocks. Investment decisions depend on many different actors,
such as the expected return on the investment, the price of the investment to be purchased, and
the investor's ability to finance the investment. Central to investment decisions is also the
assessment of the risk associated with the investment i.e., how the investor sees the investment
risk, and how much risk the investor can take (Virlics, 2013).

23

Janette Murto

While investment decisions should be made rationally, investors’ decision-making is a complex
matter also influenced by psychological matters that result in differences and irrationality in
investor behavior. (Pompian, 2012) Even if an investor would receive all the necessary
information about a company and its economic situation, the decision-making would still not be
a straightforward, simple, and rational process as the investment decisions are subjective and
therefore made from the investor's own point of view. Thus, the investor's decision-making
process consists both of an analysis of objective matters, such as the expected return on the
investment, and of the investor's subjective perspective, that is, how the investor thinks
(Pompian, 2012).
To understand how investment decisions are made is an integral part of this thesis as it provides
tools for a more in-depth understanding of future sections and their importance. Suppose it is not
understood how investment decisions are made, there is no good basis for understanding investor
communication's significance and impact on the investment decisions.

3.1.1 Factors relevant in investment decisions
Investment decisions depend largely on the expected return on investment. To analyse this, an
objective analysis of the company’s real situation is needed (Virlics, 2013) Company analysis is
a complex matter that seeks to determine the future value of a company. A valuable company
can be defined as being capable of generating high cash flows which is enabled by the ability to
grow the company’s business and generating a healthy return on invested capital (ROIC) (Koller,
Goedhart & Wessels, 2010, pp. 103).
When predicting a company’s future value, it is essential to understand a company's past.
Therefore, when investors aim to predict companies' future, an accurate analysis of companies’
historical success is usually used for this purpose. The main factors investors usually focus on
are ROIC and revenue growth. In addition to this, the analysis should also focus on company
trends that should be compared to competitors to have a reasonable forecast of future cash flow
developments. These factors mentioned above are purely financial factors. However, nonfinancial factors also play a crucial part on a company’s future. Therefore, many investors
analyse also the non-financial factors, which can give important insights about a company's
situation and differences in relation to its competitors (Koller et al., 2010, pp. 165-171).
Once the value of the company has been analysed, the next step is commonly to determine the
value of the equity, i.e. to determine whether the equity is underpriced, proportionate or
24

Janette Murto

overpriced. (Koller et al., 2010, pp. 117). Due to the uncertainty and volatility of stock prices,
there is always some level of risk in investing. Therefore, risk assessment is also an integral part
of companies' analysis and investment decisions. (Lettau & Ludvigson, 2010). Many different
analyses have been used over time to measure risks, such as: Gap Analysis, Duration Analysis,
Scenario Analysis, Portfolio Theory, and the VaR (value at risk), of which VaR is one of the
most widely used methods of measuring risk. The VaR is used to measure and describe potential
losses. What makes VaR particularly effective is its ability to measure the correlation between
different risks, which allows it to provide more comprehensive and accurate information on
potential risks (Dowd, 2007, pp. 5-14). Once the magnitude of the risk has been determined, the
next step is to analyse one's own risk tolerance. In other words, how great probability of loss the
investor can endure (Kontkanen, 2009, p. 107 as cited in Kallunki et al., 2002).

3.1.2 Investment strategies and styles
As mentioned earlier, investors’ decision-making is based on both objective, and subjective
matters, which is why there occur differences in investor behavior, which leads to different
investment strategies and styles. (Pompian, 2012) To understand the basis of how investment
decisions are made, it is vital to understand the different investment strategies and styles in which
the analysis of a company differs a bit from each other. Teall (2018) divided investment styles
and strategies into four main categories, which are: Instrument selection, Portfolio-oriented
investing (Modern Portfolio Theory), Behavioral finance, and Quantitative investing.

Instrument selection
Instrument selection refers to the methods used by investors to select their investment targets.
These instruments can be divided into many different subcategories, but according to Teall, the
four most important of these are value investing, technical investing, momentum investing, and
matching assets and liabilities (Teall, 2018). The fundamental idea of value investing is that all
securities have a ‘true value’ or a value. In value investing, an investor analyses the value of
securities on the basis of income, assets, and leverage. The basis for an investment decision in
this model is that a security should be invested if its value is higher than the market price, while
it should be sold if its value is lower than the market price. Technical investing, on the other
hand, is based on securities prices and market history. In this model, it is believed that history
repeats itself, which is why historical events are given much weight. Technical investing looks
25

Janette Murto

for models that are analysed to predict future events. Momentum investing believes in the herd
behavior mentioned earlier. Herd behavior can significantly increase or decrease the price of a
security. Momentum investing usually monitors either the price fluctuations of a security or the
company's performance. On a momentum investing basis, an investor seeks to monitor these herd
behaviors and invest in securities on this basis at the right time. Whereas, matching assets and
liabilities refer to the investor's way of managing assets and cash flows to reduce or hedge the
risk of failing to meet liability obligations. (Teall, 2018).
As societal challenges, such as climate change, international migration flows, and economic
disparities and private investors' awareness of them has increased, the responsibility of fixing
these societal problems is no longer seen as only companies' duty, but also individuals' impact
on these matters has been understood. As a result, investors' interest in socially responsible
companies has grown as this has been seen as an excellent opportunity for individual investors
to impact these societal problems. The interest in socially responsible listed companies has
created a significant new subcategory called impact investing. The main idea of impact investing
is that a private investor chooses socially responsible companies for his/her investment portfolio.
By investing in socially responsible companies, a private investor can support its operations and
thus make its own contribution to solving social problems (Spiess-Knafl & Scheck, 2017, P. 210).

Portfolio-oriented investing (Modern Portfolio Theory)
Modern Portfolio Strategy is a degree-wide investment strategy that combines many different
investment theories. Modern Portfolio Strategy believes that the component instrument and risk
are strongly interlinked to the investment result (Teall, 2018). With portfolio, we mean a list of
an investor's investments. In other words, if an investor has several different investments, these
are collectively referred to as the investment portfolio (Francis & Kim, 2013, p. 1). In the Modern
Portfolio Strategy, much emphasis is placed on diversification, the basic idea of which is that the
investor's investment portfolio consists of several different securities that have been purchased
from highly different companies. This will ensure that although some securities perform weaker,
other better-performing securities will balance the performance (Teall, 2018). While a diversified
portfolio is a fairly simple idea, it still requires skill to manage it to reap its benefits in the desired
way. (Francis & Kim, 2013, p. 1)

26

Janette Murto

Behavioral finance
As mentioned earlier, many investors act rationally, but this is not the case for nearly all investors.
According to different research, investors’ investment decisions are influenced by, for example,
how the information is received, investor’s feelings, herd behavior, and the investor's
perspectives (Teall, 2018). In behavioral finance, the focus is on the application of psychology
to finance. In other words, how individual-level cognitive biases affect investor behavior.
(Hirshleifer, 2015)

Quantitative investing
Quantitative investing differs from the investment styles mentioned above as it deals more with
the investment approach. At the heart of this approach is the use of computers in making
investment decisions (Teall, 2018). Computers can take advantage of various mathematical
models and algorithms to find the best risk-return trade-off available in the market. (Fabozzi,
Focardi & Kolm, 2010, p. xi) In other words, in quantitative investment approach investors utilize
computers to find information about the worst- and best-performing securities, which will be
then used as a basis for the investment decisions. (Teall, 2018)

3.1.3 Factors impacting investment decisions
When discussing investment decisions, one often focuses only on the traditional financial
concepts. However, investment decisions are a more complex process, influenced by many
factors (Nofsunger, 2017). As mentioned earlier, investors’ investment decisions are impacted
not only by the objective matters but also by the investor's subjective perspective. (Pompian,
2012) The subjective perspective of an investor is a sum of various different psychological
factors (Pompian, 2012), and how investor process the information received. (Widger, et al.,
2014) In other words, we are prone to our cognitive errors, heuristics, prejudices, and emotions
that have a significant impact on the investment-decisions we make (Nofsunger, 2017). We want
to think we are rational decision-makers when it comes to investing. However, the fact is that not
all investors are rational (Baker & Ricciardi, 2014) and thus are prone to psychological factors
that unfortunately often harm investment decisions. (Nofsunger, 2017)
To begin with, even if an investor would receive all the necessary information about a company
and its economic situation to form an accurate view of the company’s future value, a decision27

Janette Murto

making is still not a straightforward, simple, and rational process (Pompian, 2012). Today,
computers and various investment algorithms can be used as investment aids. However, the final
investment decision is usually made by a person. No matter how much relevant data an investor
has at their disposal, our minds' search functions are nowhere near perfection. Impairment of
human search functions is referred to among psychologists as "availability heuristic".
Availability heuristic refers to situations where the human mind cannot always decide or predict
something flawlessly like a computer, as our mind retrieves the one that comes to mind most
easily (Widger, Crosby & Widger, 2014).
In addition to "availability heuristic", framing, i.e., the simplification of information, affects the
decision-making and response to the information received. In other words, the way the
information is presented to us - whether one and the same information is presented in a positive
or negative light - dramatically influences the human mind and the response to knowledge.
Although common sense says that the result of a company or the financial profit achieved is the
same, a person reacts to it differently depending on how this information is presented to him or
her (Widger, et al., 2014). Why this is essential information for companies is that the same
information can be presented to an investor in multiple ways. However, the outcome of how the
information received can be reacted in multiple ways.
When we have a lot of information at our disposal, whether received correctly or incorrectly,
making investment decisions is still a complex process. How investors react to the information
received is affected by two psycholocial issues; cognitions, i.e., how investors think, and
emotions, i.e., how people feel. (Pompian, 2012) According to Classical decision theory, rational
investors can assess various risk factors and uncertainty and make the best possible investment
decision based on these informations. However, the fact is that one person is by no means able
to assess all possible uncertainties and risk factors fully, and not all people are rational, which is
why the theory is not entirely seamless (Baker & Ricciardi, 2014).
Investors’ emotions and cognitive impairments influence investment decisions. This issue is also
recognized among economists, which they have been benefited for more than two hundred years.
Although academic models suggest that prudent investors produce most of the market prices,
many irrational investors cannot be ignored, as the extent to which these academic models reflect
the truth cannot be shown (Teall, 2018). In Minow's (editor and co-founder of Corporate Library)
words, ‘’Markets do not run on the money; they run on trust.” (cited in Laskin 2009)
A number of studies have been carried out on this subject, the results of which show, for example,
that investors often react too strongly to the information they receive. Studies have shown that
28

Janette Murto

strong responses arise, especially in the short-term changes, and that decisions are based too
strongly on the latest information. This serves a good example of how a person does not always
act rationally when investing but gives his or her emotions the power to influence the investment
decision (Teall, 2018).
The effect of emotions on investment behavior has been studied extensively, and the results of
the studies have verified that people's emotions influence investment decisions. (Kamstra, et. Al,
(2003) One emotional factor that is also known to influence an investment decision strongly is
overconfidence. In practice, over-reliance means that the investor overestimates his or her
knowledge and potential success rate. While it is often said that making an investment decision
requires extensive knowledge of facts, concepts, and relationships, it also requires an
understanding of one’s way of thinking. Even if a person has at his/her disposal all the facts
related to the company, he/she should also be able to understand his/her own behavior, i.e., how
he/she receives all this information (Teall, 2018). In addition to this, fear also affects a person's
mind and decision-making, so we do not necessarily run things realistically enough when we are
scared (Widger, Crosby & Widger, 2014).
In addition to emotions, people's behavior and decision making are also influenced by herd
behavior. Although herd behavior often works to our advantage in basic everyday decisions, its
results may not be as favorable in investment decisions (Widger, et al., 2014). Herd behavior can
be described in investing as an event in which investors' behavior correlates with each other. In
other words, investors begin to imitate other investors, leading to similar behavior by a large
mass (Khan, Hassairi & Viviani, 2011). Herd behavior often occurs in uncertain times when
changes in the stock markets occur in a rapid phase. Fear and uncertainty also play a significant
role in decision-making, so decisions are not always made realistically enough in uncertain times.
(Widger et al., 2014) Critical events such as the Covid-19 negatively affect the global economy
through declining consumer demand and freezing supply chains. This is an example of when
investors have a fear of the future because of its uncertainty (Ramelli & Wagner, 2020), and may
react strongly to short-term changes (Teall, 2018), which has can lead to herd behavior. This
statement is also supported by a study published by Espinosa-Méndez and Arias in 2021, which
showed strong evidence that COVID-19 had a positive effect on the increase in herd behavior in
European capital markets. (Espinosa-Méndez & Arias, 2021)
This to be said, it is vital for listed or to-be-listed companies to understand the importance of
investors’ subjective decision-making. Many investors are unaware of how their cognitive
impairments affect their ability to think, so they cannot control them when making investment
29

Janette Murto

decisions. The unawareness of one's behavior gives listed companies the possibility to impact
investors' behavior and decision-making by the information presented to them. That is why this
subject is a crucial matter for listed companies to understand (Pompian, 2012).

3.2 Investor communication
Investor communication is a broad concept that includes all the information content that a listed
or soon-to-be listed company provides to its target group i.e., prospective and present investors,
analysts and stakeholders. Investor communications usually consists of the disclosure of financial
and non-financial, historical, current and future information about a company through various
media, with the purpose of maintaining and establishing relationships with its target audience
(Dolphin, 2004). As investor communication has clear goals it can be described as strategic
communication (Laskin & Laskin, 2017) designed to achieve a desired goal. (Hallahan,
Holtzhausen & Ruler, 2007) The goal of strategic communications can generally be, for example,
a larger market share or a more positive reputation. When communication is strategic, it is usually
very carefully planned, proactive, and focused on the company’s goals (Holtzhausen, 2014).
When discussing investor communication it is impossible not to mention investor relations (IR),
as investor communication is often referred to as investor relations. (Dolphin, 2004) Whereas,
investor relations is referred to as financial public relations (Grunig & Hunt, 1984). According
to the National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI), investor relations is ‘’Enhancing corporate
value through effective communication’’. (NIRI (as cited in Laskin, 2009)) Whereas, IR and
financial communication together are strategic management responsibilities that combine
finance, communication, marketing, and securities law compliance, which both aim to achieve
fair valuation to company's securities (Niri, 2020). While some financial communication
professionals clarify the matter more shortly and concisely: Investor relations and financial
communication is “a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial
relationships between organizations and their investors” (Laskin & Laskin, 2017). In other
words, investor communication is a tool for creating and taking care of the company's current
and prospect relations with investors. (Laskin & Laskin, 2017)

3.2.1 The history behind investor communication
Investor communication has changed significantly over time. (Laskin & Laskin, 2017) The Dutch
East India Company is said to be the world's first publicly traded company. With the first public
limited company, the need for a stock exchange arose, and thus, the Amsterdam bourse was
founded in September 1602. (Petram, 2014, pp.2-14) With the public sale of shares, the
opportunity for anyone to own shares in companies arose. This also led to the sale and marketing
of the company's ownership. In that time, companies’ shares were sold with ‘’get rich’’ sales
arguments. However, the problem during this period was that the buyers had a low level of
knowledge of the companies’ real situations, which made it almost impossible for them to verify
the marketing information released by the companies about its shares. As a result, many people
lost their money to scams, and public confidence in listed companies was not strong. This was
when the legislation on listed companies and their communication was first created (Laskin &
Laskin, 2017). The Legislation purpose was purely to protect the people from scams, defining
what listed companies can say and what they should at least inform about their activities. The
law then specified that a listed company must publicly disclose at least periodic reports on the
company's financial conditions and provide a business plan and a copy of the securities offered
for sale. This can be described as the period when investor relations and investor communication
began to develop (Laskin & Laskin, 2017).
Investor communication can historically be divided into three significant periods the
Communication era, the Financial Era, and the Synergy Era. The first period is called the
Communication era, which ran from 1945-1975. In this first era, “new” professions and
professional titles, such as the Investor Relations Officer, began to emerge from investor
communication. This has been a giant leap for investor communication, but still, the purpose of
investor communication was very different from the current one. At the time, investor
communication focused primarily on promotion and disclosure, and the communication was very
one-way. The second period is called the Financial Era, which runs from 1975 to 2005. During
this period, Investor communication emerged as two-way, and the purpose of communication
was to create a high valuation for the company. The third and current period is called the Synergy
Era, which has begun in 2005 and is still ongoing. During this period, communication direction
is still two-way and can be described as a dialogue between the company and the investors
(Laskin & Laskin, 2017).
Today, investor relations and maintaining them are no longer seen as a necessary evil but as an
act that can significantly improve a company’s competitiveness. The purpose of investor
31

Janette Murto

communication has changed from high valuation to fair valuation and the goal is no longer to
benefit only the company but also investors by decreasing the investment risks. (Laskin &
Laskin, 2017). Today the focus of investor communication is more on building and maintaining
relationships with the investors than just releasing obligatory financial reports (Laskin, 2009) as
today’s investors do not just want fact sheets; they want a deeper understanding of the company,
its business model, and opportunities to create added value. (Laskin & Laskin, 2017)

3.2.2 The purpose and importance of investor communication
Investor communication is a highly important and central matter for soon-to-be and already listed
companies for various reasons. To begin with, listed companies are legally obligated to disclose
certain information to the market. (Westbrook, 2014, p. 167) Because of this, the main purpose
of investor communication is to inform investors under the legal disclosure obligations (Koskela,
2015) enabling investors to form an accurate view of the company in question (Westbrook,
2014), and this way to achieve a fair valuation of the company's securities. (Niri, 2020) In
addition to the legal purpose, investor communication also aims to sell and market the company
with a positive image to its potential investors (Koskela, 2015) with the goal of increasing
investors’ interest in the company. (Suomen Pörssisäätiö, 2016)
Listed companies have the full right to determine how and to what extent the information is
presented while respecting the minimum legal requirements. The reason why companies do not
usually limit their investor communication to the legal minimum, is that these minimum
disclosures are usually not enough to answer the "why" question, but merely to inform what kind
of the situation the company has beeneen in the past. In other words, the legally required
minimum amount of information is not able to give investors a broad understanding of the
company's operations and cause-and-effect relationships (Westbrook, 2014, p. 167-168), which
has been proven to be an important matter for investors. (Laskin & Laskin, 2017)
In addition to this, investor communication is also important for companies as it enables them to
impact investors’ investment decisions. Even though the most central factor in investment
decisions is the expected return on investment which is analysed by objective analysis of the
company’s real value (Virlics, 2013), many studies have proven that a company can impact
investors’ investment decisions through investor communication (Yongshin & Eyun-Jung, 2007)
as investors are not always rational (Pompian, 2012) and are prone to psychological factors that
unfortunately often harm investors’ rational decision-making. (Nofsunger, 2017) In other words,
32

Janette Murto

if investor communication is produced strategically and successfully, it is an essential tool that
can contribute to a company's success in the stock market, which makes the importance of
investor communication even greater (Yongshin & Eyun-Jung, 2007).
Although investor communication and its possibilities have gotten more attention in the past
years, many companies still have room for improvement in implementing it. Laskin, 2009) If
investor communication is confined to the limits set by law, the company will not be able to
exploit the full potential. (Westbrook, 2014, p. 167-168) According to Laskin's study in 2009,
the focus of investor communication is still on the wrong place in too many listed companies as
they do not know how to combine financial reporting and investor marketing.

3.2.3 The different types of investor communication
Investor communication can be divided into non-numerical and numerical information, and the
contents of it can be divided into non-financial and financial information (Westbrook, 2014).
Financial disclosures has its roots in far back to 1600 which ultimate purpose of has been from
the very beginning to monitor the performance of corporate executives (Macve, 2020). Gibbins,
Richardson & Waterhouse (1992), defined the term financial disclosure as follows:
“Financial disclosure is the release outside the organization of information concerning the
economic performance, position or prospects of the organization, particularly as measured in
financial terms.” (Gibbins et al. 1992)
Financial information is most commonly presented in the company’s financial statement (Aifuwa
& Embele, 2019) and the Board of Directors' report (Minilex, n.a.). Companies' financial
statements are high-quality and detailed reports that should provide a comprehensive and truthful
picture of their economic development and position, and cash flow operations. Financial
statements should always include the company's income statement, balance sheet, cash flow
statement, and statement of changes in equity (Aifuwa & Embele, 2019). When a financial
statement is executed in a high-quality manner, it provides its reviewer with helpful information
about the company's situation and thus serves as an essential and effective tool in financial
decision-making (Aifuwa & Embele, 2019). Whereas, companies’ board of director’s reports are
documents prepared in connection with the financial statements, which contains much nonnumerical information, while the financial statements generally consist of purely numerical
information. The annual report is a legally required document, the content requirements of which
are defined by law. The annual report must include events relevant to the company's operations
33

Janette Murto

(Minilex, n.a.). According to the Companies Act, the report of the board of directors must at least
include a description, if the company has become a parent company, it has merged or split,
possible increase in share capital and its details, and a presentation of the company’s actions
regarding the company’s profit or loss. (Companies Act 2006/624, Chapter 8 §5 - §8) In
summary, financial information presents a company’s financial condition, such as the company’s
return, losses (Aifuwa & Embele, 2019), and the factors that affect these. (Companies Act
2006/624, Chapter 8 §5 - §8)
We often reflect that financial disclosure is primarily numerical communication. With numerical
communication we mean information presented with numbers. However, today's investors do
not just want fact sheets; they want a deeper understanding of the company, its business model,
and opportunities to create added value. (Laskin & Laskin, 2017) This is why most of the review
produced by a company about its past and future performance is communicated non-numerically,
utilizing language (Hales, Kuang, and Venkataraman, 2010).
At this point, it is good to make a small distinction between two similar words non-numerical
and non-financial, which can easily be confused with each other. Non-numerical information is
a way of communication (Nogueira, 2020), while non-financial refers more to the content of the
information, i.e., what topic the text deals with. Non-numerical communication occurs in the
communication of listed companies, for example, in their letter to shareholders, in various
analyses, in discussions of the management team, and in all reports that discuss the company's
operation (Amer & Maris, 2003). In addition to these communication platforms non-numerical
communication is also used in the financial statements published by the listed companies. (Hales
et al., 2011) Although the law obliges companies to disclose several different information, such
as the financial statements, the investor never has the same information about the company as
the managers of the company being invested have (McKinsey & Company Inc. et al., 2015, pp.
23-24). The financial statements do not give a complete picture of the economic situation of the
company (Huang, Teoh & Zhang, 2014). This is why non-numerical communication is a crucial
addition to numerical communication, as numbers cannot tell everything. (McKinsey &
Company Inc. et al., 2015, pp. 23-24) In other words, non-numerical investor communication is
in many cases a qualitative written expression of a company's situation. (Hales et al., 2011)
In addition to financial information, also non-financial factors play a crucial part in investor
communication. Non-financial information is clearly a newer familiarity with investor
communication, which has only become more common among listed companies in recent years.
Non-financial information is generally information external to financial statements and may deal
34

Janette Murto

with, for example, corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies and
performance, which are published in voluntary corporate social responsibility and sustainability
reports (Eccles, Serafeim & Krzus, 2011). In other words, non-financial information focuses
more on the company's policies instead of the company’s financial factors.
In summary, we can state that the types of communication can be divided purely into two:
communication methods and communication content. The two methods of communication are
numerical and non-numerical, while the communication content can be financial or nonfinancial. Both methods of communication can be utilized to communicate both financial and
non-financial content. In other words, a company's financial statement, which is financial
information, can be informed both numerically and non-numerically in the form of text, images,
and videos. The figure below visualizes the different types of communication and clarifies their
differences, making it easier to understand them.

3.2.4 Investor communication platforms
Listed companies publish many different communication materials and use several different
communication platforms to publish them. Over the years, investor communication has shifted
strongly to web-based communication platforms, which is why paper publications are nowadays
quite rare (Guggenmos & Bennett, 2021). Investor communications publications include, for
example, annual reports, Letter to investors, Press Releases, and equity stories, all of which
contain extensive information about the company's operations, both numerically and nonnumerically, and including both financial and non-financial information. In this section, the most
common investor communication publications and platforms are presented in more detail.
Annual report is a report about a company’s previous 12 moths published in printed and/or
electronic form. Annual reports are part of the communication under the disclosure obligation of
public limited companies, which is why they originally included mere informative and difficultto-understand data. (Stittle, 2003, pp.xiii-3) Over time, annual reports have evolved into visual
communication platforms that (Havemo, 2018) are understandable, in addition to the experts of
the field, also for the general public. Today, annual reports continue to publish statutory
accounting statements, but in addition to these, they also contain extensive amount of nonnumerical information on the company's operations and its situation. Annual reports are an
important part of public limited companies' daily lives, not only because these are obligated by
the laws to be published but also as they enable companies to create a wider and positive image
of the company through numbers, text, and images (Stittle, 2003, pp.xiii-3).
Annual reports always include a statutory financial statement consisting of the following
sections: The profit and loss account, The balance sheet, The cash flow statement, and The
statement of total recognized gains and losses. (Stittle, 2003, pp. 3-4). However, the financial
statement is only a small part of companies’ annual reports, as in addition to this, it serves as a
communication platform for what is behind these numbers. (Stittle, 2003, p. 4) The financial
statement is usually followed by a section explaining the accounting treatment of accounting
policies, turnover, fixed assets, depreciation, stock, foreign currency, financial instruments,
taxation, leases, pension costs etc. (Stittle, 2003, pp. 41-42). In other words, annual report opens
to enlighten the public about the company’s operating information, which can be used to more
broadly describe how the company operates, why the numbers are the way they are and in what
direction the company is heading (Stittle, 2003, p. 4).
In addition to the financial statement and their descriptions, annual reports can also report on
corporate responsibility (Stittle, 2003, p. 4), which is non-financial (Tarquinio, Posadas, 2020)
36

Janette Murto

and optional non-required information. (Stittle, 2003, p. 181) Although reporting on
responsibility, such as political, social, and environmental responsibility, in annual reports is not
required by law, it is nevertheless important and central information about the company,
especially as public awareness grows all the time. When climate change issues threaten our
environment, it is important for the company to inform about its own responsibility, as
responsible operations have direct and indirect effects on the company's quality and community
life, both corporate and national economic development (Stittle, 2003, p. 181-182).
Investor letters and press releases are also at the heart of investor communication. Investor letters
are purely addressed to investors and usually contains additional information about the company.
(Kiattikulwattana, 2019) Whereas, press releases are one of the core communication platforms
for corporate earnings releases. (Davis, Davis, Piger & Sedor (as cited in Souza & Silva, 2020))
In addition to these, as corporate financial reporting and IR have evolved, the traditional
communication platforms have been accompanied by more modern alternatives, thanks to the
increased use of the Internet (Ramassa, Fabio, 2016). Today, in addition to the traditional
platforms such as investor letters and annual reports, communication also takes place on various
social media platforms, the utilization of which in investor communication has increased over
the last couple of decades. (Alexander & Gentryb, 2014) The use of the internet and social media
has increased the number of communication platforms on which a company can communicate
with its target audience (Ramassa, Fabio, 2016) and it has become an important source of
information for individuals, companies and markets. Aral, Dellarocas & Godes, 2013) Social
media has made it possible to use visual elements such as images and videos on a completely
different scale than before. In addition to visual elements, social media has also changed the form
of communication, enabling more interactive interaction (Ramassa, Fabio, 2016). A company
can use social media to publish both voluntary disclosures and financial statements. In other
words, the possibilities are endless, but at the same time it should taken care of what and how
things are expressed. Even though social media platforms are optimal for creating and managing
relationships and reputation, it also brings its challenges (Ramassa & Fabio, 2016). Interactivity
on social media increases the vulnerability of a company’s reputation as it becomes easier for
people to express their own opinions about the company that are almost impossible for the
company to control (Aula, 2010).
In addition to these communication platforms, several other communication platforms exist, of
which, for example, an equity story is very significant. (Ditlevsen, 2012) In its brevity, an equity
story is a story about a company as an investment case that is released in the first marketing
phases of a listing process. (Finnish Stock Exchange Foundation, 2016) However, this
37

Janette Murto

communication platform will not be discussed further in this section, as it will be discussed in
more detail in the next section.

3.3 Equity story
An equity story, also known as an investment story, informs investors about a company as an
investment case. (Ditlevsen, 2012) An equity story presents company's business, its operating
environment, growth and development opportunities, competitive position, financial situation,
future earnings development, and the listing's motives and purpose that is published in one of the
first marketing phases of a listing. (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016) An equity story has a highly
central part in investor communication and investor relations as its purpose is to engage and
convince investors that the company is worth investing. (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016) In addition
to this, an equity story also provides important information about the company in question for
investors’ for securing their investment decisions. (Salo, Marika & Jukka Oksaharju, 2019, pp.
418 – 446)

3.3.1 The role and importance of equity story
Investor marketing and communications are a major part of a company’s listing process which
is aimed at attracting potential investors and testing the demand for the company being listed.
Listing communications and marketing can be divided into six different phases, which are
preliminary investor meetings, analyst presentations, pilot fishing meetings, pre-marketing,
roadshow, and public marketing (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016). The figure below visualizes the
six stages of marketing and communication in listing process.

Figure 7. Six phases of marketing and communication in listing process. (Suomen pörssisäätiö,
2016)

In the first phase, the company’s management meets with the core investors to introduce the
company and its investment story to engage these core investors. In the second phase, the
company seeks to educate stock analysts about the company and its situation. The third phase is
38

Janette Murto

very similar to the first phase. This is where the company meets selected investors again and
seeks to strengthen its relationship with them, receive feedback from them, and strengthens its
investment story presented in the first phase. In the fourth phase, the company's listing intent is
announced. Stock analysts publish their analyses of the company made in the second phase to
investors. The listed company collects feedback from investors to strengthen the company's
image and valuation. Secondly, in the last stage, the roadshow, the listed company's management
will start meeting with potential investors and collecting equity issuance. In the final stage, the
public marketing of the listed company will be published and started. In practice, this means
publishing the marketing that is visible to each potential investor, for example, the investor
section of the company's website, and all available marketing material is made available to the
public. The last stage aims to maximize the interest of the listing company in front of a larger
audience (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016).
An equity story can be said to be an important part of a soon-to-be listed companies' investor
communication, as it is one of the first marketing materials a company publishes to its potential
investors in the listing process. (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016) As mentioned above, an equity story
has a highly central part in investor communication and investor relations as its purpose is to
engage and convince investors that the company is worth investing. (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016)
In other words, an equity story serves as a platform through which a company can create the
desired image of itself for investors. (Virtanen, 2010) In addition to companies, equity stories are
very important for investors too, because when a company is listed on the stock exchange,
investors may not yet have comparable information about the listed company. Therefore, an
equity story aims to provide the information investors need and to secure the investment itself
(Salo et. al, 2019, pp. 418 – 446).

3.3.2 Content of an equity story
An equity story presents a company as an investment case (Ditlevsen, 2012) which provides
important information about the company in question for investment decisions. (Salo et. al, 2019,
pp. 418 – 446) According to Ditlevsen (2012), the content of a well-functioning and properly
implemented equity story is reliable, compelling, and credible and manages to create a positive
image of the company for the reader of the equity story. According to Etzold and Ramke (2014),
the four value propositions of good equity storytelling can be stated to be: 1. it makes the
company one that stakeholders can easily grasp, 2.it stimulates the imagination of potential
investors, 3. it increases the valuation of the company, and 4. people simply love stories.
39

The content of an investment story is not defined by law, so every company is free to
create its own look and content for its equity story. In other words, every company is
allowed to include the information they want in their equity story in the way they want.
However, although the law does not prescribe the content of equity stories, it must still
comply with the disclosure obligations and the principles of the Securities Markets Act
so that the content of the equity story is not misleading or untrue (Evli Pankki,
Kangasniemi, 2017).
Equity stories are often created around a particular message or topic, depending on
how the company wants the investor to perceive them and what kind of investment the
company sees itself. Because of this, an equity story can be of the type, for example, a
risk management story, a growth story, or a cash-flow story (Virtanen, 2010). Even
though companies are free to determine what kind of equity story they create and
publish, the contents of different companies’ equity stories often have many
similarities. (Pörssisäätiö, 2016) Pörssisäätiö (2016) presented the commonly used
sections of an equity story, which are:
1. Operating environment and market drivers
2. The company's growth and development opportunities
3. The company's competitive position & The company's competitive advantages
4. Financial position, historical and future earnings development
5. Other strengths and elements of the investment story
6. The purpose of the listing arrangement and the use of the funds to be raised
(Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016).
Usually, the equity story begins with an introduction to the operating environment and
market drivers. This section describes the company’s industry, its historical growth,
and the trends affecting its development. In addition to this, the section describes the
company's views on the industry's future, i.e., in which direction the development is
going. And lastly, the entry barriers to describe how easily new competitors can
emerge. The next section of equity story usually focuses on the company's growth and
development, the firm’s strategy and goals, opportunities to strengthen its position,
and potential growth pathways. Next, the equity story reviews the company’s
competitive position, presenting its current competitors and market shares. This is
naturally followed by a section dealing with the company's competitive advantages

Janette Murto

over its major competitors. This section can present how a company’s products or
services meet customer needs, the reasons why the company is chosen over
competitors, how the company’s resources support the company’s growth, and how
the company can respond to potential changes (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016). The
competitive position and competitive advantages are essential parts of an equity story.
Investors are generally very interested in these facts, as investors often seek to invest
in companies with a substantial competitive advantage over other companies in the
industry. (Evli Bank, Kangasniemi, 2017)
The most important section of an equity story, in the context of this thesis's, is the
financial position, historical and future earnings development. The financial section is
an overview of the company's historical and current earnings, as well as future
financial goals. In the financial section, a company can present its key indicators and
how these goals have been achieved so far. If desired, the company's financial
development can also be compared with its competitors, providing the reader with a
benchmark against how the company has succeeded. In addition to this, the financial
section usually presents the company's cash flow and balance sheet position and its
ability to pay dividends, and the dividend payment policy. In addition to the sections
mentioned above, an equity story can also present the strengths specific to the company
in question, strengthening the message of the equity story as a whole. Lastly, the equity
story usually also presents its motive for the listing, i.e., where the money from the
listing is planned to be used and how it will be implemented (Suomen pörssisäätiö,
2016).

3.3.3 The role of non-numerical and financial communication in equity
story
When a company strives to attract new investors, its accountability and trustworthiness
are an essential part of an investment decision that can be improved through
transparent

and

comprehensive

communication.

Indeed,

transparent

and

comprehensive communication means that certain information about the company,
especially financial information, is widely and transparently disclosed to potential
investors (Mazzola, Ravasi & Gabbioneta, 2006).
41

Janette Murto

As mentioned above, an equity story is an extensive presentation of a company's
operations designed to attract potential investors. The whole equity story is generally
based on the company's strategic goals and its financial situation. Thus, it can be said
that financial information is a vital part of creating an equity story. (Mazzola et al.,
2006). However, companies generally do not publish all financial information, which
is why every company has its own disclosure strategy that defines what is published
and when. (Gibbins, Richardson & Waterhouse, 1990) This publishing strategy is also
at the heart of equity story creation, as it also broadly defines the content of the equity
story. In conclusion, financial information plays an essential role in creating the equity
story and the generation of investment decisions, which is why we can argue that
financial communication plays a significant role in equity stories.
Although equity stories inform investors facts about a company, its operations, and
financial situation, the focus should be on how these facts are presented. According to
Ditlevsen (2012), the purpose of an equity story is to present the company in as positive
a light as possible, which is why the equity story, as the name implies, utilizes
qualitative information in the form of non-numerical communication and on many
occasions story telling. When discussing financial disclosures, we often reflect that
companies' financial reporting is primarily numerical communication. However, as
investor communications have evolved over the years, many companies have begun to
produce increasingly strategic and broader investor communications. The results of
which have increased the amount of usage of non-numerical communication.
Nowadays, most of the review produced by a company about its past and future
performance is communicated non-numerically, utilizing language (Hales, Kuang, and
Venkataraman, 2010) as many different studies have proved its positive effects. Equity
story is no exception to the rule, as their contents largely consist of non-numerical
communication.
Non-numerical communication enables companies to describe their situation in more
detail to the investors so that they can make safer investment decisions. However, nonnumerical communication is also utilized from the company’s perspective. The reason
for this is that a company’s financial situation can be influenced to a certain point but
there is no leeway when releasing the financial statement of a company. The current
numbers are how they are and cannot be changed. The only factor that one can impact
the investors with is then the non-numerical information released.

3.4 Summary
This theoretical chapter discussed how investors' investment decisions are made - what
factors are relevant to investment decisions, what investment strategies and styles
investors use, and what factors impact investors' investment decisions. In addition to
this, this chapter also discussed investor communication - what it means, what it is
like, and why it is such an essential part of the daily lives of listed companies. The
final section of this chapter delved deeper into one platform of investor
communication, equity stories – what kind of content they contain, its role in
investment decisions, and the role of financial and non-numerical communication used
in equity stories.
In summary, we can conclude that investors' investment decisions are a complex
process influenced by many different factors. When making an investment decision,
investors pay attention to various issues, such as the future value of the company and
the risks of the investment. However, investors invest with different strategies and
styles. Some investors take advantage of computers in making investment decisions,
while others emphasize the diversification of investments into different investment
targets. On the other hand, others are rational, while others are more prone to their
cognitive errors that influence the formation of investment decisions.
Investor communication generally seek to secure investment decisions, but in addition
to this, it also seeks to influence investors and their investment decisions. In other
words, investor communication serves as a tool to inform investors about the company
as an investment target to create the most realistic but at the same time optimistic and
selling image. Equity story is one of the platforms for investor communication utilized
in the first marketing stages of a listing process. An equity story is a story about a
company as an investment case, which presents its business, operating environment,
growth and development opportunities, competitive position, financial situation, future
earnings development, and the listing's motives and purpose. Central to the equity
story is the presentation of financial information, based on which the structure of the
equity story is usually created. In addition to this, non-numerical communication also
plays a central role in the equity stories, as it enables companies to describe their
situation in more detail to the investors. As Investor communications have Evolved
43

Janette Murto

over the years, many companies have begun to produce increasingly strategic and
broader investor communications. The results of which have increased the amount of
usage of non-numerical communication. Nowadays, most of the review produced by
a company about its past and future performance is communicated non-numerically,
utilizing language (Hales, Kuang, and Venkataraman, 2010) as many different studies
have proved its positive effects. Equity story is no exception to the rule, as their
contents primarily consist of non-numerical communication.
The information provided in this chapter helps us to understand investors, their
investment decisions, and how the right kind of investment communication can impact
them. This information has been utilized in the design and implementation of the
research, which has enabled us to focus on the right factors, creating the right kind of
content for the research materials.

4 Methodology
This chapter gives an overall view of different research methods as well as a more indepth presentation of the research method chosen for the study of this thesis. In
addition to this, the motivation of the research method selection and its benefits will
be presented. After this, this the chapter introduces the data collection method of the
study and how the obtained data are analysed. The final section of this chapter contains
a discussion of the validity and reliability of the research.

4.1 Research method
The research is a qualitative study that utilizes semi-structured in-depth interviews, as
the aim of this thesis is to determine whether and how the use of in-depth nonnumerical communication in the financial section of equity story impact investors’
investment decisions on the Finnish stock market.
The study group consisted of eight participants, all of whom were united by the fact
that each of them had previously invested in direct shares, which could ensure a basic
understanding and an interest in investing. Each study participant had been sent in
44

Janette Murto

advance a short presentation of two fictional companies' businesses and the financial
sections of the two companies' equity stories. One of the equity stories used nonnumerical information to describe the numerical financial information on a deeper
level. In contrast, the second equity story only used non-numerical information to tell
the same facts as the numerical data did but provided no more profound insights into
why the numbers are as they are. The research was conducted through semi-structured
in-depth interviews, aiming to determine the study groups' thoughts and opinions about
these two companies. In other words, the study aimed to determine whether the
widespread use of non-numerical communication had some effect on the willingness
to invest in the company. With the information provided by the study, it is possible to
define and make recommendations as to whether the use of non-numerical
communication is profitable in equity stories or not and to explain in more detail what
is the impact of non-numerical investor communication in equity stories on investors
and their investment decisions.

4.1.1 Qualitative research
Business economic research methods can be divided into qualitative and quantitative
methods (Bell & Bryman, 2017). The choice of research method should depend on the
research problems and the purpose of the research. (Ghauri, Grønhaug & Strange,
2020) The main difference between qualitative and quantitative research is that
quantitative research utilizes measurement, i.e., the research relies heavily on statistics
collected, for example, through a questionnaire, in which case the research responses
are also statistical. (Bell & Bryman, 2017) The focus of quantitative research is usually
on testing and verification of facts and causes. (Ghauri et.al., 2020) In comparison,
qualitative research seeks to understand through an interview, how people understand
and experience a particular phenomenon (Bell & Bryman, 2017).
Qualitative research focuses on understanding something from the perspective of the
research respondent, whereby the generalization of research results takes place by
comparison of properties and contexts of the individual organism. The approach to
qualitative research is interpretation, and the methods of measuring research focus on
observations and measurements in the natural environment (Ghauri et.al., 2020).
According to Bryman & Bell (2018), the key to qualitative research is that it most often
45

Janette Murto

focuses more on words and thoughts than numbers. Indeed, qualitative research
generally focuses more on creating new theories than on testing old ones, however,
there are exceptions to this. What is central to qualitative research is that its purpose is
to elucidate a fundamental understanding of something that is usually examined from
the perspective of the participant, which is why the research results are broader and
provide more information about how the subject is thinking, which is an advantage of
qualitative research.
Quantitative research is, of course, able to provide an answer whether the use of indepth non-numerical communication in the financial section of equity story impacts
investment decisions but is not able to answer the question of how or give a broader
understanding of its impact. As qualitative research is said to provide a more accurate
way to assess cause-and-effect relationships (Ghauri et. al, 2020), a qualitative
research method has been chosen for this study as it will enable the study to provide a
broader understanding of how the use of non-numerical communication in the
financial section of an equity story impacts investment decisions.
Qualitative research can be carried out by many different methods such as
observations, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions. Of these methods, I
have chosen to use in-depth interviews as the method for this study. An in-depth
interview is usually a one-to-one method of data collection, which aims to gather
accurate insights from the perspective of the research issues from the participants. Indepth interviews are used to explore people’s emotions, how people make decisions,
what kinds of people’s perceptions and beliefs are, and what motivates human
behavior (Hennink, Hutter & Bailey, 2020). As this thesis seeks to elucidate what is
the impact of non-numerical communication on investor decision-making, the in-depth
interview is a very well-suited method to be used. Semi-structured interviews are often
used in in-depth interviews (Hennink et al., 2020), which is why this interview
technique has been chosen as the research method of this thesis. The following section
will detail what is meant by semi-structured interviews and how this applies to this
study.

4.1.2 Semi-structured interviews
Interviews are one of Social Science's most widely used data collection techniques.
The interviews can be divided into unstructured interviews, semi-structured
interviews, and structured interviews. In each of these techniques, the purpose is to
interview a person, but the conduct of the interviews and the results differ slightly from
each other. In unstructured interviews, the interviewee is interviewed more with a
conversational style, which does not have to be very pre-formulated. In other words,
the interviewee is allowed to answer the questions very freely, using his or her own
experiences, in which case the interviewer's part is naturally much more passive than
the interviewee's. Although the interview is unstructured and the implementation
remarkably free-form, it still needs good planning. In contrast, semi-structured
interviews are clearly more formulated than unstructured interviews. Semi-structured
interviews utilize a pre-designed interview template that allows for a better comparison
of interview responses with those of other respondents. Semi-structured interviews
often contain more specific questions, such as "Would you invest in this item?" which
could be followed by a question, "why?". In other words, a semi-structured interview
provides results that combine quantitative and qualitative data. Structured interviews,
on the other hand, utilize very formal pre-designed standardized questionnaires.
Structured interviews naturally also include open-ended questions, which are,
however, answered very briefly (Guthrie, 2010). In conclusion, unstructured
interviews are not able to produce as much comparable information, while structured
interviews produce very comparable information, but not as in-depth as semistructured interviews.
In order to gather information and views on the research question from the research
group selected for this study, a qualitative semi-structured interview has been chosen
as the research method for this thesis. Semi-structured interviews allow for relatively
open communication, as the interview has room for maneuver, so additional questions
can also be asked during the interview if clarification is needed for some of the
answers. These additional questions can potentially play a crucial part in the research
results, as without them, certain answers may be incomplete, which may lead to a
misunderstanding of the cause-and-effect relationship (Bryman & Bell, 2017).

47

4.2 Data collection
As mentioned earlier, this is a qualitative study that makes its data collecting different
from the data collecting of a quantitative study. The following section presents the data
collection method of this research, i.e., the sources of the data collected, how the study
group was sampled, and how the research data was collected.

4.2.1 Sources
Data can be collected from both primary and secondary sources. Primary source refers
to data collected for some particular research problem, while secondary source is data
collected by another person for some previous research. In other words, secondary data
may not be fully capable of answering new research questions but is able to provide
important additional information that can be utilized in a new research (Hox & Boeije,
2005).
In this thesis, both primary and secondary data were utilized, giving a broader
perspective on this thesis research topic. Primary data was collected from semistructured interviews, which provided new information to be gathered on the research
questions of this particular study. In addition to primary sources, data was also
collected from secondary sources, which enabled to increase background information
and understanding of central topics of the Finnish stock market, investor behavior, and
investor communication.

4.2.2 Sampling
In a qualitative study, the number of respondents is not as central to the validity of the
result as in a quantitative study, where the number of respondents must be a specific
size in order for the results to be generalized and that the results can be considered
valid. Instead of the number of respondents, qualitative research is made relevant by
selecting respondents who are most relevant to the purpose of the research. In other
words, in qualitative research, the main focus should be on selecting the right research
group (Bell & Bryman, 2017). Often in research, the researcher's resources are
restricted, so it is impossible to include every respondent belonging to the target group
in the research. Therefore, the research group will have to be limited to a smaller group
48

Janette Murto

representing all the respondents in the group. This selection of a research group is also
called sampling. Sampling can be divided into three main types; haphazard sampling,
simple random sampling, and systematic sampling (Guthrie, 2010).
The aim of this research is to determine how in-depth non-numerical communication
impacts investors' investment decisions, which is why the target group can be limited
purely to investors. In Finland, however, investors consist of both men and women and
almost all different age groups, which is why the target group is highly wide. As I have
limited resources, I have chosen to use systematic sampling and, more precisely,
disproportioned stratified sampling to select the research group.
Systematic sampling can be divided into three main parts; list sampling, proportioned
stratified sampling, and disproportionate stratified sampling. In list sampling, the
target group is selected so that there is a list of people to select every third, second etc.,
person to participate in the study. Whereas in the proportioned stratified sample, the
researcher selects one representative from each subgroup. For example, if a survey is
done in a workplace, 10 % of each different department would be chosen to participate
in the study. Disproportionated stratified sampling works in a relatively same way as
proportioned sampling. However, the difference between these is that in
disproportioned stratified sampling each representative group is not sampled
simultaneously as a percentage of participants, but only one representative is chosen
from every subgroup. In addition to these three types of systematic sampling, two
alternative techniques can also be utilized: area sampling and cluster sampling. In area
sampling, people are randomly selected within different residential areas, while in
cluster sampling, the researcher aims to interview every person in the entire smaller
group. Central to all of these systematic sampling types is that the target group is
selected using random selection as much as possible, and if the target group has not
been selected at random, this should be stated (Guthrie, 2010).
The research group was gathered through a Facebook group called Sijoituskerho
(Investment club) with about 90,000 investors as members. The target group, i.e.,
Finnish investors, was divided according to age and gender. According to age, the
target group was divided into four different sections: 20-29-year-olds, 30-39-yearolds, 40-49-year-olds, and 50-59-year-olds; from each age group, two participants
were selected randomly, one male, and one female.
49

Janette Murto

A participation link was published to the group, through which those interested in the
study could register to the interview. The only restriction on participation in the study
was that the person had to have been investing in direct shares at some point. This way,
it was ensured that the research participants had some level of understanding of
investing in direct shares and investing in general. Therefore, we can claim that
participation in the study group is not yet limited so that it would have created any
significant biases that would have any effect on the research results.
Once enough registrations had been done, one person from each subgroup was
randomly selected by lottery. There were quite a few registrations, which meant that
no persons had to be selected by lottery from each subgroup, but only the one person
who had registered for the study was selected. A few subgroups received more than
one registration, from which the study group members were selected by a lottery.
In conclusion, there are a total of eight subgroups, as well as study participants. In this
way, it was ensured that information was received on each of the different subgroups
so that the research results are not biased to a particular subgroup.
The mother tongue of each person participated in the study was Finnish, which is why
the research materials and the interviews were conducted in Finnish. In the table below
one will find information about the people who participated in the study.

4.2.3 Method
In order to gather information and views on the research question from the research
group selected for this study, qualitative interviews were chosen as the primary data
collection method for this thesis and were conducted through semi-structured
interviews as semi-structured interviews produce comparable in-depth information
(Guthrie, 2010).
Each participant in the interview had been sent in advance a short presentation of the
company and its operations and the financial sections, past and future performance, of
two fictional companies’ Equity stories. The entire equity stories were not sent to the
interviewees, as it would have been too long to read as a whole, and it would have
been much more challenging to focus on a particular section, as a much larger number
of factors influencing the investment decision would have accumulated.
The companies presented to the interviewees were named Company X and Company
Y so that the name would not create any biases in the interviewee. The financial
information and the company’s operations of both companies were very similar, as a
result of which the return expectations and the investors' willingness to invest in both
of the companies based on the numbers should match. However, the financial section
of Company X's equity story took advantage of non-numerical communication to
describe the company's numbers in a deeper level, explaining why the numbers are as
they are, and motivate the growth expectations. Whereas, the financial sections of
Company Y's equity story presented only company numbers, both numerically and
non-numerically, but did not provide a more in-depth non-numerical explanation or
motivation as to why the numbers are as they are or why the company's growth
expectations are as they are or how they motivate to be able to achieve these goals.
The equity stories can be found in Appendices 1 and 2.
As mentioned earlier, semi-structured interviews were used in this study. In other
words, a pre-planned interview template had been created in beforehand and utilized
in each interview. In this way the responses had a clearer structure and themes, which
made the answers easier to be compared to each other in the analysis phase.

Pilot interview
51

Janette Murto

Prior to the first interview, a pilot interview was conducted to test the functionality of
the research method, materials, and questions. According to Bryman and Bell (2011),
conducting a pilot interview is important because it can ensure the suitability and
functionality of both the research method and the research questions to the study. The
pilot interview was conducted with a researcher acquaintance who belonged to the
target group according to her investment experience. The person in question was
interviewed, where a few shortcomings were noted, on the basis of which the research
questions were modified before the actual interviews began. In this way, it was
possible to ensure that the questions of the research interviews were well-formulated
and provided answers to all the necessary questions.

Interview structure
In the beginning of the interviews, the basic information of the study was introduced
to the interviewees, after which the basic information of the interviewee was collected.
After the start, the focus turned to questions regarding the interviewees’ investment
behavior. The third part of the interview consisted of different questions regarding the
equity stories sent in advance to the interviewees. The interview questions consisted
of such straightforward yes or no answers and follow-up questions where the aim was
to gather more insights to understand the interviewees' answers and way of thinking.
In this way, qualitative information was gathered that makes cause-and-effect
relationships easier to understand. The interviewee answered the questions in words,
which the interviewer recorded. Because the answers were answered in words, the
interviewees' answers could be longer and more describing than if the interviewee
should have written these answers him/herself.
Each participant in the study had access to the equity stories sent in advance during
the interview, which allowed them to view this information while answering the
interview questions. In this way, it was possible to ensure that the interviewee replied
regarding the correct material and that the equity stories of the two companies were
not confused with each other. The research questions clarified how the respondent
perceives the company's financial situation and whether, based on this information,
he/she believes in the future outlook presented in the equity story, such as whether
he/she would invest in these companies and which one he/she would prefer to invest
52

Janette Murto

in. In addition to this, motivations were asked for these responses to gain a deeper
understanding of how the investor thinks and to understand the cause-effect
relationships. In the end, the respondents were asked whether he/she paid any attention
to a particular matter, as this made it possible to determine whether the respondent
consciously paid attention to the non-numerical communication used in Company X's
equity story or to the fact that Company Y's equity story did not include such a part.
In addition to these interview question mentioned above, also a few general questions
were asked at the end of the interview regarding non-numerical investor
communication in general. These questions aimed to determine what the respondent
thinks about non-numerical investor communication, its importance, and impact to the
respondent’s investment decisions. In addition to this, respondents were also able to
share their thoughts on where the boundary of credible non-numerical investor
communication goes. In other words, what is their opinion about selling and overpositive investor communication.
The length of interviews were pre-assigned not to exceed 60 minutes longer to ensure
focus on the respondent. All of the interviews were conducted in May 2021. Each
interview was conducted remotely via Microsoft Teams due to the current Covid-19
pandemic. However, in each interview, we had a video on both sides, which made the
interview more personal. It is good to mention that an interview conducted remotely
is never the same as if it had been conducted physically, which may have left certain
observations out.
Interview questions and guides can be found in Appendices 3 and 4.

4.3 Data analysis
What is essential for qualitative research is that it produces a considerable amount of
data, which is an advantage, as it enables the researcher to achieve a broader
understanding of the researched matter. On the other hand, this large amount of data
can also be seen as a challenge for analyzing the research results as it makes it difficult
to process all the data collected (Flick, 2007). To find construct, patterns, variables,
and cause-and-effect relationships from the data gathered for this research, a
conceptual framework has been conducted.
53

Janette Murto

A conceptual framework is a graphical or written description that presents the main
concepts of a study. In other words, in a conceptual framework the key factors,
constructs, and variables of a research, and the relationship between them are presented
(Miles & Huberman, 1994). Central to conceptual framework is that it links previous
theory to the research carried out, which enables the implementation of the research to
be based on previous theories and the research results to become more generalizable
and linked to the real world. (Leshem & Trafford, 2007) This is why it has been chosen
to create a conceptual framework, as this will allow to better link this study to the
theoretical data collected and presented in the theoretical chapter of this thesis. This
conceptual framework has also helped in the construction of the analysis chapter, as
its structure is based entirely on the key factors, constructs, variables, and the
relationship between them found from this thesis with the help of the conceptual
framework.

The conceptual framework of how investment decisions are made
Conceptual framework consists of a network of different concepts and is based entirely
on empirical data. (Jabareen, 2009) According to Jabareen (2009), concepts are again
groups of similar theoretical data composed of several different components.
Conceptual framework creation can be divided into eight different stages, which are:
1. Mapping the selected data sources
2. Extensive reading and categorizing of the selected data
3. Identifying and naming concepts
4. Deconstructing and categorizing the concepts
5. Integrating concepts
6. Synthesis, resynthesis, and making it all make sense
7. Validating the conceptual framework
8. Rethinking the conceptual framework (Jabareen, 2009).
The creation of a conceptual framework should start with mapping. In other words,
data are collected at the beginning, from which different categories are created in the
next step. (Jabareen, 2009) In this thesis, this mapping has been carried out on the basis
of various scientific articles and books, which have sought information and previous
research on investor communication, especially the use of non-numerical investor
54

Janette Murto

communications, their impact on investors' decision making. Since then, this data has
been examined on several occasions at an in-depth level, which has led to efforts to
find key categories of data in order of importance.
The main categories found in the Theoretical chapter of this thesis are investor
communication and investors’ investment decision making. According to (Jabareen,
2009), the researcher should next define at a deeper level the internal concepts of these
categories. Analyzing the theoretical part of this thesis, the following concepts were
found under the category of investors' investment decisions: Company analysis,
including expected return on investment, future value of a company, historical
analysis, measuring the investment risk and investor's own risk tolerance, investment
strategies including instrument selection, factors impacting investment decisions
including, financial theory thinking and psychological factors, in other words,
investor's subjective perspective. Whereas objective matter such as the company’s
strategy, financial situation, and investor’s ability to finance the investment also plays
a part in investors’ investment decisions. Concepts found under the investor
communication category were non-numerical and numerical investor communication,
financial and non-financial investor communication, and investor communication’s
strategy and goal.
According to (Jabareen, 2009), after this fourth stage, the researcher should strive to
find similarities between these different concepts, which allows certain concepts to be
combined while reducing the number of different concepts. After this work phase, the
concepts of this thesis were chosen to be: Concept 1. Non-numerical & Numerical
Investor

communication,

Concept

2.

Financial

&

Non-financial

Investor

communication, Concept 3. Investor communication's strategy and goal, Concept 4.
Investor's subjective perspective, and Concept 5. Objective matters.
Next, the researcher should create a conceptual framework based on these categories
and concepts mentioned above. (Jabareen, 2009) In creating this conceptual
Framework, care has been taken to ensure that it has become a sensible whole, strongly
based on previous theories, and to support the research itself. In creating this
conceptual framework, opinions have also been sought from outside parties with the
aim of ensuring its clarity and rationality. In the figure below, one will find the
conceptual framework of how investment decisions are made.

Once all the qualitative data had been collected, it was first studied thoroughly, after
which the differences and similarities of the answers were looked for. When enough
similarities and differences were found, the answers were divided into the main
categories found when doing the conceptual framework. The data analysis has also
paid close attention to the fact that the answers have not been generalized too much,
as this is very relevant for the validity of the research results. (Flick, 2007)

4.4 Validity and reliability
If the information obtained from the research is to be used in practice, the evaluation
of the validity and reliability of the research is highly important, as this is the only way
to ensure the accuracy of the research. (Noble & Smith, 2015) Reliability refers to the
56

Janette Murto

trustworthiness and structure of research results. If the study is reliable, the same study
result can be replicated by another researcher under similar conditions (Bryman &
Bell, 2018). While validity refers to the trustworthiness, rigor, appropriateness,
(Hayashi, Abib & Hoppen, 2020) quality and relevance of research. (Bryman & Bell,
2018)
A wide variety of methods are used to assess the validity and reliability of quantitative
and qualitative research. Statistical methods are usually used for quantitative research,
while methodological strategies are used for qualitative research (Noble & Smith,
2015). As the research of this thesis is qualitative, methodological strategies has been
used to analyse the validity and reliability of this research. According to Healy & Perry
(2000), validity and reliability types can be divided into; ontological appropriateness,
contingent validity, multiple perceptions of participants and of peer researchers,
methodological trustworthiness, analytic generalization, and construct validity.
Ontological appropriateness and contingent validity are among the ontological
elements. Ontology refers to the ‘‘reality’’ that a researcher studies. While multiple
perceptions of participants and of peer researchers fall under epistemology, which
refers to the relationship between the researcher and ontological reality.
Methodological trustworthiness, analytic generalization, and construct validity, on the
other hand, fall under methodology, which refers to the research technique used by the
researcher. (Healy & Perry, 2000)
This study has sought to achieve the highest possible validity and reliability precisely
through these methodological strategies mentioned above. First, this thesis examines
does the depth of non-numerical communication in the financial outlook of an equity
story impact investors’ investment decisions, that has been found to address a complex
social phenomenon outside of people’s minds. This is why this study meets the first
part of six methodological strategies, ontological appropriateness, mentioned by Healy
& Perry (2000).
Because this research examines a social phenomenon in which outcomes are
influenced by volatile factors (Healy & Perry, 2000), contingent validity has been
chosen as the second qualitative criterion. Central to, contingent validity is that its aim
is to seek the different attributes of a good or service that people value and what effect
circumstances have on decision making. (Bishop & Romano, 1998) Efforts have been
57

Janette Murto

made to meet this criterion in such a way that all possible influencing factors have
been taken into account. In other words, the analysis has focused not only on the
responses but also on the reasons why certain responses are of a certain type and what
factors may have influenced them. The information of the interviewees, such as age,
gender, investment experience and education, has also been gathered and described in
detail, so that these issues can also be taken into account when analyzing the answers
gotten from the interviews.
The last methodological strategies are concerning the methodology of this thesis’
research, and the chosen criteria are; methodological trustworthiness, and construct
validity. (Healy & Perry, 2000) Methodological trustworthiness of a research includes
credibility, transferability, dependability, plausibility, and confirmability of a research,
which can be ensured with triangulation, external audits, member checking, negative
case analysis, peer debriefing and review, prolonged engagement/persistent
observation, and reflexivity. In order for research trustworthiness to be achieved, the
researcher must utilize more than one of these trustworthiness methods mentioned
above (Jolley, 2013). In this research, attention has been paid to several different
trustworthiness methods such as member checking, peer debriefing and review, and
reflexivity.
To begin with, the member check was conducted in this thesis so that once the
responses to the interviews were written clean, the interviewees were given these to
read for themselves so that they could check that the responses were correct and ensure
that they did not contain incorrect information. This also gave the interviewees the
opportunity to complete their answers if something was missing. Peer debriefing and
review, on the other hand, was conducted at several different seminars held during the
writing of this thesis. These seminars provided feedback and possible suggestions for
improvement, which were strongly taken into account in the writing process.
Reflexivity was implemented as the latest method of trustworthiness. According to
Noble & Smith (2015), it is important that the researcher is aware of the effects of his
or her own biases on the research, takes into account any biases that may have
influenced, for example, the research group's sampling, and critically and in-depth
analyses these issues that the researcher collects, records, and interprets information
participants' responses, in which case the study do not give a wrong kind of picture of
the answers. In writing this thesis, possible biases have been taken into account and
58

Janette Murto

care has been taken that these biases do not affect the results of the studies at any level.
The researcher has always kept in mind the possible biases of the researcher. In every
step of the research an extensive and critical analysis has been made to avoid any
factors that could harm the validity and reliability of the research.
Construct validity refers to the relationship between previous theory and research, i.e.,
how well the previous theory has been utilized in research and its structure. (Carmines
& Zeller, 1979) In this study, construct validity has been realized in such a way that
the structure of the whole study has been defined based on the previous theory. In other
words, in this thesis a conceptual framework has been created based on the previous
theory, on the basis of which the research and its analysis structure has been created.

4.5 Summary
This chapter presented the methods of this thesis research, i.e., what kind of methods
are used in the research and why, what the research will focus and aim for, and what
kind and on what basis the research target group has been selected. At the end of the
chapter, the validity and reliability of this research were presented and how these were
ensured.
In summary, qualitative in-depth semi-structured interviews have been chosen as the
method of this research, and the research results have been chosen to be analysed
thematically. The research group is based on the demographics of Finnish investors,
and disproportioned stratified sampling has been utilized in the selection of the study
group. In its brevity, the study will examine the importance of non-numerical
communication in investment decisions by presenting to the research group the equity
stories of two different companies, one using in-depth non-numerical communication
to support the financial information, while the other presenting mostly financial
information in numbers and only superficial information non-numerically.

5 Presentation of empirical data
In this chapter, the empirical data collected from the semi-structured interviews will
be presented. The purpose of this chapter is to explore respondents’ investment
59

behavior and the impact of non-numerical investor communication on investors’
investment decisions. The focus will be on finding out the role of non-numerical
communication, in investment decisions, does investors’ subjective perspective’s
impact on how non-numerical investor communication is perceived and how does it
impact their investment decisions, and lastly does and how the use of in-depth nonnumerical communication in equity story’s financial outlook impact investors’
investment decisions. In the first section of this chapter, the basic information of the
interview objects is presented, followed by a section focusing on investor’s decisionmaking. This section includes an exploration of respondents’ subjective perspectives
and views on investor communication and their relation. The final section of this
chapter will present respondents’ analysis of the two companies’ equity stories created
for this research. The focus will be on finding out whether in-depth non-numerical
communication positively impacts investors’ investment decisions.

5.1 Presentation of the interview objects
In order to maintain the anonymity of the interviewees, the names of the respondents
will not be revealed. However, we will present the respondents' gender, age, education,
profession, investment experience, and investment style. Based on this information,
we are able to point out that very different respondents have participated in the
interview, as a result of which the answers and opinions are not dependent on these
issues. With this information, we will also be able to analyse at a later stage if
significant differences are found between different investors in how non-numerical
investor communication is received and how different investment decisions are made.
At the beginning of the interview, basic information about each respondent was
gathered, which will be presented in this section.
A total of eight people, four men, and four women, each with a different level of
investment experience, participated in the interview. Respondents were collected from
four different, previously defined age groups, 20–29 years, 30–39 years, 40–49 years,
and 50–59 years. Two respondents, one male and one female, were selected from each
age group. Interviewees are named for their anonymity in letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
and H.
In the first age group of 20-29-year-olds, belonged a 28-year-old woman (Informant
A), a nurse by training, and an anesthetist by profession, and a 29-year-old man
60

Janette Murto

(Informant B) with a bachelor's degree in economics who currently works as an
account manager. Informant A's first touch to investing was in 2019 when she invested
in a fund. Experience in stock equity investing is much shorter as she bought her first
stock only a few months ago. Whereas, informant B has investment experience of
about a year and a half. Informant B has invested in various equities, such as Finnish,
German, Norwegian, Swedish, and American companies.
In the second age group of 30-39-year-olds, belonged a 36-year-old woman (Informant
C) with a degree in civil engineering who currently works as a project manager, and is
a 39-year-old man (Informant D) who studied at the Tampere University of
Technology and currently works as a software engineer. Informant C has invested in
several different Finnish direct equities and has investment experience for about a year
and a half. Whereas, Informant D has more than ten years of investment experience
and has invested in various direct equity shares, which have included both Finnish and
foreign companies.
In the third age group of 40-49-year-olds, belonged a a 45-year-old woman (Informant
E) with a degree in economics and currently works as a secretary, and a 40-year-old
man (Informant F), a chef by training, but has been an entrepreneur for most of his
life. Informant E has five years of investment experience and has invested only in
Finnish listed companies. Whereas, Informant F has more than 20 years of investment
experience during which he has actively invested in a wide variety of direct shares,
which include both Finnish and foreign companies.
In the fourth age group of 50-59-year-olds, belonged a 56-year-old woman (Informant
G) who has completed both an entrepreneurial degree and a degree in logistics who
has been an entrepreneur for several years, but today she works as a taxi driver, and a
56-year-old man (Informant H) with a master's degree in economics and ''works'' as a
full-time investor. Informant G invested in direct equity shares for the first time five
years ago. Although she has several investment targets, she does not perceive herself
as an active investor. Whereas, Informant H has invested in direct equity shares for the
first time since school age, so he has about forty years of investment experience
nowadays. Over the years, Informant H's investment targets have been spread over
Finnish, European, and American targets.

5.2 Investor’s decision-making
In the following section, the results on how objective matters, investor communication,
and respondents' subjective perspective affect their investment decisions are presented.

5.2.1 Subjective perspective’s impact on investment decisions
During the interview, some of the questions focused on finding out how respondents
make their investment decisions and how their subjective perspective impacts their
investment decisions and whether this has a link to how the respondents react to
investor communication.
When discussing what kind of an investors respondents are there were apparent
differences among the respondents with what level of confidence and risk tolerance
they make their decisions, what factors they base their decisions on, their subjective
perspective’s impact on how they understand and react to information, and how
rational decision-makers they are. Some of the respondents were more cautious, more
uncertain investors than other, while some of the respondents were more confident,
which often went in line with investment experience.
When discussing about where respondents seek for information and how they make
their investment decisions, the responses revealed that some investors rely heavily on
the tips and opinions of others.
‘’My investment decisions are based a lot on the views of others. For example, my
spouse is a more experienced investor from whom I receive good tips.’’ - Informant C
Whereas more experienced and confident investors told that they rely mostly on their
own views and analyses when making investment decisions. However, although more
experienced investors said they usually analyse listed companies themselves much
more than the more inexperienced ones, they also mentioned that in addition to their
own analyses they also rely on the opinions and views of other people to map a
company's situation more broadly.
“When making investment decisions, I carefully analyse the situation of the company
independently. Of course, I also often ask other investors for their opinions to gain
more information and different views. However, the stock market is such that it is not
62

Janette Murto

always based on fundamentals and reality, so that the share price can be guided by
something else than the situation of the company, which is why it is important to
receive comprehensive information before making an investment decision.” –
Informant F
For other respondents, on the other hand, facts are not always at the center of
investment decisions, but decisions are made due to herd behavior, where investment
decisions are not always made rationally but by following other investors. A few
respondents also described themselves as 'feeling investors', which means that
investment decisions are not made rationally but rather based on emotions.
‘’My investment decisions often go by mood, meaning that if I get a food feeling of a
company, my investment decision can be based on it, and no comprehensive analysis
is needed to make a decision.”- Informant C
When discussing from which locations the shares had been bought by the respondents,
it became clear that for more uncertain and less experienced investors, a sense of
security was a significant part of making an investment decision. For this reason, the
Finnish market was perceived as the easiest investment option, as the companies on
the Helsinki Stock Exchange were already familiar and credit to domestic companies
and their communication was stronger than foreigners.
"It has somehow been safe for me to invest mainly in Finnish equities because it is
easier to understand those companies when their operations are familiar to me." Informant B
"I believe and trust more on Finnish than foreign companies and what they inform in
their investor communication." - Informant A
Among more experienced investors, on the other hand, it emerged that investments
were found all over the world, and there was not as much fear of such unfamiliar
markets, but a firm belief in one's own ability to search for information, understand
and predict other types of markets as well. The fact that more experienced investors
are not as 'scared' and cautious of foreign markets was also undoubtedly influenced by
the fact that, according to themselves, they had a higher risk tolerance when investing
and the ability and required skill to diversify their investments which reduces the
overall risk of their investments.
63

Janette Murto

In summary, we can conclude that more experienced investors base their investment
decisions more on facts which makes the investment decisions more rational. In other
words, they focus and understand better numerical information, which is why
numerical information have a more significant impact on their investment decisions
than on more unexperienced investors. On the contrary, more unexperienced investors
base their investment decisions mainly on intuition and are more prone to their
cognitive errors, which impacts how they understand and react to non-numerical
information.

5.2.2 The role of investor communication in investment decisions
As investor communication is an important source of information for investors when
making investment decisions (Niri, 2020), the interviews sought to gain a deeper
understanding of respondents' views on investor communication, especially nonnumerical investor communication. The aim of this was to increase knowledge of what
kind of information investors consciously want and need, as well as what kind of nonnumerical communication should be in order for it to have a positive impact on
investors’ investment decisions.
When discussing the importance of investor communication in investment decisions,
respondents’ responses varied. Others were more focused on seeking more general
information that would enable them to understand the company’s operations better,
while others were researching more investor communication materials based on
company numbers. In other words, some respondents said they focused more on
financial-based information, both in numbers and in written text, while others said they
read more about what a company’s operations consist of.
“When making investment decisions, I want information about the company’s business
plan, i.e., how it is going to be implemented and what the company’s value is compared
to the market of the future and what is the company’s business potential.” - Informant
H
Many of the respondents also mentioned that they look for information from several
different sources and the weight of investment communication in investment decisions
thus also varied among respondents. Some said they read company marketing
64

Janette Murto

materials from time to time, while others always read particular companys' investor
communication materials. However, what was common among many respondents was
that the information they wanted most from investor communication material was the
information that would enable them to understand the company's business direction
and assess its future development.
‘‘What interests me most about investment communications is getting information on
why and how future growth should happen.’’ - Informant B
‘’I usually read financial statement analyses, income statements, balance sheets, and
CEO reviews. I often also want information about the future, especially about the
companies I have invested in.”- Informant F
When discussing the positive and selling sound of non-numerical communication and
what kind of non-numerical communication is credible, many respondents stated that
selling and positive text is by no means a bad thing or make the content uncredible. ''I
think a positive, selling and vivid tone in investor communication is a good thing
because at least I would not be able to read any mere number after a number or too
so-called boring text. '' - Informant C
However, this credibility is certainly helped by the fact that in connection with the
discussions, the respondents' strong confidence in Finnish companies and their
investment communications emerged. In other words, the respondents trust that
Finnish listed companies obey the law and therefore do not spread false information.
"When a company is listed on a stock exchange, it is subject to the Companies Act,
which means that they must not give false information, i.e., based on it, the text that
sells can be trusted. Of course, with a critical eye."- Informant F
However, excess positivity and selling tone in investor communication also have their
limits. Many respondents pointed out that if a text is too selling, its credibility suffers.
‘’I will at least stop reading to the point if the text is overly positive and too sellable.
In my opinion, short and clear is the best.”- Informant H
As the weight of the conversation shifts more to the importance of non-numerical
communication as part of investment communication, respondents strongly pointed
out that without non-numerical communication, it is difficult to understand the overall
picture.
65

Janette Murto

‘’Non-numerical communication adds value and makes it easier to understand things.
Non-numerical communication can provide justification at a deeper level, which is
very important too.”- Informant A
‘‘Non-numerical communication adds value when promises and intentions are based
on concreteness and the question of 'why' is answered.’’ - Informant G

5.3 Depth of non-numerical information and investor
investment decisions
As part of the interviews, the equity stories of the two fictional companies, Company
X and Company Y, were presented to the interviewees. Company X's equity story
utilized in-depth non-numerical investor communication to support both the numerical
financial information and the future growth expectations provided in its equity story.
Whereas, the non-numerical communication used in Company Y's equity story was
more superficial and did not provide as much in-depth information as Company X's
did. Company X motivated with non-numerical communication how it seeks to
achieve the future goals it presented in its equity story, while Company Y only listed
its future goal using non-numerical communication.
This section will present the study respondents’ analyses of these two different
companies and thus determine which company was more attractive as an investment
target for respondents and whether the in-depth non-numerical investor
communication utilized in Company X's equity story had some impact on the investors'
investment decisions.

5.3.1 Financial situation
Investment decisions depend largely on the expected return on an investment, the
assessment of which strongly includes an analysis of the company's financial situation.
(Virlics, 2013) Therefore, this study sought to determine the respondents' opinions on
the financial situation of Company X and Company Y, as this view is at the heart of
investment decisions. In this way, this research has also been able to understand better
66

Janette Murto

what the relationship and significance of non-numerical investor communication have
to investors' investment decisions.
Each of the respondents felt that Company X's financial situation was good and drew
attention to the company's growing turnover, as well as good operating
income.‘’Company X has had, in my opinion, a pretty good financial situation. The
company has managed to make an operating profit and grow quite well over the last
couple of years.’’ – Informant A The size of the turnover seen for the listed company
varied among the respondents. Some saw the turnover as very high, while some still
saw it as relatively small for a listing company. However, this also did not change the
view as to whether the company's financial situation was seen as positive or not. The
growth of the company was more important than its size. ‘’The company’s turnover is
still quite small, meaning operations are relatively small, but in a way, all the figures
were still growing. The company apparently does not have a gearing ratio, the equity
ratio is high, and in a way, everything seems to be improving or has already improved,
at least from 2019 to 2020.” – Informant C
Company Y's financial situation was also seen as good among the respondents. At this
point, it is worth mentioning that Company Y's turnover was about 5% lower than
Company X's. However, profitability and other essential figures affecting profitability
were precisely in line with Company Y's, which is why the two companies have been
quite successful in the same way, and the results are in line, although the turnover of
one is slightly lower than that of the other.
Many of the respondents did not see much difference between the financial situation
of the companies; the only attention was paid to Company Y's slightly lower turnover,
but this did not affect the respondents' perception of the company negatively, and the
company was perceived as successful.
"Company Y's growth has been almost as rapid as that of Company X's. However, one
has made a little more turnover than the other, but still, all the numbers of the company
look good." - Informant G
"The figures, I think, were pretty similar in both, meaning there was no major
difference between them. Looks pretty good, I must say." - Informant F

67

Janette Murto

"I am quite excited about both of these companies. Both seem to be doing really well."
- Informant D

5.3.2 Future growth estimation
In the next phase of the interview, respondents analysed the future growth estimation
of Company X and Company Y and how likely it is that these two companies could
achieve the goals they reported in their equity stories. According to Kollet et al. (2010),
the analysis of a company's future is an integral part of investment decisions to be able
to assess how good an investment target a company is, which is why this section was
included in the study. Both Company X and Company Y reported in their equity stories
that the companies are aiming for about 30% growth over the next few years.
Respondents were therefore asked whether they believed these goals are achievable
and why.
There were slightly different answers among the respondents regarding the future
growth goals of the companies. However, even the most skeptical respondents did not
argue that these goals were utterly impossible. Company X's growth target of 30%
over the next few years was seen as possible, based on past growth, for example. “After
all, Company X has made similar growth in previous years. If things are going well in
the company, this 30% growth is certainly not an impossibility, although it is probably
not an easy thing to do.” - Informant A
One of the respondents said he believed this growth to be possible because he felt the
company was still so young that he saw there still would be room for growth in the
market. ‘’Company X is still so small that it probably has a chance to rise to those
growth figures. Predictability is quite easy for a company of this size, which is why
that 30% growth could be very accurate. Of course, even when looking at the growth
of the company in previous years, it has been great, which also supports the argument
company made in their equity story about their growth expectations.” - Informant F
More skeptical respondents said that it is difficult to predict a company’s future
because growth is affected by so many different factors, such as the market and
competitors, about which no further information was provided at this point. ‘‘The
future growth of this company is not in the hands of this company alone. It depends on
68

Janette Murto

current and potential future competitors and how they are doing, and how much
market share they are gaining. I think that a 30% growth target is difficult, which is
why I have a little hesitation about whether they will get there, even if things were
done well. Of course, the history of the company and what can be read now must be
taken into account, which looks good, which in turn supports these growth goals. So it
is hard to say, but I do believe that they will keep on growing.”- Informant G
On the other hand, one of the respondents had a solid trust in what the company was
saying in its equity story and believed in the predictability of the company's future. “I
could not very analytically think about whether these growth targets were realistic or
not. However, if the growth is going to be like that, then it sounds terrific. I do not
think a company can lie to me in its investor communication, so I do believe in what
they say.” Informant D
Company X was seen as meeting its future financial goals mainly based on its
historical figures, i.e., the growth of previous years, and arguments provided through
non-numerical communication, such as the Company's recurring monthly billing and
continuous and efficient software development.
‘‘Company X justified factors affecting growth, such as the company’s earnings logic,
invoicing and cash flow, which feel stable to me.’’ - Informant F
’’Automation and coding are modern and will undoubtedly grow even more in the
future. On that basis, this 30% increase could be possible as I believe that there will
be an increasing demand for this kind of services.”- Informant A
‘’As I work in the software industry, I understand how the companies operate. That is
why things such as recurring monthly invoicing mentioned by Company X, sounds
good to me as it is the thing today and gives me a contemporary picture of the
company’s operations.”- Informant D
''In software industry, product development is undoubtedly playing an insanely
significant role in becoming a successful player in the markets. Company X mentioned
that product development is something they have a strong focus on, which will
certainly mean a lot in terms of whether or not the company will achieve its future
growth goals.’’ - Informant G

69

Janette Murto

The future growth of Company Y was also seen in a positive light among respondents.
However, when discussing about which of the two companies would more likely
achieve its future growth goals, based on the information presented in the equity stories
alone, Company X was seen as a more likely option. This was justified by the fact that
Company X provided in-depth information as to why and how these goals would be
achieved.
"Company X explained and justified things more concretely than Company Y, which
is why I believe it is more likely that Company X will achieve these goals rather than
Company Y." - Informant C
"It is easier for me to believe Company X in these set goals, as they justified them, in
addition to previous years’ growth, with some facts about their current business plan,
and what are the factors that will guarantee the growth in the next upcoming years.
They mentioned, for example, the monthly billing strategy which ensures better and
more stable cash flow.
Overall, I am interested to know why companies believe that they will achieve their
goals. It is not enough for me to know what are company’s goals. I need
justifications."- Informant B
During the discussion, the respondents also highlighted how similar the two companies
are, which made them feel that the numbers alone made it difficult if not impossible to
assess and compare which company would be more successful in the future than the
other. "Based on the numbers alone, I see no reason why one company would achieve
the future growth goals better than the other. What I understand behind the numbers
is that I believe Company X is more likely to achieve its goals based on the facts they
shortly provided in their equity story."- Informant H

5.3.3 Investors’ willingness to invest in the companies
In the next phase of the interview, the respondents were asked if they would invest in
Company X and/or Company Y, and which of the two companies would the
respondents prefer to invest in and why? The purpose of these questions was to
determine which company the respondents saw as a better investment target. At this
point, it is worth recalling that the investability of both companies is roughly in the
70

Janette Murto

same range, as the industry, service, and financial situation are almost identical. The
most significant difference presented to the respondents between the two companies
was how the equity story presented the companies’ future goals. Company X explained
in more depth why and how they will achieve their goals, while Company Y merely
listed their future growth goals but did not motivate how.
While discussing about the investability of the two companies, six out of eight
respondents said they could invest in Company X. Whereas two out of eight were
hesitating and answered maybe. However, even many of the respondents who said they
could invest in Company X highlighted that before investing in the company they
would want to know more about the product, overall market, and competitors before
any investment decisions. ‘’Company X has investment potential, but if I had to put
money into this company, I would like to know more about its product and how the
product will remain competitive in the future. Of course, I would also like more
information on the overall market, as it certainly has an impact as well. ”- Informant
H Deeper information about the company's customer base was also of interest. "What
was missing from the equity story, if I had really wanted to put money in, then I would
have liked to know who the most significant customers of the company are. In other
words, I would like to find out more about the company's customer segment, i.e., who
actually uses these services."– Informant F
When discussing the respondent’s opinion on the investability of Company Y, four out
of eight said they could invest in Company Y, and four out of eight were a bit hesitant
but answered maybe. The motivations for these answers were almost identical to
Company X, and the reasons given were, for example, that more information was
needed. However, both companies were seen as potential investment targets based on
the information that equity stories offered. However, many felt that it would be
difficult to make the right investment decision based on this information alone, i.e., a
brief company presentation, financial outlook, and future growth expectations. Most
of the respondents craved an answer to what is behind the numbers. They wanted to
know the justification for how the company could beat its competitors and continue to
grow at the same pace as in previous years.
After this, we further discussed which of these companies, Company X or Company
Y, the respondents would prefer to invest in if one of them were to be chosen as the
71

Janette Murto

investment target. This question sought to answer whether Company X's in-depth nonnumerical communication impacted respondents' investment decisions. Five of the
respondents said they preferred Company X and justified this choice because the
company in question, Company X, better justifies, for example, the expected growth,
which makes it seem a better option. All five responses referred to the non-numerical
communication used by Company X as a positive factor while mentioning that it is the
most significant factor that distinguishes the two companies and the only reasonable
justification for choosing Company X over the other. ‘’Both companies are very
similar and have succeeded in the same way. If an investment decision were to be made
on the basis of this information, I would choose Company X simply because it provides
more information and justification as to how they will achieve their goals, i.e.,
continue to grow at a rapid pace.” - Informant E
One of the respondents chose Company Y, but was unable to justify her decision in
more detail. Interestingly, although the respondent chose Company Y, she still
mentioned Company X's use of non-numerical communication and perceived it as a
positive factor, but still did not base her investment decision on this. "It came out
strongly from both companies at first that I would not invest just because I do not know
or understand the industries they operate in. If I had to choose one of the companies
as an investment target, I would choose Company Y instead. I cannot justify this
decision in any way, but it is made on a purely emotional basis. Of course, Company
X explains in more detail how it intends to achieve its goals, which Company Y did not
do, but I would still choose Y."- Informant A
Two respondents out of eight again said they would not be able to make a rational
choice between the two companies because the information is too narrow and the
numbers are so similar. Indeed, both respondents said they needed more information
about the company in order to be able to answer this question. ‘’I see so little difference
between the two companies. All the financial figures and growth are almost identical,
so based on this information, I cannot properly tell which one I would prefer to invest
in or which would ultimately be a more rational option. In order to be able to choose
one of these companies, I would need more information about the product itself.”Informant D

5.4 Summary of the results
Based on the research results, we can conclude that investors' investment decisions are
made in multiple ways. The decisions of more inexperienced investors are more
influenced by their cognitive errors, feelings, intuition, and the opinions of others,
while the decisions of more experienced investors are more focused on their own
analyses.
When discussing the importance of non-numerical communication in general, all
respondents agreed that it is an essential part of investment communication, as it
provides information about a company's operations, situation, and future that numbers
alone cannot tell. When analyzing Company X and Company Y, 6/7 of the respondents
chose Company X as the hypothetical investment target, utilizing in-depth nonnumerical communication in its equity story. On this basis, we can conclude that indepth non-numerical investment communication in equity stories' financial outlook
and future goal sections impacted their investment decisions positively.
73

Janette Murto

Several respondents also perceived reading non-numerical communication as more
pleasant and more effortless than reading mere numbers. Of course, this was also
clearly influenced by the respondents' investment experience and understanding of key
financial figures. In addition, respondents pointed out that without non-numerical
communication, it is impossible to give justifications for things that numbers cannot
tell, which is why some respondents said they give even more weight to non-numerical
communication than to realized numbers and goals. Of course, a few of the
respondents also said they emphasized more the importance of numerical
communication, but neither of these respondents underestimated the importance of
non-numerical communication.

6 Analysis of the results
In this chapter of the thesis, the empirical data presented in the previous chapter will
be analysed in a deeper level, while linking it to the literature presented in this thesis’
theoretical framework chapter. The purpose of this chapter is to answer the following
research question:
1. How in-depth non-numerical investor communication is perceived among
investors?
2. Does in-depth non-numerical communication in the financial statement section
of an equity story impact investor’s investment decision on the Finnish stock
market?

6.1 How in-depth non-numerical investor communication is
perceived among investors?
In this Subchapter, the first empirical research question of 'How in-depth nonnumerical Investor communication is perceived among investors?' is being answered.
The Theoretical chapter of this thesis stated that the use of non-numerical investor
communication among listed companies has become much more common, as today's
investors crave more in-depth information about the company, its business model, and
74

Janette Murto

opportunities. (Laskin & Laskin, 2017) However, investors think differently, which
means that one investor can react differently to one type of investor communication
while another one can react again differently as investors are prone to cognitive errors,
heuristics, prejudices, and emotions. (Nofsunger, 2017) As non-numerical investor
communication can be produced differently and therefore perceived in different ways,
it is essential to understand on a deeper level how Finnish investors perceive and what
are their attitudes towards non-numerical investor communication. Only by
understanding which kind of an impact a certain type of non-numerical investor
communication has on investors, a company can succeed when producing nonnumerical investor communication.
The study revealed that Finnish investors consider non-numerical communication as
an essential source of information that gives deeper insights and an understanding of
a company's situation now and in the future. Many respondents firmly pointed out that
non-numerical communication can inform things that numbers alone cannot tell, so
non-numerical communication is given much weight and is considered as an important
source of information. More inexperienced investors also find non-numerical
communication easier to read and understand than just numbers, and when used in
support of numbers, it helps to understand the bigger picture better. In this way, we
can state that non-numerical communication can provide important additional
information about what is behind the numbers and make it easier for both more
experienced and less experienced investors to understand the company's situation.
Because one of the purposes of investor communications is to create a selling image
of a company to investors, the tone of non-numerical investor communications is often
positive. (Koskela, 2015) The research revealed that investors do not consider selling
and positive non-numerical communication to be negative in any way, as long as it is
based on factual information. Many respondents believed that the tone of nonnumerical communication should be positive rather than too neutral, as it makes
reading more interesting and certainly increases the interest towards the company in
their eyes. The research interviews also highlighted the fact that Finnish investors have
very strong trust in the investor communication of Finnish companies, which is why
non-numerical communication is also quite strongly trusted. Many of the respondents
were aware that Finnish companies are subject to laws that prevent them from
disseminating false information. Therefore, the information and facts reported in
75

Janette Murto

investor communication were taken mainly as facts, even if they were future goals for
which no one is able to provide clear factual information.
However, excess positivity and selling tone in investor communication also have their
limits. Many respondents pointed out that if a text is too selling, its credibility suffers.
Even if non-numerical communication is to be positive in tone, it must not be excess
positive. Among the respondents, especially more experienced investors, emphasized
that if the text is overly positive, interest in the text and the company may end there.
However, it is also important to point out that opinions also varied in terms of excess
positivity, even among inexperienced investors. In other words, how positively toned
the text the investor wants to read was not directly related to the investor’s experience
but rather to the person’s subjective perspective.
In conclusion, we can state that Finnish investors perceive non-numerical
communication as an essential part of investor communication, which adds value to
numerical communication and investment decisions. The positive and selling tone in
non-numerical communication is perceived as a positive thing, as it makes reading
more meaningful. However, excess positivity and selling tone in non-numerical
communication is perceived negatively. In other words, there is a subtle limit to how
positive and selling non-numerical communication is perceived among Finnish
investors.

6.2 The impact of in-depth non-numerical communication in
equity stories’ financial outlook on investment decisions
This subchapter answers the empirical research question ‘Does and how in-depth nonnumerical communication in the financial statement section of an equity story impact
investor’s investment decision on the Finnish stock market?’. Many different
theoretical sources and studies have highlighted the importance of non-numerical
investor communication in investment decisions. Previous research has highlighted,
for example, that numbers alone are no longer enough to base an investment decision
(Laskin & Laskin, 2017) and that content, word choices, and how information is
presented to investors can influence investors' decision-making. (Moreno & Zhang,
2020) When discussing non-numerical investor communication in the context of
76

Janette Murto

equity stories, its importance becomes even bigger, as equity stories are one of the first
marketing materials a company publishes to its potential investors in the listing
process, when investors do not have that much information of the company as they
cannot seek for information about how the company has succeeded in the stock
exchange. (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016)
The research revealed that the use of in-depth non-numerical communication to
support the financial situation and future goals of a company in its equity story
increases the investability of the company and this way impacts positively on
investors’ investment decisions. For many Finnish investors, numerical information
alone is not enough to provide enough information about the company's situation to be
able to make investment decisions based on it. The main reason for this is that numbers
alone do not provide an answer to the questions 'why' or 'how', which makes it almost
impossible for investors to predict the company's future. The question asked in the
study, “Which company would you prefer to invest in, Company X or Company Y?”,
The majority of respondents chose Company X, which had more broadly justified its
business through non-numerical communication and how it will achieve a successful
future. If an investor does not understand how the company's historical growth has
been achieved so far or how growth will happen in the future, investors also cannot
fully trust that the development will continue as it has been. Investors are aware that
business situations can change and the change can be affected by many different
factors, which is why investors need motivations from the company’s non-numerical
communication to the question how the company’s growth will be ensured in the
coming years. When investors receive this information through non-numerical
communication, they find the investment decision safer, than if the future prospects
were only speculative and based merely on historical numbers, not motivations.
Inexperienced investors base their investment decisions mainly on intuition and are
more prone to cognitive errors, which impact how they understand and react to nonnumerical information. The study also revealed that non-numerical communication
could evoke various positive emotions that can drive, in particular, feeling investors
making irrational investment-decisions. On the other hand, the investment decisions
of more rational investors are more strongly influenced by the information content,
i.e., what information non-numerical communication can provide about the current and
future situation of the company. In other words, non-numerical communication
77

Janette Murto

positively affects the investment decisions of both experienced and inexperienced
investors if its content is produced correctly.
Based on the research results, we can state that in-depth non-numerical communication
is a significant part of companies' investment communication as the use of in-depth
non-numerical communication can impact an investor's understanding of the
numerical material produced by a firm and build trust, motivate, and 'sell' a firm as an
investment target to investors in entirely different ways than numbers alone could.

7 Conclusions
In this chapter conclusions of the research are presented. The chapter will begin with
a summary of findings, leading to theoretical implications, practical and managerial
implications, after which the limitations of the study and suggestions for future
research are presented.

7.1 Summary of findings
This thesis studied non-numerical investor communication and further examined the
impact of in-depth non-numerical investor communication in equity story’s financial
outlook on Finnish investors’ investment decisions.
The research revealed that the use of in-depth non-numerical communication to
support the financial information and future goals of a company in its equity story
increases the investability of the company and this way positively impacts on
investors’ investment decisions. By in-depth non-numerical information, we mean
written text that opens up company information deeper than what mere numbers are
capable of. For example, if a company names its future goal to be 30% growth, indepth non-numerical information can clarify the details of the goal and motivate the
statement by informing how and why the goal is achievable.
The research revealed that it is not enough for investors to only hear statements from
a company, even though Finnish investors’ have a strong trust on Finnish listed
companies and what they inform about their operations. It came clear that motivations
78

Janette Murto

and explanations are needed. Most of the respondents named that the most important
information content they want when evaluating a company is the kind of information
that would enable them to understand the company's business direction and assess its
future development. In other words, answers to questions how and why. The study
respondents strongly pointed out that without in-depth non-numerical communication,
it is difficult to understand the overall picture and that non-numerical communication
adds value when promises and intentions are based on concreteness. In other words,
in-depth non-numerical information makes it easier for the reader to understand what
is behind the short statements. This makes it easier for the investor to understand
cause-and-effect relationships when analysing and evaluating a company. In-depth
non-numerical information also gives the informing company a possibility to persuade
the reader believe the goals and statements that the company has stated, which can be
an essential factor in competing with rival companies on the stock market to stand out.
Based on the research results, we can state that in-depth non-numerical communication
is a significant part of companies' investment communication as the use of in-depth
non-numerical communication can impact an investor's understanding of the
numerical material produced by a firm and build trust, motivate, and 'sell' the firm as
an investment target to investors in entirely different ways than numbers or short
superficial non-numerical statements alone could.

7.2 Theoretical contribution
Prior research has shown non-numerical investor communications positive impact on
investment decisions in many ways. It has been researched how the use of nonnumerical investor communication impacts investors in annual reports (Amer & Maris,
2003), in news flashes (Hales et. al., 2010), and in earnings warnings. (Chen & Chang,
2017) However, a research gap still existed in relation to whether and how the use of
in-depth non-numerical communication in equity stories’ financial outlook impacts
Finnish investors’ investment decisions.
This study confirmed that non-numerical communication is also an essential part of
equity story's financial and future growth section, positively influencing investors'
investment decisions. Thus, this study complemented the theory by confirming and
verifying that non-numerical communication also works in listing communications
79

Janette Murto

and equity stories. As the positive impact of non-numerical communication on another
investment communication platform has been verified through this study, it further
reinforces the argument that non-numerical communication has an overall positive
impact on investment decisions.
This research also produced new information for the research field of non-numerical
communication, examining the depth of non-numerical communication. Many
previous studies have focused, for example, on individual word choices, thus providing
information on what tone and words the non-numerical text should use. On the other
hand, this study looked at the utilization of non-numerical communication from a very
different perspective, focusing on what information and what kind of images can be
created with the textual content itself. The results of the research showed that, as
previous studies have shown, the tone of the text can be selling and still credible, but
more importantly, the research answered the question of what kind of investors want
and believe, i.e., what questions should be answered and why so that investors would
have more faith and confidence in the investor communications produced by
companies and the facts and goals told there.
This study also provided new information on the Finnish stock exchange market and
Finnish investors, investment behavior, and investment decision-making, which is of
great value, especially for Finnish listed companies. The study revealed, for example,
that Finnish investors have a highly strong trust on Finnish companies’ reporting as
they trust that Finnish listed companies obey the law and therefore do not spread false
information. The study also revealed that Finnish investors, especially more
unexperienced ones, feel safer when investing in Finnish companies as there is more
trust towards the company and the business is easier to understand. As cultures,
languages, and trust-levels towards the government and listed companies are different
in different countries, it is essential to gain more specific information about specific
markets, as not everything can be generalized. This study proved that in-depth nonnumerical communication impacts positively on Finnish investors’ investment
decisions in the Finnish stock exchange market and that in Finland in-depth nonnumerical information is seen as trustworthy information among investors.

7.3 Practical implications
The findings of this research provide a variety of managerial actions that can be used
to improve the use of non-numerical communication in investor communication and
especially in equity stories’ financial and future outlook. One of the most central
finding is that much emphasis should be placed on non-numerical communication, as
this is the only way to improve the company’s image to the investors that has a direct
impact on investors’ investment decisions.
In order for non-numerical communication to positively impact investors' investment
decisions, the party producing it must understand what kind of non-numerical
communication the company must produce in terms of content, word choice, and tone
of voice. Because the target groups of listed and soon-to-be listed companies are broad,
including

both

more

experienced

and

unexperienced

investors,

investor

communication should appeal to both. According to the study, the information that
investors need when reading the financial and future growth expectations part of an
equity story that provides non-numerical communication should be informative,
provide additional in-depth information, and motivate the facts and goals presented so
that the investor reading the material would get justifications for the things a company
informs. It is important that the non-numerical information is written shortly and
vividly so that it is interesting to read for both unexperienced and more experienced
investors. The tone of the non-numerical information can be positive and selling,
however excess positivity should be avoided as it could have a negative impact on the
investors' attitudes towards the company and make the information seem unreliable.

7.4 Limitations of the study
There were certain limitations in this study that could have an impact on the study
results. Due to the transparency of the study, these limitations are presented in this
section. The research materials of the empirical study utilized the equity storys of two
nearly identical companies. The materials were sent to the respondents in advance, as
answering the questions required familiarization with these materials. Although the
importance of reading the materials with thought was emphasized to the respondents,
we still cannot be sure how accurately and deeply the materials had actually been
81

Janette Murto

accessed, which has made it possible that respondents could have familiarized
themselves with the pre-materials at very different levels. The respondents' answers
and familiarity with the preliminary material may also have been influenced because
the research interview was not an actual investment situation. In other words, when
real money was not invested, motivation may not have been at the same level when
analyzing the information as it would have been in an actual investment situation.
There were also certain limitations in the research materials themselves. Although the
companies were very identical, a few differences still existed. For example, Company
X's turnover was slightly higher than Company Y's, although the growth figures were
relative with percentage. This may have had some effect on the formation of
investment decisions. If the respondents paid much attention to the slightly higher
turnover of another firm, it might have consciously or unconsciously influenced the
comparative responses. Also, as both of the companies were told to be operating in the
same industry, it has been possible that the respondents have reflected these companies
to the market size and thus comparing each other as competitors.

7.5 Suggestions for future research
The study of non-numerical communication will indeed not cease to slow down, as
knowledge is still limited. Also, with new target groups, generations, and increasingly
electronic investor communication, communication platforms and content are likely to
change. Thus, future research could focus, for example, on other communication
platforms and how non-numerical communication works there. How non-numerical
communication can be utilized on different social media platforms and their impact
and credibility on investors and their investment decisions will undoubtedly be an
essential and integral part of the future non-numerical investor communications
research field.
There are many different types of investor communication platforms and target groups;
as the number of communication platforms and target groups grows, it could be
beneficial to study how they could be utilized for different target groups. In other
words, future research could focus on answering the question 'How could investor
communication be optimized for different target groups in different platforms?'. It
could be researched from which different platforms different investor groups seek the
82

Janette Murto

most information, which platforms are perceived as the most credible, and which
platforms could have the most significant and most positive impact on investment
decisions and a company's stock market success.

8 Summary in Swedish – Svensk sammanfattning
Icke-numerisk investerarkommunikation
–

Påverkar djupet av icke-numerisk kommunikation i den finansiella utsikterna
av en aktieberättelse investeringsbeslut?

8.1 Inledning
Investerarkommunikation är ett brett begrepp som innehåller allt informationsinnehåll
som ett börsbolag tillhandahåller sin målgrupp, det vill säga investerare. Målet med
informationen till investerare är att göra det möjligt för investerare att skapa sig en
uppfattning av företaget i fråga. Investerarkommunikation kan delas in i icke-numerisk
och numerisk kommunikation, och innehållet i den kan delas upp i icke-finansiell och
finansiell information (Westbrook, 2014). Investerarkommunikation är särskilt viktigt
för företag, eftersom dess främsta syfte är att uppnå en rättvis värdering av företagets
värdepapper (Niri, 2020) och öka investerarnas intresse för företaget. (Suomen
Pörssisäätiö, 2016)
Ett börsbolags kommunikations- och transparensförpliktelser skiljer sig dock
väsentligt från privata företag (Minilex, 2020), eftersom befintliga lagar, förordningar
och rekommendationer avsevärt begränsar börsnoterade företags kommunikation.
(Brysted et al., 2016) Dessa skyldigheter finns och är väsentliga för investerare,
eftersom de säkerställer att investerare har korrekt och aktuell information om
företagets verksamhet och den situation som investeringsbeslut bygger på (Europeiska
unionen. Europeiska kommissionen, 2020).
När vi talar om lagstadgade upplysningsskyldigheter återspeglar vi ofta att finansiell
rapportering främst är numerisk kommunikation. Dagens investerare vill dock inte
bara ha faktablad; de vill ha en djupare förståelse av företaget, dess affärsmodell och
förmåga att skapa mervärde. (Laskin & Laskin, 2017) Det är därför som det mesta av
materialet som ett företag producerat om dess tidigare och framtida resultat gynnar
icke-numerisk kommunikation (Hales, Kuang och Venkataraman, 2010).
Även om upplysningsskyldigheter syftar till att göra det möjligt för investerare att fatta
rationella beslut baserade på korrekt och tillförlitlig information (Europeiska unionen.
Europeiska kommissionen, 2020), är det ett faktum att en person inte alls kan bedöma
84

Janette Murto

alla möjliga osäkerheter och riskfaktorer fullt ut och inte alla människor är rationella
beslutsfattare (Baker & Ricciardi, 2014). Forskning inom psykologi visar att riktade
preferenser påverkar människors förmåga att bearbeta mottagen information och fatta
beslut. (Kunda, 2004) Med andra ord påverkar människors känslor och kognitiva
funktionsnedsättningar investeringsbeslut. (Teall, 2018) På grund av detta har många
studier dykt upp under de senaste åren med fokus på icke-numerisk
investerarkommunikation. (Baginski, Hassell & Kimbrough, 2003) Speciellt inom
finansiell investerarkommunikation har uppmärksamheten skiftat från numeriska till
språkliga och textuella element som används i finansiell kommunikation.
(Whitehouse, Palmieri & Perrin, 2018) Förutom att undersöka icke-numerisk
kommunikation mellan investerare har fokus alltmer betonat hur investerare reagerar
på icke-numerisk kommunikation. (Hutton, Miller & Skinner, 2003)
Eftersom forskningen har ökat inom detta område har det bevisats att ett företag kan
påverka investerarnas beteende positivt med icke-numerisk investerarkommunikation.
Detta argument stöds av olika undersökningar som har visat att ett företag till exempel
positivt kan påverka både sofistikerade och mindre sofistikerade investerare med ickenumeriska kvalitativa uttryck.(Amer & Maris, 2003) Det har också bevisats att ett
företag kan dra nytta av att använda icke-numerisk kommunikation för att stödja den
numeriska

kommunikationen

när

man

kommunicerar

om

ett

företags

avkastningsförväntningar (Baginski et al., 2003) och positivt påverka aktiekurserna
med IR och investerarkommunikation. (Yongshin & Eyun-Jung, 2007) Det är därför
investerarkommunikation i vid bemärkelse är en väsentlig del av börsbolagens dagliga
processer eftersom det ger möjligheter att påverka ett företags börsutveckling.
Användningen av icke-numerisk kommunikation slutar dock inte alltid med en positiv
inverkan på investerare om kommunikationen inte görs korrekt. Det är viktigt att
erkänna att kommunikationens orden, innehåll och ton spelar roll för investerarna.
(Amer & Maris, 2003)

Problemdefinition
Baserat på min litteraturöversikt har användningen av icke-numerisk kommunikation
i investerarkommunikation undersökts omfattande t.ex. av Baginski et al. 2003, Amer
och Maris 2003, Yongshin och Eyun-Jung 2007, Hales et al. 2010, Elliot, Rennekamp
85

Janette Murto

och White 2015, Teall 2018 och Moreno och Zhang 2020 och har visat sig påverka
investerarnas beslutsfattande på flera olika sätt. Det har till exempel undersökts hur
användningen av icke-numerisk investerarkommunikation påverkar investerare i
årsrapporter (Amer & Maris, 2003), i notiser (Hales et al., 2010) och i
resultatvarningar. (Chen & Chang, 2017) Det finns dock fortfarande ett forskningsgap
i förhållande till huruvida och hur användningen av fördjupad icke-numerisk
kommunikation i aktieberättelsers finansiella utsikter påverkar investerare och deras
investeringsbeslut.
En aktieberättelse är en berättelse om ett företag som ett investeringsfall (Ditlevsen,
2012) och syftet är att engagera investerare (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016) och ge den
information investerare behöver för säkra investeringsbeslut (Salo, Marika & Jukka
Oksaharju, 2019, s.418-446). Aktieberättelse kan sägas vara en viktig del i ett
börsbolags

investerarkommunikation,

eftersom

det

är

ett

av

de

första

marknadsföringsmaterial som ett företag publicerar för sina potentiella investerare i
noteringsprocessen. (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016)
Detta ämne är ett intressant forskningsämne, eftersom man kan anta att icke-numerisk
kommunikation har positiva effekter när det används i aktieberättelser. Baserat på min
litteraturöversikt finns det dock inga bevis eller djupare insikter om huruvida djupet
av den icke-numeriska kommunikation som används i aktieberättelsers finansiella
utsikter påverkar investerarnas investeringsbeslut. Därför är det viktigt att få gedigen
kunskap om effekten av användningen av fördjupad icke-numerisk kommunikation i
aktieberättelser så att företag kan dra nytta av det på bästa sätt. Utöver detta har inga
studier gjorts i samband med den finska börsen. När man talar om icke-numerisk
kommunikation är verktyget språk. (Nogueıra, 2020) Den finska börsen består av
finska företag, som enligt lagen är skyldiga att använda nationella språken, finska eller
svenska, som det primära kommunikations- och rapporteringsspråket. (Koskela &
Heino, 2016) Kontexten samt språket som används i icke-numerisk kommunikation
kan påverka effekten på investerare. Därför har jag valt att fokusera på användningen
av djupgående icke-numerisk investerarkommunikation i aktieberättelsers finansiella
utsikter och specifikt på den finska börsen.

8.2 Avhandlingens syfte och forskningsfrågor
Syftet med denna avhandling är att avgöra om och hur användningen av fördjupad
icke-numerisk investerarkommunikation i den finansiella delen av en aktieberättelse
påverkar investerares investeringsbeslut på den finska aktiemarknaden.

Följande forskningsfrågor kommer att undersökas för att svara på frågorna:
F1: Vilka faktorer påverkar investerares investeringsbeslut?
Målet med denna forskningsfråga är att granska de teoretiska begreppen om hur
investeringsbeslut fattas, vilka faktorer som påverkar investerarnas beslutsfattande,
vad vi menar med investerarkommunikation, dess olika former, syfte och betydelse för
både investerare och börsbolag, och förhållandet mellan investeringsbeslut och
investerarkommunikation.
F2: Vilken roll spelar icke-numerisk kommunikation i aktieberättelser?
Målet med denna forskningsfråga är att granska det teoretiska begreppet varför och
hur icke-numerisk kommunikation används och kan användas i aktie-berättelser.
F3: Påverkar fördjupad icke-numerisk kommunikation i den finansiella sektionen av
en aktieberättelse investerarens investeringsbeslut på den finska aktiemarknaden?
Målet med denna empiriska forskningsfråga är att ta reda på hur investerare uppfattar
icke-numerisk investerarkommunikation, hur viktig del av sina investeringsbeslut
investerare anser icke-numerisk kommunikation är, om ett börsbolag kan påverka
investerarens investeringsbeslut genom fördjupad icke-numerisk kommunikation och
om det ger mervärde för investeraren.
F4: Vilka är de teoretiska och ledningsmässiga konsekvenserna för investerare och
företag när de använder icke-numerisk information för att stödja den numeriska
informationen i den finansiella delen av dess aktieberättelse?
Denna normativa forskningsfråga syftar till att utveckla rekommendationer för finska
inom kort noterade företag om användningen av icke-numerisk kommunikation i sin
aktieberättelse.

8.3 Kontextuell bakgrund
Helsingforsbörsen, där finländarna främst investerar, är mycket betydande och
fortsätter att växa hela tiden. Den finska börsen är avgörande för de finländska
företagen som är noterade där, vilket gör att de kan samla in finansiering och för finska
privatpersoner som investerar i dessa börsnoterade företag. Detta argument stöds av
det faktum att i mars 2021 investerades 966 416 753 euro av finländarnas tillgångar i
finska börsnoterade företag (Euroclear, 2021a).
Finländska investerares mest kända och centrala investeringsstil är långsiktiga köpoch innehavsinvesterade aktieinvesteringar, som mestadels riktar sig till finska företag.
Därför kan vi konstatera att säkerheten för investeringar och skyddet av
investeringsbeslut är kritiska, påverkade av reglerad investerarkommunikation. I
Finland reglerar fem parter rapporteringen av finska börsbolag:
1. EU: s marknadsmissbruksförordning MAR och kommissionens föreskrifter
utfärdade i enlighet med förordning 20 och andra föreskrifter på EU-nivå som
kompletterar MAR-förordningen
2. lagen om värdepappersmarknaden, 746/2012 och lagen om finansinspektion,
878/2008
3. Finansdepartementets förordning om regelbundna upplysningsskyldigheter för
värdepappersemittenter 1020/2012
4. Vägledning från ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority),
Finansiell tillsyn och börs
5. Koden för bolagsstyrning publicerad av Securities Market Association.

8.4 Teori
Investeringsbeslut
Även om investeringsbeslut bör fattas rationellt, är investerares beslutsfattande en
komplex fråga som också påverkas av psykologiska frågor som resulterar i skillnader
och irrationellt i investerares beteende. (Pompian, 2012) Även om en investerare skulle
få all nödvändig information om ett företag och dess ekonomiska situation, skulle
beslutsfattandet dock inte vara en enkel och rationell process eftersom
investeringsbesluten är subjektiva och därför tas från investerarens egen synvinkel.
Således består investerarens beslutsprocess både av en analys av objektiva frågor,

88

Janette Murto

såsom förväntad avkastning på investeringen, och av investerarens subjektiva
perspektiv, det vill säga hur investeraren tänker (Pompian, 2012).
Investeringsbeslut beror till stor del på den förväntade avkastningen på investeringen.
För att analysera detta behövs en objektiv analys av företagets verkliga situation
(Virlics, 2013) Företagsanalys är en komplex helhet som försöker ta reda på ett
företags framtida värde. Ett värdefullt företag kan definieras som att det kan generera
höga kassaflöden vilket möjliggörs av skicklighet att växa företagets verksamhet och
generera en god avkastning på investerat kapital (ROIC) (Koller, Goedhart & Wessels,
2010, s.103). När man analyserar värdet på ett företag bör man också förstå företagets
senaste år. Det är därför ofta när en investerare syftar till att förutsäga företags framtid,
används vanligtvis en exakt analys av företagens historiska framgångar för detta
ändamål. (Koller et al., 2010, s.165-171).

Investerarkommunikation
Investerarkommunikation är ett brett koncept som innehåller allt informationsinnehåll
som ett börsnoterat eller snart börsnoterat företag tillhandahåller sin målgrupp, dvs.
potentiella

och

nuvarande

investerare,

analytiker

och

intressenter.

Investerarkommunikation består vanligtvis av att avslöja finansiell och icke-finansiell,
historisk, aktuell och framtida information om ett företag genom olika medier, i syfte
att upprätthålla och skapa relationer med sin målgrupp (Dolphin, 2004). I takt med att
investerarkommunikation har utvecklats under åren har många företag börjat
producera alltmer strategisk och bredare investerarkommunikation. Resultaten har
ökat användningen av icke-numerisk kommunikation. Numera kommuniceras det
mesta av ett företags granskning om dess tidigare och framtida resultat icke-numeriskt,
med hjälp av språk. (Hales, Kuang och Venkataraman, 2010)
Investerarkommunikation kan delas in i icke-numerisk och numerisk information, och
innehållet i den kan delas upp i icke-finansiell och finansiell information (Westbrook,
2014). Noterade företag publicerar många olika kommunikationsmaterial och
använder flera olika kommunikationsplattformar för att publicera dem. Under årens
lopp

har

investerarkommunikation

skiftat

kraftigt

till

webbaserade

kommunikationsplattformar, varför papperspublikationer numera är ganska sällsynta
(Guggenmos & Bennett, 2021). Investerarkommunikationspublikationer inkluderar
89

Janette Murto

till exempel årsrapporter, brev till investerare, pressmeddelanden och aktieberättelser,
som alla innehåller omfattande information om företagets verksamhet, både numeriskt
och icke-numeriskt, och som inkluderar både finansiell och icke-finansiell
information.

Aktieberättelse
En aktieberättelse informerar investerare om ett företag som ett investeringsfall.
(Ditlevsen, 2012) En aktieberättelse presenterar företagets verksamhet, dess
verksamhetsmiljö, tillväxt- och utvecklingsmöjligheter, konkurrensposition, finansiell
situation, framtida resultatutveckling och noteringens motiv och syfte som publiceras
i en av de första marknadsföringsfaserna i en notering. (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016)
Aktieberättelse har en mycket central del i investerarkommunikation och
investerarrelationer eftersom dess syfte är att engagera och övertyga investerare att
företaget är ett bra investeringmål. (Suomen pörssisäätiö, 2016) Utöver detta ger en
egenkapitalhistoria också viktig information om företaget för investerare för att säkra
sina investeringsbeslut. (Salo, Marika & Jukka Oksaharju, 2019, s.418 - 446)

8.5 Metodval
Denna undersökning är en kvalitativ studie som använder semistrukturerade
djupintervjuer, eftersom syftet med denna avhandling är att avgöra om och hur
användningen av fördjupad icke-numerisk kommunikation i den finansiella delen av
aktieberättelsen påverkar investerares investeringsbeslut på den finska börsen.
I denna avhandling användes både primär- och sekundärdata, vilket gav ett bredare
perspektiv på detta avhandlingsforskningsämne. För att samla information och
synpunkter

på

semistrukturerade

forskningsfrågan
intervjuer

från

kvalitativa

datainsamlingsmetoden.

Halvstrukturerade intervjuer använder en fördesignad intervjumall som möjliggör en
bättre jämförelse av intervjusvar med andra respondenter. Halvstrukturerade intervjuer
innehåller ofta specifika frågor som kan följas av en fråga, "varför?". Med andra ord
ger en semistrukturerad intervju resultat som kombinerar kvantitativa och kvalitativa
data (Guthrie, 2010). Halvstrukturerade intervjuer möjliggör också relativt öppen
90

kommunikation, eftersom intervjun har handlingsutrymme, så ytterligare frågor kan
också ställas under intervjun om förtydliganden behövs för några av svaren. Dessa
ytterligare frågor kan potentiellt spela en avgörande roll i forskningsresultaten,
eftersom utan dem kan vissa svar vara ofullständiga, vilket kan leda till ett
missförstånd om orsak-verkan-förhållandet (Bryman & Bell, 2017).
Forskningsgruppen valdes ut genom att använda systematisk provtagning och, mer
exakt, oproportionerligt stratifierad provtagning. Forskningsgruppen samlades genom
en Facebookgrupp som heter Sijoituskerho (Investment Club) med cirka 90 000
investerare som medlemmar. En deltagarlänk publicerades på Facebookgruppen,
genom vilken intresserade av studien kunde registrera sig för intervjun. Den enda
begränsningen för deltagande i studien var att personen måste ha investerat i
direktaktier. På så sätt säkerställdes att forskningsdeltagarna hade en viss förståelse för
att investera i direktaktier och att investera i allmänhet.
Totalt åtta personer, fyra män och fyra kvinnor, var och en med olika
investeringserfarenhet, deltog i intervjun. Respondenterna samlades in från fyra olika,
tidigare definierade åldersgrupper, 20–29 år, 30–39 år, 40–49 år och 50–59 år. Två
respondenter, en man och en kvinna, valdes ut från varje åldersgrupp. Intervjuerna är
uppkallade efter sin anonymitet i bokstäverna A, B, C, D, E, F, G och H.
För att ta reda på svaren på forskningsfrågorna användes två imaginära företag,
Företag X och Företag Y, i intervjuerna. Varje deltagare i intervjun hade skickats i
förväg korta presentationer av de två företagen och deras verksamhet. Utöver detta
fick deltagarna också aktieberättelser om de två företagen, inklusive endast finansiella,
tidigare och framtida resultatavsnitt. Den finansiella informationen och företagets
verksamhet i båda företagen var mycket lika, vilket resulterade i att
avkastningsförväntningarna och investerarnas vilja att investera i båda företagen
baserat på siffrorna borde matcha. Den finansiella delen av Företagets Xs
aktieberättelse utnyttjade dock icke-numerisk kommunikation för att beskriva
företagets siffror på en djupare nivå, förklara varför siffrorna är som de är och motivera
deras tillväxtförväntningarna. Medan de finansiella delarna av Företagets Ys
aktieberättelse endast presenterade företagsnummer, både numeriskt och ickenumeriskt, men gav inte en mer ingående förklaring eller motivation till varför
siffrorna är som de är eller varför företagets tillväxtförväntningar är som de är.

Begränsningar
Det finns vissa begränsningar i denna studie som kan påverka resultaten.
Forskningsmaterialet i den empiriska studien använder aktieberättelser i två nästan
identiska företag. Materialet skickas till informantrna i förväg, för att svara på frågorna
kräver bekantskap med dessa material. Även om vikten av att läsa material med tanke
betonas för respondenterna, kan vi fortfarande inte vara säkra på hur exakt och djupt
materialet faktiskt läsas.
Det finns också vissa begränsningar i själva undersökningssmaterialet. Även om
företagen är nästan identiska, finns det fortfarande några skillnader. Till exempel
Företag X: s omsättning är lite högre än Företag Ys, även om tillväxttalen är relativ
med procent. Detta kan ha någon effekt på investeringsbesluten. Eftersom båda
företagen verkar i samma bransch kan det också vara möjligt att informanterna
kommer att reflektera dessa företag som konkurrenter. I detta fall analyseras inte
företag som ’individer’, men investeringsbeslutet påverkas också av andra saker än
icke-numerisk kommunikation.

8.6 Resultatbeskrivning och analys
Baserat

på

forskningsresultaten

kan

man

dra

slutsatsen

att

investerares

investeringsbeslut fattas på mycket flera sätt. Mer oerfarna investerares beslut
påverkas mer av deras kognitiva fel, känslor, intuition och andras åsikter, medan mer
erfarna investerares beslut är mer fokuserade på deras egna analyser.
När informarterna diskuterade vikten av icke-numerisk kommunikation i allmänhet
var

alla

respondenter

överens

om

att

det

är

en

väsentlig

del

av

investeringskommunikation, eftersom det ger information om ett företags verksamhet,
situation och framtid som siffror inte kan berätta. Vid analys av Företag X och Företag
Y valde 6/7 av de tillfrågade Företaget X som det hypotetiska investeringsmålet. På
grund

av

detta

kan

vi

dra

slutsatsen

att

en

fördjupad

icke-numerisk

investeringskommunikation i aktieberättelsers finansiella utsikter och framtida
målsektioner hade en positivt effekt på informanternas investeringsbeslut.
Flera informanter upplevde också att det var trevligare och mer enkelt att läsa ickenumerisk kommunikation än bara siffror. Investeringerfarenhet och förståelse för
nycketal hade också en effekt på hur lätt man tänkte att det var att läsa bara siffror.
92

Janette Murto

Dessutom påpekade informanterna att utan icke-numerisk kommunikation är det
omöjligt att ge motiveringar för saker som siffror inte kan berätta, varför vissa
respondenter sa att de lägger ännu större vikt till icke-numerisk kommunikation än till
realiserade siffror och mål. Naturligtvis sa några av de tillfrågade också att de mer
betonade vikten av numerisk kommunikation, men ingen av dessa svarande
underskattade vikten av icke-numerisk kommunikation.
Baserat på forskningsresultaten kan man konstatera att fördjupad icke-numerisk
kommunikation är en betydande del av företagens investeringskommunikation
eftersom användningen av fördjupad icke-numerisk kommunikation kan påverka en
investerares förståelse av det numeriska material som produceras av ett företag, bygg
förtroende, motivera och 'sälja' ett företag som ett investeringsmål till investerare på
helt andra sätt än siffror.

8.7 Slutsats och rekommendationer
Denna studie bekräftade att icke-numerisk kommunikation också är en väsentlig del
av en aktieberättelses finansiella och framtida tillväxtavsnitt, vilket påverkar
investerarnas investeringsbeslut positivt. Således kompletterade denna studie teorin
genom att bekräfta och verifiera att icke-numerisk kommunikation också fungerar i
notering av kommunikation och aktier. Eftersom den positiva effekten av ickenumerisk kommunikation på en annan investeringskommunikationsplattform har
verifierats genom denna studie, förstärker den ytterligare argumentet att icke-numerisk
kommunikation har en övergripande positiv inverkan på investeringsbeslut.
Denna studie gav också ny information om den finska börsen och finska investerare,
investeringsbeteende och investeringsbeslut, vilket är av stort värde, särskilt för finska
börsnoterade företag. Eftersom kulturer och språk är olika i olika länder är det också
viktigt att ha mer specifik information om specifika marknader, eftersom allt inte kan
generaliseras med säkerhet. Denna studie ökade också medvetenheten om att ickenumerisk kommunikation också fungerar positivt på den finska börsen för finska
investerare.
Resultaten av denna undersökning ger en mängd olika förvaltningsåtgärder som kan
användas för att förbättra användningen av icke-numerisk kommunikation i
investerarkommunikation

och

särskilt

i

aktieberättelsers

finansiella

och
93

Janette Murto

framtidsutsikter sektioner. Ett av de mest centrala resultaten är att stor vikt bör läggas
vid icke-numerisk kommunikation, eftersom detta är det enda sättet att förbättra
företagets image för de investerare.
För att icke-numerisk kommunikation kunde påverka investerarnas investeringsbeslut
positivt måste den som producerar den förstå vilken typ av icke-numerisk
kommunikation företaget måste producera. Eftersom målgrupperna för noterade och
snart börsnoterade företag är breda, inklusive både mer erfarna och oerfarna
investerare, bör investerarkommunikation tilltala båda. Enligt studien ska den
information som investerare behöver när de läser de finansiella och framtida
tillväxtförväntningarna i en aktie berättelse som ger icke-numerisk kommunikation
vara informativ, ge ytterligare och fördjupad information, motivera och vara intressant
att läsa. Överdriven positivitet bör dock undvikas eftersom det kan ha en negativ
inverkan på investerarnas inställning till företaget och få informationen att verka
opålitlig.
Förslag till fortsatt forskning
Studiet av icke-numerisk kommunikation kommer verkligen inte att sluta eftersom
kunskapen på ämnet fortfarande är begränsad. Med nya generationer och alltmer
elektronisk investerarkommunikation kommer kommunikationsplattformar och
innehåll sannolikt att förändras. Således kan framtida forskning till exempel fokusera
på andra kommunikationsplattformar och hur icke-numerisk kommunikation fungerar
där.

Hur

icke-numerisk

kommunikation

kan

användas

på

olika

sociala

medieplattformar och deras inverkan och trovärdighet på investerare och deras
investeringsbeslut kommer utan tvekan att vara en väsentlig och integrerad del av det
framtida icke-numeriska investerarkommunikationsforskningsområdet.
Det finns många olika typer av investerarkommunikationsplattformar och målgrupper.
Det

kan

vara

fördelaktigt

att

studera

hur

de

olika

investerarkommunikationsplattformar kan användas för olika målgrupper. Med andra
ord kan framtida forskning fokusera på att svara på frågan "Hur kan
investerarkommunikation optimeras för olika målgrupper på olika plattformar?".

Appendix 3: Interview template in Finnish
Interview questions to the study group.
Nimi:
Ikä:
Sukupuoli:
Paikka ja Aika:
Esittely: Haastattelu aloitetaan lyhyellä tutkimuksen esittelyllä.
1. Kerro lyhyesti itsestäni (mikä on nimesi, ikäsi, koulutus, ammattisi,
koulutus jne.) Taustatietoa, joka auttaa minua analysoimaan
vastauksia.
2. Oletko sijoittanut suoriin pörssiosakkeisiin? Jos olet, mihin
osakkeisiin, onko siellä ollut esimerkiksi suomalaisia pörssiyhtiöitä?
3. Kuinka monen vuoden sijoittamiskokemus sinulta löytyy?
4. Mikä on näkemyksesi suomen osakemarkkinoista?
5. Miten kuvailisit itseäsi sijoittajana? Oletko mielestäsi esimerkiksi:
§

Osta ja pidä -sijoittaja
•

Eli et käy aktiivisesti kauppaa, vaan sijoitat pitkällä
sijoitushorisontilla, jolloin sijoituksia voit pitää
sijoitussalkussasi useita vuosia keskittyen
maksimaaliseen tulokseen, osinkoon ja korkoa korolle
-ilmiöön.

§

Osinkosijoittaja
•

Eli sijoitat yritykseen, joka maksaa tai jonka odotat
maksavan korkeaa osinkoa, josta johtuen sijoituksen
tuotto perustuu osinkotuottoon

§

Arvosijoittaja
•

Eli etsit osakkeita, joiden todellinen arvo ylittää niiden
markkina-arvon, eli arvosijoittaminen perustuu
oivallukseen, jonka mukaan osakkeen tai yhtiön hinta
ja arvo ovat kaksi eri asiaa.

§

Kasvusijoittaja
•

Arvosijoittajat etsivät jo historiallisesti
ansaintamallinsa toimivuuden ja suorituskykynsä
114

Janette Murto

osoittaneita yhtiöitä, kasvusijoittajat sen sijaan
liiketoimintoja joiden tulostaso kohenee nopeasti juuri
nyt ja odotusten mukaan myös tulevaisuudessa.
§

Laatusijoittaja
•

Laatusijoittaja ostaa salkkuunsa ainoastaan erinomaisia
yhtiöitä ja pyrkii ostamaan niitä alennuksella osakkeen
todelliseen arvoon nähden. Laatusijoittajan tuotot
syntyvät yhtiöiden liiketoiminnan suotuisan kehityksen
myötä syntyvästä arvonnoususta.

§

Momentum-sijoittaja
•

Momentum-sijoittaja uskoo, etteivät markkinat ole
tehokkaat – historiatiedolla voi saavuttaa ylituottoja.
Tarkemmin momentum tarkoittaa arvopaperien
hinnoilla havaittua taipumusta jatkaa seuraavien
kuukausien aikana nousuaan (laskuaan), mikäli
arvopaperin hinta on noussut (laskenut) edeltävän 3-12
kuukauden aikana.

§

Vastuullinen sijoittaja
•

Vastuullisella sijoittamisella tarkoitetaan
ympäristöasioiden, sosiaaliseen vastuuseen liittyvien
tekijöiden sekä hallintotapa-asioiden eli ns. ESGasioiden (Environment, Social and Governance)
huomioon ottamista sijoitustoiminnassa siten, että
salkun tuotto- ja riskiprofiili paranevat.

§

Päivätreidaaja
•

On osakkeiden ja valuuttojen päiväkauppaa, jossa
yleensä myydään lyhyeksi.

§

Jokin muu, mikä?

6. Miten kuvailisit sijoittamisen riskinsietokykyäsi, onko se?
Hyvin matala eli et halua ottaa riskiä ja tyydyt pieneen
tuottoon
Matala eli olet valmis tavoittelemaan parempaa tuottoa
pienellä riskillä
115

Janette Murto

Kohtuullinen eli olet valmis ottamaan riskin parempaa tuottoa
tavoiteltaessa ja pääoman osittainen pieneneminen ei ole
ongelma
Korkea eli tavoittelet hyvää tuottoa suurella riskillä ja
pääoman merkittävä pieneneminen ei ole ongelma
(riskinsietokykyasteet määritelty: (Kallunki, Martikainen & Niemelä
2002, 33.)

7. Mitkä tekijät vaikuttavat sijoituspäätöstesi syntyyn?
8. Oletko aiemmin tutustunut jonkin yrityksen sijoitustarinaan tai oliko
tämä sinulle entuudestaan tuttu sijoitusviestintämetodi?
Kysymykset koskien Company X
9. Minkä on näkemyksesi Company X:n taloudellisesta
tilanteesta pohjautuen sijoitustarinan esittelemään informaatioon ja
minkä takia?
10. Company X ilmoitti, että heidän kasvuodotuksensa ovat noin. 30%
ainakin seuraavat kolme vuotta, kuinka todennäköisenä pidät tätä
kasvua pohjautuen sijoitustarinan esittelemään informaatioon ja
minkä takia?
11. Sijoittaisitko tähän yritykseen pohjautuen sijoitustarinan esittelemään
informaatioon ja miten perustelisit tämän päätöksen?
12. Kiinnititkö sijoitustarinassa erityisesti johonkin huomiota, jos minkä
takia?
116

Janette Murto

Kysymykset koskien Company Y
13. Minkä on näkemyksesi Company Y:n taloudellisesta
tilanteesta pohjautuen sijoitustarinan esittelemään informaatioon ja
minkä takia?
14. Company Y ilmoitti, että heidän kasvuodotuksensa ovat noin 30%
ainakin seuraavat kolme vuotta, kuinka todennäköisenä pidät tätä
kasvua pohjautuen sijoitustarinan esittelemään informaatioon ja
minkä takia?
15. Sijoittaisitko tähän yritykseen pohjautuen sijoitustarinan esittelemään
informaatioon ja miten perustelisit tämän päätöksen?
16. Kiinnititkö sijoitustarinassa erityisesti johonkin huomiota, jos minkä
takia?

Vertaavat ja muut kysymykset:
17. Kumpaan yritykseen sijoittaisit mieluummin pohjautuen
sijoitustarinoiden esittelemien informaatioihin ja mikä sai sinut
päätymään tähän lopputulokseen?
18. Mitä markkinointimateriaaleja olet tutkinut yrityksistä, joihin olet
sijoittanut/halunnut sijoittaa?
19. Vaikuttaako ei-numeraalinen viestintä sijoituspäätöksiisi, jos miksi ja
miten, jos ei miksi?
20. Antoiko sijoitustarinan ei-numeraalinen viestintä mielestäsi lisäarvoa
sijoituspäätöksesi synnylle?
