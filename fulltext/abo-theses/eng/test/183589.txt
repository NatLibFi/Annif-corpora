The thesis provides a technical framework of gravitationally fed water distribution
systems in rural developing regions. The functionality of gravity-fed networks’ theory
includes energy profiles in the network, pressures and head losses, and demand and
supply patterns which are needed for the dimensioning of the components. The
components included in network systems are reviewed and how to estimate their sizes is
presented. Furthermore, basic water quality analyses with respective treatment methods
for centralized systems are also reviewed.
The theory is applied to a project proposal of a gravity-fed distribution system in Honde
Valley Ward 10 in Zimbabwe. A group of students from InnoEnergy (KTH, UPC)

conducted a field trip in 2017 to the area where multiple topics with potential for
development were analyzed, whereas the priority was given to the improvement of the
sanitation and water supply situation in Ward 10. The public pipeline built in 2003 is
deteriorating and only few inhabitants have access to it. Consequently, unorganized selfmade haphazardous systems have been built for individual use. The goal of the thesis is
to provide a technical basis for how to develop an improved public system in the area in
order to controllably manage the water resources and provide a reliable water supply to
the inhabitants.
The area has been mapped remotely with an open-source software, QGIS, based on
satellite pictures and interviews. The water sources have been surveyed with a
topographical runoff simulation in QGIS and verified with local measurements,
whereafter a new proposed distribution system has been drawn and dimensioned
according to the presented theory using data provided by Zimbabwe National Water
Authority (ZINWA) and Fortune Development Center (FDC). To verify the functionality
of the network from a hydrological perspective the proposed system has been simulated
on MIKE+ modelling software by DHI.
The result from the simulations shows that Ward 10 is technically suitable for a gravityfed water distribution network, however, some approximations have been used that need
further on-site data and verifications to be more accurate. Although the area is technically
suitable, there are other aspects that need to be considered. For example analysis of the
state of the current pipelines and an improved maintenance and management system for
the water supply infrastructure need to be developed.

1 Introduction
This project is part of a more extensive program to develop the living standards in Honde
Valley Ward 10, Zimbabwe. In developing countries, sustainability may be suppressed
by more urgent pressures of the control for the situation regarding economic survival or
population growth, as well as a lack of understanding and education. Our common future
by the Brundtland reports defined sustainable development as:
"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own needs." However, solutions to environmental
problems are not without cost and, thus, a choice between multiple options must be made
with an understanding of basic economic principles. Hence, proposals such as this one
must be reviewed with other possible options and their feasibility determined from the
local end users’ perspective.
In 2017, a survey was conducted by students from InnoEnergy (KTH and UPC) where
multiple aspects of the living standards in the village were analyzed, where the focus was
on the following topics:
-

water supply harmonization, purification, and sanitation

-

sustainable and clean energy access

-

roads and infrastructure improvement

-

agriculture

-

community services

-

ecotourism

Water supply was prioritized as the first topic to improve. The sanitation standards are
primitive and access to purified water is lacking. Currently, the purification of the water
is done on an individual level in Ward 10 (Chikuhwa, 2021). Poor sanitary conditions
with a combination of poor nutrition can have disastrous effects on the community when
water-related diseases rapidly spread throughout the village (Tebbutt, 2002). Ward 10 is
developing a "green belt" program where the water supply for irrigation is focused on.
This will help the inhabitants provide a livelihood from exporting products from their
agriculture. Therefore, water distribution in large quantities with relatively good quality
is essential to improve. A reliable method is through a pipelined network with a
centralized treatment.

2
A theoretical framework is presented in the thesis of how gravitationally distributed water
systems work, i.e. how the pressure profiles and demand patterns determine the
components’ dimensions of the system. The components are tanks, pipes and filters which
are reviewed, and rough dimensioning of their sizes is presented. The presented theory is
applied to the situation in Honde Valley Ward 10, with a goal to improve the water supply
situation for the inhabitants. The situation of the area is reviewed based on the data
provided by FDC, ZINWA and the previous report. Mapping of the village borders and
water resources has been made with an open-source software, QGIS. The maps are
imported to a hydraulic simulation software MIKE+ WD, to prove the proposed network's
hydraulic functionality. Technical details and management plans need to be verified from
on-site surveys at a later stage of the project.

3

2 Theory of gravitationally assisted water distribution
systems
A distribution network should be built where there is a concentrated population;
otherwise, excessive pipe length must be laid out, and other means of collecting water
might be more efficient. Two conditions must be met for a gravity distribution network
to work. Firstly, the water quantity from the sources must be equal to or larger than the
water demand. Secondly, at least a 1% slope from the water source or header tank to the
end node of the system is needed for a gravity-fed distribution, i.e., the topographic energy
profile. If these two conditions are met, then theoretically, a gravity-driven system can be
built (Sampers, 2005).
Some general aspects for distribution networks in developing countries need to be
considered when designing the system. It needs to be relatively simple to construct. The
elements should be able to be repaired with local technologies. If a system is built with
imported parts, spare parts can be difficult to obtain and the whole network might be left
malfunctioning or unused. Therefore, the components should be made of materials which
can be obtained from the local markets. Using local resources also reduces the cost of
construction, which is another crucial criterion (WHO, 2017).
The whole system should be easily operated, maintained, and supervised without needing
professional training or education. If a problem in the process line occurs, it should be
able to be resolved by the locals to keep the process continuously running. In some areas
where electricity is expensive, it could also be necessary to have a process that does not
need electricity continuously. Sometimes the area lacks infrastructure or is otherwise
inaccessible; therefore, minimal machinery should be required to construct the facilities,
and no electricity to operate the system can be an essential aspect (WHO, 2017).

4

2.1 Energy profiles
The topographic profile describes the energy balances in the system. It is a good custom
to draw the profile for each line and include the line’s elements in the profile to obtain a
summary of the line’s functionality. For the topographic survey, a LIDAR map can be
used as a rough estimation. For a more detailed study of the elevation for the system, an
on-site survey should be done with the use of a theodolite, or alternatively, an Abney level
or clinometer in inaccessible areas (Sampers, 2005).
Bernoulli’s equation (1) describes the energy principle in gravity-fed distribution
systems: the energy at the beginning of the system equals the sum of the energy at the end
of the system and the friction losses. It can be divided into three parts, the velocity in the
1

system (2 ∙ 𝜌 ∙ 𝑉 2 ), the elevation of the system (𝜌 ∙ 𝑔 ∙ ℎ) and the pressure in the system
(𝑝), which should all equal a constant energy level (𝑄𝑐 ).
1
∙ 𝜌 ∙ 𝑉 2 + 𝜌 ∙ 𝑔 ∙ ℎ + 𝑝 = 𝑄𝑐
2

(1)

The pressure in water-distribution systems is usually expressed in water columns as meter
water gauges (mWG), i.e., the weight of the water above the considered point.
1kg
= 1 bar = 10 mWG
cm2

(2)

5
2.1.1 Static pressure
Static pressure is the pressure profile of the water energy when all the outlets are closed,
and the flow is zero. In simple systems, this should be the maximum pressure in the pipes,
which determines the pressure limits and material choices for the pipes. The pressure load
in closed pipes is regarded as the water column in meters between its upper point and the
point of consideration. The static pressure (𝑝𝑠𝑡 ) can be described as equation 3, where (𝐻)
is the elevation difference from the two measured points (Sampers, 2005).
𝑝𝑠𝑡 (𝑚𝑊𝐺) = 𝐻(𝑚)

(3)

Figure 1, static pressure gradient
Nominal pressure (PN) is the pressure the chosen pipes should withstand without rupture,
which in a static-head profile is the same as the static pressure. Standardized sizes range
from PN6 up to PN400.

6
2.1.2 Dynamic pressure
The dynamic pressure is the pressure occurring when valves and taps are open, and a flow
in the pipes is present due to head losses in the pipes when the water is moving (see
chapter 2.1.3). The dynamic pressure (𝑝𝑑𝑦𝑛 ) is therefore described as the static
piezometric level (𝐻) subtracted by the head losses (∆𝑝), as depicted in Figure 2 and
equation 4.
𝑝𝑑𝑦𝑛 = 𝐻 − ∆𝑝

Figure 2, dynamic pressure gradients

(4)

7
2.1.3 Head losses
The linear head losses in a pipe depend on several things: the pipe diameter, the flow in
the pipe, the length of the pipe, and the roughness of the pipe material. As a rule of thumb,
a head loss coefficient of 1% corresponds to a loss of 1 mWG for a 100-meter-long pipe.
For a more precise calculation, head loss formulas have been developed. The most used
friction loss formula used in the US is the Hazen-Williams (see equation 5). It can only
be used for water, not other liquids, and was initially developed for turbulent flows only
(Sampers, 2005).

𝐻𝐿 =

4.727 ∙ 𝐿 ∙ 𝑄1.852
𝐶 1.852 ∙ 𝑑 4.871

(5)

where 𝐿 is the pipe length, 𝑄 is the flow, 𝑑 is the inner diameter of the pipe, and 𝐶 is the
resistance coefficient which varies depending on which pipe material is used, according
to Table 1.

2.1.4 Secondary head losses
Secondary head losses are the friction from when water runs through fittings, valves,
junctions, etc. Secondary head losses are generally only about 10% of the linear head
losses and are usually neglected in simple networks (Sampers, 2005).

8

2.2 Base demand
The estimated lifetime of the network system should be around 10-30 years; therefore,
population growth needs to be considered when designing the demand flow. Usually, a
30-year anticipation of population growth gives a relatively good ratio between the cost
and the result. Equation 6 can be used to estimate the population growth.
𝑟 𝑡
𝑃𝑓 = 𝑃0 ∙ (1 +
)
100

(6)

where 𝑃𝑓 is the future estimated population, 𝑃0 is the current population, 𝑟 is the local
growth ratio, and 𝑡 is the time perspective. (Arnalich, 2020)
The amount of water per capita needed is illustrated in figure 3. For a long-term solution
of a pipelined water system, the demand per inhabitant should be at least 60-80 liters per
capita per day of water in developing regions, whereas 5 − 10 l/m2 is used for crop
(WHO, 2017).

9
2.2.1 Demand pattern
The demand pattern tests the network’s worst-case scenario when water is used
simultaneously in larger quantities during the day. A generic daily domestic pattern is
pictured in Figure 4, where the demand is larger in the morning and afternoon, whereas it
is lower during nighttime. The base demand is multiplied by the multiplier, which causes
variations in the demand; therefore, to keep the average base demand accurate, the
average value of the multiplier must be equal to one. The multiplier can, during peak
hours, reach up to 2.5 times the average demand (Arnalich, 2020).

10
In addition to daily variations of the water demand, weekly and monthly water demand
and supply variations occur as well. These can depend on cultural and seasonal changes
and varies throughout regions. If no further survey of the weekly and monthly variations
is done from the area, a generic multiplier of 1.4 can compensate for the changes.
Unaccounted water uses such as leaks, unauthorized connections, and spilled water when
filling containers is about 20% of the average demand; therefore, another multiplier of
1.2 is added to the base demand.
In a worst-case scenario, all the multipliers are added to the base demand simultaneously,
which equals 4.2 times the base demand. Therefore, the system should be designed to
sustain the worst-case scenario, where the design flow is the sum of all the taps opening
simultaneously, which is the base demand multiplied by 4.2 (Arnalich, 2020).
Preferably, surveys need to be done in the area of interest to find a suitable indicative
demand and supply patterns. If no data are available, the presented generic numbers can
be used.

11

2.3 Water quality, analyses, and treatment
The purpose and end-use of the water determine whether treatment of the water is needed
or not, i.e., if it is for drinking or irrigation. Treating irrigation water may be considered
a waste of resources but, depending on the demand ratio of the drinking water and
irrigation water and the total flow, the water qualities can be integrated into one system
if it is economically more beneficial than building two separate systems. Therefore, if
drinking water is included, treatment is a necessity for the network. Untreated water may
also cause more wear to the system and clog the pipeline depending on the quality.
Although water treatment is essential, large quantities of reasonably good quality water
are preferable to an insufficient quantity of good quality water. An inadequate amount of
water cannot ensure minimum hygiene levels, potentially leading to more acute health
problems (Action contre la faim, 2008).
In many developing countries lacking public distribution system, the cleaning and
purification responsibility of raw water is left to the consumers themselves. Common
domestic treatment methods are boiling the water to kill bacteria, filtrating the water
through ceramic filters, or solar disinfection (SODIS) (Zinn, et al., 2018). Although these
methods can be effective treatment methods to obtain drinkable water, it takes time from
other activities, such as education and work, if people treat the water themselves. Also, it
requires education and knowledge of the dangers of drinking untreated water for people
to understand to purify the raw water themselves, which risks the spreading of waterborne diseases. Therefore, large-scale centralized water purification is a significant step
to enable inhabitants focus on other tasks than water treatment and to meet the sustainable
development goals such as “clean water and sanitation” as well as “decent work and
economic growth” amongst others.
The treatment in a centralized cleaning system is often done in multiple steps depending
on the raw water quality. The water treatment method and number of steps required are
based on the raw-water quality and catchment method (see section 2.4.1). Therefore, the
intake raw-water quality must be analyzed before choosing a suitable method.
2.3.1 Common Water contaminants
The water source is either groundwater, surface water, or rainwater. Depending on the
source and location of the water, the quality may vary. For instance, the type of soil and
rock the water runs through significantly affects contaminants it may contain. Also,
depending on the season when the flow and temperature varies may change the water

12
quality. In addition to the natural contaminants, human activities pollute the water, such
as poor agricultural practices, dumping garbage, and open defecation (sswm, 2021).
Water contaminants are divided into three qualities, chemical, biological and physical.
-

Chemical
o Natural organic chemicals and materials
o Toxic metals and solvents
o Inorganic substances

-

Biological
o Pathogens and microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and
worms

-

Physical
o Suspended particles (turbidity), temperature, odor, color and taste

The contaminants are furthermore often divided into primary and secondary
contaminants. In general, the primary prioritized contaminants are biological pathogens
and chemicals known to cause adverse health effects. Non-harmful contaminants that do
not cause severe health effects but influence the smell, taste, color, and turbidity of the
water or cause technical effects that can damage pipelines or appliances are secondary
contaminants such as zinc iron particulate matter and humic material (WHO, 2017).
The World Health Organization has complete lists summarized on most known
contaminants, a few of the most common are summarized in Table 2.

2.3.1.1 Biological contaminants
In rural areas, industries are quite limited and the primary source of biological pollution
is contact with excrements which spread diseases. Excreta contain a high number of
microorganisms, which are not visible to the naked eye. Water sources can easily be
polluted in various ways, if they are not properly protected. Especially surface water
sources need to be assumed to have been polluted and therefore require treatment. Table
3 presents the most common diseases that can spread through poor water treatment and
hygiene standards.

Water age is another essential quality to consider when distributing water through a
pipeline system. Water stagnation and excessive water age can cause chlorine disinfection
byproducts (CDBP) when the disinfectant concentration is not strong enough to control
microorganisms. The water age is defined as the time it takes for the water to reach its
consumers from the water source and is, therefore, influenced mainly by the distribution
system’s flows and pipe lengths. Often in dead ends or large tanks, water becomes
stagnant and degrades. Satellite chlorination can hinder microorganisms from forming
(Ingeduld, 2017). An optimized pipeline with loop topologies can keep the water flowing
in the pipes, decreasing the water age — more details in section 2.4.5 about pipeline
layout designs.

14
2.3.1.2 Chemical contaminants
Common natural chemicals found in East African waters are Calcium, Magnesium,
Potassium, Sodium, Bicarbonate, Carbonates, Chloride, Nitrate, and Sulphate ions.
Although water can contain many constituents, generally, only a few contaminants
propose a health risk. Therefore, different parameters require different priorities for their
management. Some propose direct health risks if found in large concentration, while
others do not cause severe health effects but cause acceptance problems from the users
due to bad odor or taste. Table 4 presents some general chemical contaminants that can
cause health effects, and Table 5 presents chemical substances that can cause acceptance
problems and wear to the distribution system (WHO, 2017).

The physical appearance of the water can cause acceptance issues for the users, although
the water is safe to drink. Therefore, the contaminants presented in table 6 are regarded
as a secondary priority. The color of the water needs to be relatively clear, and the taste
and odor should be neutral. Usually, a turbidity of lower than 5 NTU is acceptable for the
color. Table 5 summarizes some chemical contaminants that can cause acceptance
problems (WHO, 2017).

2.3.2 Analysis methods in the field
Generally, water can be used for consumption if it has no taste, smell, or significant color
within the user’s acceptance, nor should it have been in contact with excrements or near
any other human activity, such as agricultural fields, industries, or garbage. Field
measurements, such as EC, pH, turbidity, and TVC, can be conducted to overview the
water quality; however, further laboratory analyses are recommended before determining
treatment methods due to the numerous possible contaminants. Qualitative field
observation of the water’s quality is presented in Table 6, however, note that pathogens
are not visible to the naked eye (CAWST, 2009).

An electro conductivity (EC) meter is a good extensive analysis method to measure the
water quality. Conductivity measures the capacity of the water-conducting current
between two nodes, therefore indicating how much minerals and salts are present in the
water (such as Ca+2 , Mg +2 , Na+ , K + , Mn+2 , Cu+2 , Zn+2 , Fe+3 , Cl− , SO−4 and NO−3). EC
should be measured in 20-25 °C water to follow the standard values as conductivity
increases with temperature. Conductivity is usually measured in micro-Siemens by
centimeters but can also be measured in total dissolved solids (TDS) multiplied by 0.64.
Table 7 describes different values acceptable drinkable standardized values (WHO,
2017).

Total dissolved solids (TDS) or total suspended solids (TSS) measures the turbidity in the
water, i.e., the transparency of the water. Suspended particles such as organic waste,
organisms, clay, etc., can affect the color, taste and smell, and the health standards of the
water. High turbidity can also stock filters, fill tanks and pipes with sand and mud, and
damage valves and taps. If chlorination is used, even a low level of turbidity prevents
chlorine from killing germs effectively, since micro-organisms can attach themselves to
particles. Turbidity is measured in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU); for drinking
water, less than 5 NTU is recommended, ideally 0.1 NTU. It can easily be measured in
the field with a turbidity tube meter or an electronic turbidity meter. Turbidity tends to be
lower during the dry season and higher during the rainy season due to higher flows that
stir up the surrounding in the wet season (Action contre la faim, 2008).

The acidity of the water can be measured on the field with colorimetry or a pH meter. A
high pH value can cause a bitter taste, form deposits in the system, and reduce the
effectiveness of chlorine disinfection. Low pH can corrode or dissolve metals, causing
wear to the distribution system (Swenson & Baldwin, 1965). Table 9 shows the
guideline values of suitable pH values for drinkable water.

An effective way to analyze if excreta has polluted the water is by filtering the water
sample through a membrane filtration (0.45 µm) to find thermotolerant bacteria. By
incubating the filter in a warm and nutritious environment, visible colonies will form on
the filter after 16-18 hours, if bacteria are present. About 90% of thermotolerant bacteria
is Escherichia Coli (E. coli) which is resistant outside the body and can therefore be found
in polluted waters, which indicates that excreta have contaminated the water. Therefore,
other microorganisms from excrements can also be present. (Action contre la faim, 2008).
For a more comprehensive biological analysis, the Total Viable Count (TVC) is tested in
the laboratory to measure the overall number of bacteria.

The field analysis methods can give reasonable qualitative indications of which pollutants
are present in the water; for further analyses laboratories are required to determine which
specific chemical and biological pollutants are present, since each contamination requires
its own analysis. Therefore, detailed analyses can be expensive, and only prioritized
pollutants and potential elements found from the general field methods need to be
analyzed.

2.3.3 Water treatment methods
The treatment methods required depends on the water quality analyses from the raw water
source and the intake method (see section 2.4.1). Depending on the water quality results,
suitable treatment methods can be selected.
A centralized treatment system is often designed to remove several contaminants,
chemicals, pathogens, and suspended solids; therefore, multiple steps are required to treat
different qualities of the water. The primary step removes the largest physical particles
and turbidity before entering further into the system. The secondary step removes most
of the chemical substances and pathogens, and the tertiary step eliminates any remaining
disease-causing pathogens and stops new ones from forming in the system. (sswm, 2021).
The treatment methods should withstand various flows depending on the seasons (WHO,
2017).

2.3.3.1 Primary step
If direct catchments are used, a physical filter is needed at the inlet to reduce the largest
debris entering and stocking the pipeline system. Bar screens or racks with
15-25 mm gaps remove the largest debris; however, they need to be cleaned regularly,
especially during the rainy season.
If the water is very turbid (>200 NTU), a sedimentation tank is needed before further
treatment. Sedimentation is a physical treatment process where coarser suspended
particles heavier than water are removed by settling them down to the bottom of a tank.
There are many different types and shapes of sedimentation tanks, whereas the most
preferred and widely used are rectangular shaped tanks with horizontal flow, partly
because maintenance costs are low for this type. (Anupoju, 2021). Figure 6 depicts the
principle of a sedimentation tank. The inlet zone allows uniform water dispersion into the
tank’s entire cross-sectional area. The settling zone is where the particles settle through

21
the flowing water. Particles accumulate at the sludge zone, from which they need to be
removed regularly. The outlet zone collects the clarified liquid uniformly from the crosssectional area.

Figure 6, side view of a rectangular sedimentation basin, showing the four typical zones
(Anupoju, 2021)
The flow velocity of water must be reduced for the particles to settle down; the velocity
at which the particles are settling is called settling velocity (𝑉𝑠 ). The settling velocity
depends largely on the size of the particles and the relative density of the particles to the
fluid. There are two settling types, discrete settling and flocculated settling, illustrated in
Figure 7. Due to the larger flocculation size, they settle down more rapidly than discrete
particles. If necessary, flocculants can be added to the fluid to flocculate discrete particles
(Wisniewski, 2012).

The time it takes for the particle to settle is called hydraulic retention time (HRT). The
HRT can be calculated by dividing the height (ℎ) of the basin by the settling flow of the
particle (𝑉𝑠 ), as described in equation 7.
𝐻𝑅𝑇 =

ℎ
𝑉𝑠

(7)

Rough dimensions for the sedimentation tank can be calculated by multiplying the design
flow (𝑄̇ ) with the retention time, as equation 8. The height (ℎ) of a sedimentation tank is
typically between 2 and 3 meters, and the length (𝑙) is four times the width (𝑤), as
equation 9. Preferably, the water flow velocity should be less than 0.005 m/s to avoid
turbulence in the water which may disrupt the sedimentation process.
𝑉 = 𝑄̇ ∙ 𝐻𝑅𝑇
𝑉 = ℎ ∙ 𝑤 ∙ 𝑙 = ℎ ∙ 5𝑤

(8)
(9)

To improve the efficiency of a sedimentation basin inclined plate settlers (IPS-design)
can be added, reducing the area needed for the sedimentation process to occur. This design
is suitable for hilly areas where the construction of large facilities might be challenging
(Wisniewski, 2012).

Figure 8, Sedimentation tank with an Inclined Plate Settler - design (Wisniewski, 2012)

23
2.3.3.2 Secondary step
The secondary treatment step removes the bacteriological pathogens from the water,
making it safe to drink. The secondary step can use slow sand filters as a treatment method
or membrane filters, if the water is severely contaminated.
Slow sand filters (SSF) use gravity to let water flow through a filter of sand (with an
adequate particle diameter size of 0.15-0.3mm). On the top few centimeters, a layer on
the sand forms a biological layer known as the "schmutzdecke," which allows the filter
to remove turbidity and microorganisms from the water. A well-designed SSF can
effectively remove biological pathogens and turbidity in a single step. The treated water
is collected from underdrains at the bottom of the filter. The top sand layer accumulates
solids and needs to be replaced periodically. The typical flow rate is usually between 0.1
and 0.3 m3/h per square meter (WHO, 2017).
SSFs are adequate for low turbidity water. If the water source has a high degree of
turbidity (>200 NTU) or algae contamination it can cause the filter to clog rapidly, in
which case pre-treatment of the water is needed, e.g., sedimentation (see section 2.3.3.1).
SSFs are highly reliable, simple to construct, and have low lifecycle costs. The
construction and maintenance only require basic skills, making this treatment method a
promising filtration method in rural communities with reasonably good initial surface
water source quality (sswm, 2021).

Figure 9, illustration of an SSF construction (Huisman & Wood, 1974)

24
SSFs are very efficient for removing bacteria and viruses; with an efficiency ratio of 9099% removal rate, SSFs will seldom indicate microbial contamination present in the
outlet. However, SSFs are not effective for removing most chemicals, as shown in Table
12 (WHO, 2017).

Disinfectants, such as chlorination, are usually added after the SSF to remove the
remaining contaminants (see section 2.3.3.3), decreasing any activity for bacteria during
the storage and distribution of the water. If chlorine is introduced, it must be added after
the SSF not to interfere with the schmutszdecke (sswm, 2021).
If the raw water contains contaminants that SSFs are ineffective for, membrane filters can
be used, although these filters need more efficient pre-treatment than SSFs not to clog the
filter. Membrane filtration uses a thin, porous sheet to separate contaminants from the
water when a force is applied through the filter. The membrane process can remove
bacteria, microorganisms, particulate material, micropollutants, natural organic material,
and chemicals such as arsenic and fluoride. The membrane filtration can produce potable
water from ground, surface, and seawater sources. However, it is expensive, and the
membrane can be difficult to obtain in rural developing areas, also maintenance and
service of the membrane filters require professional expertise which can be lacking in
remote areas (sswm, 2021).
Due to the importation of membrane filters to rural areas and continuous expert
maintenance needed, membrane filters are not recommended to use in simple distribution
systems and, thus, are not further presented in this context.

25
2.3.3.3 Tertiary step
The tertiary step is a treatment within the distribution system that prevents
recontamination and forming of microorganisms in the pipelines and water tanks,
therefore ensuring the drinking water quality throughout the system.
Chlorination effectively kills remaining pathogens and hinders algae, fungi, and bacterial
growth in pipes and tanks. However, if chlorination is misused, by-products can form that
are toxic and cause odor and taste problems to the drinking water (sswm, 2021).
Different types of chlorine can be used which are in gaseous form, liquid form, or powder
form. Chlorine in gaseous form is usually used in public systems due to higher
concentrations; however, it can be dangerous if used by untrained personnel. Smaller
systems or private households use chlorine in liquid or powder form.
The presence of chlorine residuals in the water after treatment indicates that all oxidable
substances in the water have been oxidized and, therefore, any biological activity
disabled. By maintaining a low chlorine residual concentration assures a successful
treatment; therefore, the concentration should be constantly measured throughout the
distribution system to prevent recontamination in the pipelines and tanks. An ideal
chlorine residual ratio is 0.2-0.5 mg/l. If biological contamination spreads in the system,
shock chlorination can be needed with a 50 mg/l chlorine residual concentration.
Otherwise, an excessive chlorination is corrosive to equipment and undesirable to
consumers due to taste and smell (Oram, 2021).

26
The amount of disinfectant needed depends on the concentration of the chlorine type and
the initial water quality. The time required for the disinfectant to react is called Contact
time (CT). CT depends on the temperature, pH, and targeted microorganisms. It can
roughly be estimated by a K-factor that is temperature and pH-dependent, whereafter it is
divided by the targeted chlorine residual (Oram, 2021).

CT is the contact time in minutes, K is the factor from Table 13, and C is the chlorine
residual concentration, usually between 0.3 and 0.5 mg/l.
Chlorination disinfection by-products (CDBPs) can be produced in the chlorination
process (see Table 14) if the water contains natural organic matters such as fulvic and
humic acids, usually found in tropical regions surface water sources. If the water is very
turbid (>20 NTU), pathogens can attach to suspended particles, reducing the effectiveness
of the chlorine treatment. For these reasons, the water should be pre-treated before
chlorination is introduced unless the quality of the raw water can be ensured. Pretreatment also reduces the CT, increasing the effectiveness and reducing the amount
needed (sswm, 2021).

2.4 Components of a gravity-fed distribution system
The components in a gravity-fed distribution system are illustrated in Figure 10. The
water source and catchment may vary depending on the accessibility and circumstances,
whether from a spring catchment, well, borehole, or surface water. The water source and
its quality determine the treatment method required for the system. The first tank in the
pipeline system is a header tank used as an initial flow buffer to the rest of the system. If
treatment is required, it can also be used as a sedimentation tank and be combined with a
slow sand filter. If the elevation difference is too significant and the pressure in the
pipeline becomes substantial, break-pressure tanks can be installed as primitive
substitutes to pressure-reducing valves to reduce the internal pressure to atmospheric
pressure in the pipeline. Storage tanks are the largest components in the system and are
used to secure a constant supply regardless of the demand and supply variations. The
outlets distribute the water close to the consumers and need to follow certain criteria to
be practical.

Figure 10, component overview of a gravity-fed distribution system (Sampers, 2005)

28
2.4.1 Catchment
There are generally three different ways of catching water to a distribution system. These
are rainwater, surface water and groundwater.
Rainwater can be harvested from rooftops and other large surfaces and is brought by
gutters to a water reservoir. Rainwater is mainly a temporal and complementary way of
collecting water. Whether it is in an area where it rains a lot or where it is dry and any
means of collecting water is used, the method requires large storage volumes to be useful
over longer time periods. During long storage periods, the water is easily exposed to
contamination. It may also easily become polluted through the catchment process from
rusty rooftops or animal excretes. Due to the lack of minerals, the water is acidic and
corrosive towards metals (Action contre la faim, 2008).
Surface water is an easily accessible resource to use and can be used in various ways.
However, surface water is vulnerable to pollution and may dry out during the dry season.
Direct river catchments need a screening of debris to hinder the largest particles to enter
the pipeline. A simple way is to build rocks around the pipe which work as a rough filter
as well as physical protection (see Figure 11). The intake should at least be more than 30
cm under the surface to avoid floating particles, such as excrements and organic material
and algae, to enter the pipeline. Nor should the intake be near the bottom due to risk of
sedimented contaminants entering the intake. (Arnalich, 2020) Furthermore, the intake
can be equipped with bar screens or racks with 15-25 mm gaps to filter out sediments. To
reduce further contamination of the water the direct river intake should be placed
upstream of all other activities, such as agricultures, industries and storm water outlets
(Action contre la faim, 2008).

Figure 11, direct river intake with rough screening filter (Arnalich, 2020)

29
To ensure sufficient flow from direct river intakes small dams can be built to increase the
water depth. A dam also creates an area of the water at rest, allowing particles to sediment
if it is large enough (see section 2.3.3.1). Dams should be carefully designed, as erosion
can easily cause the dam to collapse; moreover, the dam should not flood the area when
it is full. Figure 12 illustrates an example of a partially closed river dam. The walls and
sides must be reinforced with stones and masonry as not to let them erode. The design of
dams varies and depends largely on the specific area it is built on; preferably, it should be
built on bedrock in narrow stretches where there is a significant change in the elevation
(Arnalich, 2020).

Figure 12, partially closed dam, top view (Arnalich, 2020)
Indirect river catchments are the intake of choice from surface water sources due to them
greatly reducing the need for subsequent treatment. Figure 13 illustrates the principle of
the method. In a similar way as slow sand filters treat the water, the catchment pipe is
buried at least one meter in layers of sand with a progressive reducing diameter starting
from 10 mm gravel around the pipe, which significantly reduces the bacteriological
contamination from the surface water. In gravitationally fed systems, the underlying pipe
can be placed in parallel with the stream flow to increase the catchment area and supply
(Arnalich, 2020).

Figure 13, indirect river catchment, side view (Arnalich, 2020)

30
Water within three meters of the surface is considered surface water, below three meters
is groundwater. Groundwater usually has the best quality but may be the most expensive
option to utilize. It tends to have low bacteriological contamination due to the natural
cleaning occurring through the flow through the ground. However, there may be a higher
concentration of minerals in the water depending on the soil, which must be analyzed
(Action contre la faim, 2008).
Spring catchments in slopes work as great intakes for gravity-fed systems. The flow is
generally more reliable and stable throughout the seasons than surface water sources. The
spring catchment intakes are very simple and do not require advances materials to
construct, as shown in Figure 14. The water source is protected from probable
contamination with an impermeable layer of clay before the intake; additionally, the area
can be fenced off to stop animals from entering the collection zone. The underground
water flow is collected with a concrete wall and a collection bowl which is pressurized
by the slope. If possible, a header tank can be combined with the intake (Arnalich, 2020).

Figure 14, spring catchment (Arnalich, 2020)
Artesian springs are natural wells containing groundwater where two impermeable layers
of soil or rock have an opening in between, and the hydrostatic pressure of the
underground river is positive in the opening. Artesian springs are very easy to utilize; a
concrete box with a lid on can be built directly on top of the spring where the walls are
sealed with the lowest impermeable layer, and the bottom is covered with gravel for the
water to flow through. Usually pumping power is required if artesian springs are utilized
in a larger distribution system (USGS, 2021).
Wells and boreholes can be dug where there are known deeper groundwater sources,
ranging for wells 3-30 meters deep for wells, respectively for boreholes up to 60 meters
deep. The construction for wells and boreholes can be expensive, especially boreholes,

31
since drilling equipment is needed. The area around the intakes needs to be protected with
impermeable layers as not to let contaminations soak through the soil. Both methods
require pumping power to extract the water (Action contre la faim, 2008).
A summary of the different catchment methods is provided in Table 15.

Some catchments require pumping power to extract the water. If they are integrated into
the distribution system, an electric pump is needed. The rough size of the pump is
determined by calculating equation 11 (Engineering ToolBox, 2021):

𝑃ℎ =

𝑞∙𝑝
3.6 ∙ 106

(11)

where 𝑃ℎ is the hydraulic power (kW), 𝑞 is the required demand flow (m3 /h) and 𝑝 is the
pressure (Pa). To determine a more accurate and dynamic use of the pump the pump
pressure curve and pipe curve should be considered, as well as the pipelines infrastructure,
if there is a tank downstream that the pump need to smoothen out during peak demands.

32
2.4.2 Header tank
The header tank is placed at the beginning of the pipeline and works as a buffer to the
flow variations from the water source to stabilize the flow. Since the header tank is the
first tank in the network after the intake, it also determines the static and dynamic
piezometric lines for the rest of the line. It can also work as a primary treatment for the
water and be dimensioned as a sedimentation basin. If further treatment is needed, the
header tank should be combined with an SSF. See section 2.3.3.1 for dimensioning the
header tank as a sedimentation tank and section 2.3.3.2 for dimensioning an SSF.
2.4.3 Brake pressure tank
A brake pressure tank (BPT) can be installed if the pressure in the network between the
source or storage tank and the outlet exceeds 30 meters. The BPT reduces the pressure in
the lines to atmospheric pressure. BPTs are more commonly used in developing regions
as substitutes for pressure-reducing valves due to their simplicity and availability. There
is no minimum size for a BPT, but generally, a volume of 1 − 2 m3 allows for less abrupt
flow and, therefore, longer life expectancy of the float valve (Arnalich, 2020).

Figure 15, brake pressure tank illustration (Arnalich, 2020)

33
2.4.4 Storage tank
A storage tank is not necessarily needed if the maximum flow demand is smaller than the
inflow from the water source. However, if a storage tank is needed, it needs to be carefully
designed. A storage tank should preferably be located on a hill near the largest
concentration of outlets and demands.
A rough estimation of the required storage tank size can be calculated by the difference
of the largest consecutive inflow during a selected period and the maximum outflow
during the same time period, e.g., during a day. Preferably, the time period should also
consider different seasons, if possible. The larger the timeframe, the better the estimation;
however, a broader timeframe requires more data and research of the local area’s water
behavior to estimate the pattern (see section 2.2.1Demand pattern) (Arnalich, 2020).
An example of a dimension calculation is presented below. The water tank is fed with a
constant supply of water, 1900 l/h. A base demand of 0.5 l/s is multiplied according to
the pattern in Figure 4. The balance column calculates the difference for each hour by
subtracting the demand from the supply. The water stock is the sum of its previous value
added with the current balance value. The necessary water stock is the minimum volume
of water per hour in the tank, i.e., the water stock added with its minimum value (Action
contre la faim, 2008).

Since the supply is larger than the demand, there will be an overflow in the tank during
the selected time period. Therefore, to preserve some of the overflows the daily supply
(𝑉𝑡𝑜𝑡.𝑠𝑢𝑝 ) is subtracted from the average daily demand (𝑉𝑡𝑜𝑡.𝑑𝑒𝑚 ) to obtain the extra
volume (𝑉𝑆𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙 ) needed to hinder a daily overflow, as equation 13 (Action contre la faim,
2008).
𝑉𝑆𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙 = 𝑉𝑆𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛 + (𝑉𝑡𝑜𝑡.𝑠𝑢𝑝 − 𝑉𝑡𝑜𝑡.𝑑𝑒𝑚 )

(13)

𝑉𝑆𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙 = 5.7 𝑚3 + (4.56 𝑚3 − 4.32 𝑚3 ) = 8.1 𝑚3
This method of dimensioning works if the water supply and consumption are relatively
the same. If the supply is lower than the demand, then an additional intake or an intake
with a larger capacity is needed. Alternatively, if the difference in demand and supply is
huge, then a more extended time period of the demand and supply pattern must be
selected.

36
2.4.5 Pipes
To determine the diameter (𝑑) size of the pipe the topographic profile is analyzed (see
section 2.1) . The hydraulic gradient line needs to be above the one bar limit at all times.
A larger pipe diameter lowers the liquid’s velocity (𝑣); respectively, a smaller diameter
increases the velocity and therefore increases the resistance. The design flow (𝑄) is based
on the worst-case scenario demand when dimensioning the pipe diameter, as equation 14.
𝑄=

𝑣
(14)

𝑑 2
𝜋 ∙ (2)

Decreasing the diameter increases the headloss and conversely, increasing the diameter
decreases the headloss according to the Hazen-Williams formula (see section 2.1.3). If
the headloss is larger than the elevation difference of the pipes’ end points, the dynamic
pressure will be insufficient to transport water to the end point (see Figure 2). For
economic reasons, it strives to find the smallest possible diameter for the pipe without
breaking the hydrostatic rules; however, smaller than 63mm for network applications is
not recommended (Arnalich, 2020).
The maximum pressure in the network is the highest static pressure (see section 2.1.1)
that is found in the pipeline, whereafter suitable pipe material and pipe tolerance are
chosen.

The choice of the pipe route can be roughly estimated from maps and satellite images;
however, the definitive route must be determined on-site with a local who knows the area
well and takes into account the following aspects (WHO, 2017):
-

Minimize crossings, such as rivers and roads

-

Avoid rocky zones, as it is easier for trench digging

-

Prioritize accessible zones, e.g., avoid steep slopes, follow existing paths such as
roads to ease construction

-

Land ownership and authorization

Furthermore, the design of the layout and connections can be varied. Branch topologies
are most common in gravity-fed systems; however, if one branch breaks, it compromises
the whole distribution to the rest of the network. Another drawback is stagnation of the
water, which can be a problem if the water is not constantly used in branched networks.
Loop networks are more reliable, since water is distributed through several pipes to the
nodes, but this method requires more pipes and is therefore also more expensive. The
water circulates more in loop networks reducing the stagnation of the water. In a
gravitationally fed system, the loop network would need additional pipes to work
properly, as shown in Figure 17. Therefore, whether the advantages for a loop-topology
in a gravitationally fed network are more beneficial than the cost to build it must be
individually analyzed for each case (Sampers, 2005).

Figure 17, pipeline topology designs

38
2.4.6 Outlets
For practical purposes, the pressure in the outlets of the pipe should be between 1 bar and
3 bar. Less than 1 bar is insufficient to distribute the water, and more than 3 bar can cause
problems with opening the outlet valves; thus, when filling the buckets, large amounts of
water will splash and go to waste.
It is recommended to have at least one outlet within 250 meters or 4-30 minutes walking
distance. Less than a four-minute walking distance might cause overuse by the closest
households and, therefore, inequalities between locals. More than 30 minutes of walking
distance will defeat the purpose of an easily accessible piped water network. Locals will
find other solutions to provide water to themselves, especially if the network is designed
to provide more than 50 liters per capita per day.
It is essential for the system to be equally accessible for all users, or else illegal
connections to private households may be constructed, which can disrupt the flow to the
rest of the users. Satellite images can be used to locate the households if no other data is
available (Arnalich, 2020).

3 The water supply situation in Ward 10
3.1 Problem description of the water supply system in Ward 10
According to the 2017 survey, 88% of the inhabitants on Ward 10 have complained that
the water access is insufficient, whereas only 26% have access to water from the existing
pipeline network, and the rest use wells or other means of collecting water. The average
distance from a drinking source is 739 m, ranging from 3 m to 10 km. (Awais, et al., 2017)
The current public water system was built in 2003 by Plan International in cooperation
with ZINWA. The primary water source of the existing public system is the Mupenga
River 1196m above sea level, which is relatively small and very dependent on the year’s
season. During the dry season in the spring and autumn, the water flows partially
underground, and the surface water is very shallow. During the rainy season in the winter
(Dec-March), the water flows are strong (Awais, et al., 2017).
By analyzing the existing system, a few fundamental technical problems have been found.
It does not cover the whole area of Ward 10, nor is the single intake from the Mupenga
River sufficient to meet the demand of the area that it covers. The measured flow of the
Mupenga River in the dry season is 0.91 l/s, whereas the base demand that the area the
network covers is 1.27 l/s for 80 liters per capita per day. Furthermore, the current water
treatment system in Ward 10 lacks numerous aspects of treatment. It mainly relies on the
consumer to treat the water by boiling it or using clay filters to remove pathogens from
the water. Boiling the water can take from 30 minutes up to 60 minutes, and only 8% of
the inhabitants treat their drinking water. Due to lack of knowledge and education, about
90% of the inhabitants drink the water raw without treating it, even if the water has been
polluted by derelict tanks with collapsed asbestos roofs (Chikuhwa, 2021), (Awais, et al.,
2017).

40
Currently, the only treatment in the water supply system in Ward 10 consists of an underdimensioned physical filter and an insufficient natural sedimentation basin. The water
source used in the system is the Mupenga River, a stream draining the rainwater from the
mountain ranges. Before the intake of the water distribution system is a natural
sedimentation basin. However, the sedimentation basin is too small to work as intended,
so excess sediments and mud must be manually removed three times a week during the
rainy season and once a week during the dry season, which causes troubles to the water
system and maintenance. At the sedimentation basin are two intakes to the pipeline
distribution system, a 90 mm pipe and a 110 mm pipe. Each has a physical filter that is
poorly constructed; due to too large holes in the filter, numerous smaller objects can easily
enter the pipelines. After 1.3 km from the intake are two pressure breaker tanks for the
respective pipelines, which helps the sedimentation for some of the remaining suspended
substances (Awais, et al., 2017).

Figure 19, Raw water source at Mupenga River (Awais, et al., 2017)
No in-depth water quality analysis has been made in Ward 10 other than a basic analysis
presented in Table 18; it should be noted that no biological nor radiological contaminants
have been checked during the analysis. Four samples from four different locations were
taken and analyzed in 2017, one from a groundwater source, one from a borehole, one
from a clinic’s water tank, and one from the Turumhu River. The samples results are
compared to the WHO standards for potable water, and it can be noted that most of the
samples are well within the range of the WHO threshold value, except the fluoride levels.

The high levels of fluoride may be due to the type of soil in the area the water absorbs.
Using surface water as a water source to the system may decrease the fluoride levels in
the drinking water; however, surface water is more exposed to bacteriological
contamination. According to the World Health Organization, chemical standards can be
seen as a secondary concern compared to bacterial contamination (WHO, 2017). The
water in the area has been drunk for generations, and no excessive dental problems have
been noted due to the high fluoride levels (Mukome, 2021).
Due to the placement of the water intake and lack of nearby households and factories, it
is assumed that only physical particulates and natural biological pathogens of various
kinds are present in the open water source. No illnesses caused by heavy metals or
radiations have been noticed. However, collapsed water tanks that are made of hazardous
materials such as asbestos may pollute the distribution lines. In order to clear this issue,
whether this is drinkable water, further testing needs to be done.

42
Some years after the construction of the pipeline system, it had a transfer of responsibility
of the management and maintenance due to problems with the water bill payments, and
the responsibility shifted from ZINWA to the local Samaringa community committee.
After that, the water supply has been free of charge, and maintenance has been carried
out by volunteers, whereafter it has been reported that it is leaking and water tanks are
deteriorating; however, further data are lacking concerning what exact condition the
pipeline is currently in.
Due to lack of water availability from the public pipeline system and mismanagement,
the inhabitants of Ward 10 have begun to make their own rudimentary dams with
sandbags in nearby streams and collect water with a pipeline system of their own, as can
be seen in Figure 20-22. These systems are disorganized and haphazardous, which makes
the management of the water resources and availability more challenging, thus draining
the rivers more than needed. Some private pipelines are not maintained and may be left
to pollute the environment after serving their use (Chikuhwa, 2021).

3.2 Mapping of the existing network and Ward 10
Through interviews with locals, a digitalized representation of the existing public pipeline
was drawn in 2017; however, the illustration (Figure 23) is not to scale nor georeferenced.

Figure 23, digitalized version of the existing pipeline by Krysztof Dzialo and Leon
Haupt (Awais, et al., 2017)
An attempt to draw the existing network in scale with georeferences was made on QGIS
to analyze the network’s functionalities. Some points have been confirmed and identified
on the map from interviews with a local, Jacob Chikuhwa. A few tanks, such as the
Samaringa tanks and the Honde clinic tank, have had coordinates set in the 2017 survey.
The elevation points found in the digitalized picture have matched the interpreted map’s
elevation (see Figure 24).
The main pipes of line 2, line 4, and the old line have been assumed to follow certain
infrastructures such as roads. Line 3 has been assumed to follow an elevation line around
Hwahwazira mountain. Most of the outlets have been assumed to lead to clusters of
households found from the satellite view.
The village borders had to be defined to locate the households and their respective water
demand. The borders have been determined from an interview with Jacob Chikuhwa in
2021. To broadly confirm the village borders, each household has been located from the
satellite view (Google, 2018), whereafter, the number of households found on the map
has roughly matched the number of households per village provided by ZINWA.

The lack of additional concrete geo-points on the pipeline system and village borders
makes this not an entirely reliable, only indicative, map. Also, the elevation data used is
a 30-meter LIDAR map (RCMRD, 2018) which has interpolated the in-between elevation
values. To make a more precise system analysis, a more detailed survey needs to be done
using on-site measurements regarding the height differences between the nodes and tanks
and their exact location.

borders, map drawn on QGIS

47

3.3 Water resources in the area
In general, heavy rainfall produces high runoff and good groundwater recharge, especially
in mountainous regions with low population densities (Tebbutt, 2002) and, therefore, the
rivers and tributaries in Ward 10 could provide a sufficient supply. A rainfall-runoff
simulation has been made in QGIS to find the largest rivers and tributaries, which could
potentially be used as a water source to the distribution system in Ward 10.
The simulation provides the size of the catchment area, which gives indicative
measurements for the capacity of each river and its intake. In essence, the further down
the stream an intake is placed, the larger the catchment area is, and the more reliable the
river is to provide water to the system. However, the supply capacity must be balanced
with the elevation of the intake for it to have sufficient pressure to the gravitationally fed
distribution network.

Figure 25, 3D-view of the rainfall catchment areas in Ward 10, QGIS simulation
The simulation only considers the topology of the area and calculates the catchment area
and runoff to each tributary; therefore, it is only indicative since the permeability of the
soil and soil type has not been taken into account in the simulation. Also, only a resolution
of 30 meters elevation LIDAR map is used, which has interpolated the elevation values
between the registered elevation points. The simulation results show the location of the
tributaries, which has thereafter been confirmed by matching with the satellite pictures
and identified through interviews with Chikuhwa.

48
Figure 26 depicts a detailed map of the rivers and tributaries’ catchment areas. The red
line divides the catchment area of Honde and Mupenga rivers, whereas the respective
smaller tributaries consequently flow to these two larger rivers. The more black arrows
that are pointed to a river, the stronger the rainfall-runoff is for the respective river. As
can be noted, the larger the area these black arrows cover, the larger the flow of the river
is.

Figure 26, detailed representation of the rainfall-runoff simulation on QGIS of Ward 10
The largest tributaries and rivers identified from the simulation have been measured with
a simple on-site method to find their average flow. By measuring the width (𝑤) and depth
(𝑑) of the river and timing (𝑡) how long it takes for a floating object to travel a certain
distance (𝑙), the results of the flow (𝑉̇ ) for each river have been acquired, as seen in Table
20. Each measurement has been done at three different locations of the respective river,
whereafter an average result of the three measurements has been calculated. The
measurements were done during the dry season in June 2021 by Jacob Chikuhwa.

Groundwater sources are usually preferred as intakes over surface water sources since the
water quality is generally better in groundwater sources, especially regarding
bacteriological contamination. A groundwater simulation has been done in the area to
locate potential boreholes and spring catchments where the recharge rate is sufficient.
However, the data for this simulation have been limited, and further analyzes are required
to confirm the actual potential use of these wells. In Figure 27 and Table 21, one to three
boreholes per village cluster have been located from the simulation, which could
potentially be used as additional intakes to the distribution system (Thomas, 2021).

Locals already use two of the identified potential wells in the groundwater simulation: the
Patsime water hole in village cluster 2, which is an artesian spring (see Figure 28) and the
Samaringa borehole, which provides large quantities of water to the Samaringa village.

4 Water supply proposition to Ward 10
The locals do not rely on the current public pipeline. Therefore, they have built their own
disorganized haphazardous systems to supply their respective needs for irrigation to
support their livelihood and drinking. The proposition is to build a new reliable pipeline
system to meet the water demand throughout Ward 10 with a public gravitationally fed
distribution regulated and maintained under trained personnel.
The three fundamental technical flaws of the old networks are, firstly, that the Mupenga
River’s supply (0.91 l/s) is not sufficient to cover the area that the pipeline network covers
(average base demand 1.27 l/s) and, secondly, that the pipeline does not cover all of Ward
10, only some villages. Therefore, additional intakes to the existing network are needed,
and an expansion of the pipeline system with more intakes to the remaining villages is
needed. Thirdly, the old pipeline system and the self-built haphazardous systems do not
have any functioning treatment and distribute raw water to the outlets, leaving the
treatment responsibility to the user.
The layout of the old network is fairly well planned out, as can be seen in Figure 31,
where its outlets cover most of the inhabited area it is designed to cover. However, due
to its unknown condition, it may need to be rebuilt or at least repaired. Therefore, the new
proposition has only two proposed changes to the existing pipeline system: Firstly, an
additional intake from Patsime water hole supplies water to Ngwende and Mutetwa with
a pump to a storage tank on the nearby hill, whereafter it is gravitationally distributed to
cluster 3. Secondly, to ensure sufficient water supply to Cluster 2, the Samaringa borehole
is proposed to be connected to the system via line 2B. Therefore, the water supply from
Mupenga River is sufficient when distributing water only to Manyonho village via line 3
and cluster 2 via line 2 with the complementary borehole intake at Samaringa. Line 5 to
9 are the new proposed distribution lines covering the rest of village clusters 1 and cluster
4. Due to the area's topography, the proposed networks are not connected to each other
but separate systems. Line 5 to line 7 supply most of village cluster 1, and line 8 and line
9 supply water to Nyabadza and Mutsamba. A more detailed description of each line is
presented in Table 22, and the lines are depicted in Figure 29.

Line 5 Supplies water to Matingo village from Mwauru river. The
line follows a road which is in parallel with the river, wherafter it
crosses the Mwauru river and supplies water to a storage tank near
the center of Matingo village. The line continues along a road and
crosses Nyamaware river and Makute river until its end point in the
Saruwaka Gowa storage tank.

LINE 5.4

Branch line 5.4 continues down the parallel road with Mwauru and
supplies water to the inhabitants between Mwauru and Mupenga
river.

LINE 6A

Line 6A shares its intake supply with Line 5 from Mwauru river. It
crosses two rivers and distributes water to the western part of
Nyakabinga and Chipunha. At the villages borders it follows a road
that leads to Line 6.

LINE 6A1

Line 6A1 is a branch from Line 6A which distributes water to the
households east of Mwauru.

LINE 6B

Line 6B receives water from Makute river, however if the supply is
insufficient it can have an additional supply from Line 7B. The line
distributes water to the eastern part of Nyakabinga and Chipunha
following a road until it connects to Line 6.

LINE 6

Line 6 combines Line 6A and Line 6B. It follows a road and
provides water to a storage tank on a hill which subsequently
connects to line 5 and supplies water to Matingo.

LINE 7

Line 7 supplies water to Saruwaka- Gowa village from Chiruzvi
river. It follows an elevation curve from Mutsago mountain and

54
continues along Nyamaponjo mountain to the end of the Saruwaka
Gowa village.
LINE 7A

Line 7A follows the road beside Chiruzvi river in order to make
construction easier. Line 7A supplies water to the inhabitants west of
Chiruzvi in Saruwaka-Gowa.

LINE 7B

Line 7B follows an elevation curve from the Chiruzvi intake to
supply additional water to Line 6B. Along its way are some outlets
to the nearby inhabitants in Saruwaka Gowa.

LINE 8

Line 8 supplies water to Nyabadza from Butukare river. The storage
tank in the village center may need pumping power to fill since
Butukare river is at such a low elevation. The line follows the road
throughout the village.

LINE 9

Line 9 provides water to Mutsamba from Nyamarungu river. The
line follows the road west om Nyamarungu at a set elevation.

LINE 9.1

Line 9.1 is the link between Mutsamba village and Nyabadza and
supplies additional water to the intermediate households before it
connects to Line 8 via a storage tank.

A simplified overview of the respective lines’ components is illustrated in Figure 30. The
demand of the outlets and supply of the intakes for the respective line decide the
dimensions and design flows for their respective components.

4.1 Demand specifications
The overview map in Figure 31 shows the proposed outlets positions of the whole pipeline
system, where the outlets are located in the middle of each green circle. The green circles
have a radius of 250 meters which is the maximum distance between a household and an
outlet. The pipeline system’s design aims to cover as large of an area as possible without
breaking hydraulic rules, which is also how the number of outlets has been determined in
Table 23.

Figure 31, Pipelines distribution area and outlets locations
The base demand is estimated from a 30-year perspective with a 1.48% population growth
(The World Bank, 2021) for 80 liters of water per inhabitant per day. The worst-case
scenario multiplies the base demand with a general factor of 4.2 to compensate for
seasonal patterns and other unpredicted changes in the demand.

ZINWA provided the water irrigation storage demand for Ward 10, which is in total
471600 m3 storage required per irrigation cycle, when 50 irrigation cycles for a period of
six months average one irrigation cycle every 72h. Therefore, the average water supply
needed for irrigation purposes to Ward 10 is 1.82 l/s. When divided by the predicted
inhabitants, 5645, equals 28 liters per capita per day, whereas the remaining 52 liters per
capita per day is for domestic use. Therefore, the 80 liters per capita per day demand is
sufficient and applies the WHO standards according to Figure 3 where 50 liters per capita
per day of potable water is provided for domestic use and 30 liters per capita per day for
irrigation.
No deeper analysis has been done regarding the demand and supply patterns in Ward 10.
Therefore, the generic theoretical patterns, presented in section 2.2.1, are used as demand
patterns, and constant values from the dry season are used for the supply pattern. This
assumption may affect the dimensions of the system, especially the water tanks in section
4.4.

57

4.2 Catchments
Spring catchments are typically used for gravity-fed systems due to their consistent flow
and good water quality. However, additional surveys of the groundwater flow need to be
done to find more possible groundwater sources and spring catchments in Ward 10.
Therefore, due to the provided data, surface water sources have been used as intakes to
the proposed system; thus, water treatment is recommended.
The proposed potential intakes to the system have had their supply capacity data measured
during the dry season (see Table 24). Since the supply must be larger than the demand
and the river flow data are measured once during the dry season when the flow is at its
yearly minimum, multiple intakes are proposed to meet the supply and demand criteria.
Fewer intakes could be used, and water could be stored throughout the dry season in larger
storage tanks if more thorough surveys on the rivers’ seasonal variations are done.
Another restricting criterion to the number of intakes to the system is the area’s
topography. It is sought to provide the water gravitationally to the network, limiting the
layout of the network and placement of the intakes, except for two wells, Patsime water
hole, and Samaringa borehole, which require pumping power to be connected to the
network.
The exact location (see Figure 29) and capacity of each proposed intake needs to be
further analyzed. If the supply from a river is insufficient at the proposed location, it can
potentially be sufficient further down the river as the rainfalls catchment area increases
further down the river, as seen in the simulation in section 3.3. However, the intake’s
supply and elevation need to be balanced for the gravity-fed network to function.
It is recommended to build the intakes from the rivers with indirect catchments, which
would provide a better and safer quality of water to the distribution system, as stated in
section 2.4.1.

Mupenga River supplies water to Cluster 2, Manyonho, and Matingo west. Due to the
insufficient supply, cluster 2 can use the Samaringa borehole as an additional intake to
line 2 via tank L2BSamST. The remaining needed supply has a base demand of 0.394 l/s,
with a worst-case scenario multiplier 4.2 which gives 1.65 l/s. The estimated depth of the
borehole is 30 meters. Required pumping power for the base demand is 0.12 kW,
respectively 0.5 kW for a worst-case scenario demand. It is calculated with equation 11,
from section 2.4.1.
Cluster 3 is mainly supplied from the Patsime water hole, which has a base demand of
0.74 l/s; worst-case scenario 3.1 l/s. The water needs to be pumped from the water well
to the storage tank (OPL4NgwST), which has an elevation difference of 23 meters from
the well to the hill, added with the storage tank’s water levels, gives an estimated elevation
difference of 30 meters. To meet the required base demand 0.2 kW pumping power is
needed, whereas the maximum pumping power required is 0.9 kW.
Pump curves and pipe curves should be estimated for the pumps’ dynamic regulation and
steering.

59

4.3 Pipe specifications
The topographical profile and pressure profiles of the line sections between the tanks of
each line are illustrated in the profile plots in Appendix B. Their locations are depicted in
Figure 29.
The design flow is the sum of the worst-case scenario demand for every outlet the
respective pipe covers.
Maximum pressure is the highest static pressure found in the pipeline (see 9.2 Appendix
B, Pressure profiles and pressures in pipelines), whereafter a suitable standardized NP
pipe is chosen. However, the pressure values in the simulation assume the tank's water
level to equal the surface level, which in practice means that the tanks are empty, which
therefore assumes a lower pressure in the system than the actual.
The pipe lengths have been determined from the QGIS map.
The pipe diameter is chosen by the design flow and the elevation difference between the
end points for the respective line. The Hazen-Williams head losses have been subtracted
from the elevation difference, whereafter a suitable diameter has been chosen, but not
smaller than 63mm. The diameters have then been implemented to the simulation in
MIKE+ to confirm the functionality of the hydraulic behavior in the system.

4.4 Water tank specifications
The respective water tank’s location is depicted in Figure 29.
The header tanks’ sizes are dimensioned according to the sedimentation tanks calculation
theories in section 2.3.3.1. Fine silt particles (𝑑 = 16 µm, 𝑉𝑠 = 0.0018 m/s) are assumed
to settle with an HRT of 28 minutes.
The storage tanks’ dimensions are based on the sum of the maximum inflow and
maximum outflow of the largest variation for the selected time frame. The pattern used
for the minimum daily domestic variation is the same as in Figure 4. The pattern used in
the theoretical variation with two irrigation cycles is the same as Figure 5, which is a time
frame of six days.
BPT: s are all two cubic meters according to the theory in section 2.4.3.
Most of the tanks are quite small, hence could the local plastic tanks be suitable for some
as the ones in Figure 32. Larger tanks (>15 m3 ), BPT: s, and HT: s can be constructed
with concrete or bricks, which would require further construction costs; however, the
rough cost estimate for the larger tanks has interpolated the price value as to be similar to
the plastic tanks. The costs are based on the sizes from Table 28.

The obtained values in Table 28 of the water tanks’ variation of volumes must still be
analyzed, since the demand patterns used are theoretical, and the weekly and seasonal
variations have not been taken into account due to lack of data. In addition to the
theoretical demand pattern, a seasonal supply pattern is needed to determine the need for
storage throughout the seasons. The water supply used in this calculation is constant from
the dry season (see Table 20).
For the short-term variation demands, suitable sized tanks for the potable water system
can be found locally, as shown in Figure 32.

Figure 32, Water tanks from a local producer (Awais, et al., 2017)

65

4.5 Water treatment specifications
The distribution network is dimensioned for 80 liters per capita per day, which combines
domestic water use and irrigation demand into one network. Therefore, whether a
centralized treatment for both water qualities with the determined design flow is
economically beneficial needs to be surveyed. Alternatively, two parallel systems can be
built for the respective water quality, but it doubles the material cost.
However, water treatment is recommended for domestic water use due to the intakes
being mainly from surface water. The proposed treatment setup is highly dependent on
the raw water quality analysis; due to the lack of water quality analyses from the area, the
proposed water treatment included all steps necessary in case of bad water source quality.
The treatment methods may also vary between the intakes due to different local water
qualities.
4.5.1 Analysis
Before selecting the intakes’ locations, the quality should be surveyed. Field method
analyses such as EC, turbidity, pH, and biological contaminations can easily be tested for
each intake if the equipment is procured, whereafter ZIMLABS in Harare have stock
analyses for 60$ per sample, which test the presence of chemicals (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Mn,
Cu, Zn, Fe, Cl, SO4, NO3), pH, EC, TDS, TH, Ecoli and TVC. Additionally, samples
should be taken during different seasons, especially regarding the turbidity of the water,
which can vary strongly between seasons.
Continuous analysis is needed for the distribution system to ensure good quality and
measure chlorine residuals to find suitable amounts of disinfections needed for the
system.
4.5.2 Primary step
The catchment from the rivers can be constructed in different ways, the easiest of which
is a dam with an inlet with a physical filter with 25mm holes in it. A preferable method
is an indirect collection of the river water, as illustrated in Figure 13. This method would
not necessarily require a sedimentation tank and possibly not a sand filter either,
depending on the quality.
From videos and pictures, the water sources in Ward 10 seem to have low turbidity;
however, it is not taken for granted. If the turbidity of the raw water is >10 NTU, then
pre-treatment is recommended before the secondary filtration step not to clog the sand
filters. A sedimentation basin is relatively cheap and straightforward to build. In the

66
proposed system, the header tanks are designed to work as sedimentation tanks, since the
header tanks are always the first tanks before any outlet in the system. The dimensions
calculated in Table 29 have an HRT of 28 minutes for fine silt particles with a 0.0018 mm
diameter to settle.

4.5.3 Secondary step
A slow sand filter can be combined with the header tank in the system to effectively treat
the water before entering the distribution system. A slow sand filter can work as a single
treatment step without pre sedimentation if the raw quality water is good, i.e.,>10 NTU
and low concentration of chemicals. The dimensions for slow sand filters depend on the
design flow for the respective line divided with 0.3 m3/h per square meter. The total
needed filter size for the maximum design flow is shown in Table 30; however, the
required size can be divided into several smaller parallel filters, enabling easier
maintenance while keeping a continuous flow in the system.
The construction costs for SSF: s can be estimated to $100-$300/m2 (sswm, 2021).

The total cost for installing SSFs to the required square meters is $20,520.
The Samaringa borehole and Patsime waterhole intakes may not necessarily need an SSF
due to their natural groundwater quality. The necessity depends on the water quality
analyses, although the EC analyses conducted in 2017 from the Samaringa borehole and
Patsime water hole have a relatively high conductivity which might indicate high
turbidity.

4.5.4 Tertiary step
Chlorination is largely dependent on the water quality in the system. Without further
water analyses, an estimation of the amount needed for respective tank can be calculated
from Table 31. The chlorine residuals should be between 0.1 and 0.3 mg/l in the system,
unless shock chlorination is needed, which leaves 50 mg/l chlorine residuals. The chlorine
should sit in the system for 12-24 hours. Two different concentrations of disinfection are
reviewed, liquid bleach and powdered calcium hypochlorite (Clean Water Systems,
2017).

The additional chlorine residual concentration 1 mg/l can compensate for the pipelines to
make the final chlorine residual concentration 0.1-0.3 mg/l. Header tanks should not be
chlorinated if they are combined with SSFs, however, in Table 32 they are included to
assume the full water volume in the system to approximate the amount of disinfectant
needed.

4.6 Financial aspect
The financial analyses present the concrete material costs for the proposed system and its
estimated construction costs. Due to the proposal having several separate networks in
different villages, these can be evaluated separately if other means of water supply are
more suitable for the respective villages. Furthermore, it is assumed that the old network
needs complete refurbishment. Hence, all the necessary equipment for the old system is
included in the cost calculation. The prices for the respective components have been
reviewed in chapter 4, except the valves and accessories which is an estimate.

The estimated cost for the total project is about $240 000, maintenance and operation
costs not included. The estimation has an accuracy of 50% and can, therefore, differentiate
largely from the final costs.
Donors can partially pay the initial costs, however, when the system is built, it needs a
sustainable payment system to pay for maintenance and operation costs, which is
dependent on the inhabitants of Ward 10 if they are willing to pay for their water or if
they find other means to collect water better. A continuous payment system by the users
needs to be developed. Therefore, further surveys are required regarding the economical
aspect, how to pay for the initial costs and maintain a sustainable system operation.

72

4.7 Management
Previously, the management and maintenance of the water system has been entirely done
through volunteer work. A continuous payment fee would support a more sustainable
management. The water committee should cooperate with local and national
governments, state-owned utilities, possibly NGOs and donor agencies to start the project.
(WHO, 2017) The system is designed to use locally available technologies that can be
repaired and maintained by locals. A water committee with organized responsibilities will
work more efficiently. A proposed set of responsibilities was set in the report in 2017
(Awais, et al., 2017):
-

Coordination with the authorities and other departments

-

Routine maintenance and inspections of the water systems
o Routinized water analyses, especially CDBPs and pathogen analyses
o Routinized cleaning and disinfection

-

Resolving of eventual issues and repairs for users
o Technical skills required

-

Collecting of service fees

-

Reporting of information to users

More detailed management positions are required to operate and maintain the network.

5 Results and discussion
The topography in Ward 10, combined with the rich water sources in the area, allows for
a gravitationally driven water distribution system to be applied in the area. However, due
to the topography of the terrain and nature of gravity-fed systems, one network only
cannot be constructed to supply the whole of Ward 10 but must be divided into several
separate smaller systems. For example, Line 8 and 9 supply water only to Nyabadza and
Mutsamaba and is not being connected to the larger networks due to the large mountains
between the systems. Additionally, lines 5 to 7 supply water to the majority of village
cluster 1. Therefore, each of the systems can be reviewed individually, whether the
population and water demand are large enough for a pipeline network to be constructed
and the inhabitants are willing to pay to use a pipelined distribution system or there are
other means of collecting water more suitable to the smaller villages. The decision must
be made by the end users themselves through surveys, whereas the thesis provides the
technical basis of the pipeline construction.
Before building a new system, the reasons for the old system’s deterioration should be
analyzed; otherwise there is a great risk of a new system sharing the same fate. According
to the 2017 report, the biggest reason for the deterioration was payment failure, which led
to mismanagement and ultimately caused the system’s decay. The management system
needs to be clearly setup and properly organized before the system is built. A continuous
payment system needs to be settled as well to maintain and operate the network when the
system is in place and the donors are out of the picture.
The project’s success criteria are analyzed with a risk analysis (Table 35) and SWOT
analysis (Table 36). The analyses are based on the previous report from 2017 but with a
perspective from a gravitationally fed system rather than a general water supply
harmonization. The risk analysis reviews potential risks and how to prevent or handle
certain risks, were they to occur. The preventive measures reduce the possibility of the
risks, and the containment measures reduce the impact if the potential risk occurs.

5.1 Further necessary technical data
The thesis provides rough dimensions and designs for a distribution network. Due to the
proposal being made remotely, approximations and estimates have been used. Therefore,
on site measurements are still needed, and additional data of the demand and supply are
required to make more precise calculations and dimensions.
The demand and supply patterns are essential to dimensioning the systems components,
especially sizes of the storage tanks. Too large water tanks are expensive to build, and
unused water will stagnate, forming algae and CDBPs requiring unnecessary treatment.
Contrarily, too small tanks will not meet the peak hour demands, and the users will be left
without water. Further surveys need to be conducted of the water uses and habits in Ward
10 as well as analyses of the irrigation cycles to find a matching demand pattern to the
area. Furthermore, education of the water use could be provided, for example, it is
unnecessary to water the crops in the middle of the day. Currently, only a theoretical
demand pattern has been used, which may not correlate with the actual pattern in Ward
10.
Water supply patterns are also needed, especially if surface water sources are used due to
their varying seasonal capacity. Currently, only one measurement of the supply capacity
has been conveyed during the dry season, which compels a minimal constant supply value
to the dimensions. The capacities of the water sources should be measured throughout the
year to measure the flow rates’ difference to find a suitable supply pattern to the respective
source. Due to only one supply measurement being available, multiple inlets are proposed
to meet the supply and demand criterion. If a supply pattern is surveyed in the area over
different seasons, suitable sized tanks can be dimensioned over longer time periods, which
can reduce the number of intakes needed and, therefore, potentially also reducing the
number of treatment facilities and maintenance required. The proposed intakes cannot
guarantee a steady flow or supply, since the location is based on a topographical
simulation only; they should be surveyed on site.
Potential groundwater sources such as spring catchments should also be further analyzed
in the area, since they tend to provide a more reliable flow of water even during droughts.
Also, the groundwater quality is less prone to pollution exposure than surface water. The
water quality from the basic analysis tests seems to prove good quality, but further
laboratory analyses of the water quality need to be analyzed to prove whether chlorination
is treatment enough or whether additional treatment methods are needed.

77
The layout of the pipeline is determined from satellite view and follows certain
infrastructure, and the elevation is determined with a LIDAR map. The demand for public
houses such as schools, health centers, and business centers has not been taken into
consideration. Due to their unknown location an average demand has been assumed. To
confirm the accessibility of the pipeline layout, site-specific demands and pressures of the
proposed system should be surveyed on site, and the layout can therefore change
radically.
The next step in the project phase should be to conduct on site analyses of the water
quality, intakes capacities and locations, pipelines layout, and water demands, as well as
more details should be presented of the practical construction and installation of the
components.

5.2 MIKE+ WD simulation results and discussion
MIKE+ Water Distribution is a commercial simulation program built on the demanddriven EPANET solver engine. The simulation on MIKE+ proved the theoretical
functionality of the proposed system from a hydraulic perspective and, therefore,
confirmed the dimensions of the pipes and capability of the demand flows.
Some issues with the software emerged when building the simulation network that limited
the application to the results of the proposal. Adding storage tanks to the system interrupts
the mass balance of the network. The net inflows of the storage tank, i.e. the inflows
subtracted with the outflows of the tanks, are added to the total outflow of the system.
According to the simulation, the net inflow is more often positive than negative, which
means that more water is entering the tank than exiting, even though the tanks are set not
to overflow. This issue raises the total water supplied to the system, therefore disrupting
the total systems mass balance. However, by inserting strict rules in the simple controls,
the overflow issue can be partially resolved with the following commands:
LINK 1 CLOSED IF NODE 2 ABOVE 20
LINK 1 OPEN IF NODE 2 BELOW 19
where LINK 1 is feeding water to NODE 2 which is a storage tank. These commands
resolve the system’s mass balance problem but add another unrealistic behavior to the
network. With an infinite water reservoir as the supply, the refilling of the tanks happens

78
instantly, which does not seem realistic in a gravity-pressurized system. Furthermore,
when simulating larger networks with longer distribution lines and with multiple storage
tanks, it causes sudden spikes in the total system’s supply which do not correlate with the
respective storage tank’s refilling regarding volume and time step.
To overcome the issues with the solver, storage tanks have not been used in the
simulation. Infinite reservoirs with a dummy node matching the total demand for the
network the respective tank covers have been used as substitutes for storage tanks. The
reservoir and dummy nodes’ elevations are constant and equal to the surface elevation,
which eliminates the dynamic water level which a realistic storage tank would have and,
therefore, also assumes a constant minimal pressure in the succeeding pipelines. Due to
the stiffness of the hard coded demand parameters set to each dummy node, no regulation
or steering of the simulated network has been made. Only the hydraulic rules of the
dimensions of the pipes were confirmed from the simulation results.
An attempt to use a different solver was made, with MIKE+ Collection Systems that
models water drainages, but it was discarded due to lacking substitutes for a distribution
network's components.

79

6 Conclusions
A technical framework of the functionality of a gravity-fed water distribution system was
presented, where the theory of how pressure profiles and demand patterns determine the
sizes and dimensions of the components in the system. Water quality, analyses, and
treatment methods have been reviewed, as well as how they are included in a distribution
system.
The presented theory was applied to Ward 10 Honde Valley, a village surveyed by a
delegation from KTH and UPC in 2017. In the survey, basic data were gathered and
provided by ZINWA, and the problem description of the water supply situation was
evaluated. The main problem has been a deteriorating public distribution system, which
has made villagers construct their own haphazardous water supply systems. The goal is
to provide a technical basis for a public water distribution system that is controllably
managed and maintained by authorities and supplies sufficient water to the inhabitants.
The area has been mapped with QGIS through satellite pictures, LIDAR, and interviews.
Furthermore, the water sources were located by simulating a topographical simulation on
QGIS to measure their sizes and potential uses to the distribution system. With this data
and the data provided by the previous report as a basis, a hydrological simulation on
MIKE+ WD has been done to verify the functionality of a possible distribution system to
the area.
The results prove that, technically, a distribution system could be constructed in Ward 10,
and rough dimensions of the components and costs have been presented. However, some
further data gathering from the area would be beneficial to make a more detailed
estimation of the network and the dimensions of its components. Thus, analyses of the
water quality, intake capacities and locations, pipelines layout, water supply and demand
patterns should be surveyed, and more details of the practical construction and installation
of the components is necessary in successful continuation of the project.
Although, technically, Ward 10 suits a distribution system, many other aspects are vital
to investigate. Is there a willingness to use the system compared to other means of
collecting water that the area already uses, especially in the smaller villages where the
demands are modest can the payment of a public system be too significant for the
individual user? Clear management roles of a continuous operation for the system are
vital for the system not to let it deteriorate, which requires continuous payment systems
once the initial investment is done.

7 Swedish summary – Svensk sammanfattning
Projektförslag för ett gravitationsdrivet vattendistributionssystem till Honde Valley
Ward 10
Detta examensarbete är en del av ett större utvecklingsprogram för Honde Valley Ward
10, Zimbabwe. År 2017 utfördes en exkursion till byn där en delegation bestående av
studenter från KTH och UPC identifierade utvecklingspotential inom flera områden.
Områdena var följande:
-

vattendistribution, sanitet och rening

-

hållbar energitillgång

-

väg och infrastrukturförbättringar

-

jordbruk

-

samhällstjänster

-

ekoturism

Vattendistributionen och reningen prioriterades som första område att utveckla.
Lokalbefolkningen livnär sig på export av jordbruk och därmed har området behov av
distribution av stora mängder vatten. Tillgången till rent och säkert dricksvatten för
hushållsbruk

och

hälsostationer

är

bristfällig

i

och

med

avsaknaden

av

reningsanläggningar och omedvetenheten om riskerna av vattenburna sjukdomar. Enligt
undersökningen från 2017 har 88 % av invånarna i Ward 10 klagat på att vattentillförseln
är otillräcklig, och endast 26 % har åtkomst till det existerande distributionsnätverket.
Resten av invånarna använder sig av brunnar eller andra tillvägagångssätt för att tillförse
sig med vatten.
År 2003 byggdes ett vattendistributionsnätverk i området. Några år efter byggandet av
rörledningssystemet överfördes ansvaret för förvaltning och underhåll från ZINWA till
den lokala Samaringa-gemenskapskommittén, på grund av problem med betalning av
vattenräkningarna. Därefter blev vattenförsörjningen avgiftsfri och underhållet utfördes
av frivilliga. Efter ansvarsöverföringen började nätverket förfalla och förtroendet för den
allmänna vattenförsörjningen sjönk. På grund av detta började lokalbefolkningen bygga
sina egna rudimentära vattenledningssystem för sina egna behov. Dessa egenhändigt
utförda system är oorganiserade och dränerar vattenresurserna mer än nödvändigt samt
blir lämnade i miljön vartefter de börjar läcka och slutar att fungera. Vattenreningen för
de egenhändigt gjorda systemen och det gamla allmänna systemet är obefintlig,
konsumenterna själva ansvarar för att rena sitt dricksvatten.

81
Avhandlingens syfte är att ge en grov teknisk bakgrund för återuppbyggnaden av ett nytt
allmänt vattendistributionssystem med inkluderad vattenrening som skulle kompensera
för de oorganiserade egenhändigt gjorda systemen. För att komma upp till en tillräcklig
kvantitet och kvalitet med tanke på hushållsbehoven och bevattningsvattnen krävs ett
rörledningsdistributionsnätverk som är tillräckligt utbrett, och därtill bör sociologiska
aspekter från lokalbefolkningens synpunkt tas i beaktande för att inte låta ett nytt system
förfalla igen.
Avhandlingen är ett teoretiskt ramverk som anger hur ett gravitationsdrivet
vattendistributionsnätverk i lantbyggsområden i utvecklingsländer kan byggas upp, när
resurserna som används bör vara lokala. I ramverket ingår komponenterna som ett
distributionssystem uppbyggs av samt hur dessa kan dimensioneras grovt. Komponenter
som ingår i ett gravitationsdrivet distributionssystem är vattenupptagningspunkter,
samlingstankar,

lagringstankar,

vattenreningsmetoder som

tryckreduceringstankar,

långsamma sandfilter och

rörledningar

samt

klorering av systemet.

Komponenternas dimensioneringar beror på behoven och tillgångarnas flödesvariation
och kapacitet.
Teorin om distributionsnätverket tillämpas på situationen i Ward 10 och analyseras med
ett

simuleringsprogram,

MIKE+.

Topografiinformationen

som

simuleringens

rörledningsnätverk baserar sig på är från en kartuppbyggnad som är ritad på QGIS utifrån
satellitbilder, LIDAR-kartor och intervjuer med lokala. Med dessa informationskällor har
hushållen och vattenresurserna lokaliserats samt höjdkurvorna och distanserna av
rörledningarna definierats i Ward 10.
Distributionssystemet levererar 80 liter vatten per person per dag vilket enligt WHO:s
standarder inkluderar vattenförbrukning för hushållsbehov samt bevattning för
jordbruksbehov. Invånarantalet har beaktats med en 30 års perspektiv med 1,48 %
befolkningstillväxt, vilket uppskattas till 5645 invånare. Det totala vattenbehovet har
multiplicerats med ett dagligt variationsmönster för att beakta flödesförändringarna i
systemet. Dessutom har generella tilläggskonstanter till flödet multiplicerats med
grundbehovet för att kompensera för olika säsongsvariationer och övriga oförutsedda
förbrukningar för att få det maximala designflödet i rörledningarna.
För att hitta tillräckliga vattenkällor för behoven har en topografisk simulering av
regnvattenavledningen i området gjorts och kompletterats med resultat från en tidigare
utförd grundvattenssimulering för att mäta vattenkällornas kapaciteter. Intagen till
systemen har valts utifrån simuleringens resultat, varefter lokala mätningar har gjorts

82
under torrperioden för att få konkreta flödesmätningar av bifloderna. De slutliga
positionerna för intagen bör bestämmas på plats, där en tillräcklig höjdnivå för systemets
tryck balanseras med tillräcklig kapacitet i vattenkällan oberoende årstid.
Eftersom dimensioneringarna på vattentankarna baserar sig på flödesvariationerna som
har antagit teoretiska värden under ett dygn är dessa dimensioner bara riktgivande. Fler
undersökningar bör göras i området om hur vattentillgångarnas flöden varierar med
årstiderna samt hur vattenförbrukningen varierar under längre tider för att få ett mera
realistiskt flödesvariationsmönster som beskriver en utsträckt tidsperiod och lämpar sig
specifikt för Ward 10.
Det föreslagna distributionssystemet är ett integrerat system med två olika vattenbehov,
bevattningsvatten och dricksvatten. Vattenrening rekommenderas för att inte låta
dricksvattenreningen ske på invånarnas eget ansvar eftersom intagen till systemet är från
ytvatten som lätt kontamineras. Däremot är rening av bevattningsvatten inte nödvändigt
vilket kan medföra långsiktiga extra kostnader när vatten för bägge behoven renas i ett
integrerat system. Alternativt kunde parallella system byggas för respektive vattenkvalitet
men det dubblerar materialkostnaderna för konstruktionen.
Arbetet behandlar inte vilket tillvägagångssätt som lämpar sig bäst för Ward 10, utan är
ett förslag som utgör grunden för projektet som vartefter får ta form av de lokala
bestämmelserna och behoven.

9.2 Appendix B, Pressure profiles and pressures in pipelines
It is strived to keep a minimum pressure of 1 bar in the system and pressure between 1-3
bar at each outlet. Nodes under 1 bar are usually next to a water tank which according to
the simulation is empty, but in reality does have a pressure if the tank is containing water.
Nodes above 3 bar are mostly junction nodes or dummy nodes, therefore requiring a
higher PN pipe for that section.
