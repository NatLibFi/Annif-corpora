Self-Incriminating Evidence, Ill-Treatment, and the Notion of Fair Trial under the
European Convention on Human Rights

Abstract:
In 2010, the European Court of Human Rights faced a daunting task when it was called upon to
give a Grand Chamber judgment involving a defendant, a murderer of a child, who had prior to
his conviction been submitted to police brutality in a situation where the police had believed
that the child could still be rescued. As his remedy, the defendant pursued that the state had
violated against him the prohibition of torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment, as
well as his right to fair trial. Accordingly, the defendant called for violations of the European
Convention on Human Rights in its articles 3 and 6, respectively. Referring to the absoluteness
and non-derogability of the principle, the Court found that the state had indeed violated the
prohibition of inhuman treatment, as it had forcibly obtained testimony from the defendant.
However, in an arguably unprecedented fashion, the Court found that this same chain of events,
simultaneously, amounted to no violation on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.
Understandably, the case activates profound considerations in terms of the right to a fair trial, a
multifaceted omnibus provision in the European Convention. Importantly, it involves the longestablished principle called the privilege against self-incrimination, designed to protect the
defendant’s procedural rights by allowing him to remain silent and refrain from testifying
against himself. Furthermore, it prompts one to consider the utility of all evidence that has been
acquired against the spirit of this privilege, e.g. via forced confessions. Such considerations
showcase the technicalities that may be involved, while meanwhile the human rights scope of
“fair trial” nonetheless requires that such issues must be afforded due weight. Furthermore,
self-incrimination highlight the defendant’s own agency, prompting one to consider the
conditions that the European Convention demands from human rights waivers. This thesis,
essentially, considers the effect that the absolute prohibition of ill-treatment should legally
entail towards these procedural rights and the fairness of the trial proceedings as a whole.
This work is grounded in legal dogmatics, as it especially examines the capacity of the
discussed norms to converge with one another. This convergence marks the need to reconcile
two fundamental human rights norms that are crafted in very different ways. Especially the
notion of absoluteness provides an interesting point of departure, as this thesis essentially
considers whether the absoluteness of the prohibition of ill-treatment should, as a peremptory
principle of international law, carry over also to the ambit of fair trial whenever a collision with
these norms occurs. Making extensive use of the Court’s case law, this thesis argues that the
extensive and nuanced doctrines that the Court has cultivated around the idea of fairness serves
to give plenty of tools to tackle the research problem, even without the need to always revert to
the absolute backdrop behind ECHR art. 3.

Introduction

1.1. Background

The right to a fair trial is one of the most prominent notions in international human rights law.
Framed as a core civil and political right, it catalogues a medley of state obligations where coverage
is provided for trials themselves, but usually also for their ancillary proceedings such as pre-trial
investigations.1 In criminal proceedings, it entails concrete rights afforded to individuals the
proceedings concern, including those in the role of defendants. Universally included within these
rights is the state obligation to allow defendants2 their privilege against self-incrimination.3 Besides
an element inside the multi-pronged fair trial apparatus, this principle remains embedded into
foundational principles of procedural law around the world.4
To explain, self-incrimination refers to the act when an individual confesses or otherwise testifies
against himself, thereby aiding the prosecution5, inadvertently or not, to make a case against the
defendant in criminal proceedings against him. Self-incrimination highlights the defendant’s
individual choice and personal autonomy, ideally rendering such an act inherently unproblematic, at
least when self-incrimination occurs on a voluntary basis. Accordingly, protections against selfincrimination are erected as a specific counterweight in order preserve the legitimacy, i.e. the
fairness, of the criminal proceedings, taken as a whole. Viewing it from the standpoint of the
defendant’s rights, such protection therefore entails the right to refrain from incriminating oneself
without fear of adverse repercussions from choosing to do so.6 The expression that has long
saturated American courtroom drama7, “pleading the fifth”, signifies this very prerogative.8

1

This extensive notion is exemplified, inter alia, by the right to a fair trial enshrined in the European Convention on
Human Rights art. 6, whose protective scope begins from the moment when a person is charged with a criminal offence.
See Rainey et al. 2017, p. 277.
2
For consistency, the term ”defendant” will be exclusively used throughout this thesis, when alluding to individuals
criminally charged.
3
For an explicit reference in a human rights instrument, see art. 14.3 in the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights.
4
Archaic references to the principle have been unearthed all the way from ancient Christian and Talmudic writings. Later,
at least 17th century England saw the principle used in a form that somewhat resembles its current form. See Jackson et
al. 2012, p. 241.
5
Here, the term calls for loose interpretation, including not merely prosecutors but also police officers or any other state
officials partaking in the proceedings against the defendant.
6
Prominent instruments showcasing the principle in international law include the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (art. 14.3g) and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (art. 55.1a).

The expression refers to the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution.

Emphasising the defendant’s own volition, the protection against self-incrimination has been
frequently monikered a privilege.9 The moniker shall be utilised also throughout this thesis.
Self-incrimination brings about several issues to consider in a human rights discourse. As
mentioned, it should be understood as a part of the larger construct, i.e. the right to a fair trial.
Furthermore, a question of individuals willingly waiving their own human rights is aptly
demonstrated exactly in situations where a defendant waives his privilege against selfincrimination. However, it is hardly always clear whether such waivers have been conveyed out of
the defendant’s own volition. Worse, a possibility may exist that self-incriminating statements are
derived by compulsive means. Consequently, the genesis of confessions or any other kind of selfincriminating testimonials demand careful scrutiny every time doubts are cast over their
genuineness. When such doubts have merit, the situation calls for further assessment whether there
has occurred a human rights violation, pertaining to fair trial. Understandably, the issue also
connects to the use of evidence during the proceedings against the defendant.
Accordingly, procedural legislations globally tend to recognise another protective mechanism,
which has a direct bearing on the integrity of the privilege against self-incrimination itself. This
mechanism is often known as an exclusionary rule, designed to guarantee that all evidence acquired
in violation of the privilege is declared inadmissible during court proceedings. This means that all
evidence thus tainted should be excluded, i.e. rendered unusable against the defendant.10 Mirrored
against the ideal for fair proceedings, this is only reasonable, as the exclusionary rule provides
actual teeth to the privilege against self-incrimination by quashing all evidence acquired
thereagainst. Understandably, this pair of procedural mechanisms deserve a solid standing also
inside international human rights discourse, and fair trial doctrines therein. A giant among such
doctrines, indubitably, is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), its Article 6
containing the overarching provision for fair trial.11
Human rights law, to be sure, cannot claim sole primacy over the global realisation of procedural
law. Due to state sovereignty, the actual implementation of the privilege or evidence exclusion
remains dependant on how these concepts are incorporated into domestic legal orders worldwide.

9

In ECHR framework, the moniker has been in Court’s regular usage since the early 1990s. See John Murray v. United
Kingdom, ECtHR, 8 February 1996, para. 45 and Saunders v. United Kingdom, ECtHR, 17 December 1996, para. 65.
10
To reiterate, not all evidence acquired through self-incrimination should be declared inadmissible. Rather, the
question is whether the state has failed in its obligation to respect the privilege, improperly prompting an individual to
incriminate himself. Such failure can have transpired by, for example, if the state has forced the individual to confess to
a crime by force. Contrarily, evidence stemming from voluntary confessions remain, prima facie, quite admissible.
11
Officially the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the ECHR was concluded
4 November 1950, and entered into force 3 September 1953 under the auspices of the Council of Europe.

2

An attempt to provide exhaustive, let alone uniform content to these issues only via human rights
treaties is hardly reasonable. In addition, such an exercise would be even further exacerbated by the
sheer scope of the concept of “fair trial”. A myopic, internationalist lens would also undermine the
heterogeneity of different global legal systems, who bear the primary responsibility on these issues.
Nonetheless, the tremendous capacity of international human rights law to penetrate domestic legal
orders may sometimes force even technical issues, such as self-incrimination and evidence
exclusion, under its ambit. A case in point is the ECHR framework, where jurisprudence of the
European Court of Human Rights (“the Court”) provides in-depth content towards ECHR rights and
obligations, legally binding towards all state parties to the Convention.12
While reflecting international human rights law and individual domestic legal orders often presents
its challenges, it must also be noted that individual human rights norms themselves may frequently
require reconciliation with one another. Throughout history, human rights courts have tackled cases
and situations where convergences and collisions of different rights and obligations must be settled
in a holistic way. This is a challenge both to individual states as well as human rights courts, the
latter often arbitrating contested decisions made by the former. While one could well posit, in
oversimplified terms, that some rights norms are more important than others, the interaction
between different aspects of human rights law may give rise to considerable legal problems that
need resolving by a competent judiciary, such as the European Court.
To expound upon the issue, self-incrimination and evidence exclusion both are prone to becoming
entangled with one of the most prestigious human rights norms: the prohibition of torture and other
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Invariably framed as an absolute human right, this
prohibition appears as such also in the European Convention, in its Article 3.13 Forced confessions,
i.e. confessions solicited from a defendant by means of ill-treatment, are of course a textbook
example of a situation where a defendant’s choice to not incriminate himself is destroyed, and
which also warrant the exclusion of all evidence derived by such means. Nonetheless, the
Convention text of ECHR itself proves reticent in explaining this connection between selfincrimination and ill-treatment. Another prominent human rights instrument, however, fares better
in this regard. A crucial part of the United Nations treaty framework, the Convention against
Torture (CAT) provides the following in its Article 1:
“For the purposes of this Convention, the term "torture" means any act by which severe pain or
suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as
obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession […] when such pain or suffering
12

Rainey et al. 2017, p. 183.

is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or
other person acting in an official capacity.”14

Besides setting the tone for the ubiquitously recognised prohibition against ill-treatment, the
opening paragraph of CAT underlines forcibly obtained confessions as a premier example where
violations against the prohibition occur. In addition, CAT serves to strengthen the link towards selfincrimination even further in its art. 15, prohibiting the usage of all evidence acquired in violation
of CAT.

1.2. Aims, structure and the research question

Collisions between different legal norms are frequently a topic of judicial scrutiny as well as legal
research, exemplifying situations where mere written law proves as an insufficient legal source,
thereby calling for an arbitrator in the form of a court of law. The framework for the European
Convention on Human Rights provides the quintessential arena to consider such collisions in terms
of international human rights law. Not only is the Convention one of the oldest and most prestigious
such rights instruments, it is arguably also the richest in terms of its jurisprudence, thanks to the
European Court of Human Rights.
The main instigator for this thesis is to study specific aspects of procedural law, namely the
privilege against self-incrimination and evidence exclusion, under the specific human rights
backdrop of ECHR. Firstly, these issues, while extensively codified in national legislations, remain
relatively hidden in terms of human rights instruments. Indeed, they make no appearance
whatsoever in the actual text of the European Convention. Therefore, their incorporation into a
specifically human rights oriented framework provides an interesting starting point for this work, as
well as providing insight on the role these issues command under the auspices of “fair trial” in
ECHR art. 6. Secondly, the likely convergence of these procedural norms with the prohibition of
torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment, found also in ECHR art. 3, provides another
interesting anchoring to the topic. By the global consensus for absoluteness, the torture prohibition
not only commands universal respect, but it also boasts a rather straightforward, widely agreedupon content. As human rights norms, articles 6 and 3 of ECHR are very different by their natures,
providing further challenge for those scrutinising the articles in tandem.

All situations where the states violate the prohibition against ill-treatment command a gravity unlike
with many other rights violations. Such violations also tend to occur more rarely, at least in the
ECHR framework. The absolutist backdrop behind the prohibition is therefore quite understandable,
even incontestable. It signifies non-derogability, rendering the prohibition into an international law
monolith whose prestige is practically impossible to argue against. Nonetheless, even this notion of
“absoluteness” has its genesis, where absoluteness is attributed to the prohibition for certain,
specific reasons based on history, morals and fundamental notions derived from human societies.
Therefore, even absoluteness warrants research and questioning.
Such research may well be conducted under the auspices of criminal procedure, a setting which
historically has, at times, been marred with rather serious instances of ill-treatment, especially in the
form of forced confessions, whose evidential value is thankfully nowadays viewed in much more
unfavourable light. Nonetheless, the practice of procedural ill-treatment has failed to vanish.
Therefore, one is prompted to think whether the absolute backdrop of the prohibition of illtreatment is somehow transferrable to other, traditionally non-absolute human rights when such
rights converge with one another. A case in point is the privilege against self-incrimination, which
one could justifiably consider attaining similarly absolutist standards when a defendant is, for
example, tortured by the state whilst attempting to procure a confession from him. To frame this
problem into a specific research question, the thesis will consider the following:
Under the framework of the European Convention on Human Rights, does the absolute scope of the
prohibition of ill-treatment preclude the state from admitting self-incriminating evidence from a
defendant who has previously, during the same criminal proceedings, been subjected to a violation
of ECHR art. 3? And to frame the question differently, should such self-incrimination categorically
entail a violation of fair trial according to ECHR art. 6?
Substantively, the thesis is designed to account for the individual themes mentioned in the
introduction and to support a cohesive way to tackle the research question. Due to its cross-cutting
effect, the prohibition of ill-treatment makes frequent appearances throughout the chapters as they
organically appear along the notions discussed. Indeed, plenty of substantive contents on ECHR art.
3 will be provided already during the two first substantive chapters, even though the chapters are
commanded by the procedural themes of evidence exclusion and self-incrimination. Especially the
discussion on evidence exclusion within a human rights context raises the issue of handling the
topic in a somewhat different light than conventional, domestic procedural legislations tend to do,
which will also be considered during Chapter 2. Meanwhile, Chapter 3 pertains to self5

incrimination, while also introducing the relevant, larger constructs pertaining to the overall right to
a fair trial in ECHR art. 6.
The following two chapters, conversely, aim for less descriptive approach, as an attempt is made to
deepen the understanding of the topics in light of the research questions. Chapter 4 predominantly
latches onto the backdrop of ECHR art. 6, considering self-incrimination in tandem with the
procedural realities of the defendant and their impact towards his rights. Furthermore, the chapter
considers self-incrimination as a specific form of a human rights waiver. Finally, Chapter 5 boasts
the closest nexus to ECHR art. 3, probing especially the notion of absoluteness in order to better
understand its institutional significance. To elaborate, the chapter explores specific approaches by
which to tackle this Gordian knot of absoluteness in light of this work. By rough division, an
external approach first contemplates the manoeuvrability that the states themselves may have
around the absolute ideal, by considering the principle of subsidiarity as well as specific state
interests that are inherent during criminal procedure. Thereafter, a more internal approach
scrutinises the prohibition of ill-treatment itself, by considering its historical development and the
distinctions that the Court has afforded to different forms of ill-treatment.

1.3. Method, materials and limitations

The legal foundation for this work is firmly embedded into public international law and
international human rights law. The thesis thereby adopts the research methodology of legal
dogmatics and is focused very specifically to the framework of the European Convention on Human
Rights. The Convention functions as the premier primary legal source for this work, while drawing
necessary inspiration even from related rights instruments, such as the UN Convention against
Torture. Due to the heavy emphasis of ECHR, the thesis depicts an extensive case study of the
jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, rendering its case law the overwhelmingly
most important secondary legal source for this work. The Court’s findings are further scrutinised by
the help of doctrinal, scholarly sources, which have further been of tremendous assistance in
forming the thesis into the synthesis it is. Finally, other legal sources of varying degrees of
authoritativeness have been utilised when appropriate, including General Comments and case law
of treaty bodies within the UN, as well as its Special Rapporteur on torture.

6

While the research questions may appear very specific substantively, they have a clear anchoring
especially in one Grand Chamber15 case from the European Court. This is the case of Gäfgen v.
Germany16, from 2010, which dealt with a situation where a defendant, having murdered a child,
was during his police interrogation submitted to ill-treatment, thereby confessing his deeds and
leading to a sequence of events where the Court ended up proclaiming a violation in ECHR art. 3,
although not in art. 6. While the case will be better accounted for within the substantive chapters,
this curious finding serves to cast the research question into a somewhat more concrete light.
Therefore, while not incorporated into the research question itself, the case functions as a useful
point of reference throughout this work.
The thesis is heavy on procedural terminology, thanks to its technically aligned background in the
right to a fair trial. This warrants clarifications on terminology. Firstly, even though the full name
appears regularly, the term privilege refers exclusively to the privilege against self-incrimination.
Meanwhile, the term defendant is used in an extensive meaning, sometimes even appearing as the
inferior alternative against suspect, accused, appellant, respondent, plaintiff, or so on. Nonetheless,
persistence with defendant hopefully serves this work in the interest of consistency and legibility.
Likewise, the term ill-treatment appears frequently to ameliorate the reading experience, by
avoiding constant referrals to the litany “torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment”.
Therefore, in the absence of the need to specify, ill-treatment will refer to all or any of these terms
found in ECHR art. 3, among other instruments. Finally, the author recognises the capacity of the
prohibition of ill-treatment to possibly extend even towards the sphere of private individuals, where
the agency of the state behind such treatment may be limited.17 In this thesis, however, the
discussion limits the issue solely to situations where states exclusively manifest the requisite agency
behind the prohibited ill-treatment.

15

Based on its mandate given in ECHR art. 43, the Grand Chamber assesses cases raising “a serious question affecting
the interpretation or application of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, or a serious issue of general importance”.
This undeniably conveys more robust doctrinal value to its findings, compared to ones taken in Chamber, Committee or
by a single judge. See Rainey et al. 2017, p. 18-19 or Pellonpää 2005, p. 168.

17
Grans mentions, as an example, honour-related violence as one such originator for privately occurring ill-treatment.
While international human rights law is yet to find a clear consensus on how such violence should be viewed in light of
the prohibition of ill-treatment, the issue nonetheless brings forth a state obligation to take measures in preventing
honour-related violence. See Grans 2015, p. 717.

Exclusion of evidence in human rights law

2.1. Exclusionary rule: meaning and rationale

While a niche topic inside the behemoth that is procedural law, evidence exclusion must also be
assessed from the standpoint of human rights, as a component inside the right to a fair trial. Indeed,
the connection therein being so clear, the exclusionary rule has even been referred as an “alter ego”
to the privilege against self-incrimination.18 In the practice of the UN Human Rights Committee
(HRC), i.e. the treaty body for the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights19 (ICCPR),
the topic has been most prominently referred to in connection to forced confessions, thus also
activating the ambit for the prohibition of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, in
ICCPR art. 7.20 Appropriately, this connection commands prominence also in the UN Convention
Against Torture.
Of course, mere human rights considerations can hardly exhaust the full rationale behind domestic
exclusionary rule doctrines. Globally, different justice systems and courts may credit several
reasons why upholding robust rules of evidence is considered essential. For instance, the
exclusionary rule can be thought to emphasise the value of discovering material truth in criminal
proceedings, thereby also promoting the functional credibility of national justice systems.21
Alternatively, the rule could be viewed as a tool for deterring illegal or otherwise undesirable
conduct from the police or other authorities during criminal investigations.22 Underlying rationales
aside, well-functioning rules of evidence can nonetheless be thought of as an important procedural
building block in democratic societies which strive to uphold a rule of law. The differing rationales
exist in their unique shapes and forms, contributing to the canvases that form these countries’
individual procedural rules of evidence.
In domestic legislations, procedural models on evidence exclusion derive from a wide spectrum of
regulatory solutions. They may or may not have a constitutional status. They may be incorporated
into a state’s rules on evidence, rules on reasoning, or some other set of procedural legislation.
Furthermore, such rules may vary in their orientations, with differing emphases on different stages

of criminal proceedings, i.e. the pre-trial vis-à-vis the actual trial stages.23 With this thesis in mind,
one should also recall that violations on the privilege against self-incrimination are, despite
significant, still only one example which may beget inadmissible evidence during criminal
proceedings. With a rights-based approach, however, research of human rights norms pertaining to
evidence exclusion could provide an opportunity to entrench the exclusionary rule more directly
into the application of international human rights law, thus possibly allowing the rule a more
universally cemented legal position. This is undoubtedly true, mutatis mutandis, even with many
other procedural constructs considered within the confines of ECHR art. 6, such as the privilege
against self-incrimination.
In terms of rationales, even direct human rights considerations undoubtedly have earned their place
in the discourse of procedural evidence. Despite the global recognition of exclusionary rules,
however, their rights-based significance remains somewhat elusive to account for in clear terms.
This has been evident in the commonplace trepidation of, for example, the European Court of
Human Rights to apply such rules as directly enforceable state obligations.24 Indeed, the Court has
frequently exhibited hesitancy to weigh in on questions of evidence admissibility, preferring instead
to pass the buck to domestic jurisdictions of ECHR state parties.25 Meanwhile, the Court has also
indicated that wrongfully obtained evidence may well have the effect of rendering trial proceedings
unfair.26 In this, the Court has manifestly reserved itself the possibility to weigh in further on the
matter. This bipolarity indicates that the exclusionary rule should not go neglected as a topic even in
human rights discourse.

2.2. Development of the exclusionary rule within ECHR

2.2.1.

Perceiving the issue

Discussing evidence exclusion activates a specific niche of procedural law discourse also in terms
of ECHR. Functionally, exclusionary rules appear as recognisable procedural constructs regardless
of whether they are applied in domestic legal systems or international ones. Ontologically, however,

the difference is considerable: in ECHR, the legal framework surrounding evidence exclusion exists
thanks to the wish of the member states to the Council of Europe to be bound by a collectively
concluded human rights treaty. This, naturally, is a significant difference compared to individual
states’ legislations where emergence of all procedural norms is attributable to political and
historical developments in criminal procedure within the individual states themselves.
Being directly attached to provisions of art. 6 on fair trial, evidence exclusion under the ECHR
framework must necessarily be rendered under the raison d’être of the Convention itself, i.e. the
protection of human rights. As the Convention is an amalgam of the will of the Council of Europe
member states, it remains questionable to claim human rights as the exclusive rationale behind all
substantial details that are derivable from the articles of ECHR.27 Nonetheless, the rights-based
anchoring of ECHR should probably convey significance to the standing which exclusionary rules
have in domestic legal hierarchies. Accordingly, Ölçer credits the ECHR for how it has facilitated
an approach to evidence exclusion in a way unlike domestic legal traditions have done prior to it.28
One may justifiably argue that the example shown by ECHR has led to jurisprudential ramifications
in many individual state practices; state parties may well have begun to give the exclusionary rule
more credit as a fair trial component, thereby amending the emphasis of human rights in their
procedural legislation accordingly. For example, compared with evidence exclusion in domestic
U.S. law, the European Court’s approach on admitting evidence exhibits less rigid characteristics
and allows for more extensive adjudicative discretion in domestic courts under its purview.29 While
outside the scope of this thesis, the topic whether the European Convention has heralded a change
in the attitudes within the “European” understanding on the exclusionary rule is an interesting one.
From a human rights standpoint, Thaman has nonetheless characterised the Court-developed
doctrine as influential.30 Due to its underlying human rights ethos, it arguably boasts a distinct, sui
generis flavour.

See Ölçer 2010, p. 83.

serving as the premier precursor whereupon many national evidence exclusion models have been based.

Application of the rule in the Court

While deciphering its stance on evidence exclusion, the Court has analysed both the acquisition of
evidence during pre-trial phases, as well as the fairness of the subsequent usage of evidence during
the actual trial phase.31 While the Court has afforded evidence exclusion due recognition within its
fair trial doctrine, emphasis on state sovereignty has limited and disincentivised the Court somewhat
in its substantive interpretation.32 Indeed, over the years the Court has exhibited ambivalence while
considering whether, and to what extent, its mandate even calls for involvement in issues of
evidence exclusion.33 The case of Schenk from 1988 marks an early example where the Court
considered that the Convention and its art. 6 are ill-suited to dictate rules on evidence
admissibility.34 This is also due to an underlying principle of subsidiarity within the Convention,
which forces the Court to rely upon the domestic assessment on individual pieces of evidence,
precluding the Court from conducting such assessments on its own.35 Consequently, the Court has
proclaimed a limited mandate to comment on domestic legislative or judicial solutions on the issue.
Ölçer has interpreted that the Court’s jurisprudence on admissibility and exclusion of illegally
obtained evidence delineates a state obligation to “the fair use of evidence”.36 While lacking official
treaty-level recognition, this idea of fairness effectively mirrors the operative idea behind “fair
trial”. It should still be noted that the Court’s substantive gaze over the topic may sprawl even
outside the scope of ECHR art. 6. As mentioned in the introduction, the issue lends tremendous
relevance also to the prohibition of torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment, discussed
more below in chapter 2.3. Exemplified by Schenk, plenty of the Court’s earlier scrutiny has
moreover touched upon the ambit of ECHR art. 8, i.e. the provision protecting everyone’s right to
respect for private and family life.37
Due to all possible scenarios where a defendant’s privacy may be encroached upon amidst the
procurement of evidence, the link to ECHR art. 8 is hardly inconceivable. Generally, the Court has

applied the principles of art. 8 from several points of vantage. As per Moreham, two such points are
freedom of interference with physical or psychological integrity as well as freedom from unwanted
access to and collection of information, both easily linkable to events that often transpire during
criminal process.38 It should be noted that the Court has clearly stated that a criminal conviction
cannot in itself constitute an interference of private life in the meaning of the Convention.39
Individual procedural aspects such as evidence acquisition, however, undoubtedly remain open to
contention also in light of ECHR art. 8.
While the Court’s initial case law on evidence exclusion pertained nigh exclusively to the angle of
privacy, these cases never yielded any violations pertaining to fair trial.40 In Khan, the Court
pronounced a violation of art. 8 due to a lacking domestic regulation on covert listening devices, as
applying such devices had led to the applicant’s conviction on narcotics-related charges.41 However,
while this inroad to the defendant’s privacy sufficed to declare a violation of private life, the Court,
considering the overall circumstances, ruled that the incursion was not sufficiently dire to declare
the trial proceedings unfair.42 This was the case, remarkably, even though the covertly acquired
evidence formed the entire basis for the defendant’s conviction. This suggests that privacy
violations are relatively simple to compensate for. Indeed, the Court’s praxis bespeaks of the low
estimation that the Court appears to have pertaining to privacy violations when they are juxtaposed
against the larger whole of ECHR art. 6.43 Besides the high threshold for privacy violations in terms
of evidence exclusion, the Court’s early jurisprudence may also have contributed to the subsequent,
cautious approach it has manifested on the issue.
With developing jurisprudence, the Court has nonetheless exhibited an increasing aptitude to
analyse also strictly procedural aspects behind evidential violations. Generally, the Court seems to
have opted for a holistic approach where it prefers to analyse the overall circumstances behind the
obtainment of evidence in individual proceedings.44 The Court has, further, stated as a matter of
principle that it ought to refrain from ascertaining the admissibility of any specific type of
38

See Khan v. United Kingdom, ECtHR, 12 May 2000, paras 37-39.
42
The deciding factor on the fairness assessment was that the evidence obtained through covert methods were deemed
extremely reliable and, besides, went unchallenged by the applicant within the domestic proceedings. This had a
sufficiently recuperative effect as to not declare the proceedings unfair, despite the violation found on ECHR art. 8. The
Court also afforded weight to the fact that none of the domestic courts had declared the evidence inadmissible.
43
Certainly, a reticence to declare violations may also be due to the inherent nature of ECHR art. 8, whose second
paragraph contains a limitations clause providing for restrictions in the enjoyment of this Convention right. Such
restrictions require a clear legal basis as well as an inherent necessity “in a democratic society”, based on, inter alia,
issues such as national security, public safety and the rights and freedoms of others. See Ölçer 2010, p. 90.

evidence.45 Instead, as per Ölçer’s characterisation, the operative idea under the Court’s focus is the
overall fairness of the proceedings. As Ho has indicated, this perspective renders it rather difficult
to derive clear individual principles from the Court’s jurisprudence on the topic.46 Nonetheless, a
holistic if restrained approach may also be due to the dynamism the Court has at its disposal, where
it reserves its right to add and adapt to its own gradually developing praxis.47 Signs of such gains in
momentum have been visible through the early 2000s.48

2.2.3.

Testing fairness

Reflecting on the idea of fairness, the Court has considered the notion of lawfulness both in terms of
domestic law and from the standpoint of ECHR.49 On the one hand, evaluating the impact of
“unlawful” evidence could prove an intricate exercise, as the Court’s function is not to assess
whether a piece of evidence should be excluded as such, but rather how the manner of the evidence
acquisition ends up impacting the fairness of the proceedings.50 On the other hand, despite the
complexity behind the undeniably relativistic idea of “fairness”, it is hardly unfathomable to
discover situations where unlawful acquisition of evidence may render the whole criminal
proceedings unfair. For instance, obtaining evidence through a direct violation of another ECHR
right may be thought sufficient to fulfil the criterion of unlawfulness to activate a violation of
ECHR art. 6.51 This is perhaps easiest understood by considering forced confessions obtained
through torture or other prohibited ill-treatment. On the other hand, the Khan case (see above)
argues clearly against this notion by reminding that even direct unlawfulness may be redeemable in
the overall appraisal of the proceedings. Evidently, certain levels of unlawfulness may thus be
compensated, and the fairness of the trial recuperated back to a level commensurate with ECHR art.
6.

45

See Allan v. United Kingdom (2002), para. 42. As an example, the Court specifically mentions ”unlawfully obtained
evidence” as a type of evidence which the Court may not categorically declare as inadmissible. While slightly
counterintuitive, the wording makes sense when considering the term “unlawful” strictly in terms of domestic law – an
area where the Court has no jurisdiction to interfere.

Illustrated by the case of Bykov, the Court has also called attention to the quality of evidence by
demanding scrutiny on its accuracy, reliability, as well as the circumstances in which the evidence
was obtained.52 From a standpoint of procedure, the defendant’s possibility to challenge the
authenticity of a piece of evidence, and to oppose its use, has a clear impact on realising the rights
of the defence.53 The relative strength and reliability of a single piece of evidence also has a bearing
on whether other, supportive evidence is needed in order to uphold fairness within the
proceedings.54 This, of course, remains true even in cases where no evidence needs to be directly
excluded at all. Furthermore, the Court has demanded scrutiny on the decisiveness of the evidence
in question, as such consideration may have a profound effect on the overall conclusions of the
Court and the issue of fairness.55
The Court has synthesised a way of analysis where relevance is afforded both to the gravity of the
wrongful evidence acquisition and to the probative value of the evidence thus obtained.56 It has,
further, considered the seriousness of the investigated crime or the accompanying public interest
considerations that the criminal activity entails.57 The Court has, moreover, highlighted the
responsibility of the national courts to properly assess and test the quality of the evidence during the
domestic procedure. This was illustrated in the case of Khudobin, where the Court based
insufficient national assessment of the quality of evidence as its reason to find a violation in ECHR
art. 6.58 Whilst it could have pronounced a clear-cut and more straightforward violation on another
bases, the Court appeared to deliberately adjudicate the case this way, highlighting the paramount
importance, and perhaps even the the categorical expectation, for national courts to assess the value
of their evidence properly.59
The Court’s method to assess the fairness of evidence exclusion may well be viewed as a balancing
test, where permissibility of smaller rights restrictions is weighed against the overarching, general
demand for fair trial. It is thereby essential that while sub-level restrictions may be allowed, they
must always be based upon some legitimate necessity and kept to their minimum.60 Furthermore, in
order to uphold a balanced and rights-friendly approach to the overall usage of evidence,

restrictions demonstrably entail the need to compensate for them appropriately. Generally, this is
consistent with the way the Court has viewed the full scope of ECHR art. 6, which lacks definitive
limitations clauses such as those found in articles 8–11 of the Convention. Instead of such clauses,
the Court makes use of different, often broad and flexible “umbrella tests” to determine the overall
fairness of the proceedings.61 A test in similar vein is frequently employed also while assessing the
privilege against self-incrimination, discussed below in chapter 4.
Assessments on “balancing” have also received certain criticism for their lack of clear structure,
rendering outcomes of different cases, at times, difficult to predict.62 Also, the development of the
relevant case law has been gradual if not slow. Nonetheless, the Court’s jurisprudence has had the
effect of linking human rights law even more firmly into criminal procedure.63 It appears, after all,
that the exclusionary rule has become one of the crucial tools within the fundamental notion of
fairness, entrenched in ECHR art. 6. While privacy-related violations appear to have lacked
sufficient potency on the matter, individual procedural violations have led the Court to ascertain an
inadequate recuperation of fairness and thus a violation in ECHR art. 6. Violations on the
prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment have, understandably, had the self-same effect.

2.3. Evidence exclusion and ill-treatment

2.3.1.

Raising the stakes

Evidence procured specifically through ill-treatment connects to the topic of this thesis.
Furthermore, the issue warrants its own subchapter simply due to the gravity of torture and its
corresponding prohibitions in international law. Although no mention of an exclusionary rule exists
in the text of ECHR, the notion is no stranger to human rights treaties; indeed, it specifically seems
to make such appearances in relation to prohibited ill-treatment. Arguably the most prominent
appearance of the rule within international instruments can be found in the UN Convention against
Torture (CAT), in its article 15:

Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result
of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused
of torture as evidence that the statement was made.

As Rodley has stated, backing for this provision may be found in the unreliable nature of all
information procured through torture, as well as the obvious ramifications on the fairness of the
proceedings should such information be admitted.64 The UN Human Rights Committee (HRC) has
further commented that the provision carries also a preventive function, importantly discouraging
states to rely upon ill-treatment in their intelligence acquisition.65 Significantly, CAT art. 15 signifies
that the exclusionary rule has carved a place in the most peremptory sphere of international human
rights law. Alike CAT art. 1 (see introduction), also art. 15 serves as a reminder on the
interconnectedness of fair trial and the prohibition of ill-treatment. As already mentioned, the latter
one is considered a non-derogable and absolute principle in international law.
The UN Special Rapporteur on torture has affirmed that the reach of the absolutist backdrop extends
also to CAT art. 15.66 The categorical nature of this absoluteness is, however, cast under some doubt,
as the most vigorous absolutist terminology in CAT refers only to torture. In CAT art. 16, the
Convention lists specific substantive articles of CAT where other inhuman and degrading must also
be observed, asserting these articles should “in particular” be applied also to these lesser forms of illtreatment.67 Article 15, however, is omitted from this list. Meanwhile, the UN Special Rapporteur on
torture has stated that even other inhuman and degrading treatment remain covered by the obligation
of CAT art. 15 due to the long-established interlinkage between torture and other ill-treatment that
stems from customary international law.68 The same finding has also been made by the HRC, through
its interpretation on the corresponding prohibition within the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR).69 Torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment are undercast a
universally accepted jus cogens prohibition; thereby, it is prudent to consider the exclusionary rule
from a similarly absolute angle.70

67
In its wording, CAT art. 16 calls states to ”undertake to prevent in any territory under its jurisdiction other acts of
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture”. This marks an important
difference in gravitas, compared against the blanket ban on torture in CAT art. 2, which mandates that each state party
to “take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in any territory under
its jurisdiction”.

The official treaty body for CAT, the Committee Against Torture, has also echoed the position taken
by HRC and the General Rapporteur. In a General Comment, the Committee has proclaimed that
despite the wording of CAT, the absolutist backdrop of the Convention applies also in terms of other
ill-treatment than torture for all its substantive articles, including art. 15.71 In addition, the Committee
has offered nuance to the matter in response to individual complaints. In its case law, the Committee
has frequently stressed that the demands of art. 15 entail an obligation for domestic courts to verify
that confessional or other statements are not a result of torture if they are so contested, and that in
case of torture such statements are rendered null and void in domestic proceedings.72 While the
Committee has voiced that it is not its place to conduct evaluations of facts and evidence utilised in
domestic proceedings, it still retains the right to take a stance on the matter if it manifests that the
domestic evaluation of facts or evidence has clearly occurred arbitrarily or amounted to clear denial
of justice.73

2.3.2.

Evidence and ill-treatment in ECHR

In ECHR, the European Court’s jurisprudence pertaining to an absolute ban on evidence acquired
by torture or inhuman or degrading treatment is quite consistent with other international authorities,
such as CAT. Essentially, also the ECHR system mandates that its state parties adopt a categorical
system of excluding confessions or other evidence acquired through torture and other forms of illtreatment.74 This marks a departure from other violations stemming from individual procedural
violations as well as violations pertaining to ECHR art. 8, where the Court has relied upon a holistic
fairness assessment detailed above. In the case of ECHR art. 3, the departure is therefore quite
understandable, as the ECHR treats the prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment in similar terms
as customary international law, CAT, ICCPR, and others.75 Clarifying further, the Court has also
stated that it is immaterial from the standpoint of admissibility whether the perpetrator of illtreatment is an agent of a state or a private individual.76

In the case of Jalloh, the Court has given a Grand Chamber ruling on acquisition of real evidence
against the spirit of ECHR art. 3. In the case, the applicant was a suspected drug offender, who
under police surveillance was seen swallowing small plastic bags, assumed to contain drugs.
Having been detained, no illegal substances were found in the applicant’s possession, prompting the
public prosecutor to order an emetic administered to him to secure the swallowed bag. While the
procedure was carried out by proper medical personnel, the applicant himself opposed it heavily,
requiring police officers to hold him down while the physician administered the emetics by these
forcible means. The impelled regurgitation yielded a baggie of cocaine, leading to the charging of
the defendant. The Court ascertained that the overall procedure in Jalloh was tantamount to
inhuman and degrading treatment, declaring that the acquired evidence should have been
considered inadmissible in domestic proceedings.77 The matter has obvious bearing also in terms of
self-incrimination, returned to subsequently in this thesis.
The Court specified that no matter the circumstances, it is under no conditions possible to admit
evidence into the proceedings, if improper ill-treatment is involved in its acquisition. It further
clarified that doing so always raises serious issues on the fairness of the whole proceedings, and that
neither the evidence’s decisiveness nor lack thereof has any bearing on the matter.78 Later, the case
of Harutyunyan saw the Court rejecting the applicability of verbal evidence acquired by torture,
even though the confessions themselves were made afterwards to another person not physically
involved in the torturing itself.79 Due to the prominence of ill-treatment, it is no surprise that Jalloh
and Harutyunyan both merited a violation also in the scope of ECHR art. 6. Regarding categorical
violations on fair trial, the Court specifically left open the general question “whether the use of
evidence obtained by an act qualified as inhuman and degrading treatment automatically renders a
trial unfair”.80 Conversely, its motivations in Jalloh indicate that such a categorical, indeed an
absolute, violation will always be found when the acquisition of real evidence is based on torture.81
Noted also by the UN Special Rapporteur on torture, evidence exclusion has a capacity to also
extend to so-called “fruits of a poisonous tree”, i.e. evidence that in itself is acquired through
permissible means, but considered to originate from acts of prohibited ill-treatment.82 Considering
such derivative evidence provides depth, and possibly complexity to evidence exclusion, as it
means that even decisive pieces of evidence that have been obtained lawfully may end up being

excluded, should their “origins” be traced back to torture or other forbidden ill-treatment. Such a
complicated appearance is evident, for example, in the case of Gäfgen, already mentioned in the
introduction chapter. A Grand Chamber judgment, Gäfgen elaborates quite significantly on the
Court’s stance on evidence exclusion. Furthermore, it is a prime example on the intricate nature of
the “fruits of the poisonous tree” doctrine, exemplifying the challenging nuances that the interplay
of articles 3 and 6 of ECHR may invoke. Gäfgen also marks the first time that the Court has
considered the “fruits” doctrine properly, in a structured and comprehensive way.83
As background for Gäfgen, its defendant had committed a series of egregious actions involving a
ransom-seeking kidnap and the subsequent murder of an 11-year-old boy. The defendant had been
apprehended by the police shortly after he had collected the ransom-money he had designated, despite
having also already murdered the boy. Labouring under the impression that the victim could still be
rescued, the police subsequently interrogated the defendant in an aggravated way, which, according
to the Court, amounted to inhuman treatment in violation of ECHR art. 3.84 During the events, the
obtained information had led the police to find the boy’s corpse, ultimately culminating to a life
sentence for the defendant who later challenged the proceedings in the European Court. Despite the
violation on ECHR art. 3, Gäfgen served to prove how the theme of evidence exclusion can take a
complicated appearance even with the accompanying absolutist undertones that the prohibition of illtreatment entail.
In the case, the intel that the police received forcibly by inhuman treatment bore vital significance to
the overall chain of events. As its stance for exclusion of statements obtained against the spirit of
ECHR art. 3, the Court still maintained that no matter how high the probative value a piece of
evidence has, its applicability in criminal proceedings should be absolutely out of the question if such
statements are acquired through torture or other ill-treatment.85 However, the conviction of the
defendant was not actually based on the inappropriately acquired evidence per se. Instead, the
decisive evidence sanctioning the conviction was another confession offered by the defendant, given
later during his trial. In this sense, the events bear slight resemblance to the case of Harutyunyan,
except for the severity of the ill-treatment, considered “merely” as inhuman in Gäfgen. And whilst
the Court, appropriately, declared that a violation of ECHR art. 3 had transpired in the overall events,
it maintained this time that they did not merit a simultaneous violation of ECHR art. 6.

As its reasoning, the Court concluded that the violation of ECHR art. 3 itself ended up having no
material bearing on the final result of the proceedings against the defendant.86 The Court made this
interpretation because it considered that the defendant had confessed to his crime voluntarily due to
his personal feelings of remorse, in circumstances where no issues of ill-treatment were longer
present. This, to be sure, appears to mark another difference in the events when compared to the case
of Harutyunyan. Along with other corroborating evidence in Gäfgen, the Court deemed the voluntary
confession sufficient to convict the perpetrator without pronouncing a violation on a fair trial.87 While
this rationale may well be acceptable, it remains true that the proceedings contained moments where
the advancement of the criminal investigation was the result of evidence secured through inhuman
treatment of the defendant.
Another striking thing in Gäfgen was that the Court adopted a stance where it differentiated between
torture vis-à-vis other inhuman or degrading treatment in terms of their significance. While asserting
that all evidence accrued through means of torture should always, categorically, render a trial unfair,
the same was not necessarily true for evidence acquired through other forms of ill-treatment, as long
as such evidence is not decisive.88 The Court did not see the outcome of the events “flowing” directly
from the tainted evidence, thus resulting only in a violation in the scope of ECHR art. 3. In cases of
ill-treatment not amounting to torture, the Court appears therefore to distinguish between evidence
obtained directly from confessions as opposed to mere “fruits” derived therefrom.89 Interestingly, had
the Court viewed the defendant’s treatment as torture, the outcome of the trial would have been
subject to change, at least according to the logic of the Court. This serves to make the Gäfgen case
intriguing, along with the considerable public interest it has evoked since the Court’s judgment.90
Perhaps troublingly, it also casts doubt on the non-derogable nature of ECHR art. 3 and the absolute
prohibitions it prescribes. The Court has also in later cases maintained this uncategorical stance
pertaining to similar situations, where the considered ill-treatment “falls short” of torture.91
The main issue present in this subchapter is rendered complicated by the interplay between the
comparatively straightforward, nigh universally accepted prohibition of torture and the omnibus
86

Gäfgen v. Germany (2010), para. 183.
Regarding the other corroborating evidence, the Court approved of the admissibility of the on-scene evidence
discovered at the scene, where the perpetrator had taken the victim’s corpse. This, too, seems somewhat problematic, as
the discovery of the scene was, indubitably, a direct result of the police interrogation marred by the violation in ECHR
art. 3. See Maffei – Sonenshein 2012, p. 26.

provision for everyone’s right to a fair trial contained in ECHR. As already indicated, violations on
art. 6 that have simultaneously activated the ambit of ECHR art. 3 have frequently been based upon
an infraction against the defendant’s privilege to not incriminate himself.92 The privilege imposes
various obligations towards state authorities, among them boundaries on the permissible levels of
compulsion they are allowed to utilise against a defendant. For further analysis, notions of fair trial
and self-incrimination need more elaboration. They will, therefore, highlight the following chapter.

3

Privilege against self-incrimination in ECHR art. 6

3.1. The privilege as a general component of fair trial

The European Convention on Human Rights art. 6 is dedicated to the right to a fair trial and is
applicable in proceedings both criminal and civil.93 In the first paragraph, its cornerstone principle
reads:
“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him,
everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and
impartial tribunal established by law.”

This introductory clause alone sprouts a multitude of procedural rights and state obligations. Indeed,
the whole art. 6 is considered an omnibus provision with an immense scope, as well as one with
most invoked violations within the European Court of Human Rights.94 According to the longestablished tradition by the Court, the fundamental notion of fairness also eliminates the possibility
to interpret this core right in a restrictive way.95 Consequently, the idea of a “fair trial” should be
assessed holistically, where individual scrutiny must be afforded to the circumstances of each
particular case. This entails an obligation to consider the fairness of trial proceedings as a whole,
without allowing any single rule outright precedence. At the same time, one ought to acknowledge
the possibility that even specific individual factors may herald decisive outcomes while assessing
the fairness of the “trial”.96 This approach renders “fair trial” into somewhat an elastic construct;
despite its gravity, detecting unequivocally absolute rights or obligations inside the omnibus
contents of ECHR art. 6 is hardly straightforward. This is consistent with globally recognised
human rights standards; absolutist standards prevalently linked to notions such as right to life or
prohibition of torture are not similarly entertained in connection to the right to a fair trial, as a selfstanding right.97

In the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the right to a fair trial (art. 14) is not included in the nonderogable rights listed in art. 4 of the Covenant. The Human Rights Committee has reaffirmed the exclusion, while
emphasising the restraint that states are expected to exercise while derogating from art. 14 in circumstances of public
emergency. The Committee does, however, regard the requirement of competence, independence and impartiality of the
trial tribunal as an absolute one. See HRC GC 32, paras 6, 19.

To convey its core ideals, ECHR art. 6 establishes further procedural rights which doubtlessly
deserve their explicit mentions in the Convention text. Art. 6.2 is dedicated to the presumption of
innocence, i.e. the idea to treat anyone criminally charged as innocent, until proven otherwise.
Appropriately, this paragraph affirms the ideal set forth already in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (UDHR) art. 11.1.98 In addition, art. 6.3 provides certain minimum procedural rights
and state obligations, including the defendant’s right to be informed on charges against him, to
allow for the preparation of his defence, to acquire legal assistance, to examine witnesses and to
receive free interpretation if such is needed.
In contrast, the privilege against self-incrimination fails to make a similar, explicit appearance
within the ECHR. The omission appears, prima facie, somewhat striking. From a procedural
standpoint, an utmost function of the privilege is undoubtedly to promote the equality of arms and
mitigate the substantial disadvantage that the defendant may have against the state.99 Equality of
arms is a core element in of fair trial and is of great importance especially in a criminal setting,
where states’ procedural capabilities could have the means to totally overwhelm those of the
defendant, if left unchecked.100 Protective fair trial guarantees, such as the privilege against selfincrimination, could thus be construed as an important means to apply internationally approved
social ethics, in a procedural law context.101 These factors alone argue heavily for the inclusion of
the privilege into the ambit of the Convention, despite its explicit omission in ECHR art. 6.
What further underscores the curious absence of the privilege within the Convention text is that the
same principle, in contrast, occurs explicitly in several other rights treaties. Arguably the most famous
of these is ICCPR, where art 14.3 succinctly entitles everyone to “[n]ot be compelled to testify against
himself or to confess guilt”. As noted in the introduction, also CAT affords the privilege considerable,
if indirect significance, highlighting its firm status within the UN treaty framework. A more recent
example is the appearance of the privilege in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC),
underscoring its understandable significance even in international criminal law.102
The treaty body for ICCPR, the UN Human Rights Committee, has called the privilege a safeguard
against direct or indirect physical or undue psychological pressure from the investigating authorities
98

The Court has described the principle of equality of arms as requiring that each party at a trial is given a reasonable
opportunity to present their cases in such a way that neither party is placed into a substantial disadvantage against his
opponent. See Dombo Beheer BV v. the Netherlands, ECtHR, 27 October 1993, para. 33, or De Haes and Gijsels v.

on the defendant.103 The Committee’s phrasing appropriately suggests a categorical denunciation of
all forms of physical pressure; conversely, the notion of “undue psychological pressure” appears
vaguer to define and thus more open to interpretation. As has already been discussed, an axiomatic
exclusion of all evidence that has been acquired in violation of the absolute prohibition of illtreatment is relatively simple to justify. What is somewhat more unclear, however, is how HRC
perceives other, “undue” forms of compulsion in connection to evidence admissibility. In its very
first procedurally oriented General Comment, HRC considered that besides the evidence emanating
from ill-treatment where ICCPR art. 7 is violated, even evidence from “any other form of
compulsion is wholly unacceptable” for admittance.104 This notion from the 1980’s has, however,
been later supplanted in a new General Comment (no. 32), where the Committee saddled the term
“compulsion” with an exclusive nexus towards ICCPR art. 7, whilst meanwhile omitting additional
commentary on possible other, lesser forms of compulsion.105
The ambiguity demonstrated by the HRC may suggest that the Committee has not wished to
become bound by needlessly expansive interpretations on the notion of “compulsion”. This could be
reasonable, given the practical need society has for certain compulsive measures (e.g, by the
police), utilised to secure fair administration of justice. Furthermore, as the crux of the issue is not
on the compulsion itself per se, but rather on the evidence acquired through it, the straightforward
ban on all physical pressure is quite a concrete, and sensible, starting point. More specific
commentary on the notion of “undue psychological pressure”, however, remains to be welcomed
from the Committee.
Considering the HRC jurisprudence, it appears evident that material focus on self-incrimination lays
nigh exclusively on its intertwined nature with prohibited forms ill-treatment.106 Similar spirit is
transparent even in, inter alia, the UN Convention Against Torture. As with evidence exclusion, this
link to ill-treatment is of course vital; one should, however, recall that the link hardly exhausts the
substance that violations on the privilege against self-incrimination may entail. A broader scope for
interpretation is ruled out neither by the language of ICCPR art. 7 nor the jurisprudence of HRC
condemning physical and undue psychological pressure directed towards defendants. Mirroring the
idea of pressure, the terminology employed by the European Court of Human Rights has referred to
“improper compulsion” when describing similarly unacceptable practice from state officials.107

Semantically, one could argue that “compulsion” in this context boasts somewhat more concrete
connotations than “pressure”, the HRC counterpart. Furthermore, the European emphasis on the
“improperness” of the compulsion serves to recognise the exigencies of criminal procedure, where
compulsive measures against the defendant may, at times, be inevitable. This theme will be further
revisited below, in chapter 4.2.
On the issue of fair trial, HRC has also provided useful commentary regarding derogations that could
be allowed in the scope of ICCPR art. 14. The Committee has emphasised that while extraordinary
circumstances such as public emergencies may allow for proportional derogations from certain fair
trial provisions, such derogations are impossible when they would circumvent the protection of some
other, non-derogable right.108 Therefore, such derogations remain out of the question when, for
example, they would interfere with the peremptory prohibition of ill-treatment.109 Mutatis mutandis,
this is surely true also while assessing the contents of ECHR art. 6. It bears noting that it is hardly a
futile exercise to reflect the institutional standards of ECHR and ICCPR against one another. While
these rights regimes function independently, the core raison d’être on both makes comparisons quite
appropriate. Furthermore, as ICCPR is ratified by every ECHR member state, parallel interpretation
in shared issues is, obviously, advisable. All ECHR member states also subscribe to the UN
Convention against Torture.110
In the European Convention, the Court has effectively incorporated the privilege as a tenet inseparable
from the core ideals if art. 6.1. Since the 1990’s, the Court has referred to the privilege as a generally
recognised international standard, affording it a place within the very “heart” of ECHR art. 6.111 The
Court has viewed the protection thus received as securing the aims of art. 6 and contributing to
avoiding miscarriages of justice. It has been read as such in parallel with the defendant’s right to
silence under police questioning, a right whose interlinked (indeed, nearby identical) nature with the
privilege against self-incrimination probably requires no further clarification.112 Besides highlighting
the status of the privilege as an internationally recognised standard, the Court has emphasised the
intrinsic link that the privilege has towards the presumption of innocence in ECHR art. 6.2.113 The
link is detectable by considering the burden of proof which, in criminal cases, invariably befalls the

prosecutor; this essentially mirrors the privilege against self-incrimination and stresses that besides
his guilt, the defendant should neither be obligated to proof his own innocence.114
All in all, aided by the Court’s surmounting case law, the incorporation of the privilege into the
framework of ECHR art. 6 has been confirmed beyond any doubt. Despite its omission from the
Convention text, it is hardly unfathomable that the ECHR drafters still intended to incorporate the
privilege within the ethos of ECHR art. 6. It appears that the privilege against self-incrimination
within the ECHR system boasts similarly high institutional standards that the same principle has been
afforded in other prominent international instruments. Thus, the privilege has carved its own niche
within the very nucleus of the ECHR fair trial apparatus. As mentioned in the introduction, the
institutional value of the privilege enjoys considerable global and historical prestige, lending the
principle even further gravity. A testament of this esteem was witnessed during the drafting process
of the Protocol 7 to ECHR (from 1984), when it was deemed unnecessary to incorporate the privilege
into the Protocol, despite its underlying purpose to amend the substantive contents of ECHR art. 6.115
The omission was motivated by the will to ensure that countries wishing to opt out from the Protocol
would be unable to arbitrarily claim immunity from the privilege.116

3.2. Interpreting criminal charges under ECHR

Indicated by its very name, the ratione materiae for the privilege against self-incrimination is
limited to the context of criminal proceedings.117 Therefore, before venturing into case law on how
the European Court has applied the protective mechanisms of the privilege, it is essential to discuss
the preconditions that the Court has deemed necessary for a criminal charge to exist. Prefacing the
matter is worthwhile in order to understand the Court’s own, independent conceptualisation of the
issue, and thus to better understand situations when issues pertaining to self-incrimination may be
assessed in the Court.
ECHR art. 6 contains the notion of “criminal charge” in all its three paragraphs: the foundational
principles in article 6.1 apply for everyone with “criminal charge against him”, while the more

114

116
One operative idea of Protocol 7 was to bring ECHR standards pertaining to fair trial closer to those contained within
ICCPR. It appears noteworthy that the corresponding substantive contents in ICCPR art. 14.3 nonetheless ended up
unincorporated into the Protocol. See Trechsel 2005, p. 361.
117

26

specific rights listed in articles 6.2 and 6.3 are afforded to “[e]veryone charged with a criminal
offence”. Of course, even the term self-incrimination implies sole applicability inside a criminal
law ambit and thus, for the privilege, a utility only towards criminal activity of the defendant. While
semantic emphasis on the word “criminal” is quite apposite, the term also lacks a wholesome
universal definition. Indeed, in the spirit of subsidiarity, the Court itself has determined that ECHR
leaves it up to state parties themselves to designate what constitute criminal offences in their own
jurisdictions.118 As an inescapable flipside, the Court has been forced to create a system to adapt to
the varying interpretations that ECHR states may have on the nature of different types of
malfeasances. Within the whole spectrum of offences that an individual may commit under the
scope of ECHR art. 6, be they “criminal”, “disciplinary”, “regulatory”, or something else, the Court
has taken a very open-ended approach to reconcile whether such an offence can be scrutinised
under ECHR art. 6. With the approach, the Court has also wished to so uphold the compatibility of
different state solutions with the object and purpose of ECHR.119
To this end, the Court has adopted its own, autonomous interpretation to establish whether a defendant
has been criminally charged. Instead of a strictly formalist approach to the word “charge”, the Court
has emphasised a substantive notion thereof. It has viewed as a necessity to consider in casu
procedural realities, and has this way been able to “look behind the appearances”.120 This is useful
from the very outset of the Court’s reasoning process, as the autonomy helps the Court to determine
already the admissibility of potential cases. By autonomous interpretation, the Court may distance
itself from misguided or arbitrary terminology that could risk sidetracking essential issues requiring
the Court’s attention. Further, semantic autonomy helps to facilitate the applicability of ECHR art. 6
so that its scope may also reach proceedings that predate the actual trial, thereby including even the
investigate phases of the procedure.121
Consequently, the Court is not constrained by the different state notions of criminal law or criminal
procedure, enabling the regime of ECHR art. 6 a sufficiently expansive ambit. The Court, therefore,
analyses independently if it considers a person “charged” within the meaning of ECHR art. 6. In the
case of Engel, the Court outlined essential components for this analysis: the classification of the
offence within the domestic legislation, the nature of the offence itself, and the severity of the penalty
that the offence could entail.122 Moreover, it is important to assess the nature of the offence in relation

27

to the nature of the corresponding punitive measures for it. Even only one of these components can
suffice to activate an issue as a criminal charge in the meaning of the Convention.123 To account for
the circumstances of the defendant, the Court has further voiced the prerequisite that the defendant
ought to be “substantially affected” by his current situation.124 Analysing this, the Court ascertains
whether the defendant has been sufficiently at peril of prosecution while being “charged”.125
As an example from the Engel case, the Court has rejected the rationale according to which a criminal
law scope should have been excluded due to the “disciplinary” nature of a military-based offence, in
Dutch jurisdiction. The Court thereby forced the issue under the criminal law scope of ECHR art. 6,
proclaiming that it has jurisdiction to satisfy itself in determining whether offences deemed
“disciplinary” possibly encroach upon the criminal.126 The Court’s reasoning on the case ignored a
provision within the erstwhile Dutch law, where disciplinary offences or sufficiently “trivial” criminal
offences were outside the scope of criminal proceedings.127 Another notable example is the case of
J.B., where the Swiss government claimed that the sui generis nature of a tax-related issue failed to
fulfil necessary criminal law elements to be applicable under ECHR art. 6.128 The overall proceedings
in the case had an administrative backdrop, as the applicant was never cast under any direct criminal
investigation or prosecution.129 Nonetheless, the Court ascertained that the state’s tax authorities had
been in a position to impose the tax-negligent applicant fines whose scope went beyond a mere
pecuniary compensation, and into the sphere of punitive sanction for tax evasion. The penal backdrop
led the Court to determine that the applicant was “criminally charged” in the meaning of ECHR.130
It is important for the Court to have developed an unconstrained way to approach cases where doubts
could be raised regarding their applicability under the scope of ECHR art. 6. Fuelled by the Court’s
autonomous criteria, the above examples show that the Court has utilised a rather pragmatic approach
towards criminal charges. It should, however, be noted that the sometimes elusive notion of “charge”
has not, in the bigger picture, complicated the dogmatic understanding on ECHR art. 6 in any
significant way. A vast majority of cases pertaining to the existence of criminal charges have usually
been unproblematic to categorise during the Court’s history.131 This is because both domestic
legislations and European human rights law have usually had quite a compatible notion in classifying

acts as “criminal”. Trechsel has argued that, for these reasons, the importance of such distinctions
should not be overstated.132 Nonetheless, the Court’s autonomous interpretation on criminal charges
is an elegant example of the sophistication which the Court utilises to reconcile legal notions that are
understood universally, but not homogeneously. Other autonomous notions created that the Court has
created during its history include notions such as “home” and “family”.133

3.3. The privilege within the Court’s developing case law

As mentioned, the Court has afforded the privilege against self-incrimination a pivotal place in the
framework of ECHR art. 6, at the “heart of the notion of fair procedure”.134 Therefore, one could say
that the privilege contributes significantly to securing the aims of fair trial in the Convention. The
privilege highlights the defendant’s individual autonomy by precluding the possibility to utilise
against him any evidence that has accrued in defiance of his will by methods of coercion or
oppression.135 The Court has stated that the applicability of the privilege is independent of the scale
of the criminal proceedings: it applies, without distinction, from the simplest of offences to the most
complex.136 Temporally, the Court has indicated that the defendant’s right to silence is activated from
the moment of first police questioning.137 While the scope for “right to silence” may be slightly
narrower than the whole privilege against self-incrimination, it is hardly unreasonable to extend this
temporal scope for the privilege in its entirety.
The case of Funke from 1993 is a foundational event for the privilege within the Court’s praxis.138
While unlayered with extensive analytical depth, it nonetheless helped to establish concrete substance
to the topic and, in a way, elevate it beyond synonymity with the right to silence. In the case, state
officials had ordered the defendant to hand over statements from suspected bank accounts he had
abroad, under pain of penalty based on French customs law. Having refused to provide evidence on
his alleged offences this way, the defendant was issued monetary penalties and fines, including ones
that incurred per diem with the aim to force him to hand the statements over. The Court disapproved
of this coercive and punitive approach and called a violation of ECHR art. 6, showcasing that the

protective reach of the privilege may span beyond verbal self-incrimination.139 The Court further
highlighted that no “special features” of the case (due to its customs law implications) could justify
any deviations from the scope of ECHR art. 6, as the defendant was deemed charged as per the
autonomous interpretation of the Court.140 Besides confirming that self-incriminatory documents
belong under the scope of the privilege, Funke paved the way for future verdicts where the theoretical
framework behind self-incrimination attained better sophistication.
A subsequent hallmark case where the Court approached self-incrimination with better dogmatic
depth was Saunders, taken in Grand Chamber.141 The case considered the utilisation of information
which initially was collected by compulsive (and lawful) means, but then was subsequently used in
criminal proceedings against the defendant. Thereby, the defendant was at that stage no longer able
to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination. To clarify, the defendant, as the chief executive of
Guinness plc, had been legally obligated to provide authorities information during a stock market
inspection, and this information was later used against the applicant himself in quite high-profile
criminal proceedings. The British government justified the usage of the statements by maintaining
that they contained no directly incriminating statements and were, therefore, applicable as material
evidence. In the Court’s view, however, it was irrelevant to ascertain whether the obtained statements
were directly incriminating; they could, nevertheless, still be deployed in criminal proceedings in
support of the prosecution.142 Consequently, what the Court deemed most essential was “the use to
which evidence obtained under compulsion is put in the course of the criminal trial”.143 In this
instance, the usage led to violation of ECHR art. 6.
In J.B., the Court found that the applicant’s privilege against self-incrimination was violated after he
had been fined administratively for his lack of compliance, having failed to produce the state a
requested piece of tax information that was possibly self-incriminating.144 Deliberating on the
applicant’s omission, the Court concluded it sufficient that the applicant could not exclude the
possibility that the submitted information may later be used in tax evasion proceedings against him,
thereby finding that the imposed fines violated his right to not incriminate himself.145 Interestingly, it
never was established whether the required documents, had the applicant produced them, even would

have contained incriminating information on tax evasion. Evidently, the mere jeopardy for selfincrimination was enough to activate the applicant’s right to rely upon the privilege and forgo
submitting the requested documents to the state.146 This type of protection against such “hidden”
criminal charges indicates a high institutional esteem that the Court holds for the privilege. Indeed,
the rationale in J.B. argues that the robustness of this ex ante protection should not be undermined
even despite the existence of an exclusionary rule, i.e. the procedural tool with ability to tackle
wrongfully obtained evidence even after the fact.
Another noteworthy example in the development of the privilege is the case of Heaney and
McGuinness.147 Mirroring Saunders, the case was likewise saddled with a high public profile, relating
to events during the Northern Ireland conflict and the applicants being members of a criminalised
terrorist faction of IRA. As in Saunders, the applicants had initially not received formal charges
against them.148 They had been questioned, however, about offences on terrorism and had been
prompted to provide accounts on their movements, in relation to a bombing incident under
investigation. The applicants chose to not comply, which led to their imprisonment with a 6-month
sentence based on the erstwhile Offences against the State Act. Consistent with its previous approach,
the Court agreed that the defendants had not been obligated to provide the Irish authorities accounts
on their whereabouts and concluded that the compulsive element imposed upon the defendants
effectively destroyed the essence of their privilege against self-incrimination.149 This, essentially,
rendered ineffective the Section 52 of the Offences against the State Act, which stipulated that a
detained person was, upon questioning, obligated to provide a full account of his movements and
actions if he was under suspicion of certain treasonous offences. The Court’s finding further
underlines that even very considerable public interest considerations cannot set aside the protections
provided by the privilege.
The case of Jalloh, introduced above in chapter 2.3, provides further angle on the discussion
pertaining to compulsive methods employed by police. As already discussed in terms of prohibited
ill-treatment, the Court took special note of the excessive degree of force utilised to secure the
evidence. While the Court had previously, in Saunders, conceded that the privilege against selfincrimination does not extend to (for example, medical) evidence that exists outside the “will of the
accused” (see below, in 4.2), it viewed the extraction method in Jalloh as excessive.150 Besides paying

attention to the defendant’s physical safety, the Court also noted that the forcible methods utilised
upon the defendant were disproportionate in relation to the scope of the alleged offence.151 On top of
the health risks, the Court took note of the level of humiliation that the procedure had posed towards
the defendant. Compounded, these factors broke the defendant’s privilege in the Court’s estimation,
amounting to a violation of ECHR art. 6. Indeed, the overall events, deemed by the Court to be
“verging on brutality”, also activated a violation on the prohibition of inhuman and degrading
treatment, as per ECHR art. 3.152

applied) had even led to two fatalities in Germany. See Jalloh v. Germany (2006), para 46.

Perspectives on waiving the privilege

4.1. Parameters and absolute notions

As mentioned, ECHR art. 3 is an absolute and non-derogable provision that casts interpretative issues
around it into a straightforward light, at least when compared to the substantive sprawl of ECHR art.
6. However, the Court has engaged, at least cursorily, in analysing whether also the privilege against
self-incrimination itself could be understood as an absolute right. To be sure, issuing absolutist scope
to any ordinance is a weighty proposition; in this instance, the topic is complex already thanks to the
multifaceted nature of “self-incrimination”.153 Prima facie, it appears that the only clear situation
where absolutist undertones may be attributed to the privilege is when violations thereagainst are
linked to torture or other prohibited ill-treatment. As showcased by Gäfgen, however, even then the
topic may contain elements where categorical absoluteness becomes difficult to ascertain (see 2.3,
above).
Pertaining to the case of Saunders, Trechsel argues that absolutist tones were detectable in the case’s
reasoning process.154 This was because the Court, in the case, purposefully ignored whether the
wrongfully elicited self-incrimination had actually contributed to the defendant’s conviction; instead,
the Court emphasised that it merely could have contributed to the conviction. Nonetheless, the Court
has stated that it finds unnecessary to “decide whether the right not to incriminate oneself is absolute
or whether infringements of it may be justified in particular circumstances”. 155 In light of the full
scope of the right to a fair trial, this approach surely appears prudent. Showcasing consistency, the
Court has on several occasions strived to highlight that the tenets of ECHR art. 6 should remain
unsaddled with any singular, unvarying rules.156 In spite of this, it could well be that the Court’s
practice may yet provide absolutist depth to certain component-like aspects included within the
protective ambit of the privilege. So far, such absolute components seem to lack sufficient
confirmation.
Another such component-like example could be detected in the Court’s strict approach pertaining to
public interest considerations. This is visible in the Court’s consistent reminding that the privilege
153

Compare this, e.g., to the absolutist ordinance “prohibition of torture”, where the object, purpose and even the
semantic meaning are considerably easier to grasp.

applies in all kinds of criminal cases without distinction and by proclaiming that “public interest
considerations cannot be invoked to justify the use of answers compulsorily obtained”.157 However,
assuming no oversight pertaining the public interest considerations voiced in connection to Jalloh
(see below), the Court appears to have left the door ajar even considering the effect of public interest
considerations towards the privilege. Scrutinising the privilege’s possible “absoluteness” is therefore
best limited to its component parts, exemplified by the way the Court has preferred to afford the
privilege applicability irrespective of the probative value of the self-incriminatory evidence, or the
pressure to rely upon such evidence brought forth by public interests. Such issues, in addition to its
interconnectivity to ECHR art. 3, could entail partially absolutist undertones for the privilege. When
considering the whole privilege as a legal monolith, however, jurisprudence shows that absolutist
assertions are imprudent.158 Fairness of the proceedings, similarly discussed in relation to evidence
exclusion, is undeniably the more optimal point of departure also in terms of self-incrimination, and
its implications for the defendant.
With the maturation of its case law, the Court has accordingly begun to delineate a test to help in
determining violations on the privilege. Generally, the test has comprised of three components.159
Firstly, the Court draws focus on the nature and degree of compulsion used to obtain the evidence
from the defendant. This first component prudently signals the cognisance that the Court has on the
interconnectivity between the privilege and the prohibition of ill-treatment. Secondly, the Court has
scrutinised the relevant safeguards that the defendant has been able to avail himself of during the
procedure. An obvious example of such safeguards is the defendant’s access to legal counsel during
the proceedings.160 With the third component, mentioned already in Saunders, the Court has analysed
the use to which the obtained evidence has been put during the criminal procedure.
Specifically, the whole test appears to be designed for ascertaining whether procedural failures may
lead to the destruction of the “essence” of the privilege against self-incrimination, thus meriting in a
violation of ECHR art. 6. This central notion of the privilege’s essence came about in the case of John
Murray, rather soon after the trailblazing case of Funke.161 Undoubtedly, such a notion provides a
157

Saunders v. United Kingdom (1996), para. 74. See also Choo 2013, p. 62–63.
The Court has, in John Murray v. United Kingdom (1996) even stated directly that a defendant’s right to silence may
not be considered absolute. Indeed, this seems a safe assertion also from a logical standpoint, as the Court considered in
the case the evidential value of the defendant’s silence itself. See para. 46.
159
As an early example thereof, the Court’s reasoning behind Heaney and McGuinness (2000) accounts for the test in a
piecemeal way, its components detectable in paras. 53-55. Subsequently, the test begun appearing in its more cohesive
form. See for example Allan v. United Kingdom (2002), para. 44, Jalloh v. Germany (2006), para. 117 and O’Halloran
and Francis v. United Kingdom (2007), para. 55.

See Allan v. United Kingdom (2002), para. 52.

upon the defendant, which it considered insufficiently severe to find a violation of the privilege. The yardstick in this
158

34

useful way to conduct proportionality analysis on the significance of self-incrimination within
individual cases; it also, once again, reminds of the holistic fairness assessment behind the whole
ECHR art. 6. That the Court has at all engaged in the creation of such a test indicates a stark call for
case-by-case determination in cases regarding self-incrimination. Without a doubt, also the notion of
the privilege’s “essence” should be subject to circumstances and facts in casu.162
Perplexingly, the Jalloh case saw the Court making a minor deviation to the test above, as it appeared
to list an additional element therein. Namely, the Court mentioned “the weight of the public interest
in the investigation and punishment of the offence in issue” as an additional factor to consider in
determining whether a violation of the privilege had occurred.163 This appears to run contrary to ideals
set forth above (e.g., in the case of Heaney and McGuinness), where the weight of public interests
should not affect the defendant’s right to refrain from self-incrimination. To be sure, one may argue
that the public interest considerations in Jalloh were minimal, in contrast to Heaney and McGuinness
as well as Saunders. Indeed, this insignificant nature probably, in this instance, aided the defendant
in pleading his case, instead of harming him. Unfortunately, the Court failed to provide theoretical
clarity on whether it may generally opt for a reversed stance with public interest considerations in
situations when they would serve to benefit the defendant during the procedure. In a later reference
to this same point, the Court framed the issue of public interests as something that ought to be assessed
in the overall context of fair trial, thus not just pertaining to self-incrimination.164 If this indeed was
the Court’s intention in Jalloh, the additional parameter to the test could be more easily palatable.
Speaking of different types of situations where the essence of the privilege has been destroyed, one
can deduce different scenario types which may violate the privilege. One scenario pertains to
sanctions (or the looming threat thereof) which will befall the defendant should he refuse to
incriminate himself, as was the case in Saunders, Heaney and McGuinness, among others. Another
scenario, exemplified by Jalloh and Gäfgen, is one where evidence is obtained by disproportionate
physical or psychological pressure towards the defendant. A third scenario, thus far unmentioned,
connects to entrapment. This was exemplified in the case of Allan, where the police had obtained
incriminating information from the defendant via persistent inquiries and subterfuge by installing an
undercover police officer into the same custody cell with the defendant.165 Notably, this was done

comparison was the predecessor case of Funke from 1993, where the enacted compulsion had indeed destroyed the
essence of the privilege.
162
See O’Halloran and Francis (2007), para. 53, where the Court roundly rejects the idea that any direct form of
compulsion should automatically amount to a violation of the privilege.

despite the adamant persistence of the defendant to rely upon his right to silence under police
questioning. Also herein, the overall circumstances thus violated the essence of privilege and ECHR
art. 6. As common denominators, one could well assert that every one of these three scenario types
pertain to some form of compulsive element, rendering the Court-cultivated term “improper
compulsion” apt while ascertaining root causes for violations of different kinds on the privilege.

4.2. Procedural exigencies and compulsion

The privilege in itself highlights the defendant’s own agency. Despite this, this agency remains
inescapably entangled with the web of criminal procedure, where the state is another inevitable, active
party. Criminal investigations and trials, moreover, are frequently events that defendants are both
unfamiliar and uncomfortable with. Therefore, decisions or statements made in such a setting are
liable to be ill-considered, inadvertent, or otherwise unreflective of the defendant’s decision-making
in regular circumstances. While probably not tailored to arbitrarily “regularise” the defendant’s
position, human rights surely demand that this compromised situation is notwithstanding considered.
This surely helps in assessing the overall fairness of the proceedings in situations where the defendant
has, willingly or otherwise, incriminated himself. Thereby, better understanding is needed when
assessing the validity of situations when someone waives his own rights, such as the privilege against
self-incrimination.
Several factors serve to complicate the scrutiny around self-incrimination. Virtually everywhere,
criminal procedure packs plentiful legislation, designed to somehow protect everybody’s interests
during the procedure, be they the interests of the defendant, the victim, the state, or the taxpayer.
Indeed, while the defendant is afforded several important rights which to rely upon, other interests
simultaneously tip the scales towards the rights of others such as, for example, those of the victim.
Thus, the full criminal procedure is a tightrope not only from a legislative point of view, but also from
a human rights perspective. This is what renders the topic of “improper compulsion” rather intricate.
To frame physical compulsion into very general terms, the Court has stated that the use of force may
be permissible by agents of a state.166 Circumstances when this may occur must be well-defined and
the utilised force must be indispensable and not excessive. Moreover, such force must adhere to a
strict test of proportionality, where consideration must be given to the overall circumstances as well

166

Rainey et al. 2017, p. 199.

36

as the injuries inflicted upon the individual.167 It is worthwhile to recall that criminal proceedings are
not devoid of such means which can only be characterised as compulsory, while yet still in full
compliance with international human rights standards. Furthermore, such compulsion may take many
different forms, only some of them containing a physical component.
A commonplace example worth mentioning is that the defendant cannot remain anonymous during
the proceedings against him; consequently, he is usually compelled to reveal his identity under the
pain of sanctions. Whilst providing one’s own name to state authorities is undoubtedly conducive to
“helping” the state to prosecute someone who would prefer to remain anonymous, this deviation from
the right to silence is widely accepted in international law.168 Moreover, pertaining to acquisition of
real evidence, the Court has since Saunders recognised that all evidence obtained from the accused
pursuant to warrants, blood samples, DNA testing or other such legal means falls outside the scope
of the privilege against self-incrimination.169 The clarification importantly serves to remind of the
nexus that the privilege must have with the will of the defendant himself. Such “non-testimonial”
evidence could surely arise also in situations when a person has a duty to produce documents or other
information by law.170 As witnessed by Saunders and J. B., however, such evidence at least may run
the risk of becoming contested as violating the spirit of the privilege.
Refraining from self-incrimination by remaining decidedly mute may be preferable for a defendant
who wishes to avoid giving inadvertent statements that end up harming him. The Court has shown,
however, that relying upon the right to silence may have evidential value in itself. John Murray, also
taken a Grand Chamber, was a key case where the Court had to decide whether it could be acceptable
to draw incriminatory inferences from the defendant’s silence in such a way.171 In the case, the
defendant had systematically refrained from answering the questions that police and prosecution had
put to him. During the trial, which led to a prison sentence, the domestic judge had relied upon the
defendant’s silence as a supporting element in his conviction.172 It was the Court’s view, however,
that no violation of ECHR article 6 had transpired for this reason. The main rationale was that the
silence in question had no decisive effect in the proceedings; therefore, the Court viewed that other,
accompanying evidence alone proved sufficient to convict the defendant. Accordingly, the Court

emphasised that it would be unacceptable to employ silence as the deciding factor in anyone’s
conviction, as such a decision would inevitably trigger a violation under ECHR art. 6.173 The Court
has, subsequently, also engaged in counterbalancing decisions in this regard, by calling for due
respect that should be afforded to people electing to remain silent. A reason for this has perhaps been
to avoid disproportionate emphasis on the precedent set by John Murray.174
In spite of the outcome, it was clear that the defendant in John Murray was subjected to a certain
level of procedural compulsion. Indeed, having suffered through the regular psychological pressure
that criminal prosecutions themselves entail, staying decidedly silent under such pressure certainly
presents its own discomforts. Commenting on the case as amicus curiae, the Amnesty International
opined that using silence as leverage against the defendant essentially has the effect of shifting the
burden of proof away from the prosecution, towards the defendant himself.175 The universal nature
of this problem is quite easy to grasp for anyone facing pressures of police interrogation. This is also
what serves to make any evidential value of the defendant’s silence somewhat problematic.
At the same time, if it remains guaranteed that inferences from silence cannot be relied upon in any
exclusive or decisive manner, an argument could be made that the compulsion present in John Murray
fell short of destroying the “essence” of the privilege against self-incrimination.176 Within the
parameters of the Court’s test, such a contention could probably be supported. Herein, specifically
one of the factors of the test, i.e. the use to which the evidence was put, appeared quite essential: it
was specifically the lack of decisiveness of the defendant’s silence that helped to maintain the integrity
of the privilege, as a whole. Further relating to the degree of compulsion on the case, the Court also
noted that the defendant remained capable of upholding his silence throughout the proceedings.177
As with its HRC counterpart “undue pressure”, many factors make it difficult to pinpoint exact
parameters to the Court’s idea of “improper compulsion”. Trechsel posits that this question appears
equally elusive in reverse; characterising rights-based limits for “proper” compulsion remains entirely
unclear as well.178 To be sure, certain characteristics on the issue are somewhat obvious. As already
indicated, compulsive means may easily be deemed improper should they violate the peremptory

Jackson et al. 2012, p. 262. As example, see Averill v. United Kingdom, ECtHR, 6 June 2000. In the case, the Court
thought that the accused person’s silence was sufficiently motivated (and thus merited no inferences to be drawn) by his
assertion that he wishes to speak to a lawyer prior to answering any questions. See para. 49.
175

infringe the principle of the presumption of innocence”. See para. 54.

prohibition of torture. The threshold of ill-treatment, however, is hardly always the sole line of
demarcation one must consider. Therefore, further clarity on the issue is to be welcomed. The Court
has, after all, repeatedly indicated that compulsion which falls short of “proper” is the premier
contributor to violating the “essence” of the privilege against self-incrimination, and thereby also
ECHR art. 6.179 Mostly, the issue continues resting upon an in casu foundation, reliant on the
parameters of the Court’s test, whose substantive development may still be ongoing.
During his prosecution, the defendant may find it arduous to rely upon, or even be aware of, his rights
to procedural protection. Consequently, tremendous relevance should be afforded to a classic dogma
derived from the case of Airey, where the Court highlighted the need for practical and effective means
to uphold the integrity of all the Convention rights, in order to guarantee that their protective
mechanisms are not merely theoretical or illusory.180 The Court has voiced this opinion in connection
to the defendant’s right to legal representation, stressing that the defendant is not only entitled to legal
counsel, but also to be properly notified about this right, along with the accompanying right to refrain
from incriminating oneself.181 Firstly, this opinion, from the Grand Chamber case of Ibrahim,
arguably sets standards for a European variant of “mirandasation”, i.e. the procedure where an
individual is primed on his rights as a defendant, including his subjective right to an attorney.182 To
realise the privilege in the “practical and effective” spirit of the Convention, such notification could
well be seen as a procedural minimum standard. It has been viewed as such even in the face of the
relatively commonplace opposition thereto by police or prosecution authorities, who may sometimes
view mirandasing as a hindrance to reach swift solutions to their cases. 183 Secondly, the defendant’s
right to legal counsel has pivotal bearing on his capability to make informed decisions pertaining to
his procedural rights. This including counselling on whether he wishes to voluntarily waive these
rights.

4.3. Waiving rights

4.3.1.

Why waivers matter?

Whereas human rights translate into an abundance of obligations towards states, the very term rights
clearly denotes agency, even freedom, when it comes to individuals. To an extent, this entails a
possibility to relinquish, i.e. waive protections afforded to people via human rights, including
procedural rights. Designed, in part, to protect the defendant from improperly solicited testimonials,
also the raison d’être of the privilege against self-incrimination signifies the defendant’s own volition
and autonomy, when deciding on the extent of his cooperation during the proceedings against him.
However, such autonomy is conducive to a significant problem: how can a layman, during criminal
proceedings, know what course of action is eventually the most beneficial, or the least harmful, to
him? The problem could surely exist along any procedural right, but is rendered especially striking
with the privilege, thanks to the apparent complexity it could evoke.184 Muddying the waters even
further, pre-trial authorities can have several lawful means at their disposal to exert influence on the
defendant. These may range from vague, psychology-laden impositions à la “let us help to help you”
to concrete plea bargaining, where the prosecution pledges to seek a reduced sentence in court, in
exchange for the defendant’s confession or other cooperation.
To uphold relevant procedural safeguards available to him, the significance of the defendant’s right
to legal counsel remains therefore paramount. Not only may a legal representative monitor that state
authorities continue to uphold respect towards procedural law and the human rights of the defendant,
but a lawyer may also offer consultation to his client who might otherwise struggle to make an
informed decision about waiving his rights. Self-inflicted harm from self-incrimination may, after all,
prove challenging to repair afterwards if the defendant himself has originally consented to waive
away his privilege, regardless how ill-informed he may have been. The question of a waiver,
indubitably, reaches the very core of self-incrimination and may, therefore, wind up as an existential
dilemma for the entire privilege.
Consequently, it is vital to discuss how a human rights discourse tackles the question of voluntary
waivers in which individuals relinquish their own fundamental rights. To be sure, the question is a
vast one, inviting extensive discourse in theories both legal and political. The notion is therefore
184

Trechsel characterises the privilege as ”certainly one of the most complex guarantees in the entire body of
fundamental rights applicable in the context of criminal proceedings”. See Trechsel 2005, p. 341.

40

assessed only in scope for this thesis, in an ECHR context. Therein, it bears noting that the question
of human rights waivers should usually be separated from ECHR art. 17, which prohibits the
downright “abuse of rights” by interpretations that have a destructive or inappropriately limiting
effect toward substantive rights within the Convention.185

4.3.2.

Personal autonomy

Personal autonomy and self-determination are close, if not synonymous concepts in universal human
rights ethos, and embedded also in ECHR.186 In the Court’s case law, these notions are frequently
connected to an individual’s ability to conduct his life in a manner he chooses.187 Such autonomy, to
be sure, comes with certain caveats. Firstly, it entails an inbuilt respect for the autonomy of others;
infractions against the rights of others, and perhaps by vague extension, against public morals, are
not afforded respect in international human rights.188 Secondly, one should recall that human beings
rarely live in a vacuum where their personal autonomy is totally unaffected by surrounding interests,
whether they belong to other people, the state, or anything in the between. For this reason, rights
waivers must be assessed also in terms of the free and uncoerced consent of the individual, including
appropriate consideration towards such individual’s vulnerability and other such relevant factors.189
Indeed, a prime example of an “invalid” form of waiver forms when doubts are cast over the true
consent of its giver. Aall has opined that while waivers should ordinarily be afforded relevancy, they
may not always be decisive.190 Doubtlessly, direct or categorical answers on the “waivability” of
different kinds of rights are few and far between. Nonetheless, one could posit that ECHR does in
fact contain a substantive notion which is unwaivable in absolute terms: equality.191 This is because
human rights are, at their moral foundation, equally applicable to everyone. Such indiscriminatory
ethos is echoed also in the ideal on personal autonomy, which contains the injunction to also respect
the autonomy of others. Equality, furthermore, provides a bedrock for other fundamental values that
the Court frequently refers to, such as “dignity”, “democratic society” and “right to liberty”.192

Rights that are ordinarily considered absolute, such as those in ECHR art. 3, of course invite one into
a legal and moral discourse in terms of their waivability. Indeed, the question may even bring forth a
collision between two colossal notions of international human rights law: absolute rights and the selfdetermination of every individual. As Aall has indicated, personal autonomy may well cause
situations where even absolute rights end up waived by an individual, in a justifiable way.193 As
hypothetical example, one could mention medical operations that would exceed the bounds of
inhuman treatment if enacted upon an individual without his consent, but which may contrarily be
rendered permissible by a (properly scrutinised) approval received from this individual. Such
considerations invite one even deeper into the issue, indeed, to consider the very utility of
“absoluteness” in a human rights context, an issue best kept outside the scope of this work.
Indubitably, absoluteness still serves its purpose in many an arena, for example by precluding
unilateral state interferences with these inalienable rights.194
For the term to make any logical sense, personal autonomy surely also forms a basis for an individual
to refrain from his protection of human rights, if he so desires. Indeed, due to a positive obligation to
protect the self-determination of individuals, a state incurs even duties to protect such choices of
individuals, including ones where individuals actively renounce their rights.195 As witnessed by above
caveats, international law does nonetheless recognise qualifications around the freedom to waive
one’s rights. In ECHR, the Court has therefore engaged to analyse whether specific waivers of rights
may be “permissible”.196 However, instead of focusing merely on the substantive anchoring of
different rights or notions such as absoluteness, a waiver’s applicability has ordinarily been governed
by things such as the waiver’s unequivocal nature, among others.

4.3.3.

Considering procedural waivers and self-incrimination

In practice, the European Court routinely accepts waivers of different kinds in its case law. Procedural
rights in ECHR art. 6 are among those where such waivers have occurred most frequently, along with
waivers pertaining to freedoms covered by articles 8–11 in the Convention.197 Under the auspices of
criminal trial, the Court has maintained that neither the letter nor the spirit of the Convention prevent

the defendant from waiving his rights under ECHR art. 6.198 While affording a relatively long leash,
the Court has nonetheless offered stipulations which should discourage overtly libertarian
interpretations on the prospects of waiving one’s fair trial guarantees.199 Applied prominently in
relation to ECHR art. 6, the Court’s surmounting praxis on the issue has become referred to, by the
Court itself, as the doctrine of a “knowing and intelligent waiver”.200
For example, the Grand Chamber case of Sejdovic saw the Court considering a situation where the
defendant was convicted in absentia, and thus whether his status as a fugitive could be construed as
a valid waiver from his right to be present at his trial. While not outright dismissing the possibility
that such implicit waivers could be valid, the Court nonetheless stressed that a mere fugitive status
provided clearly insufficient basis to consider the situation as a valid waiver. This was especially
since the state had been unable to even notify the defendant properly about the proceedings against
him.201 Accordingly, the Court also stated that the defendant in such a situation should have been able
to reasonably foresee what the consequences of his conduct would be. Such foreseeability should thus
have been demonstrated in the European Court.202 Other instances where the Court has employed
similar standards have, inter alia, pertained to waivers to examine witnesses during his trial or the
right to legal counsel.203 The latter example was touched upon also in the Ibrahim case (see chapter
4.2, above), where a sufficiently “knowing and intelligent waiver” from the right to lawyer was
deemed as a prerequisite for upholding necessary standards for the defendant’s right to silence and
his privilege against self-incrimination.204
Demonstrably, the Court has shown aptitude in providing stipulations to satisfy itself on the validity
of waivers, when considered necessary. Generally, the Court therefore appears to require a sufficient
level of quality for waivers to consider them valid. Prudent stipulations thereon have appeared in its
case law since the 1990s, where the Court has crucially stated that a waiver must be given in an
unequivocal manner, either explicitly or tacitly.205 Determining such unequivocalness may sometimes
require additional scrutiny pertaining to the defendant’s comprehension on his legal situation. Indeed,
such knowledge ought not to be automatically presupposed, especially with tacit waivers.206 In case

of passive defendants, inferring waivers should invoke a reasonability test where the circumstances
around the alleged waiver require proper ascertaining.207 The Court has, moreover, stated that the
waiver should not run counter to any “important public interests”.208
In criminal procedure, the defendant may face conundrums while electing to accept a shortened,
summary procedure whereby he accepts an outcome (often, a reduced punishment) to expedite the
proceedings against him, or when he wishes to enter into a plea-bargaining agreement with the
prosecution. Indeed, in terms of waivers, these instances signify situations where the defendant
relinquishes his right to a full trial. While ascertaining merits and validity of waivers in such
situations, they undoubtedly warrant a heightened level of scrutiny.209 The juxtaposition that the
defendant has against the public authorities (indeed, the state) is by its nature quite different than one
emerging in a horizontal legal relationship between private individuals. Thereby, the validity of rights
waivers should also meet tighter criteria. Indeed, as self-incrimination may invoke walking the fine
line between a defendant’s voluntary waiver and improper compulsion from the state, finding a
balance between these notions could prove a delicate exercise.
With situations giving rise to summary procedures or plea bargaining, the Court has stated that a
defendant may always expect the state to act in good faith towards the defendant and take into due
account the procedural choices made by the defence.210 In the case of Scoppola, the Court expounded
upon the notion of good faith by stating that when expedited procedures are employed, the advantages
attached to them should not be subsequently deprived from the defendant by arbitrary means. 211 In
another Italian case, the Court found accordingly that no violations transpired in the summary
proceedings against defendants who had been unable to question witnesses during their proceedings
due to their previous, informed (and thereby, valid) consent to the summary proceedings.212 Similarly
with plea bargaining, the Court has stipulated that such agreements may only be entered into when
the defendant is completely aware of the significance and the repercussions of the agreement, and
that such an agreement occurs on a genuinely voluntary basis, with sufficient judicial review attached

proper safeguards due to the defendant, his right to legal counsel high among them.
Abounding in this work, the element of state compulsion needs addressing also from the standpoint
of human rights waivers. To be sure, when discussing torture or other ill-treatment prohibited in
ECHR art. 3, it takes little effort to concede that waivers obtained by such methods are prone to
invalidity without a second thought. This can of course be attributed to the absoluteness of the
prohibition, but the rationale is perhaps even better explained by the overarching requirements that
the Court has provided for the validity of waivers, in general. After all, ill-treatment is rather easy to
frame as an emphatically antagonistic concept against notions such as personal autonomy,
unequivocal consent, or public interests. Such an infringement upon a defendant’s will easily
extinguish his capacity for genuine waivers. For this reason, Aall has argued that even less grave
methods that have the pellucid purpose of extracting a confession, e.g. by detention conditions
characterised by prolonged isolation, should have a similarly nullifying effect towards validity of
procedural waivers received from a defendant.214 Such an interpretation, obviously, serves to also
highlight the institutional strength of the privilege against self-incrimination.
In a way, the privilege against self-incrimination could well be viewed as a mannequin for the whole
concept of rights waivers. After a fashion, the function of the privilege is to remind defendants that
they have a procedural right to abstain from witnessing against themselves. Indeed, such a specific
reminder is quite justifiable in a situation where the active participation of the defendant, for example
through volunteered confessions, would actually signify forgoing a portion of one’s protective
rights.215 Meanwhile, the principle also contains the inbuilt respect for personal autonomy in an
inverse meaning; be it remorse, contrition, or any other reason, it also permits the defendant to assist
state authorities in his own prosecution, if he so desires. This, surely, is partly why the principle has
been afforded its particular moniker, privilege. The significance of this specific waiver against selfincrimination stems from a plethora of considerations. These include the notions of prohibited illtreatment and other forms of improper compulsion that could compromise the fairness of individual
criminal proceedings. Furthermore, the topic also ties in the concepts of evidence exclusion and
admissibility, another procedural aspect that bears significance also in a human rights discourse.

One could add that the privilege serves its purpose also as a reassurance of sorts, by reminding that the lack of the
defendant’s cooperation in itself will not exacerbate his situation during the criminal proceedings.

Consequently, circumstances where such waivers may be given must be afforded a profound
significance also from a human rights standpoint.

Approaches to ECHR art. 3 and absoluteness

5.1. The principle of subsidiarity in ECHR

As is evident from above, the absolute nature of ECHR art. 3 has a great capacity to also affect the
exigencies of criminal procedure, thereby lending the prohibition’s sphere of influence even deep
into the substance of ECHR art. 6. This warrants further consideration on the dogma of the
prohibition’s absoluteness, especially in the way it should be perceived in relation to this work. As
this work has, predominantly, revolved around state obligations pertaining specifically to ECHR,
there may be practical utility to assess how the absoluteness manifests itself when approached from
specific vantages.
The discourse of state obligations is inevitably characterised by the inherent tension between state
sovereignty and binding international obligations, which both have the capacity to create applicable
law. Understandably, such a tension may take different shapes, depending on legal, moral, political,
or other ramifications that different issues irradiate. The gravity of the legal principles at stake
undeniably has its own effect as well. The framework of ECHR, along with many others, has
addressed this tension by prominent references to the principle of subsidiarity, which signifies that
the primary responsibility for decisions pertaining to human rights violations remains at the hands
of the states themselves.216
Subsidiarity thereby entails, inter alia, that the Court avoids intervening in right based
considerations and decisions based thereupon by national authorities. In the case of such
intervention, it further indicates that uniform and rigorous criteria should be applied while the Court
considers the jurisdiction and admissibility of the cases brought thereto.217 The reason behind the
idea of subsidiarity is practical: states are better situated to assess human rights questions based on
local needs and conditions, compared to an international court such as the European Court of
Human Rights.218 To be sure, the notion also involves an inbuilt respect for democracy and the
differing legislative mechanisms this democracy entails among different Convention states.
Nonetheless, in spite of its prestige, the principle of subsidiarity obviously affords no complete

carte blanche by which the states could freely choose their methods by which to apply the rights
mandated in the ECHR framework.
In the Convention, the notion of subsidiarity has formed a part of its primary law for a quite short
period of time. Indeed, its treaty-level endorsement has materialised only recently, as the principle
was amended to the preamble of ECHR via Protocol 15, which entered into force in August 2021.219
Despite this, the principle has been implicitly present via the Court’s jurisprudence since the 1960s,
achieving a prominent status in the Court’s praxis early on.220 It should be noted, however, that the
concept boasts no universally understood meaning, in ECHR or elsewhere. Rather, its current
iteration is merely the result of a diverse range of historical contexts, where competing power
structures have attempted to sensibly allocate their influence within their domains.221
Contemporarily, this bespeaks of the same tension as mentioned above, where sovereign legislation
of the states may be liable to clash with external international law regimes, operating at a remove
from the states’ sphere of power-political influence.
In ECHR, the idea of subsidiarity is also buttressed with the doctrine of margin of appreciation,
concomitantly added to the Convention text via the new Protocol 15. The doctrine brings about the
idea for certain, somewhat abstract “outer lines” within which the states must remain whilst
applying the protective contents of ECHR in their domestic jurisdictions.222 This essentially affords
states their own leeway to decide how they implement ECHR into their statecraft. While the Court
reserves its own initiative to scrutinise domestic proceedings, it has also stated that its approach to
such scrutiny must be cautious, due to the principle of subsidiarity.223 Meanwhile, specific,
“cogent”224 elements may still lead the Court to depart from the findings of fact within domestic
proceedings, consequently furnishing the Court with its freedom to make independent assessment
regarding all the material available to it.
Prima facie, one could argue that the gigantic scope of the notion for “fair trial” could justify a wide
margin of appreciation to the states in issues pertaining to ECHR art. 6. While the Convention
contains several clear injunctions that need to be satisfied, the overall realisation for the parameters
of fair trial remains unburdened with absolute notions, such as those contained in the prohibition of
219

Protocol 15 amends specifically the whole Convention itself: after its entry into force, it is binding towards all
Convention states. The addition of the subsidiarity principle came about via art. 1 of the Protocol.

torture. Herein, ECHR art. 3 constitutes a totally converse example where the margin of
appreciation of the states is generally considered to be excluded.225 However, a further argument
can be made that all Convention rights entail some inherent limitations to the states’ margins. To
further this idea, Besson has argued that a margin of appreciation is unapplicable with the very
“fundamental core” of all the Convention rights.226 Consequently, such core arguably remains
outside the reach of subsidiarity and could thus be regarded as absolutely protected. Such a notion,
to be sure, serves to reinforce the integrity of the whole Convention itself.
On the one hand, subsidiarity implies a presumption that the domestic legislators independently
follow the tenets of ECHR in a way that suits their domestic legal order. On the other hand, the
European Court may provide a judicial assessment of the situation, should doubts arise that a state
is failing on this task. Consequently, it seems clear with ECHR art. 6 that states must, despite their
margins, adapt their procedural legislation to the frames of fairness, as provided by the Court.
Moreover, the Court’s praxis, striving to follow the “object and purpose” of the Convention itself,
even frames many of the positive state obligations into a somewhat strict light.227 If deviating from
such obligations would lead to a situation where the fundamental “core” of the right to a fair trial,
indeed, its object and purpose, would be compromised, such situations should undoubtedly herald
violations of ECHR art. 6. Further, as the question of fairness always pertains to a holistic
assessment and circumstantial considerations, a state’s margin of appreciation on the right to a fair
trial may in fact be rendered, de facto, quite narrow. This narrowness is thereby reflected not only in
the room to manoeuvre that domestic courts have, but also in the policy choices available to
individual states regarding criminal procedure.228
While a testament to the primacy of individual states in the ECHR framework, subsidiarity still
confers limited, if any, means to the states to interfere with the core obligations central to this thesis.
This applies undeniably in terms of the prohibition of ill-treatment, and further casts the
interpretation of ECHR art. 6 into a strict light. The margin of appreciation, while affording states
substantive freedom, nonetheless remains a Court-created doctrine, subject to development and
scrutiny under the evolutive interpretation of the Convention itself. While the Court cannot dictate
how the states incorporate articles 3 or 6 into their legislations, its jurisprudence serves to construct
clear boundaries, qualitatively and quantitatively, which delimit the policy choices of the states and
provide authoritative insight to domestic courts. Several such constructs have previously been

touched upon even in this thesis. These include the different umbrella tests that the Court has
created around evidence exclusion or the privilege against self-incrimination. They are also visible
in the Court’s capability to take autonomous control of necessary terminology, such as when
assessing prerequisite conditions to “knowing and intelligent” human rights waivers, or when
ascertaining whether a “criminal charge” exists.

5.2. Compulsion and state interests

While fair procedure and human rights demand due diligence in securing the rights of defendants,
legitimate considerations are naturally due also to the interests of the state, which is responsible for
conducting the prosecution and other relevant proceedings against the defendant. Such state interests
originate from many sources, among them the will to uphold the integrity of the state’s justice system,
but also from the need to protect other parties involved, such as victims of crimes.229 To this end, the
state accordingly utilises its police, prosecutors, courts, or other relevant officials. Furthermore, as
the presumption of innocence demands a burden of proof from the state, the state’s own interests
accordingly require it to utilise all legal means possible to secure the needed proof against criminal
suspects. Besides interrogations or hearings, such means may entail clear interferences with the
defendant’s fundamental freedoms, e.g. via detention. For meting out justice, these means appear
quite necessary; meanwhile, they also highlight the vulnerability of the defendant, rendered
susceptible to the compulsive powers of the state. Logically, it therefore follows that the state owes
the defendant respect towards his rights of due process and fair trial. To borrow from the European
Court’s phraseology, “improper compulsion” by the state marks one example of a lack for such
respect. As noted, such compulsion may, at its worst, fulfil the unsavoury prerequisites of torture.
Categorisation of improper state compulsion may be highly dependent on the circumstances around
the compulsion. Ascertaining this calls for frequent assessments on proportionality, where even
severe physical or mental pain towards an individual may be rendered lawful, if circumstances justify
and warrant it.230 On the other hand, when the same pain or suffering fails to meet the criteria of
proportionality, i.e. cannot be viewed as absolutely necessary during the considered situation, the
treatment may cross the threshold for cruel, inhuman or degrading. Furthermore, when the victim of
229

While making rare appearances in this discussion, victims of crimes nonetheless constitute a tremendously central
group of individuals whose rights must also be secured during the proceedings. For the most part, the backdrop of this
thesis leaves victims out of its scope.
230
Nowak – McArthur 2008, p. 77.

50

the treatment is in a situation of powerlessness due to a deprivation of his liberty, the same pain or
suffering could be straightforwardly characterised as torture.231 One can therefore see that the overall
assessment focuses on the condemnable nature of the state compulsion, setting the bar highest when
the defendant is at complete mercy of the state officials. In such a situation, no proportionality
assessment may allow for ill-treatment of the defendant, in any scenario.232
An important issue to note is that ill-treatment specifically emphasises the role of the state as the
perpetrator. Indeed, this is one of the defining characteristics also to be found in CAT art. 1, which
requires torture to be inflicted, instigated by or consented to by a public official, in order to qualify
as such. This has since become an internationally settled position, setting a standard for public
officials everywhere to proactively act against or stop ill-treatment transpiring in their legal
domain.233 As mentioned, proportionality and the circumstances of the overall situation have a large
bearing whether the force utilised by state officials may be either justifiable, or characterisable as illtreatment and thus always unpermitted.234 Detention or similar conditions contributing to the
powerlessness serve to heighten the duty of care that the states have, as ill-treatment therein is more
readily attributed as torture.235
In practice, overextending the limits of state compulsion into the sphere of prohibited ill-treatment
appears categorically precluded by international law. For this reason, states should have little to no
recourse to refer to any kinds of “state interests” in order to justify torture or other ill-treatment.
Indeed, this also reflects to the Court’s findings pertaining to self-incrimination, as discussed above
in connection to the cases of Saunders or Heaney and McGuinness, in chapter 3.3. Compared to the
multifaceted sprawl of the term ”fair trial”, the prohibition of ill-treatment thereby entails a clear
imposition. The clarity is well manifested in ECHR, whose entire art. 3, very succinctly, reads:
“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”

While CAT art. 1 (see chapter 1.1, above) affords considerably better detail and substance to its
own corresponding provision, the fact remains that the prohibition of ill-treatment is consistently
worded in clear terms, in quite an unqualified way, and without any limitations clauses.236 Such

231

individual remains absolutely prohibited even when the purpose of such torture (known in certain circles as “enhanced
interrogation”) would be saving lives from an imminent bomb explosion.

51

wording has retained its shape since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, which,
while not a binding instrument, has cemented the prohibition also as a part of customary
international law.237
As has already been discussed, the development of the international prohibition of ill-treatment has
been frequently characterised by a mutually beneficial interplay between prominent rights
instruments, such as CAT and the European Convention. On his concurring opinion on the Jalloh
case, judge Zupančič from the European Court illustrated this interplay by delineating four basic
characteristics to define “torture”, derived from CAT art. 1.238 Firstly, torture shall be considered
delictum proprium, signifying that the specific act is carried out by public officials, or by someone
on their behalf. Moreover, such an act must entail severe physical or mental pain or suffering, which
furthermore occurs as a specific consequence of the delictum. Finally, torture requires a specific intent
behind it, indicating the specific intention or acquiescence of the officials conducting it.239 While
speaking specifically of torture, these prerequisites should be transferrable also to other, lesser forms
of ill-treatment without any larger difficulty. Reasons for this have already been discussed in chapter
2.3, in connection to procedural evidence and ill-treatment.

5.3. The notion of absoluteness and distinctions within ECHR art. 3

5.3.1.

Deriving absoluteness

The European Convention can boast having quite a significant role in the development of the
prohibition of ill-treatment in international human rights law. While the text of ECHR art. 3
essentially repeats the ideals established already in UDHR, the concise nature should not go
misconstrued. Indeed, ECHR served as tremendous influence in the drafting process of CAT.240
Interestingly, the influence has subsequently manifested as a two-way street, as the developing
framework of ECHR itself has clearly benefitted and drawn influence from CAT and its treaty
body. Exemplified by the interpretative aid drawn from CAT by Judge Zupančič (see above), the

medical or scientific experimentation.” The first sentence of the article is, furthermore, a direct copy from the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

mutual proliferation has heralded somewhat of a dialectical relationship between ECHR and CAT.
Looking the issue from the perspective of ECHR, the relationship has led to concrete incorporation
of standards found in CAT into the European Convention, via the Court’s jurisprudence.241
As already indicated, the peremptory status of the prohibition within ECHR stems from a global and
historical consensus. To frame the issue as a positive obligation, the prohibition has long entailed a
state responsibility to protect everyone’s personal integrity and dignity, objects often placed at the
very core of international human rights law.242 Consequently, the prohibition has been described to
constitute a jus cogens norm; it has long been seen as a part of customary international law (CIL),
with internationally established state practice and virtually unanimous opinio juris behind the
issue.243 While specifically drafted treaties (e.g. CAT) are undoubtedly superior in codifying the
prohibition against ill-treatment in detail, its firm positioning in CIL serves to provide the state
obligation considerable gravitas, notwithstanding any possible indirectness on the topic in any
underlying rights framework. This is especially important when considering perhaps the most
defining characteristic of the prohibition, i.e. its nature as a non-derogable state obligation.
To be sure, the semantic definitions for terms “cruel”, “inhuman” or “degrading” treatment are
abstract at worst, and relative at best. This highlights that the activation of this “absolutist” provision
often depends heavily upon individual circumstances, making it up to courts (or other organs) to
determine whether such considerations have merit on individual in casu bases. As the notion is
identically underpinned in several celebrated human rights regimes, the absoluteness of the
prohibition of ill-treatment appears more as a result of attribution, rather than being an inherent or
orthodox legal necessity.244 Greer argues that the absoluteness can therefore only exist in a “virtual”
sense, as many moral, legal and even logical factors argue against a strict idea of the notion.245
To offer a comparison in a legal sense, one can compare the scope of the prohibition to another
peremptory human rights norm: the right to life. Despite its sacrosanct nature (and, at least to a high
degree, absolute246), the right to life usually still entails exceptions and limitations, stated often
explicitly or implicitly within the relevant rights instruments. The prohibition of ill-treatment, on the

243
Nowak 2005, p. 674. See also Rodley 2009, p. 69–70. Rodley suggests, however, that the notion of universal
acceptance has also been challenged, due to the many states who continue to violate the prohibition, or due to failings to
effectively enforce the prohibition in an international scale.

other hand, essentially never carries such qualifications. In this sense, the prohibition of torture
manifests itself as devoid of any limitations or exceptions whatsoever.

5.3.2.

Distinctions between the forms of ill-treatment

Chapters above show that the notion of absoluteness on ECHR art. 3 may also entail significant
challenges in a practical sense. The applied terminology within the prohibition raises questions
regarding the existence of the distinction between torture and other ill-treatment, and what it entails.
Indeed, this very distinction has been touched upon above pertaining to self-incrimination and
evidence exclusion, in connection to the Gäfgen case in the European Court.
Historically, emphasising any specific distinction between different grades of ill-treatment was
unlikely an operative idea behind the UDHR, where the drafters merely sought to provide a blanket
ban to hinder state atrocities à la Holocaust.247 After its emergence, the prohibition nonetheless soon
saw itself divided into its component parts in international law discourse, as torture and other cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment, respectively, began to ostensibly attain individualised
characteristics. Rodley argues that the first significant occurrence of the distinction took place within
the ECHR framework, in the so-called Greek-case from 1969.248 Specifically, the case set out to
provide a characterisation of all the three variants of ill-treatment given in art. 3. Distinction between
the variants has received attention in several prestigious international instruments, CAT among them.
Expounding upon the issue is therefore relevant, as it could intimate whether the approach on
absoluteness somehow differs between these different forms of ill-treatment, in some concrete way.
The Greek-case, considered by the European Commission of Human Rights in 1969, predates CAT
by over a decade. In the case, the Commission defined inhuman treatment as covering “at least such
treatment as deliberately causes severe suffering, mental or physical, which, in the particular situation
is unjustifiable”, while degrading treatment entails treatment towards an individual that “grossly
humiliates him before others and drives him to act against his will or conscience”. 249 More
importantly, a defining characteristic to separate inhuman or degrading treatment from torture, the
Commission viewed that torture entails both “an aggravated form of inhuman or degrading treatment”

247

54

and that it is based upon a purpose, such as obtaining a confession or inflicting punishment.250 Later,
the above wording for inhuman treatment has, understandably, met with criticism, as it seems to
betray an indirect willingness from the Commission to actually allow certain types of ill-treatment,
as long as such treatment is justifiable. Such an approach, in these days, would be regarded as
untenable. Meanwhile, the purpose-oriented approach to the distinction has seen plenty of further
cultivation. The CAT framework, for instance, derived a great amount of influence from the Greekcase, as the UN ended up adopting a similar, purpose-oriented approach in its own definition of torture
within CAT.251
Despite the gravity of the Greek-case, actually a subsequent case of Ireland v. the United Kingdom
from 1978 has served as the long-time authority on the distinctions between torture and other
inhuman treatment within the framework of ECHR.252 In Ireland, the Court introduced a threshold
of minimum severity, which ought to be reached in order to categorise inhuman treatment
specifically as torture. To be sure, an idea of severity was implicit already in the Greek-case, in its
requirement for an “aggravated form of ill-treatment”. Nonetheless, it is exactly Ireland’s notion of
severity that has long set the tone for the Court’s interpretation of ECHR art. 3.
To achieve the threshold of torture, the Court viewed that a minimum severity had to be attained in
the overall ill-treatment.253 This severity, furthermore, ought to be relative to the circumstances in
the case. The Court further stated that such circumstances could be linked to the duration of the
treatment, its physical and mental effects and also things such as gender, age and the state of health
of the victim.254 The notion served to distance the Court away from the purpose-oriented approach
advocated in the Greek-case as well as by CAT, later on. Contrarily, the Court wished to highlight
the distinction by instilling a special stigma specifically to torture, characterising it as deliberate
inhuman treatment which causes serious and cruel suffering.255 However, in its assessment, the
Court seemed to bypass its focus on the purpose behind the ill-treatment, focusing the principal
significance on the difference in the intensity of the suffering inflicted.256 To give the notion some
credit, such an approach undeniably serves to highlight the condemnable nature of torture, the most
severe form of ill-treatment.

While a special stigma to torture is surely to be welcomed, Ireland has also met with criticism. The
case’s unilateral focus on severity has frequently been seen to present a myopic view on the whole
concept of “torture”, due to the lack of the purposive element that was apparent in the Greek-case,
and later visible also in the assessment of Judge Zupančič, in Jalloh.257 Despite this curious shift in
defining the terms, Ireland nonetheless emerged as a tone-setting case, maintaining a prominent
position in the Court’s case law long after the case’s publication.258 Consequently, emphasis on
severity remains a crucial element in the Court’s jurisprudence. Additionally, Ireland helped to
expound upon the significance of administrative practice, when dealing with violations against art.
3. This has entailed that the state’s violations are likely considered more serious and severe, if the
ill-treatment in question appears on a repetitive basis and is officially tolerated by the state.259 This
mirrors and maybe even refurbishes the proportionality assessment that has been discussed above,
in chapter 5.2.
Around the turn of the millennium, the overall proliferation of case law has indicated signs of a
paradigm shift in the Court’s approach to ill-treatment. The Court has showed willingness to better
revisit the purpose-oriented approach of ill-treatment, having largely overlooked it since the time of
the Greek-case.260 While not clearly departing from its approach in Ireland, the Court has begun to
incorporate a mixed approach in ascertaining whether a specific form of ill-treatment qualifies as
torture, thus combining elements pertaining both to the purpose behind the ill-treatment, and its
grade of severity.261
The case of Selmouni marks an important moment in this shift, as the Court in the case gave
credence to the significance of the tenets in CAT art. 1, noting the purpose-oriented references
within the article.262 The significance of the case stems from the Court highlighting the ECHR’s
role as a living instrument, thereby indicating that this doctrine may apply even for ECHR art. 3, a
tenet from the utmost core of the Convention.263 Indeed, the Court utilised CAT for the first time in
Selmouni to support its reasoning on the issue of torture, albeit still affording primary emphasis on
the severity of the ill-treatment.264 As an interpretative guideline, however, the Court stated that the
relative notion of severity in CAT art. 1 essentially corresponds with that of the ECHR

framework.265 Most importantly, Selmouni showcased an increase in the Court’s willingness to
categorise different forms of ill-treatment specifically as torture.266 This is further evident by the
Court’s subsequent case law, where findings on torture have become considerably more abundant.
To be sure, the overall increase of ECHR member states has likely had a bearing on the matter, as
well.267
After Selmouni, concrete references to CAT’s reasoning on the purpose-oriented approach began
appearing more regularly in the Court’s jurisprudence. Admittedly, this shift has occurred rather
discreetly, as the Court has also continued to recognise the prominence of the Ireland case in its
considerations.268 For example, in the case of Dikme, the Court explicitly held that issues such as
the purpose and the duration of ill-treatment may well have bearing on the categorisation of illtreatment.269 According to Forowicz, this newfound bipolarity has since continued to develop
towards a point where the mixed approach entails quite an equal weight between severity and
elements pertaining to purpose.270 In consequence, such an overall approach renders it quite
difficult to detect conclusive boundaries that the Court may have meant between the concepts of
torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment, respectively. From the standpoint of the nonderogable ideals of ECHR art. 3, such a lack of clarity ought not to be a problem; absolute
characteristics should, after all, apply equally to all forms of ill-treatment. In any case, the mixed
approach certainly allows the Court good leeway to keep developing its jurisprudence on ECHR art.
3. Furthermore, a dialogue with other rights instruments hopefully remains beneficial also for future
development of this profound principle, even within the larger sphere of international law.
While characterising torture simplistically as mere “aggravated ill-treatment” has progressively
lessened in international frameworks and jurisprudence, it has failed to vanish altogether and
continues to be applied in prominent bodies, such as within the practice of the European Court of
Human Rights.271 Indeed, the assessment of severity seems by no means a futile exercise; mere
common logic dictates that torture would require some form of a threshold in order to be characterised
as such. Subsequently, jurisprudence and international law discourse have shown that also the
purposive element behind the ill-treatment should be considered, in order to facilitate a more holistic
way to scrutinise the distinction. This could be also important while assaying the consequences that

different forms of ill-treatment should entail in respect to violations on ECHR art. 3, or even in
relation to other rights, such as notions of fair trial in view of ECHR art. 6. Deriving guidelines or
rules from the Court’s practice on the matter remains, however, unclear at best.
The distinctive elements between the forms of ill-treatment thereby remain a somewhat perplexing
issue when considering ECHR art. 3, a formally absolute prohibition in its entirety. The absolute ideal
continues to remain quite uncontested as a customary legal norm, warranting the prohibition a de
facto international status where states, at least in principle, recognise its peremptory and nonderogable backdrop, even in times of war or national emergencies. In ECHR, this is also showcased
by the unapplied margin of appreciation when it comes to issues pertaining to art. 3. In a larger picture,
however, it appears that differing forms of ill-treatment have so far failed to yield considerable
differences in their condemnable nature; violations on art. 3 are unfailingly deemed serious,
regardless of their denomination.
Nonetheless, the Gäfgen case demonstrates that the substantive distinction between torture vis-à-vis
other ill-treatment may have bearing also in the outcome of human rights violations, such as those
pertaining to fair trial. Unfortunately, concrete reasons for this sole solution appear to be rather
difficult to ascertain by looking at the genesis of ECHR jurisprudence pertaining to art. 3. Perhaps,
the solution is therefore attributable rather to the sophistication that the European Convention can
boast, due to its capacity for internal development via the flexible and nuanced treaty interpretation
exhibited by the European Court. Besides its flexibility and capacity for nuance, the Court has at its
disposal an enviable amount of jurisprudence that may be utilised on the topic directly, pertaining to
both articles of 3 and 6, of the Convention. Therein, one is called upon to see also beyond the
formalistic idea of absoluteness, its allure notwithstanding.

Conclusions

The topics of self-incrimination and evidence exclusion are matters related to procedural law, a
sprawling discipline even within the confines of individual domestic legislations. The sprawl is
similarly visible in the context of international law where ECHR forms only one example, seeking
to codify the issue in the discourse of human rights, subject to the right to a fair trial. While
questions of evidence and self-incrimination are completely omitted from the Convention text, the
long-established case law and binding judgments by the European Court have provided plenty of
substantive depth to the issues. They have, simultaneously, offered a jurisprudential backdrop that
differs from the one developed within domestic courts that function under the premise of state
sovereignty. Thereby, the ECHR offers its own unique, rights-based rationales and approaches to
procedural issues. Indeed, aided also by the inspiration of several corollary international human
rights doctrines, the European Convention codifies the issues of self-incrimination and evidence
exclusion substantially. Overall, the Court’s stance on evidence exclusion and self-incrimination are
thereby built on a sui generis foundation, which enables one to consider even the specific, Gäfgenesque research question posed in the introduction.
Bearing in mind the principle of subsidiarity, the Court’s active participation in the crafting of
procedural jurisprudence is necessarily stymied by the primacy that Convention states themselves
have in the implementation of rights within ECHR. Further, the development of the case law
remains subject to the actual accumulation of cases, and the contents therein, that are brought forth
to the Court. Despite the “living instrument” doctrine, these reasons have rendered the Court’s case
law development sometimes quite deliberate and, arguably, slow in aspects requiring extensive or
technical legal scrutiny. Sometimes, the Court has found itself considering whether such issues even
belong under its mandate. The early examples set, inter alia, by the Schenck case demonstrate this
in terms of procedural law and evidence exclusion. Nonetheless, whilst retaining a reticent stance
on certain issues, such as proclaiming any type-specific rulings on different kinds of pieces of
evidence, the Court’s jurisprudence on evidence exclusion and admissibility has proliferated
considerably.
Due to its development, the Court’s case law on evidence exclusion has come closer to creating its
own, albeit loose “exclusionary rule” doctrine, mandating many prerequisites which the states must
consider in order to uphold the tenets of fair trial of ECHR. This includes quality-related
considerations such as the accuracy and the reliability of the evidence at play, as well as the overall
59

circumstances where the evidence was obtained. Moreover, the case of Khudobin afforded
tremendous emphasis to the proper assessment of evidence that states themselves are required to
conduct already during the national proceedings. Accordingly, the Court has shown that individual
irregularities in evidence-related issues may not suffice to call a violation of ECHR art. 6. Indeed,
such irregularities may be subject to compensation, achieved by a recuperation of fairness by the
surrounding circumstances, which serve to mitigate the whole issues so that the threshold for a fair
trial violation remains uncrossed. Accordingly, as per Ölçer, rules on evidence exclusion in ECHR
are characterised by an idea for “fair use of evidence”, a term quite becoming of its surrounding
framework. Indeed, ascertaining evidence-related issues in the way described above is quite
consistent with other “umbrella tests” that abound precisely in relation to ECHR art. 6, an omnibus
provision where a holistic way of assessment is paramount in order to reconcile the abstract overall
concept of fairness.
The Court has shown that insufficient fairness in the proceedings may have been compensated for
in case of individual procedural irregularities, and even in situations where the Court has
simultaneously called a violation in some other Convention right. This has been demonstrated in
terms of ECHR art. 8, for example in the case of Khan. Startlingly, one could further argue that the
same has occurred even with ECHR art. 3, in the case of Gäfgen. One should meanwhile recall,
however, that the latter represents a significant outlier on the issue, with the compensation of
fairness probably not appearing as the sole motivator behind the judgement. Indeed, the reasoning
pertaining to ECHR art. 6 in Gäfgen dealt strongly also with the causality, or lack thereof, to the
violation of ECHR art. 3. Specificities notwithstanding, Gäfgen, and forced confessions in general,
serve to remind of the stark influence that the prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment can entail
with human rights considerations, including situations where different rights provisions collide or
converge. The prohibition of ill-treatment, specifically, derives prominence also from other human
rights instruments (e.g. CAT) as well as customary international law. Consequently, the
surrounding framework of international law undeniably reinforces the non-derogable jus cogens
nature of the prohibition also in terms of ECHR art. 3. Therefore, a dubious light is cast over the
question of “compensating” for torture or inhuman treatment while ascertaining violations of fair
trial, in the framework of European Convention. Indeed, the Court’s ruling the Jalloh case suggests
that such recuperation may never be occur when torture is involved; with lesser forms of illtreatment, however, the question appears to have been left open, if only slightly.
The significance of the privilege against self-incrimination within the fair trial apparatus of ECHR
should also be deemed considerable. Besides evidence-related issues, the privilege also has a
60

fundamental connection with core tenets of criminal procedure, such as the defendant’s
presumption of innocence and the state’s burden of proof. Furthermore, as the privilege emphasises
individual volition and autonomy, the need to express this volition in an informed and uncoerced
way highlights the defendant’s right to legal assistance. These notions serve to benefit the equality
of arms in the procedural setting, so easily characterised by the skewed nature pertaining to
capabilities of individual defendants vis-à-vis the tax-subsidised machineries of the police,
prosecutors, and courts of law. The European Court, moreover, applies the protective ambit of the
Convention according to its autonomic terminology in relation to the term “charged”, which sets the
stage for the whole criminal ambit of ECHR art. 6. This autonomy frees the Court to consider its
criminal cases substantively, instead of tying itself to formalist notions to what “criminal charges”
entail in individual states. Thereby, the Court is free to consider these issues from a perspective that
matter in relation to human rights: the nature of the offence and the severity of its possible penalty.
The Court analyses state transgressions on the privilege against self-incrimination by referring to an
idea of an “essence” of the privilege, the breaking of which will lead to a violation in the right to a
fair trial. Here, the Court has considered the relevant safeguards available to the defendant, the use
to which the acquired evidence is put, as well as the nature and degree of compulsion that is utilised
against the defendant to prompt his self-incrimination. The Court in its case law recognises that
such compulsion may take various forms, including the threat of monetary or legal sanctions,
entrapment, or disproportionate physical or psychological pressure towards the defendant. To be
sure, this last form of compulsion is probably the one most frequently encountered upon in human
rights discourse, as it pertains the most clearly to the prohibition of torture or other ill-treatment.
Indeed, the notion of self-incrimination is practically named in the defining art. 1 of CAT, and
furthermore derivable from the exclusionary rule provided by its art. 15. Pertaining to the research
question, a rather important issue to consider is whether improper compulsion amounting to illtreatment could be thought to destroy, categorically, the essence of the privilege, thus warranting an
automatic, concomitant violation of both ECHR art. 3 and art. 6.
Indeed, the research question invites one to consider the significance of the unrelenting term,
“absolute”, and whether the ostensibly unconditional purview of this term should extend beyond
ECHR art. 3, to such situations that were considered in Gäfgen. Relating to this work, the Court has
shown understandable restraint in applying absolutist terminology to other arenas than ECHR art. 3.
In relation to the multifaceted, holistic scope of fair trial, absolutist notions have received little
consideration. This could also be partly due to the nature of human rights themselves, highlighting
specifically the autonomy of individuals; in terms of self-incrimination, the Court has herein
61

highlighted the will of the accused. Absolutist notions are therefore much better suited to state
obligations entailing concrete impositions, such as the prohibition of torture. From the standpoint of
individual defendants, a better way of analysis is thereby provided from the way the Court has
considered voluntary waivers of human rights, given by individuals. This shifts the notion of
absoluteness to a different level, where the only absolutely unwaivable rights notion is, in fact,
equality. Consequently, considering the Court-created standard of “knowing and intelligent waiver”
provides the next-best thing to an absolutist ethos when following the choices of individuals who
relinquish their rights, voluntarily or otherwise.
To recapitulate, the violations of ECHR art. 6 in relation to self-incrimination hinge especially on
the notion whether the “essence” of the privilege remains intact. Undoubtedly, this assessment is
related to the question whether the defendant elects to waive his privilege, in a “knowing and
intelligent” way. While the dogma of absoluteness on the prohibition of torture and other illtreatment has a deeply established and well upheld history in international human rights law, the
case of Gäfgen demonstrates that such strictness may have its limits. The substantive development
of ECHR art. 3 (and its corresponding provisions in CAT and elsewhere) contains plenty of scrutiny
on the historical distinctions that have been given to torture and other inhuman or degrading
treatment, respectively. This scrutiny has pertained on things such as the severity of the ill-treatment
or vulnerable position of the ill-treated. As per the mixed approach that the Court has increasingly
adopted, the consideration takes also into account the purpose behind the ill-treatment. All of this
certainly helped to canvas the differing forms of state-sponsored ill-treatment in terms of its
characteristics, degree, and condemnable nature.
Conversely, the same development contains little to no indication that torture and the other forms of
ill-treatment should actually be applied according to differing standards, or in a way which would
render torture “more” absolute than the weaker variants of ill-treatment. In this sense, the Court
may have, in Gäfgen, found itself in an impasse of sorts: either apply different standards than the
ones pertaining to torture that were proclaimed in Jalloh (see above, in chapter 2.3.2.), or consider
the “lesser”, inhuman treatment that occurred in Gäfgen by those same standards. The latter option
would have entailed pronouncing a violation on ECHR art. 6 for the benefit of the pedicidal
defendant, perhaps leading to a mistrial due to police brutality whose scope pales in contrast to the
defendant’s deeds.
From this line of reasoning, one can deduce that the Court has afforded more value towards the
holistic, in casu reasoning employed with ECHR art. 6, rather than remaining tied to the formalistic,
even historical notions of absoluteness that art. 3 entails. Therefore, it appears that the absolute
62

scope of ECHR art. 3, while important, should not be the paramount consideration while assessing
the admissibility of self-incriminating evidence acquired by ill-treatment. For the same reasons, it
appears unwise to frame such self-incrimination as a categorical cause for a violation in ECHR art.
6, despite the overwhelming likelihood that such a violation is warranted in such situations. As
showcased by the increasingly refined ways the Court assesses things pertaining to criminal
procedure and fair trial, the nuanced human rights interpretation of the European Court may well,
therefore, be underway of rendering substantive notions on “absoluteness” towards a lesser utility
than what the term semantically, formalistically, or historically may entail.
