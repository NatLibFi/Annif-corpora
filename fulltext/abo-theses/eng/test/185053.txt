Title of the Thesis: PROTECTION OF CIVILIAN DATA FROM CYBER ATTACKS IN
ARMED CONFLICTS
Supevisor: Mikaela Heikkilä
Cyber operations targeting civilian data can in a present-day context operate in somewhat of a
grey area. Because of this, states and non-state groups can attack civilian data during an armed
conflict without consequens in most cases, which can rapidly cause more harm to the civilian
population than the destruction of physical civilian objects. Since states have in many cases
been reluctant to share their views on how international humanitarian law applies to the case of
data as a civilian object, this thesis sets out to clarify whether data is protected from attack
during an armed conflict.
The general protection of civilians and civilian objects seams to be unfit to deal with the notion
of computer data being digital in nature, as opposed to material. It is therefore only in very
specific contexts that civilian computer data will be protected from cyber operation, due to the
consequences of the operation qualifying it as an attack. International humanitarian law,
however, affords special protection to certain objects, persons and activities. Since these
protections are in most cases applied in an overreaching manner some civilian data, falling
witing the grasps of special protection, can be protected from attack.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
With the development of technology most societies have become thoroughly digitalized
and therefore highly dependent on the access of data when conducting their day-to-day
activities. Many everyday services access our personal information in the form of
computer data even when accomplishing the most simple tasks, such as paying with a
credit card, visiting a medical service or using electricity or water from the electrical grid
or the water supply.1 At the same time, the technological development has made states,
non-state groups and international organizations both more dependent on constant access
to data as well as more susceptible to cyber attacks through the use of cyberspace. This
development has in turn resulted in states developing cyber military capabilities of their
own both for defensive and offensive purposes. Among others the United States, the
United Kingdom and Australia have publicly revealed that they have used cyber means
and methods of warfare in the fight against the Islamic State.2 The use of cyber operations
during armed conflicts is already a reality and cyber operations will probably become an
even more prominent part of the battlefield in the future.3
In the recent decades, cyber operations have been conducted as part of the military action
in the Russian-Georgian war of 2008 as well as in the conflict between Russia and
Ukraine since 2014.4 More recently, in 2022 the tension between Russia and Ukraine has
developed into a full scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces, which have
been followed by a constant onslaught of cyber attacks against the Ukrainian
government.5 Similarly, in the Russian-Georgian war of 2008 the alleged Russian cyber

operations against Georgia took down the country's websites and crippled
communications of the Georgian government affecting civilians nationwide. In addition,
these attacks were used to access and gather computer data from Georgian servers.6
While it is clear that international humanitarian law is applicable to cyber operations in
these cases because of ongoing armed conflicts, it is still uncertain how international
humanitarian law applies to cyber operations targeting civilian computer data.7 Among
other these uncertainties are reflective of how the principles of international humanitarian
law apply to military action conducted through cyberspace, which have especially been
observed at the political level in the UN Open-ended Working Group on Developments
in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International
Security.8 In the Open-ended working group, States where unable to codify anything
conclusive, concluding that there are “questions relevant to how the principles of
international humanitarian law, such as principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality,
distinction and precaution, apply to ICT operations…. States noted that further study was
required on these important topics in future discussions.”9
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has already in 2015 stated in its
report on International humanitarian law and the challenges of contemporary armed
conflicts, that the destruction or manipulation of civilian data could rapidly cause more
harm to the civilian population than the destruction of physical civilian objects.10 Attacks
on civilian objects are prohibited according to the Articles of Chapter IV of Protocol
Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the Protection
of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (hereinafter Additional Protocol I) and

according to Customary International Humanitarian Law in both international and noninternational armed conflicts.11
However, with regards to data, soft law instruments such as the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on
the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (hereinafter Tallinn Manual 2.0)
has stated that the notion of objects according to customary international humanitarian
law does not include data. Followingly, civilian data would fall outside of the principle
of distinction and not be afforded the protection that is commonly related to civilian
objects.12 For the most part states have been reluctant to issue statements regarding the
protection of data, probably since it would clearly restrict the conduct of legitimate cyber
operations. However, if data was considered an object of international humanitarian law,
states would have to distinguish between military and civilian targets in addition to
factoring in the damage caused to civilian data in the proportionality calculations of an
attack.13
The ICRC considers that because our societies are essentially dependent on data, the
conclusion to not distinguish between different types of data, between civilian and
military, would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of the norms of customary
international humanitarian law.14 The ICRC argues that civilian data such as “medical
data, biometric data, social security data, tax records, bank accounts, companies’ client
files or election lists and records” are essential for the functioning of modern society.15
Therefore, if data does not constitute an object of international humanitarian law, the
destruction or manipulation of civilian data would not be prohibited by the principles of
international humanitarian law. Thereby making data a legitimate target of military
action, which could be attacked because it does not amount to an object that would engage

the prohibition of attacks on civilian objects.16 The exclusion of civilian data as a civilian
object is to be regarded as a severe protection gap within international humanitarian law
that can result in exploiting civilians during armed conflict. States could, for instance,
execute military operations with the aim of gathering personal information of civilians
that are stored in cyberspace because military operations against civilian data would not
be prohibited.17 According to the ICRC the “the replacement of paper files and documents
with digital files in the form of data should not decrease the protection that IHL affords
to them.”18
1.2. Research questions and structure
This thesis sets out to explore the current lex lata of international humanitarian law with
the aim to clarify the issues related to the protection of civilian computer data in armed
conflicts. Interpreting the rules of international humanitarian law in relation to computer
data has never been a more topical issue. Especially, considering the statement of the
ICRC in 2019 in the International Humanitarian Law and the Challenges of
Contemporary Armed Conflicts – Recommitting To Protection In Armed Conflict On The
70th Anniversary Of The Geneva Conventions rapport considering that: “data have
become an essential component of the digital domain and a cornerstone of life in many
societies”.19 Additionally, the ICRC considers that the destruction or manipulation of
civilian data could rapidly cause more harm to the civilian population than the destruction
of physical civilian objects.20 The topic of this thesis will be studied in light of the
following research question and the underlying sub questions:
1. Does international humanitarian law afford protection of civilian data from
military action, in the context of an armed conflict?

a. Does data fall within the definition of a civilian object as considered by
customary international law and Article 52 of Additional Protocol I?
b. In what cases, if any, is civilian data protected from military action
pursuant to special protection regimes of international humanitarian law?
The reason for examining the research questions in the following order is that the question
of, whether data qualifies as an object or not, is central for the thesis as a whole.
Additionally, the second sub-question as well as the main research question can only be
fully examined, after concluding the current state of the law, lex lata, in relation to data
as an object of customary international humanitarian law. After the quality of data has
been established the thesis will answer the second sub-questions, which ultimately works
in tandem with the first, in answering the research question in its entirety.
The thesis is divided into four main chapters. After the introduction, Chapter 2 seeks to
explain the difficult circumstances and terminology following the conduct of armed
conflict in cyberspace. Followingly, Chapter 3 will seek to establish whether civilian
computer data do constitute a civilian object, lex lata, in international customary law
treaty law. After the position of data in relation to international humanitarian law, lex lata,
is confirmed, Chapter 4 will further dive into the protection of civilian computer data and
examine whether computer data can be protected from military action despite data falling
outside/inside the scope of a civilian object. Since different special protection regimes are
common in international humanitarian law it would be useful to clarify whether and when
they extend to civilian computer data. Finally, in Chapter 5 the author makes concluding
remarks as to the practical nature of protection related to civilian computer data and the
specific cases in which protection of data could be afforded as well as discusses the
implications of the current lex lata.
1.3. Method, sources and limitations
This thesis will be performed on the basis of the legal dogmatic method. The legal
dogmatic method can be described as: “research that aims to give a systematic exposition
of the principles, rules and concepts governing a particular legal field or institution and
analyses the relationship between these principles, rules and concepts with a view to

6

solving unclarities and gaps in the existing law.”21 Smits, recognizes three key
characteristics for a legal dogmatic research approach. First and foremost, an internal
perspective is characteristic for the dogmatic method, meaning that the author places
themselves inside the legal system, analyzing the legal system itself.22 Secondly, it is
important that the research recognizes the law as a system. This second aspect thereby
requires that all appropriate elements of the law are “fitted together into one working
whole, resolving internal inconsistencies among seemingly contradictory materials.”23
Lastly, the third characteristic is that a dogmatic research method systematizes present
applicable law, lex lata.24 Lex lata, being considered as “[t]he positive law currently in
force, without modification to account for any rules subjectively preferred by the
interpreter.”25 Considering the above mentioned characteristics of the legal dogmatic
approach, this thesis will examine the research question against the sources of
international law, as set forth by Article 38 (1) of the Statute of the International Court of
Justice (ICJ) as:
a) international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules
expressly recognized by the contesting states;
b) international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;
c) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;
d) judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of
the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law26
In answering the research question the author will review relevant conventions related to
the jus in bello such as the 1949 Geneva Conventions as well as their additional

protocols.27 When interpreting treaty law, the author will primarily turn to generally
agreed upon rules for treaty interpretation as those enshrined in the Vienna Convention
on the Law of Treaties (hereinafter VCLT).28 In addition, the author will whenever
possibly refer to state praxis and position papers which might suggest emerging custom
or state practice, to further the arguments made elsewhere in this thesis.
Following the sources of international law as considered by the ICJ, customary
international law constitutes that of Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International
Court of Justice and is considered as “general practice accepted as law.”29 In more detail,
it is considered that customary international law requires two elements to emerge, state
practice and opinio juris sive necessitatis. As stated by the ICJ in the Continental Shelf
case: “It is of course axiomatic that the material of customary international law is to be
looked for primarily in the actual practice and opinio juris of States.”30
State practice can consist of both physical and verbal acts of states as well as practice of
executive, legislative and judicial organs of a state.31 In addition, states have to act in
accordance with their practice, for practice to be general as if it “occurred in such a way
as to show a general recognition that a rule of law or legal obligation is involved.“ 32 In
the customary international humanitarian law study by the ICRC, state military manuals

were considered as verbal acts of state practice.33 However, following the developments
of international law as applicable to cyberspace, numerous states have issued public state
position papers, voicing their view on the matter of how international law applies to acts
in and throughout cyberspace. Therefore, this thesis uses state position papers and official
statements of states as evidence of state practice in relation to the applicability of
international law in cyberspace during armed conflicts.
Opinio juris is seen as the fact that practice of states is considered to be reflective of a
legal conviction. The conviction has to be accepted or supported, or at least not objected
to, by the international community in large. For customary international law to emerge
there is a requirement for opinio juris communis.34 The verbal accounts of states can count
as both state practice as well as be reflective of a legal conviction of the state, 35 which is
why state positions can be used to argue that an element of opinio juris has emerged. For
a norm of customary international law to crystalize the ICJ considered in the North Sea
Continental Shelf case that:
“State practice, including that of States whose interests are specially affected, should have
been both extensive and virtually uniform in the sense of the provision invoked; -and
should moreover have occurred in such a way as to show a general recognition that a rule
of law or legal obligation is involved.”36
The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) will be used in this thesis to
further the argument that some international norms are indeed customary. This is
primarily done due to the unique relationship between international criminal law and that
of some rules of customary international humanitarian law. Additionally, with 123
ratifications, the Statute and its contents are widely ratified by states.37

Considering the exceptional mandate of the ICRC “to work for the faithful application of
international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts and... to prepare any
development thereo”38 the author will turn to the commentaries of the ICRC when
interpreting the Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols.39 With regards to
non-international armed conflicts the International Crimes Tribunal of the former
Yugoslavia (ICTY) has recognized that the practice of the ICRC is an important factor in
the emergence of customary rules in non-international conflicts.40 Additionally, reports,
positions papers as well as any other relevant documents produced by the ICRC will be
used to further argument made by the author that are based on the primary sources of law.
In addition, the ICRC’s study on customary international humanitarian law will be used
when further analyzing and applying customary international humanitarian law
throughout this thesis. Although criticized, inter alia, for placing to much emphasize on
written materials of state opinions rather than operational practice,41 the work is the most
complete codification of the rules of customary international humanitarian law and
relevant due to the ICRC’s mandate, as mentioned above.
In addition to the ICRC study on customary international humanitarian law the Tallinn
Manual 2.0 will be used throughout the thesis, in providing valuable insights on the
discussion on cyber operations and the applicability of international law to their use in
armed conflicts. Although the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is a soft law instrument and cannot be
considered a primary source of law it will be considered as “teachings of the most highly
qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of
rules of law.”42 The Tallinn Manual 2.0 is the product of two separate international groups
of experts, who have sought to codify the legal principles governing cyber operations in

relation to different legal regimes of international law. The goal of the Manual is to be an
objective statement of lex lata as of date of adoption in June 2016, it does not venture into
policy questions or statements reflecting lex ferenda.43 Although the Tallinn Manual 2.0
has received some criticism, it is mostly with regards to the fact that the Manual does not
express the views of states.44 However, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is not an international
agreement of states or international organizations, rather it should and will be regarded as
a product of the international experts that participated in the drafting of the manual in
their personal capacity.45 Finally the author will turn to relevant academic literature to
support the findings of this thesis, although non-binding, scholarly work is crucial in
understanding the legal issues in connection to cyberspace and the conflict that can be
fought within it.
This thesis presupposes two factors. First and foremost, that there is an ongoing armed
conflict either international or non-international in character to which the states are party
to. Secondly, that the cyber operations that have been conducted are attributable to a state
or to a non-state group. Therefore, this thesis does not deal with issues arising from either
the threshold of an armed conflict or the issue of attribution in cyberspace. Finally, this
thesis does not deal with the issues arising from the dual use characteristics of either
cyberspace or the internet since the dual use nature of cyberspace and the internet has
been thoroughly analyzed and discussed elsewhere by scholars.46

2. Technical and legal aspects related to cyberspace
2.1 Concepts and terminology
The ICRC position paper on International Humanitarian Law and Cyber Operations
during Armed Conflicts (2019) begins with providing the definition for cyber operations
during armed conflicts as: “operations against a computer, a computer system or network,
or another connected device, through a data stream, when used as means and methods of
warfare in the context of an armed conflict.”47 In many cases however, the means of using
cyber technology is combined with activities such as crime, warfare and attacks that when
conducted through cyberspace are coupled with the ‘cyber’ prefix, resulting in cyber
warfare or cyber crime, for instance. However, it is important to pay explicit attention
since the meaning of the words themselves can have a different contextual meaning in the
international legal sphere as opposed to in the day-to-day context, as seen in the case of
cyber warfare and cyber crime above. For instance, a cyber attack generally refers to a
“cyber operation against a particular object or entity, and in the military sense it usually
indicates a military operation targeting a particular person or object… the term as used in
the jus in bello indicates a particular type of military operation that involves the use of
violence”.48 As can be derived from the previous quote and the definition of cyber
operation of the ICRC above, terminology plays a vital part in understanding the legal
issues faced in this thesis and in cyberspace for that matter.
The issue of terminology is common when encountering novel areas of the law and it was
also seen as a particular obstacle that the drafters of both editions of the Tallinn Manual
had to overcome.49 Since it is vital to avoid confusion about some of the most central

In the drafting of both editions of the Tallinn Manual, terminology posed a particular obstacle. Many
words and phrases have a common meaning as well as having specific military or legal meanings. In
addition to the example presented in the text if the word ‘attack’ is coupled with the word ‘armed’ in the
jus ad bellum, it refers to a cyber operation that justifies a response in self defence according to article 51
of the UN charter. See Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 4) p. 4-5; Schmitt MN, Tallinn Manual on the International

terms and concepts of this thesis, this chapter will seek to discuss the meaning of some
terms and concepts in relation to cyberspace. Therefore, this chapter will begin with
defining cyberspace and discussing the legal implications of cyberspace with regards to
the specialized regime of international humanitarian law. After ascertaining the basic
legal and technical understanding of cyberspace, the chapter will discuss how military
action is perceived when conducted in cyberspace in the jus in bello. Finally, the
remainder of this chapter will seek to clarify digital computer data and how it is used
throughout this thesis, since it has such a central role in understanding both the questions
and conclusions reached.
2.2 The Cyberspace
Although a majority of people are connected to cyberspace on a daily basis through the
use of connected devices (smartphones, computers, tablets), it is important to clarify the
meaning of the word itself. The prefix, cyber, comes from the Greek verb kyberno which
means to steer or to govern.50 In language, the use of the cyber prefix in conjunction with
nouns such as war or terrorism transports these nouns into the virtual arena which makes
up cyberspace.51 The actual word cyberspace was first used in 1984 by the writer William
Gibson and is credited to him and his book Neuromancer. In the book, Gibson defines
cyberspace as:
“a consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every
nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts... A graphical representation of
data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable
complexity. Lines of light ranged in the non-space of the mind, clusters and constellations
of data”.52

Gibson’s perception of cyberspace was not far from the current understanding of
cyberspace after all, today cyberspace does indeed share some of the same characteristics
that he envisioned. The global aspect of cyberspace has time after time been
acknowledged, especially by military manuals, because it opens up for attacks at physical
infrastructure within the borders of a state even without access to said states territory.53
This follows from the fact that cyberspace is virtually “created by the connection of
physical systems and networks, managed by rules set in software and communications
protocols.”54 Rattray’s perception of cyberspace points out that there are different layers,
which are inherent to cyberspace as a whole. He distinguishes both the physical and nonphysical layers of cyberspace.55
The Tallinn Manual 2.0 furthers this definition, by adding a layer to the ones suggested
by Rattray. According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0 cyberspace is made up of three layers: a
physical, a logical and a social layer. Naturally, the physical layer consists of physical
objects or hardware such as cables, routers, servers and computers. The logic level,
however, comprises of connections, which exist between different network devices and
facilitates the exchange of data between devices on the physical layer through
applications and protocols. Lastly, the social layer consists of the users who engage in
activities in cyberspace.56 At this point, it is important to state that cyberspace should not
be equated with the internet. The internet is part of cyberspace, but cyberspace is vastly
more widespread than just the internet which could be perceived as comprising only of
the physical and logical layers of cyberspace.57 As for cyberspace, the Tallinn manual
2.0, defines cyberspace as “[t]he environment formed by physical and non-physical
components to store, modify, and exchange data using computer networks”.58

For some scholars, cyberspace has emerged as a fifth domain of warfare, in addition to
the four formerly recognized domains, land, air, sea and space.59 However, there is one
major difference in characteristics of cyberspace which is the fact that it is totally man
made, as opposed to the naturally occurring domains.60 Considering that cyberspace
should essentially be understood as, “the sum of technology, people, and procedures that
employ the Internet to achieve actions ranging from personal communications, the
conduct of business and government, to the coordination and support of processes and
activities that rely on data and synchronization delivered by and through the Internet”,61
the reach of state sovereignty in cyberspace has to be considered. Since the physical layer
or cyber infrastructure, located within a state's territory falls within the territory of the
state where it resides it also falls within that state’s sovereignty.62 However, how do the
virtual elements and actors of cyberspace fair in light of state sovereignty?
The Tallinn Manual 2.0, states that “no state may claim sovereignty over cyberspace per
se… because much of cyber infrastructure comprising cyberspace is located in the
sovereign territories of States.”63 However the manual still considers that all layers of
cyberspace are encompassed by the principle of sovereignty.64 Consider the social layer
of cyberspace, which encompasses individuals and groups conducting cyber activities,
states can exercise their sovereignty over these actors, through the use of various
jurisdictions. A state can exercise jurisdiction over both cyberinfrastructure and its
nationals located within its territory.65 In addition, according to the active nationality
principle, states can exercise jurisdiction over their nationals regardless whether on
domestic territory or abroad.66 Therefore all actors of the social layer fall within state
sovereignty, even when cyber activities “cross multiple borders, or occur in international

waters, international airspace, or outer space, all are conducted by individuals or entities
subject to the jurisdiction of one or more States.”67 This also holds true for any objects
that are within state sovereignty but whether applications, data and internet protocols of
the logic layer suffice as objects will further be explored in chapter 3, explicitly with
regards to data.68
2.3 Data defined
At its most basic level digital data is formed by the complex succession of 1s and 0s. This
is commonly known as binary, which computers through software and protocols can
interpret and turn into something that users can perceive, like the text of this thesis for
example. However, it should be noted that data is not only limited to documents of text
stored on computers. The binary code can constitute anything from computer code for an
application on a smartphone or a military missile system, both are just as much data as
the protocols of a credit card company which handles transactions when made by the
card's user.69 Simply put, data are information, and because all computers use binary data
on a rudimental level it can be created, processed, saved, and stored. In addition, this
allows for data to be transferred between computers either through network connections
or with a media device, since data itself does not deteriorate over time or because it is
used.70
The binary code of otherwise unreadable data is what the so-called logic layer of
cyberspace is composed of, which inter alia is recognized in the Tallinn Manual 2.0.71
The Tallinn Manual 2.0 has defined data as “[t]he basic element that can be processed or
produced by a computer to convey information. The fundamental digital data
measurement is byte.”72 Some scholars have argued that data should be categorized into
different types of data depending on how it functions. According to Dinniss data should

not be understood as a single entity, but distinguished as two types of data, operationlevel data and content-data.73 Operation-level data is what gives data logic and is
essentially composed of program data or ‘code’. It is what gives hardware functionality
as well as the ability to perform pre-determined tasks.74 Content-level data on the other
hand, does not have functionality on the logic layer of cyberspace but is simply
information or text “such as the text of this Article, or the contents of medical databases,
library catalogues.”75
This thesis does not strictly adopt to consequentially use either data as such or contentlevel and operational-level data, as suggested by Dinniss.76 For example, in chapter 3, the
more general term data or computer data will be used, as it succeeds to encompass both
content-level data and operational-level data. However, in chapter 4 it sometimes proves
useful to distinguish between different types of data since special protection might be
afforded only to one of the different types of data. When using content-level data and
operational-level data, this thesis adopts the definition presented above as suggested by
Dinniss.77
2.4 The reach of international humanitarian law in cyberspace
It is now generally accepted that international law applies to cyber operations and to
cyberspace by both states and academia. The United Nations Group of Governmental
Experts on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the
context of international security (UNGGE) has been the primary forum for state
cooperation when discussing how international law pertains to information and
communication technologies (ICT). The discussions on information security started after
the Russian Federation submitted the first resolution on the subject to the UN General
Assembly in 1998, which eventually led to the creation of the UNGGE.78

In the 2013 report of the UNGGE, it reaffirmed that both international law and the UN
Charter is applicable to cyberspace and any acts conducted therein. 79 The group further
concluded that both “[s]tate sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow
from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction
over ICT infrastructure within their territory.”80 Later in the 2015 report as well as in the
final report of the UNGGE in 2021 it was affirmed that international humanitarian law
and especially the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction are
applicable to the use of ICTs by states in situations of armed conflict.81
Since the object and purpose of international humanitarian law is to regulate military
action in future conflicts while allowing for military necessity, international humanitarian
law treaties are adopted with the development of means and methods of warfare in mind.82
Therefore, as early as in the 1868 Declaration of St. Petersburg, it was stated that the
principles establish therein should be respected by “future improvements which science
may effect in the armament of troops”.83 Similarly, even though the use of offensive cyber
capabilities is not specifically mentioned in any of the 1949 Geneva Conventions or their
additional protocols, Article 36 of Additional Protocol I requires that any weapon, means
or methods of warfare used in an armed conflict is subject to international humanitarian
law. This is because states party to Additional Protocol I are required to, in their
development of new means and methods of warfare, ensure that their uses are in
compliance with international humanitarian law, however this obligation does not extend

to non-international armed conflict.84 The applicability of international humanitarian law
to cyber means and methods of warfare was reaffirmed by the ICJ in the 1969 advisory
opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, when stating that the
principles and rules of international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflict
“applies to all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons, those of the past, those of the
present and those of the future.”85
Several states have also recognized the applicability of international law as well as
international humanitarian law specifically, to cyber means and methods of warfare in the
context of an armed conflict, through public declarations of position papers on the issue.
For instance, the United Kingdom stated in 2021 that “IHL applies to operations in
cyberspace conducted in the furtherance of hostilities in armed conflict just as it does to
other military operations.”86 Similarly Australia held that “[e]xisting international law
provides the framework for state behaviour in cyberspace. This includes, where
applicable, the law regarding the use of force, international humanitarian law,
international human rights law, and international law regarding state responsibility.”87
Several other states have made similar declarations of their national positions on how
international law applies to cyberspace and the activities committed therein, inter alia:

nature.99 Since this thesis assumes the existence of an armed conflict the requirements for
an armed conflict to emerge will not be discussed further.100
States that have joined the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace have also
reaffirmed the applicability of international humanitarian law as well as international law
to cyberspace.101 Although the Paris call is not a legal framework, the declaration made
by states at the time of joining the Paris Call serves as proof of verbal state practice. At
the time of writing, 81 states have already joined and made the call.102 Among the most
recent are the United States of America as well as the European Union.103 By all accounts,
both state praxis and the international framework in place, suggest that international
humanitarian law is applicable to cyber operations or state use of ICTs in armed conflicts.
2.5 Military operation and attacks in cyberspace
Military action conducted through cyberspace usually falls within the definition of either
a military operation or an attack. However, since the laws of armed conflict were
developed in the 1800s and the 1900s, they do not always adequate kinetic military action
and cyber military action, as suggested earlier. In treaty law, Additional Protocol I
provides for the protection of civilians and civilian objects from attack,104 the prohibition
is also considered to be customary international humanitarian law.105 As opposed to
military operations in general, attack means “acts of violence against the adversary,
whether in offence or in defence.”106 The distinction between military operations and
military attacks is therefore based on the fact that the use of violence during military
action makes it an attack as opposed to non-violent military action. Non-violent military

action, on the other hand encompasses any non-violent military operation.107 This
interpretation is supported by the commentary of Bothe, Partsch and Solf which states
that: “[t]he term ‘acts of violence’ denotes physical force. Thus, the concept of ‘attacks’
does not include dissemination of propaganda, embargoes, or other non-physical means
of psychological or economic warfare.”108
In addition, the 1987 ICRC commentary on Additional Protocol I states that “the term
‘attack’ means ‘combat action.’”109 Non-violent military operations as those described by
Bothe, Partsch and Solf, are generally considered to be lawful as long as they do not cause
physical harm or human suffering.110
It is however important to consider that attacks are not only limited to such combat action
that uses physical or kinetic force.111 Both the text and commentary of the Additional
Protocol I, suggest that physical violence is required, since most attacks during the time
of drafting employed some kind of kinetic weapon, which caused physical damage when
used.112 However, considering the primary purpose of the Additional Protocol I is to allow
for military necessity while affording effective protection to civilians113 and if interpreting
the treaty “with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context
and in the light of its object and purpose”114, it is argued the drafters of Additional
Protocol I must have intended the Protocol to protect the civilian population from the
violent consequences of an attack, rather than from the act of an attack.115 This approach

is suggested to be more in line with the general theme of the protections of the Additional
Protocol I.116
There exists some means and methods of warfare that rely on biological, chemical or
radiological components in causing damage rather than relying on kinetic components, as
traditional weapons of warfare. For these non-kinetic weapons, the act of using such
means and method of warfare would not be a violent act as such, because the act of
deploying such a weapon does not use physical violence. However, the consequences of
using means and methods relying on biological, chemical or radiological components
could lead to consequences that in turn are harmful or lethal.117 It is therefore more
appropriate for these non-kinetic weapons to use the doctrine that suggested above which
relies on violent consequences to qualify as an attack.118 The shift in focus to the violent
consequences of an act has seemed to gain ground considering that the ICTY stated in the
Tadic case, that a general consensus has emerged where the use of chemical weapons
against the civilian population is prohibited.119
The doctrine is also supported by the conclusion of the ICRC commentary on Additional
Protocol I, which considers an attack to encompass any combat action.120 Additionally,
Article 51(1) states that the “‘civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy
general protection against dangers arising from military operations.”121 Likewise, Article
57(2)(a)(iii) respectively 57(2)(b) mentions that attacks which could result in the “loss of
civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof”122

should be avoided or suspended.123 Article 57 of Additional Protocol I, containing
precautions in attack, is also considered to be customary international law in both
international and non-international armed conflicts, although Additional Protocol II does
not contain a similar provision.124
The realm of cyber warfare is similar to some extent to means and methods of warfare
that rely on biological, chemical or radiological components. Similarly, cyber warfare can
be conducted as to, for instance alter “the running of a SCADA system controlling an
electrical grid and results in a fire”125 or, a cyber operation could be conducted to
manipulate an enemy’s air traffic control tower resulting in the crash of an airplane.126
Because the consequence of such a cyber operation is destructive, entailing an act of
violence, the operation would qualify as a cyber attack rather than a cyber operation.127
When it comes to cyber operations that have violent consequences, this thesis adopts the
definition of a cyber attack suggested in the Tallinn Manual 2.0. According to the
definition: “[a] cyber attack is a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is
reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to
objects.”128 In addition, it would be reasonable to consider that cyber operations, which
are conducted with the primary purpose of spreading terror would be prohibited, pursuant
to Article 51(2) of Additional Protocol I as well as Article 13(2) of Additional Protocol
II, since they prohibit “acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to

spread terror among the civilian population.”129 Additionally, the prohibition is
considered customary international humanitarian law.130
A military cyber operation that does not rise to the level of an attack is primarily a nonviolent military operation. Cyber espionage, operations of psychological warfare (not
arising to the level of causing terror) or operations denying access to a certain kind of
service that would be regarded to be akin to jamming, would be considered lawful cyber
operations against the civilian population.131 In international humanitarian law there is
neither any prohibition against economic sanctions that target the civilian population.132
Therefore, cyber operations that are tantamount to the effects of economic sanctions are
lawful, as long as the cyber operation does not fall under the prohibition of destroying,
removing, or rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian
population of Article 54 of Additional Protocol I.133 As a general rule of thumb, some
scholars have considered that operations targeting civilians that cause only mere
inconvenience to the civilian population are considered to be military operations rather
than military attacks although this has to be evaluated case by case.134
The present chapter has only touched upon the most essential concepts and legal aspects
of cyberspace. In the following two chapters the issue of protection of civilian computer
data will be tackled. Therefore, chapter 3 begins with considering whether civilian
computer data can be considered an object of international humanitarian law.

3. Data as an object of international humanitarian law
3.1 Civilian objects and military objectives
The fundamental principle of international humanitarian law and a cornerstone of civilian
protection is the principle of distinction. The ICJ described it as one of the “cardinal
principles” of international humanitarian law and it was laid out as early as 1868 in the
preamble of the Declaration of St. Petersburg. 135 The Declaration of St. Petersburg states
that: “the only legitimate object which States should endeavour to accomplish during war
is to weaken the military forces of the enemy”.136 This is the first codification of the
principle of distinction, which can now be found across numerous treaties and military
manuals.137
Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions reiterates the principle of distinction in
Articles 48, 51(2) and 52(2).138 The basic rule of the Protocol (Article 48) ensures the
protection of both civilians (persons) as well as civilian objects and requires parties to a
conflict to distinguish between military and civilian and only direct their operations
against the former.139 With regard to objects, Article 52(1) prohibits attacks against
civilian objects by the means of reprisal.140 To ensure the protection of civilian objects,
both civilians and civilian objects are negatively defined in the Protocol as those objects
which are not military objectives per the definition of military objectives of Article
52(2).141

The principle of distinction can also be found in the Additional Protocol II, amended
protocol II and protocol III to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. 142 In
addition, international courts have also reaffirmed the protection of civilians and civilian
objects from military action, with the ICJ stating, in its advisory opinion on the Legality
of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, that: “[s]tates must never make civilians the
object of attack”143 and the Rome Statute of the ICC considering that attacks which are
intentionally directed at civilians or civilian objects constitute war crimes.144 The ICJ has
further stated that the principle of distinction is to be considered one of the
“intransgressible principles of international customary law”, therefore binding on all
states.145 The principle of distinction has been codified by the ICRC study of customary
international humanitarian law separately for persons and objects. The principle of
distinction pertaining to objects reads as follows: “[t]he parties to the conflict must at all
times distinguish between civilian objects and military objectives. Attacks may only be
directed against military objectives. Attacks must not be directed against civilian
objects.”146
As noted Additional Protocol I defines civilian objects as “all objects which are not
military objective”.147 Therefore, the definition of military objectives enshrined in Article
52(2) of the Protocol and international customary law becomes vital.148 The first
codification of a definition of military objectives was made in the 1923 Hague draft rules
of air warfare as “an objective whereof the total or partial destruction would constitute an

obvious military advantage for the belligerent”.149 However, this attempt of the Hague
draft rules of air warfare to codify a distinction between civilian objects and military
objectives did not make it to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, relating to the wounded
and sick and to prisoners of war, even though the rules of the Conventions were largely
based on a fundamental distinction between civilian objects and military objectives.150
Later however, Additional Protocol I took a similar approach, as the Hague draft rules of
Air Warfare, defining military objectives as follows:
“In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which
by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action
and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances
ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”151
According to the ICRC study on customary humanitarian law, this codification of military
objectives reflects customary humanitarian law applicable in both international armed
conflict and non-international armed conflict and therefore binding on all states.152
Similar codification of the rule is contained within several military manuals of states153
and supported by several official statements of states. Additionally, it is stated that states
who are not party to Additional Protocol I have shown that they support this practice.154
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia’s Committee Established
to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
also found and stated that both the protection of civilian objects as well as the definition
of military objectives is to be considered customary international humanitarian law.155

Essentially the requirements of a military objective of Article 52(2) of Additional
Protocol I establishes a two-pronged test.156 For the first prong, it has to be determined
whether the object makes an effective contribution based on either its nature, location,
purpose or use. The second prong requires that the destruction, capture or neutralization
of said object offers a definitive military advantage in the circumstances ruling at the time
of the attack. A military objective is present when the requirements of the two-pronged
test are fulfilled.157 Because the drafters of Additional Protocol I could not possibly
foresee the future developments of means and methods of warfare, the following
subchapter will explore both the qualifications of military objectives and military cyber
objectives.
3.2 The qualifications of military objectives
The qualifications of military objectives made in reference to Additional Protocol I are
largely based on the 1987 commentary of the protocol by the ICRC. The same
qualifications, however, are also present in customary international law.158 For a military
objective to be present the two subsequent requirements of Article 52 paragraph 2 must
thus be fulfilled. The object must make an effective contribution to military action either
due to its nature, location, purpose or use and the total or partial destruction, capture or
neutralization of the same object must at the time of the attack result in a definite military
advantage to the attacking party of the conflict.159
The first requirement is dependent on an objective’s effective contribution to military
action. An objective can make an effective contribution to military action in four different
ways. Firstly objectives, which by their nature make an effective contribution to military

action comprises of those objectives which would directly be used by the armed forces of
a state and are inherently used for military action. In traditional warfare, these objects
would include objects such as “weapons, equipment, transports, fortifications, depots,
buildings occupied by armed forces, staff headquarters, communications centres etc.”160
However, with regards to the cyber objectives, objects which by their nature effectively
contribute to military action could include “all weapons, weapons systems and matériel,
sensor arrays, battlefield devices, military networks and databases, military command and
control systems, communications systems and any other digital device purposely built to
military specifications."161
Equally, data that constitutes a cyber weapon is considered to be a military objective. This
conclusion is in part made of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 Rule 103. According to which “cyber
means of warfare that are used, designed, or intended to be used to cause injury to, or
death of, persons or damage to, or destruction of, objects, that is, that result in the
consequences required for qualification of a cyber operation as an attack”. 162 The
operation of executing such a weapon would amount to an attack for the purposes of
international humanitarian law because the consequences of the operation would be
violent in nature.163 Therefore the same cyber weapon could be considered to be a military
objective due to its nature. Similarly, data that contains the information on troop
movement orders or timetables for military action, also represents data that would fulfill
the requirement of making an effective contribution to military action due to its nature.164
Objects which make an effective contribution to military action due to their location are
traditionally recognized as specific geographical areas such as a mountain pass or a
canal.165 These objects do not need to have a military function by their nature or be
military objectives as such but can become military objectives due to their location when

they become of importance for furthering military action. The location can in addition be
a site that is of special importance for military operations or that it must be controlled to
deny its use by the adversary.166 Physical examples of the objects fulfilling the locational
requirement are easy to come by but with regards to cyber objects the task is not as easy.
This problem arises mainly because of the distributed characteristics of networks.
Although, a cyber objective which might qualify is a civilian wireless network that is
located in a certain geographical area. If the wireless network would be located in an area
of hostilities the network might be an objective which the adversary military forces could
use to intercept the first states communications. The civilian wireless network could
qualify as a military objective, by the definition of the first prong of Article 52(2) of
Additional Protocol I, since it offers an effective contribution to military action due to its
location and if the territorial state would neutralize or destroy it they would gain a
definitive military advantage from the objective's destruction. Followingly, the data that
controls the network could also be targeted since it similarly amounts to a military
objective by making an effective contribution to military action by the location of said
wireless network.167
The final notion is of objects which effectively contribute to military action through their
use or purpose. The criterion of use is made in relation to the current use of the object’s
function, while purpose on the other hand is related to the future use of an object. Both of
these criteria are present since most civilian objects can become valuable military
objectives, and either be used as such or converted into military headquarters,
fortifications or other establishments used by the armed forces.168 The most common uses
of civilian objects that render the object a military objective is the use of civilian
transports, airfields and buildings by military personnel or objectives. In the same sense,
any cyber infrastructure connected to the object will simultaneously become a military
objective as traditional objects become military through their use. 169 Similarly, any data
that is part of the software or which otherwise makes an effective contribution to military

action could qualify as a military objective due to either its actual or intended use or
purpose. Some practical examples might be the data that operates civilian railroad
networks or the data that controls civilian radio or tv towers to broadcast military
information,170 other examples are for instance the data of a civilian software that controls
a satellite capable of taking imagery of the planet's surface which could be used for
military action thereby qualifying as a military object through its use or purpose depended
on if such purpose was planned beforehand.171
With regard to objects qualifying as military objectives, through their purpose, the
intended use of an object is vital. Evaluating the potential use of an object does not suffice
as a characteristic for determining the object’s contribution to military action due to the
reference to paragraph 3 of Article 52 in the commentary of Additional Protocol I when
regarding objects that are normally used by civilians.172 The criteria of purpose must be
evaluated after the original nature of the object but before the actual use, otherwise it
would be redundant in relation to the other criteria’s of the paragraph.173
The second part of the first pong of the two-pronged test requires that the objective makes
an “[e]ffective contribution to military action.”174 The effective contribution an objective
entail does not require a direct connection to the hostilities.175 It is however regarded that
the military action employed needs to have a certain nexus to the conflict. Otherwise
nearly anything could be labeled a military objective with the argument that it is
contributing to a state’s economy, thereby supplying its armed forces.176 Similarly the
1907 Hague Regulations prohibits states from destroying or seizing the enemy states

property ”[u]nless such destruction or seizure be imperatively demanded by the
necessities of war.”177 The Tallinn Manual 2.0 confirms the same principle, considering
the objective needs to be contributing to the military capabilities of one of the parties to
the conflict and referencing the prohibition set forth in the Hague Regulations.178
The second requirement of the two-pronged test requires that the total or partial
destruction, capture or neutralization of the objective must at the time of the attack result
in a definite military advantage to the attacking party of the conflict.179 According to
Bothe et al. the use of a definitive military advantage, is made to limit the scope of the
military advantage gained from an attack to a concrete and perceptible advantage, rather
than a speculative or hypothetical one.180 The limiting factor of the second prong can be
seen in the following example. Targeting a church would be an illegitimate targe since
that would gain no military advantage, however the church becomes a military object by
the use criteria if enemy troops were positioned there altering the equation of the military
advantage gained. Before the deployment of the troops, one could argue the church could
serve as a military objective due to its potential future use, however destroying it
beforehand would not offer a definitive military advantage in the circumstances ruling at
the time since the advantage gained cannot be a potential advantage.181
According to the ICRC customary international humanitarian law study; military
advantage refers to the anticipated advantage of the military attack as a whole and not
only as the advantage gained from isolated events or specific parts of the attack.182
However the military advantage gained cannot be calculated from the war effort as a
whole, rather the definite advantage must be calculated on the basis of a specific military

operation183 because every military objective that is attacked has to offer a definitive
advantage.184
The requirement of the advantage being military in nature generally consists of ground
gained or of either annihilation of weakening the enemy armed forces. 185 Targets which
are directly involved in supporting the logistics of armed forces or enabling military
communications and manufacturing weapons for the military can also be included.186 On
the other hand, a target which offers a political, psychological, or economic advantage
does not fall within the requirement of military advantage. Similarly, forcing a change in
the negotiation approach of the adversary, even if welcomed, through political or
economic targets that change in the negotiation approach cannot be deemed as gaining a
military advantage.187
According to several states, it is the responsibility of those planning and executing the
military operations to determine whether or not an actual military advantage can be gained
from the action employed on the basis of the information known at the time.188
3.3. Data in light of the definition of military objectives and civilian objects
3.3.1. Data as an object
In international humanitarian law, objects only appear in two categories: as civilian
objects and as military objectives. The 1949 Geneva Conventions and their additional
protocols are in large based on this fundamental distinction between the two and therefore
the definition of an object as such, becomes a vital question for the interpretation of the

rules of Additional Protocol I as well as customary international law. However, can all
things and thereby computer data constitute an object or are objects confined by certain
requirements?
According to the view expressed in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 it is vital to determine how
the term object is understood.189 The Manual references the ICRC Commentary of 1987
on Additional Protocol I which states that the word object “means something that is
visible and tangible.”190 Based on this understanding of the ICRC commentary the Tallinn
Manual 2.0 has concluded that data does not constitute an object in international
humanitarian law and is therefore not protected by the provisions protecting civilian
objects.191 However, the matter is controversial and requires further examination to
determine whether computer data constitutes an object of customary international
humanitarian law in the present day context. Therefore, the following chapters are aimed
at answering that question.
3.3.2. The ‘object’ requirement
According to the ICRC Commentary of 1987, it is apparent that the use of the word
‘object’ in English is traditionally conceived as something that is both visible and
tangible.192 The ICRC does this conclusion on the basis of the dictionary definition of the
Oxford English Dictionary (OED) of 1970, which states that an object is “something
placed before the eyes, or presented to the sight or other sense, an individual thing seen,
or perceived, or that may be seen or perceived; a material thing”.193 More generally, an
object is nowadays perceived as “a material thing that can be seen and touched.”194 In the
equally applicable French version of the protocol the word ‘biens’ is used. Similarly, to
the English version, ‘biens’ means something that is both visible and tangible. According

to the commentary both the English and French versions refer to something that is both
visible and tangible.195
When it comes to military objectives, the 1967 ICRC Commentary on Additional Protocol
I states that the use of the word objective is an abbreviation of the expression: objective
point.196 Again quoting the dictionary definition of the Oxford English Dictionary of
1970, the Commentary considers that an objective point is “the point towards which the
advance of troops is directed; hence, [...] the point aimed at”. 197 The same goes for the
French versions ‘objectif’ which in large is similar to the word used in the English version
and both versions intended both tangible and visible things in their own language. One
clear difference is however pointed out by the ICRC Commentary. The French dictionary
definition’s extended meaning of the word ‘objectif’, includes that an objective could also
be a general objective of an operation or rather the aim and purpose of said operation.
Therefore, the extended definition has been excluded by the Commentary. This statement
also follows the requirement of tangibility and visibility of an object that the ICRC stated
in the Commentary as discussed above. 198
Some scholars have criticized the view adopted by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 especially with
regards to data. For instance, Dinniss has argued that the ICRC 1987 Additional Protocols
Commentary on Article 52 of Additional Protocol I, does not require an object to be
material per se.199 Since the definition of the term ‘object’ referred to is a dictionary
definition and not a definition agreed upon at either the working committees or the
Diplomatic Conference200 Dinniss argues that the tangibility requirement set out by the
ICRC is therefore rather made as a distinction between different kinds of ‘objects’. The
fact that the dictionary definitions require something to be material to be an object does
not mean that the Additional Protocol I does. In other words, this distinction is made to

separate between objects as things rather than as an exclusion of an intangible object from
the definition of an object.201 Considering that the Geneva Conventions and their
additional protocols are based on the distinction between civilian and military as well as
an equally important distinction between people and things, especially with regards to the
treatment of both in different situations. Dinniss argues that setting aside any materiality
requirement of an object, made by the dictionary definitions, data would qualify as a thing
and not as a person. While data lacks a material component it is perceivable by the senses
in particular sight, and therefore ‘visible’.202
3.3.3. Interpretation and International Customary Law
Although the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties does not apply to the
interpretation of international customary law, the customary rule in question is identical
to that of Additional Protocol I Article 52(2).203 However, it is not uncommon that a
customary norm exists both in treaty law as well as in customary law, as stated in Article
38 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.204 As observed by Merkouris, the
case law of various international courts suggest that there indeed are rules guiding the
identification of customary law.205 For instance, in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ held that
“rules which are identical in treaty law and in customary international law are also
distinguishable by reference to the methods of interpretation and application.”206 Further,
in a similar notion, Judge Tanaka stated in the North Sea Continental Shelf case that “[t]he
method of logical and teleological interpretation can be applied in the case of customary
law as in the case of written law.”207
Therefore, recognized rules of treaty interpretation can be employed to understand the
meaning of the word object. This was the approach used by the experts of the Tallinn

Manual 2.0 while interpreting this customary rule defining military objectives, as seen by
the references to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties when
interpreting the ordinary meaning of this customary rule.208 According to the general rule
of treaty interpretation of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 31(1)
states that a “treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object
and purpose.”209
In other words, a treaty, and in this case its formation in customary international law,
should be interpreted textually, contextually and teleologically.210 With regards to the use
of the word “object” scholars have argued that the drafters of Additional Protocol I could
not have been able to perceive the development of technology and how vital computers
would be in the present-day context. Therfore, Dinnis argues that the distinction between
objects and non-objects should not be based on materiality but between things and people.
And if data is not considered as an object, the conclusion would be contrary to the object
and purpose of Additional Protocol I,211 which is to allow for military necessity while
affording effective protection to civilians.212
Similarly, Mačák argues that pursuant to Judge Tanaka’s statement in the North Sea
Continental Shelf case, the term object should be interpreted in light of its present day
meaning.213 In the Dispute Regarding Navigational and Related Rights case the ICJ held
that:
“Where the parties have used generic terms in a treaty, the parties necessarily having been
aware that the meaning of the terms was likely to evolve over time, and where the treaty
has been entered into for a very long period or is "of continuing duration”, the parties

must be presumed, as a general rule, to have intended those terms to have an evolving
meaning”214
Since Additional Protocol I fulfills the requirements set out by the ICJ, the evolved
meaning must be considered.215 According to the OED, the word object in technical use
is defined as “the thing or body observed with an optical instrument; (also) the thing of
which an image is produced by drawing or draughtsmanship.”216 And with regards to
computing “[a] distinct (or discrete) entity, as (a) a package of information (as a data
structure definition) together with a description of its manipulation; (b) a single graphic
image, or the data that produces such an image.“217 Some courts have taken an
evolutionary approach to interpretation. For instance, the Israeli Supreme Court held in
2006 that “new reality at times requires new interpretation. Rules developed against the
background of a reality which has changed must take on a dynamic interpretation which
adapts them, in the framework of accepted interpretation-al rules, to the new reality.”218
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties Article 32 addresses Supplementary means of
interpretation. According to the Article the preparatory work of the treaty and the
circumstances of its conclusion can be used in order to confirm the meaning of a provision
remains “ambiguous or obscure.”219 The provision is significant for interpreting the use
of the word object, since, according to Schmitt, the ICRC 1987 Commentary on the
Additional Protocol I reference to “visible and tangible”220 is precisely a clarification of
how the word object should be understood.221 Against this backdrop and that of state
practice, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 adopted a view which considered that data did not suffice
as an object of international humanitarian law. However, since international customary

law can change, the following section will deal with current state practice to determine if
data can be considered an object lex lata.
3.3.4. State practice
3.3.4.1 Usus
Recalling the fact that the definition of military objectives, pursuant to Article 52(2) is
considered international customary law, whether during an international armed conflict
or a non-international armed conflict,222 one of the requirements of customary law is usus
or state practice. As stated by the ICJ in the Continental Shelf case of 1985: “It is of course
axiomatic that the material of customary international law is to be looked for primarily in
the actual practice and opinio juris of States.”223 This section will in turn look at the
practice of States, since if practice has changed so can the rules of customary law also.
3.3.4.2 State positions submitted to the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing
Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security
Pursuant to Resolution A/76/135 of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing
Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security,
several states participated in the call to contribute their views on how international
humanitarian law applies to the use of state cyber capabilities or ICTs.224 In addition,
several states have issued state position papers on how they view international law in the
cyber context.
Of the fifteen states answering the call of the Group of Governmental Experts on
Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International
Security, three States expressed a position with regards to data as an object of

international humanitarian law. The first of the three countries, the government of Brazil,
did not take a distinct position on the issue, merely raising that whether civilian data
should be regarded as an object, is one of many issues with regard to the cyber context.225
Similarly, the second country Switzerland, does not exactly tackle the issue either,
whether data is an object or not and therefore afforded protection. On the other hand, the
government of Switzerland raises the challenging question of how data should be
protected in absence of physical damage which would engage the prohibition of attack.226
A question which would only be relevant if data would be considered as an object and
protected by the first paragraph of Article 52 of Additional Protocol I.227 Additionally,
the State of Switzerland proceeds by considering the fact that “the obligation to take all
precautionary measures practically possible to spare civilians and civilian objects plays a
particularly important role in the use of cyber means and methods of warfare.”228
In a similar manner as Brazil, the third of the countries, Romania touches upon the
ongoing discussion of data as a civilian object. Surprisingly however, the Government of
Romania takes an interesting approach, stating that since the discussion is ongoing
Romani adopts “the preliminary view that cyber operations against data do trigger the
application of international humanitarian law. Therefore, cyber-attacks can only be
directed against those data that represent military objectives according to international

humanitarian law and cannot be directed against those data that represent a civilian object
which must be protected under the principle of distinction.”229
3.3.4.3. The French Government
The French Government was one of the first States to state in a publicly released position
paper a view on whether data should qualify as an object. The position paper, entitled
“International Law Applied to Operations in Cyberspace, contains a similar reasoning as
the Romanian Government held in 2021, as discussed above. France takes a position
which is contrary to the conclusion reached by the majority of experts of the Tallinn
Manual 2.0,230 stating that: “Although intangible, France considers that civilian content
data may be deemed protected objects”.231 The argument is furthered by concluding that
data cannot be excluded from being an object, especially considering the digital
dependence of society since “such an interpretation would be contrary to the aim and
purpose of IHL.”232
Even though there is no direct reference to operation-level data as such, the French
government addresses this issue with regards to special protection, stating that “special
protection afforded to certain objects extends to systems and the data that enable them to
operate.”233 Therefore, the position paper of the French government takes a rather
inclusive approach, including both content-level data as well as when qualifying for
special protection including also operation level data.234 The issue of special protection
of data will be further discussed in the following chapter, chapter four.

“The majority of the International Group of Experts agreed that the law of armed conflict notion of
‘object’ is not to be interpreted as including data, at least in the current state of the law. In the view of these
Experts, data is intangible and therefore neither falls within the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the term object, nor
comports with the explanation of it offered in the ICRC Additional Protocols 1987 Commentary.” Tallinn

3.3.4.4. The Israeli Government
The Israeli Government stated their position on the application of international law in
cyberspace in a speech, which was given by Dr. Roy Schöndorf, Israel’s Deputy
Attorney-General at the Stockton Center for International Law on December 8 of 2020.
According to the transcript, the Israeli State considers that: “Objects for the purposes of
LOAC have always been understood to be tangible things and this understanding is not
domain-specific.”235 They therefore concluded, as the majority of the Tallinn Manual 2.0,
that data does not in the current context of the law of war constitute an object.236
3.3.4.5. The Finnish Government
The Finnish Government issued a public position paper in 2020 which dealt with
international law and cyberspace. The Finnish position does not raise the ongoing debate
of whether data constitutes an object. Rather Finland has adopted the position that when
planning how cyber means and methods of warfare are used, both their direct and indirect
effects shall be accounted for.237 As other States have held this does not encompass
civilian data because it does not fall within the protection of civilian objects. However,
the Finnish State position goes on to state that: “Constant care shall be taken to ensure the
protection of civilians and civilian objects, including essential civilian infrastructure,
civilian services and civilian data.”238
3.3.4.6. The Federal Government of Germany
The Federal Government of Germany issued their public position paper in early 2021.
Generally, it accepts the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyberspace and
defines when a cyber operation amounts to a cyber attack. The German paper does not

directly deal with the issue of data as a civilian object of international humanitarian law.239
However, in defining an attack the paper states that:
“Germany defines a cyber attack in the context of IHL as an act or action initiated in or
through cyberspace to cause harmful effects on communication, information or other
electronic systems, on the information that is stored, processed or transmitted on these
systems or on physical objects or persons.”240
Additionally, the position paper goes on to state that the Federal Government of Germany
does require a cyber attack to be violent as regarded in Additional Protocol I Article 49(1).
Considering these notions, the position paper seems to adopt the same view as that of the
French government, something that becomes even more obvious as the paper takes the
view that ‘data stocks’ can be considered a potential civilian object.241
3.3.4.7. Organization of American States
The Inter-American Juridical Committee of the Organization of American States (OAS)
has published a report which states the practice and conviction of how international law
should be applied to cyberspace according to the following states: Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,
Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guyana, Peru, and the United States.242 According to
the report, which was published in November 2020, none of the states was of the view
that “civilian data is directly subject to the principle of distinction in armed conflict.”243
Regardless, Chile considered that the principle of distinction should be considered when

cyber operations are targeting data if it could affect the civilian population.244 Guyana
adopted a similar view where states employing cyber operations should refrain from
attacking data. The view adopted by Chile and Guyana therefore falls within the inclusive
approach to civilian data as an object of international humanitarian law.245
3.3.4.8. The summarized position of states
State practice is de facto scarce, when it comes to public state positions on the application
of international law to cyber operations. Of the reviewed state position papers, a very
limited part is made with regards to data and even fewer with regards to the notion of
civilian data. The positions presented in this subchapter are reflective of only a small
portion of the international community. When including the states that participated in the
OAS report on “International Law and State Cyber Operations”, ten states have publicly
stated that they do not consider data to be an object of international humanitarian law.246
However, out of these ten, two states Chile and Guyana were of the view that the principle
of distinction should be considered when attacking civilian data if it could result in
negative effects on the civilian population.247
The position papers of Switzerland and Brazil have opened up for discussions
surrounding the issues of applying international law to the notion of data as a civilian
object. However, they have not divulged their official positions on the matter. 248 Of the
state positions papers only the governments of Germany, Finland, France and Romania

have adopted a position in which the principle of distinction would require them to treat
civilian computer data as a civilian object coupled with the required protection regimes.249
3.3.5. Conclusions: Data an object?
The object of chapter 3 has been to determine whether civilian data can be seen as an
object of international humanitarian law lex lata. As stated by Schmitt “the line between
lex lata and lex ferenda is horribly indistinct.”250 Because the issue at hand is in relation
to international customary law, rather than to explicitly treaty law, the importance of
official state positions has been considered, because as stated by the ICTY, when
considering whether a crystallization of a customary rule of international humanitarian
law has emerged “reliance must primarily be placed on such elements as official
pronouncements of States, military manuals and judicial decisions.”251 For a new norm
of customary international law to crystalize both sufficient state practice and opinio juris
would be required.252 On this matter the ICJ stated in the North Sea Continental Shelf
cases that:
“State practice, including that of States whose interests are specially affected, should have
been both extensive and virtually uniform in the sense of the provision invoked; -and
should moreover have occurred in such a way as to show a general recognition that a rule
of law or legal obligation is involved.”253

To date, only a handful of states have explicitly stated their positions regarding their
understanding of how the rules of international humanitarian law pertain to data in
relation to the term object. In the practice of only a few states data does constitute an
object of international humanitarian law, however most states have not openly divulged
their view on the matter.254 Considering that it is essentially up to states to determine how
the rules of customary international law develop, the ICRC has called on states to take
clear positions on how international humanitarian law protects civilian data.255 However
as stated by Schmitt “there is some state practice and/opinio juris, but not enough to
definitively conclude that a new norm has emerged.”256
Does this mean civilian computer data can be attacked and exploited in any way? As
discussed above, the principle of distinction affords protection from military operations
amounting to an attack. By the doctrine adopted in chapter 2.5. that considers the violent
consequences of an attack rather than the violence of an act, any military operation that
has violent consequences qualifies as an attack. Therefore, if a military operation against
civilian data is bound to have a violent consequence against a civilian person or civilian
object then that operation constitutes an attack and is therefore prohibited.257
Even if the data is the intended target, whether or not it is an object of international
humanitarian law is irrelevant. Since any “cyber operation, whether offensive or
defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or
destruction to objects”258 constitutes a cyber attack. Therefore, attacking civilian data can
in some cases be prohibited, because of the consequences that attacking said data would
have on civilians and/or civilian objects that are protected.259 Considering the notion that
attacking some data can be prohibited, the next chapter will focus on determining whether

special protection of international humanitarian law can afford civilian data protection
from attack in armed conflict.

4. Civilian data protected from attack through possible special
protection
4.1. Special protection of international humanitarian law
The ICRC stated in its 2015 position paper on International Humanitarian Law and Cyber
Operations during Armed Conflicts, that civilian data should be protected since “medical
data, biometric data, social security data, tax records, bank accounts, companies’ client
files or election lists and records – are an essential component of digitalized societies.”260
However, as shown in chapter 3, data do not lex lata, constitute an object of international
humanitarian law at the current state of the law.261
Although all civilian data might not be universally protected from attacks, the law of
armed conflict does, however, offer special protection to certain objects and persons.262
In such a case when the attribution of special protection becomes relevant, the
understanding of the term object is not the issue, because the activities themselves enjoy
protection thereby, the data upon which such activities are dependent are protected as
well.263 Although originally stemming from treaty law, especially the 1949 Geneva
Conventions and their additional protocols, many of these rules are nowadays considered
customary in nature.264 Whether such rules can offer protection to civilian data lex lata
will be explored throughout this chapter.
4.2. Special protection afforded to medical personnel, objects and activities
One of the core imperatives of international humanitarian law is “mitigating, as far as
possible, the sufferings inseparable from war.”265 Therefore, the law of armed conflict
provides for an extensive protection of medical personnel, objects and activities so that

they can diminish the suffering and misfortune of the civilian population. The rules for
protection are found both in written treaty law as well as in customary international law.266
For instance, the first Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the
Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field (First Geneva Convention) provides in
Article 19 that medical units, both fixed and mobile, shall be respected and protected from
attack at all times.267 Additionally, the special protection afforded to medical services also
encompasses civilian hospitals as provided by Article 18 of the Convention Relative to
the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (Fourth Geneva Convention).268
Subsequently the Geneva Conventions provide further protection in all circumstances for
all kinds of medical activities civilian and military alike. 269 The protection of civilian
medical personnel was expanded in Additional Protocol I Article 15,270 which has gained
support in state practice also among States not party to the Protocol.271 With regard to
non-international armed conflict, common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions
requires that the wounded and sick be cared for,272 therefore protection of medical
personnel and activities is a requirement of the rule.273 In addition, Additional Protocol II

sets out the protection of medical personnel in non-international armed conflicts.274 The
special protection of medical personnel, objects and activities is considered customary
international law in both international armed conflict and non-international armed
conflict.275
Since medical activities as such fall under special protection, data used by the same
medical activities would also be protected under the same special protection. In other
words, all data that is personal medical files, both content- and operational-level data
required to operate medical equipment and programs would be protected against attack
or any operation that would negatively affect medical activities.276 The obligation to
respect, prohibits manipulation of data since such actions could cause irreparable damage
or suffering to persons as well as render the activities of medical units more difficult.277
The same view is held by the ICRC, considering that the obligations to respect and protect
medical facilities, encompassed in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and customary
international law, must be understood as extending to medical data whether an object of
international humanitarian law or not.278
State position papers such as that of the French government have stated that:
“Cyberoperations must also take into account the special protection of certain objects,
such as medical units…This protection extends to ICT equipment and services and to the
data needed to operate them, such as medical data linked to the operation of a hospital.“279
Furthermore, the view of the French government is also that the systems and data needed
to operate the systems are protected by the special protection.280 Scholars have also

recognized the fact that attacks and operations against medical data stored in hospital

The special protection afforded to medical activities ceases only if they commit actions

The protection of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population stems
from the general prohibition on attacking civilian objects in Article 52(1) of Additional
Protocol I, as shown above the prohibition forms customary law as well.283 Additionally,
a more specific prohibition is set out in Additional Protocol I Article 54(2), which states
that it is prohibited to attack, destroy or render useless objects which are indispensable
for the survival of the civilian population.284 The objects in question are regarded as
“objects for subsistence”285 including, inter alia, “agricultural areas for the production of

foodstuffs, drinking water installations and supplies, and crops.”286 With regards to foodstuffs, Article 54(1) states that using starvation as a means of warfare is prohibited,287
thereby extending the protection to virtually encompass anything in the food producing
industries.288 Several military manuals of states provide for this protection of objects
indispensable to the survival of the civilian population,289 and the Rome Statute of the
ICC labels the deprivation of these objects a war crime.290 In the case of a noninternational armed conflict, Additional Protocol II Article 14 provides virtually the same
protections as Additional Protocol I.291 Additionally, there exists no state practice to
counter this rule.292 The prohibition to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects
indispensable to the survival of the civilian population constitutes international customary
law in both international armed conflicts and non-international armed conflicts.293
State positions by Norway and France have shown that any operation, whether cyber or
kinetic, denying the use of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population
is prohibited.294 Therefore the protection also covers content- and operational-level data
needed for the functioning of these objects, whether data constitutes an object or not is
irrelevant.295

4.4. Works and installations containing dangerous forces
Works and installations containing dangerous forces are subject to special protection in
treaty law and international customary law. In treaty law, the special protection is
enshrined with regards to international armed conflict in Additional Protocol I Article
56,296 and for non-international armed conflict in Additional Protocol II Article 15.297 In
treaty law, the works and installations such as dams, dykes and nuclear electrical
generating stations shall not be the object of attack whether a military objective or not.298
In customary law, the rule does not cover the same level of protection. According to
Customary law, particular care must be taken when planning and executing attacks, if
works or installations containing dangerous forces are the target of attack or in the vicinity
of an attack, to avoid the release of dangerous forces. According to the ICRC study on
customary law, this customary norm is not only limited to the listed works or installations,
other installations such as chemical treatment centers are also included.299 However, it is
not clear that the duty to take particular care is imposed on other works or installations
containing dangerous forces. For instance, the ICRC 1987 Commentary on the additional
protocols suggests that although the list of objects is only illustrative, consensus could
only be found once Article 56 was limited to dams, dykes and nuclear electrical
generating stations.300 The Tallinn Manual 2.0 has taken the view that other works or
installations are not covered by customary law.301 The scope of protection is widely
covered in several state’s military manuals. In addition, numerous states have
incorporated attacks against works or installations containing dangerous forces as an

offense in domestic legislation. This customary rule is applicable in both international
armed conflict and non-international armed conflict.302
Data of civilian works and installations containing dangerous forces is protected from
attack at all times for those states that are party to Additional Protocol I respectively
Additional Protocol II. This protection extends to data even when it is considered a
military objective.303 The customary protection of data is not absolute since customary
law only requires that special care is taken when attacking works or installations
containing dangerous forces.304 Although data which is required for works or installations
containing dangerous forces is considered to enjoy the same special protection that the
protection of the objects themselves enjoy, the special protection is dependent on
individual state obligations in this case.305
4.5. Cultural property
Cultural property enjoys a wide range of protections, from different legal sources. First
and foremost, the 1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event
of Armed Conflict affords protection to cultural property pursuant to the following
definition “movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage
of every people.”306 The convention requires parties to respect and protect cultural
property in order to safeguard cultural property in the event of an armed conflict, a
requirement that can only be waived by imperative military necessity.307 The Convention
is applicable both in international armed conflict and non-international armed conflict and

binding upon 133 State parties, at the time of writing.308 The principles of the convention
are considered customary law in international armed conflict309 and the customary
applicability of the rule to non-international armed conflicts was recognized by the ICTY
in the Tadić case.310
Secondly, according to the Rome Statute of the ICC, intentionally attacking buildings
dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes as well as historic
monuments, constitutes war crimes under international customary law.311 The obligation
to refrain from damaging buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, education or
charitable purposes and historic monuments is also evident in state practice, which is well
established throughout numerous state military manuals as well as official statements of
states.312
Thirdly the Hague Regulations Article 56 states that “institutions dedicated to religion,
charity and education, the arts and sciences, even when State property, shall be treated as
private property. All seizure of, destruction or willful damage done to institutions of this
character, historic monuments, works of art and science, is forbidden.313 International
courts have also reinforced the protection of cultural property with the ICTY including a
similar prohibition in its statute under violations of the laws and customs of war. 314 All
of the above listed rules are considered customary international law and applicable in both
international armed conflict and non-international armed conflict.315

The special protections of cultural property in international customary law, listed above,
protects civilian data extensively. Military cyber operations are required to refrain from
damaging data that in turn would damage buildings dedicated to religion, education, art,
science or charitable purposes as well as historic monuments.316 The protection also
extends to the arts which through the development of technology has become digitized
and nowadays form a significant part of culture. Considering the definition of the cultural
property as something movable or immovable, the data used by software to render such
art is also protected by the requirement to protect and respect cultural property. In
practical terms, a digital copy of Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa could become protected
by the special protection of cultural property although it was a civilian computer object.
This does however require that the number of copies that can be made of said object is
limited and even, in some cases, that the original work of artr is inaccessible or
destroyed.317 Similarly, the same protection extends to any digital document that is of
“great importance to the cultural heritage of every people”318 a notion that includes for
example demographic data collected by the government.319
4.6. The natural environment
The natural environment is one of the objects that is afforded special protection through
international law. General protection is afforded by the fact that the natural environment
constitutes a civilian object. The destruction of the natural environment is prohibited as
long as the object of attack does not constitute a military objective.320 In international case
law, the ICJ stated in the 1996 Nuclear Weapons case that: “Respect for the environment
is one of the elements that go to assessing whether an action is in conformity with the
principle of necessit”.321 Similarly the Committee Established to Review the NATO
Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, held, with regards to
the environmental impact of the NATO bombings, was best evaluated against the

“underlying principles of the law of armed conflicts such as necessity and
proportionality”.322 This rule is considered to reflect customary international law in
international armed conflict, which is strongly reflected by both state practice as well as
official statements of States.323
The protection of data on the basis of the special protection afforded to the natural
environment cannot be directly afforded to data, because data does not constitute of the
natural environment, however special protection can be afforded consequentially. It is
therefore considered that “the destruction of the natural environment carried out wantonly
is prohibited. ‘Wanton’ means that the destruction is the consequence of a deliberate
action taken maliciously, that is, the action cannot be justified as militarily necessary.324
Damaging or altering data through military cyber operations that could lead to the
destruction of the natural environment is therefore also prohibited in international armed
conflict.325
Pursuant to treaty law, State Parties to Additional Protocol I are required to afford the
natural environment with enhanced protection. According to Article 35, State Parties are
prohibited to employ such cyber operations that “intended, or may be expected, to cause
widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.”326 According to
the ICRC customary international humanitarian law study, this rule is considered to be a
customary norm in international armed conflict. However, as shown by the commentary
of the customary international humanitarian law study, the customary status of this rule
is not unchallenged.327 For instance, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 refused to adopt this rule as
a customary norm of international law.328

Whether the status of this rule falls within the sphere of customary international law is
outside the scope of this thesis. However, the additional protection afforded by Additional
Protocol I simply enhances the more general protection discussed above. Since it would
be prohibited to attack data, although constituting a military objective, if the intended or
expected consequence of the attack would cause widespread, long-term and severe
damage to the natural environment.329 State parties to Additional Protocol I will have to
consider this protection when planning their military cyber operations.330
4.7. Humanitarian relief operations
Apart from the general protection of civilians,331 humanitarian relief operations are
protected by special protection in international humanitarian law. More specifically, the
Fourth Geneva Convention requires that States party to the international armed conflict
guarantee the protection of humanitarian relief operations.332 The same obligation is
further set forth in Additional Protocol I stating that: “The Parties to the conflict shall
protect relief consignments and facilitate their rapid distribution.”333
In non-international armed conflict, Article 18(2) of Additional Protocol II requires that
relief operations shall be organized with consent of the parties to the conflict.334 Although
it is not specifically required that these humanitarian activities are protected and respected
it is a prerequisite for humanitarian assistance. According to the Rome Statute of the ICC,
applicable in both international armed conflict and non-international armed conflict, it is

prohibited and considered a war crime to “intentionally direct attacks against personnel,
installations, material, units or vehicles involved in a humanitarian assistance or
peacekeeping mission in accordance with the Charter of the United Nation”.335 The same
view was adopted in the Statute of the Special Court for Sierra Leone336 as well as by
several resolutions of the UN Security Council with regards to conflicts in Angola,
Liberia and Rwanda.337 The special protection of humanitarian relief operations is
considered customary international law in international armed conflict and noninternational armed conflict.338
Since humanitarian relief operations require the consent of the parties to the conflict,
military cyber operations against data of the humanitarian relief operations can be
conducted as long as they do not interfere with their activities. This is pursuant to the fact
that according to Article 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention the parties to the conflict
have a right to search through consignments of humanitarian relief activities.339 However,
apart from that right to search through consignments, the data of humanitarian relief
operations is protected to the same extent as the rest of the operation.340
4.8. Journalists
In international humanitarian law, civilian journalists are protected pursuant to Article 79
of Additional Protocol I as civilians. The protocol requires that journalists are protected
from attack,341 which is also considered to be customary humanitarian law in international

armed conflict.342 For non-international armed conflict, there is no rule in Additional
Protocol II containing a similar provision to that of the Additional Protocol I. However,
there is a widespread practice that started before the adoption of the First Protocol which
suggests that journalists are protected as civilian persons. Therefore, the ICRC customary
law study found that journalists are protected as civilians in non-international armed
conflict.343
In the ICRC customary law study, the study concluded that customary law requires
journalists to be respected in addition to the requirements set out by Additional Protocol
I.344 However, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 did not go as far, considering that customary law
only obligates parties to a conflict to protect journalists from attack.345 Journalists should
not be confused with war correspondents, who are separately distinguished under
international humanitarian law and who accompany armed forces without being members
of the armed forces following the requirements set out in Article 4(A)(4) of the Third
1949 Geneva Convention.346
The Tallinn Manual 2.0 adopted the view that the equipment of journalists is not entitled
to special protection, and therefore a legitimate target for cyber attacks. Civilian objects
used by the journalists are protected as required by the general rules of civilian protection.
However, with regards to data the same reasoning follows as presented in chapter 3.3.
Because the protection of journalists is based on the protection that is generally afforded
to the civilian population as well as to civilian objects, the data of journalists face the
same dilemma as that of ordinary civilian data, as discussed in depth throughout chapter
3. Therefore, although journalists are considered to have special protection, the protection
afforded does not extend to their data since it does not constitute an object as such.347

The so-called special protection of journalists, at least as it is considered by the Tallinn
Manual 2.0, is problematic. This is because of the obvious fact that the requirement to
protect, does not afford journalists with any additional protection, as opposed to the
protections afforded to the civilian population as a whole.348 This means that special
protection does not extend to the activities of journalists and therefore the computer data
they may have.349 Because, the protection of journalists data requires that data would be
protected as a civilian object pursuant to the principle of distinction.
4.9. Conclusion: The special protection of data
Although data cannot, at the time of writing, be considered an object in existing law, that
does not mean civilian data is without protection. The special protection regimes of
international humanitarian law falling within the different categories presented
throughout Chapter 4, provide enhanced protection to civilian computer data. The gist of
the matter being that since the activities themselves enjoy special protection, the data used
by the activities is afforded the same protection. It is therefore irrelevant whether data
constitutes an object or not, because it is protected regardless.350 Additionally, in some
cases, as in the special protection of medical personnel, objects and activities, the military
action employed need not rise to the level of an attack, military operations against medical
activities are also prohibited and should be respected.351 Similarly, humanitarian relief
operations are protected extensively in customary international law. The computer data
that is used by these activities is protected from attack and must be respected in the same
regard as the operations themselves. Since the humanitarian relief operations operate by
requiring consent of the parties to the conflict, it would be possible for the parties to the
conflict to scour the data to check what information it holds. However, such activities can
not hinder the operations of the humanitarian relief activities.352

The data of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population holds its own
enhanced protection. The protection covers all content- and operational-level data that is
required for the operations of such objects, since international customary law prohibits
attacking, destroying, removing or rendering these objects useless.353 Dams, dykes and
nuclear electrical generating stations fall within the category of works and installations
containing dangerous forces. The protection of these objects is not as substantive as that
of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population. However, any cyber
attack or operation against such objects is required to take special care in conducting the
military conduct regardless of whether data is targeted or not.354
Civilian computer data falling within the vast definition of cultural property is extensively
protected. Following the broad definition of objects which are protected as cultural
property all data that either by itself falls under the requirements of cultural property or
consequentially affects cultural property in a negative way is protected from attacks. The
protection even covers content-level data such as demographic data and essentially any
data that qualifies as being of “great importance to the cultural heritage of every
people”355
However, the special protection regime of international humanitarian law is not perfect.
Journalists that are protected from attack as civilians fall victims of the same problematic
definition of objects as the rest of the civilian population. Until either the notion of how
an object is perceived in international humanitarian law changes or journalists are
afforded more extensive protection, they will fall victim to cyber attacks without
consequence.356 It is, therefore, important to note that the protection afforded through
special protection does not provide sufficient protection of civilian computer data. Rather
it should be regarded as a shortcut to protecting a small, although important part of civilian

5. Conclusion
The Russian invasion and the cyber attacks that followed against the Ukrainian
government in early 2022 has once again showed the destructive capabilities of cyber
warfare.358 Today data is an “essential component of the digital domain and a cornerstone
of life in many societies.”359 There is however differentiating views on whether data
should be considered an object of international humanitarian law and therefore protected
by the principles and rules governing the conduct of hostilities.360 Therefore this thesis
has examined whether data constitutes an object of international humanitarian law and
how the special protection of international humanitarian law applies to civilian data.
From a standpoint of enhanced civilian protection, it would be beneficial to consider that
civilian computer data constitutes an object of international humanitarian law. However,
such an inclusive approach reflects that of de lege ferenda and not lex lata, as has been
shown throughout chapter 3.361 One of the main arguments against civilian computer data
constituting an object of international humanitarian law, is based on the 1987 ICRC
Commentary of Additional Protocol I characterizing objects as “visible and tangible.”362
It should be noted that the commentary is made pursuant to treaty law rather than to
international customary law363 and that it is up to states to determine whether data
constitutes an object of customary international humanitarian law or not, which is why
emphasis has been placed on the two elements of customary law.364 Since the reasoning
of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is based in part on the ICRC 1987 Commentary on Additional

Protocol I, the author is eagerly awaiting for a renewed commentary on the First Protocol.
The ICRC has released updated commentaries on the First Geneva Convention in 2016,365
on the Second Geneva Convention in 2017366 and on the Third Geneva Convention in
2020.367 It therefore only stands to reason that after an updated commentary on the Fourth
Geneva Convention is released, there will also be one on Additional Protocol I.
With regards to treaty law, it must be considered that the drafters of the 1949 Geneva
Conventions as well as their additional protocols could not possibly predict the
development of technology or the implications such development would bring about.
Considering treaty interpretation, some scholars have argued that the word object should
be interpreted in light of its present day meaning, as opposed to the requirement set out
by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.368 However, such an interpretation
would only be legitimate following evidence of a change in how states perceive the notion
of an object, and such evidence has not emerged.369
Similarly, in customary international humanitarian law, with regards to computer data as
a civilian object, there is not enough state practice to consider that a new norm of
customary international humanitarian law has emerged or that the present one has
changed.370 In addition, the practice of states that does exist, is far from uniform and
cannot be considered as a “general recognition that a rule of law or legal obligation is
involved.”371 The lack of state commitment to publicly state how international
humanitarian law should apply to cyberspace, probably boils down to strategic reasons.
If states remain reluctant to share their views on the matter of how data should be regarded

in international humanitarian law, they can operate in somewhat of a gray area. In terms
of how this affects cyber operations and attacks, states would not have to apply the
principle of distinction when targeting, if the target would not qualify as an object or be
subject to special protection. Likewise, states would not have to factor in the effects of
cyber attacks in their proportionality calculations to determine whether the attack is
proportional in light of the gained military advantage.
Because the use of cyber means and methods of warfare allows for the targeting of even
smaller parts of systems connected in cyberspace, it should be noted that the specificity
level of which cyber attacks are conducted is always relevant when considering civilian
protection. Whenever data is targeted, it should be considered whether the military
operation disrupts the functioning of the system connected to said computer data, whether
content-level or operational-level. If that is the case, then the system using that data is the
intended target not the data itself, and the protection of civilian objects would be
applicable considering that the attacked system constitutes a civilian object.372
Additionally, as previously stated any “cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive,
that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction
to objects”373 amounts to a cyber attack and engages the protection of civilians and
civilian objects, regardless of the target being data, an object or not.374
Although, some data is indeed protected through special protection, the author considers
that civilian data is not adequately protected from the effects of hostilities in present day
context. To exclude data as an object, allows for the targeting of data that can cause
indirect harm to the civilian population. For instance, personal information, tax-records,
bank account information, or any other data could be acquired during a cyber operation
and used later outside the scope of an armed conflict to cause harm to civilians. According
to the views of the author, data should somehow be afforded similar protection to that of
civilian objects from an attack. Since the civilian population enjoys protection from the
effects of attacks, 375 the indirect consequences of an attack should also be considered. At

the time of writing however, this cannot be done since a cyber operation against data
would only in very specific cases classify as an attack. That is if it would amount to a
cyber attack which is a cyber operation “offensive or defensive, that is reasonably
expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.” 376 The
views of the author does however at the time of writing reflect that of de lege ferenda.
Finally, this thesis has only applied written law and international customary norms of
international humanitarian law. Other regimes of international law can also be applicable
although, international humanitarian law is usually considered to be lex specialis. The
legal regime of international human right law might afford further protection to civilian
data in situations of armed conflict whether international or non-international. For
instance, the ICJ has stated in the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons
advisory opinion that “the protection of the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant
whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in a time of national emergency”377
And in the more recent Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall case the court
considered that:
“that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed
conflict… As regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human
rights law, there are thus three possible situations: some rights may be exclusively matters
of international humanitarian law; others may be exclusively matters of human rights law;
yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law.”378
However, considering the applicability of civilian data protection arising from
international human rights or regional human rights frameworks such as the General Data
Protection Regulation of the European Union requires more research and is beyond the
scope of this thesis.
