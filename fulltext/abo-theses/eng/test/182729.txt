Abstract
The recyclability of materials and plastics in general has been discussed a lot in
recent years. The majority of the plastic waste ends up in landfills and is being
incinerated for energy. On the other hand, the recycling rate of plastics is still quite
low as the average in the EU of recycling of plastics is around 30 %. The EU has
also set targets for recycling until the year 2030. The proposal is that all plastic
packaging should be able to be recycled.
The aim of this thesis is to create a toolbox in which the extrusion process of how
polypropylene films can be recycled is described on a pilot scale. The toolbox can
then be used as a starting ground for how the recycling process can be achieved.
Two different polypropylene films have been used as the waste product: one that has
been printed on and the second that has been metalized. They have then been reextruded to determine the recyclability of these films. Different screws and methods
have been used to test out the processability of the recyclates with varying results.
The films have first been compacted before shredding them into smaller pieces and
then re-extruded with a 50/50 mixture of virgin pellets and recycled film flakes. The
processability of the printed film has yielded good results and the product is stable
enough to be recycled with minimal to no degradation to the polymer. The metalized
film with the aluminum layer is more challenging to recycle since the aluminum
present has caused the polymer to degrade more easily. The removal of aluminum
from the film before re-extrusion should be further researched.
The purpose of the thesis is to investigate whether the printed and metalized films
can withstand the extrusion process and what the effect of the re-extrusion process
on the polymer itself is.

Abstrakt
Frågor om miljö och återvinning har varit ett stort samtalsämne de senaste åren.
Särskilt plastskräp och vad som ska göras med det har diskuterats. En stor del av
skräpet förs till avstjälpningsplatser och en del bränns för energi. Andelen plast som
återvinns är liten, och inom EU ligger den på 32,5%. För att motverka det här har EU
gjort upp en plan som går ut på att alla plastförpackningar ska kunna återvinnas
senast till 2030.
I diplomarbetet har extrudering av två olika polypropenfilmer (PP) undersökts och
frågan har varit om dessa filmer går att återvinna. Utgående från resultaten har en
verktygsback, som ska kunna användas i samband med plaståtervinning i framtiden,
skapats. De två filmer som har undersökts är en tryckt film och en film med ett
metallskikt av aluminium. Filmerna har antagits vara rena eftersom det är
industriskräp som blivit kvar från tillverkningsprocessen.
Polypropen är en termoplast som används för diverse produkter, till exempel
förpackningar och leksaker. Polypropen är lätt, tål starkt slitage och är genomskinlig.
En plastfilm är en benämning på plast som har en tjocklek på högst 0,254 mm. Ifall
plasten är tjockare klassas den som skiva. Filmen används oftast som
förpackningsmaterial för matprodukter. Den tryckta filmen ger konsumenten
information om vad som finns i förpackningen, medan metallskiktet ger skydd och
fungerar som en barriär mot fukt, syre och ljus. För att trycka filmer kan
vattenbaserad tryckfärg eller icke-vattenbaserad tryckfärg användas. Genom att
använda vakuum kan aluminiumet förångas och deponeras på filmytan.
För återvinningsprocessen användes en extruder med två skruvar, där skruvarna
roterar åt samma håll inuti kanalen. En extruder kan definieras som en mekanism
som pressar en massa genom en öppning. Skruvarnas uppgift är att smälta, knåda och
bearbeta materialet inuti kanalen samt att föra materialet framåt till öppningen där de
sedan pressar ut den smälta plasten i önskad form, i detta fall som långa band som
sedan avkyls och skärs till pellets. Under den experimentella delen av den här
avhandlingen har en extruder i pilotskala använts för att utföra experimenten. Proven
har sedan analyserats i laboratoriet för att bestämma kvaliteten på den återvunna
produkten.
Innan filmerna kunde extruderas, måste de kompakteras och skäras i mindre bitar så
att de kan köras genom extrudern. Vid extruderingen gjordes en blandning av 50 %
plastfilm och 50 % naturell plastpellets. Tre provkörningar gjordes under arbetet: ett
förhandstest och två egentliga provkörningar. Tanken med förhandstestet var att få
en startpunkt och för att se ifall det över huvud taget är möjligt att återvinna PPplastfilm. För de olika provkörningarna användes olika skruvar för att se ifall ett byte
av skruv inverkar på plastens kvalitet. Skruvbyte var också nödvändigt för att göra
det möjligt att lägga fast en vakuumpump i anläggningen.
I samband med förhandsprovet kördes tre prov per material och tre kontrollprov
under samma omständigheter. Provkörningen gick bra och produkterna analyserades
efteråt. Den första riktiga provkörningen gjordes i slutet av mars och vakuumpumpen
orsakade några problem då smälttrycket gick drastiskt nedåt och polymeren gick
ii

sönder under extruderingen. Med den valda skruven gick det inte så bra att återvinna
plastfilmen i fråga.
Vid den sista provkörningen användes den första skruven med en modifikation för att
användningen av en vakuumpump skulle vara möjlig. En operator utförde alla test.
Dock gjordes provkörningarna utan vakuumpump då det märktes att pumpen sög upp
den smälta plasten. Ett flöde av kväve tillsattes. Det här gjordes för att kvävet tar
syrets plats inuti kanalen och genom det kan oxidering av polymeren undvikas. Efter
återvinningen hade båda de återvunna materialen en viss färg. Där filmen med
tryckfärg använts blev det återvunna materialet grönt och med den metalliserade
filmen blev proven gråa eller silveraktiga. De här kan förklaras med tryckfärgen och
med aluminiumet som fanns i filmerna från tidigare.
Av förhandsprovet och den sista provkörningen gjordes ytterligare en plastfilm där
jag undersökte hur bra kvaliteten var på produkten vid filmtillverkning. Vid visuell
inspektion av proven kunde geler och andra orenheter som tryckfärg och aluminium
märkas i filmen.
Alla prover analyserades i laboratoriet och från analyserna kan jag konstatera att den
tryckta filmen lämpar sig bra för att återvinnas och att det går bra att göra film på
produkten. Den metalliserade filmen var dock lite svårare att återvinna och
aluminiumet ser ut att orsaka degradering av polypropen.
Utgående från litteraturen som presenterats och provkörningarna kan jag dra
slutsatsen att det är möjligt att återvinna polypropenplastfilm och att filmen kan
användas på nytt. Vissa saker måste fortsättningsvis undersökas vidare, till exempel
hur det skulle vara möjligt att neutralisera eller få bort aluminiumet ur plastfilmen
samt hur tryckfärgen kan neutraliseras så att plasten skulle bli genomskinlig.
En annan fråga är huruvida det blir färg kvar inuti extrudern efter extruderingen av
de den tryckta filmen som i pilotanläggningen putsades bort med hjälp av att mata in
obearbetad pellets tills plasten vid utflödet var genomskinlig igen.
Som slutsats är det möjligt att åtminstone i en mindre skala återvinna
polypropenplastfilm och en någorlunda bra filmprodukt kan uppnås.

Literature Part

1. Introduction
There has been much discussion about the increased amount of plastics produced, the
usage of fossil feedstock, and littering of plastics. Many think we should start to
minimize the amount of plastics used and start thinking about using other raw
materials instead, since large amounts of plastic products are thrown into landfills or
energy recovery. Many of the products that go to landfills end up in the water
supplies. This causes environmental problems in the form of pollution (Tiseo, 2020).
The yearly global production of plastics is at 359 m metric tons (Tiseo, 2020). A
possible solution to minimize the amount of plastic products in landfills and burned
for energy would be to recycle these products at the end of their lifecycle. This
would be better for the environment in the sense that less and less plastics are thrown
away and the raw material could be reused to make new products instead.
In this thesis, an extrusion toolbox for the recycling of post-industrial polypropylene
(PP) films has been presented based on literature research as well as in a laboratory
setting, in order to verify the results of the theoretical framework. The toolbox will
support further work on developing recycling of polypropylene flexible packaging.
The recycling process is mimicked by shredding the films and then extruding. Regranulates are further tested and extruded into film as well. The films that have been
used in the experiments are considered clean and free of contaminants due to them
not being used as packaging materials, and because of that, the cleaning stages of the
recycling process have been left out of scope of this thesis.
Two different raw materials are used in the recycling experiments: One that has been
printed on, and one that has been metalized with aluminum. The printed films are coextruded polypropylene films with a surface print. The metalized film is also a coextruded polypropylene film with the metalized layer on the surface.
The purpose of the thesis is to investigate whether the printed and metalized films
can withstand the extrusion process and what the effect of the re-extrusion process
on the polymer itself is.

2. Plastics recycling
With the growing demand for a more sustainable and cleaner world, it is of interest
to minimize the waste produced from end of use plastics even when the main raw
material in the production of polymers is not oil. The depleting amount of oil is also
a future problem with several implications in many fields. Littering, the amount of
CO2 emitted when burning plastic waste, and climate change are problems we are
facing today. Today only about 14% of plastics are recycled worldwide and in
Europe the number of 32.5% is higher than the total global recycling (Sanchez, et al.,
2020). This means that if plastics could be recycled instead of being dumped in
landfills, it would be of interest to many companies.
Polymers can be derived from many fossil or renewable sources, for example
cellulose, coal, natural gas, and salt. Two main types of chemical reactions are used
to produce polymers: polymerization and polycondensation. In the polymerization
process, monomers (for example propylene, ethylene) are linked together to form
longer chains. (Plastics Europe, 2021)
The fact that plastics do not corrode and decompose at a slow rate is one of the
problems associated with plastic waste. The fact that plastics are widely used and
durable is causing challenges with the waste management of plastics as well. A great
solution would be to recycle them. The variety of different polymers, as well as the
additives and composites used, makes it more difficult than it would seem to recycle
polymers. (Shen & Worrell, 2014)

2.1 Circular economy
The European Union is currently looking into a circular economy strategy and it has
started to gain attention from manufacturers. This would change the current strategy
of a linear economy which depletes the natural resources, is harmful to the
environment, generates copious amounts of waste, and is a non-sustainable economy
by evaluating how plastic recycling can be made into a viable stream of the plastic
value chain. An upcycling and down-cycling of the recyclable plastics as a raw
material has been discussed as well, meaning that the plastics can get a new purpose
if they are of a worse or better quality than the original. (Sanchez, et al., 2020)
The difference between circular and linear economy is that a linear economy has a
straight path of manufacture, use, and dispose. A circular economy, however, makes
sure that the resources will be used for as long as possible, and that the maximum
value of the products will be utilized before the products are recovered and
regenerated into new products or materials of products that have served their
purpose. When circular economy has been utilized, it will then, as a result, improve
the competitiveness and resource efficiency of Europe. A figure of how linear and
circular economy differ from each other can be seen in Figure 1. (Plastics Europe,
2021)

2

Figure 1. Linear vs. Circular economy. (Tomra, 2020)

Considering that plastics have some unique characteristics, it will enable them to
play a major role in striving towards a future that is more sustainable and resource
efficient. Plastics could be helpful in the saving of key resources, such as energy and
water, building, and construction to name a few, this because plastics are versatile,
lightweight, and durable. By applying plastics in packaging, it could help to save on
food waste. For this to be possible, more and more plastic products must be
recovered in order to ensure that the products will not end up in landfills or in the
environment. (Plastics Europe, 2021)

2.2. EU targets for recycling
The current trend of how plastic waste is handled in Europe varies depending on the
country. Statistics for Europe as a whole show that the most common way of
disposing of plastics waste is energy recovery, followed by landfills. The recovery
and recycling are the smallest part of about 30%. Some of the plastics end up
uncollected in nature as well. Annually, 26 million tons of plastic waste is generated
in the EU. In 2018, about half of the collected plastic waste for recycling was
shipped to countries outside of the European Union. The reasoning behind this is the
lack of capacity for recycling, as well as the technology and the financial resources
being too limited to be able to recycle everything locally. (European Parliament, A,
2018; European Parliament, B, 2018)
Not having the possibility to recycle the plastics means great economic losses for the
EU, since much of the value of the plastics is lost after many products are used for
only a short time. The production and incineration of plastics emits around 400
million tons of CO2 worldwide. This amount would be reduced greatly with proper
recycling methods. (European Parliament, A, 2018)

3

In 2018, the EU backed the proposal that all plastic packaging waste should be
recyclable by the year 2030. The amount of single use plastics and micro-plastics
should also be limited, and these have even been banned as of the year 2021.
(European Parliament, A, 2018; European Parliament, 2019)

Figure 2. How different Countries in the EU recycle plastics packaging waste. (European Parliament,
A, 2018)

In Figure 2, the amount of recycling of plastics by different countries in the EU can
be seen. As can be seen here, there is a big difference between the various member
states. Finland does also have quite a low number of plastic recycling. The data from
this figure are from 2015.
A law called extended producer responsibility for packaging, which is restricted to
Finnish companies that have a turnover of 1 m € or more in Finland or that import
packaged products to Finland, has also been implemented. The aim of the legislation
is to reduce the amount of packaging waste, increase the reuse of packaging
products, prevent damages to the environment, and to remove the barriers to trade.
Finally, the aim is to prevent distortion and restriction of competition by having an
equal treatment of materials for packaging. In short, the legislation means that it is
the producer’s responsibility to organize and pay for the collection of and recycling
of the products used in packaging with other waste management included. These
should be in accordance with the regulations agreed upon by the European Packaging
waste Directive and the Finnish Waste Act. (Rinki, 2021)

2.3. Challenges with recycling of polypropylene flexible packaging
In general, the main challenge of recycling polymers is that the recycled products are
usually of lower quality than those made of virgin materials. Therefore, it would be
of importance to minimize or completely get rid of the color and metalized materials
from the recyclable films. When those are neutralized it should, in theory, produce a
better-quality product that would be quite close to the virgin material. (Strangl, et al.,
2020)
The positive side of being able to recycle plastics is that the amount of plastics being
dumped into landfills and then burned for energy would be minimized. This would
also limit some of the emissions that come from the burning of waste. It would also
extend the longevity of the plastics produced, if at least some of the plastics could be
recycled and reused for new applications. This would, however, depend on how
qualitative a product could be achieved during the experimental part of this thesis
and whether it would be possible to make a close-to-original product.
Considering that this is a new area of recycling, the theory behind what to do and
how is limited. By trial and error, it will be possible to obtain new information that
could be used after the thesis is complete. Due to the limited test-runs, and therefore
limited options available, there will not be a perfect formula for how to recycle
polypropylene films, but it will be a step in the right direction and will be a starting
point for how it would be possible to recycle different films. By having this
knowledge, it will be easier to continue research in the subject.
Usually, plastics that are recycled have been recycled mechanically. Depending on
the characteristics, some plastics, such as thermosets, cannot be recycled. Purity is
also a factor as to why some plastics cannot be recycled mechanically. Low purity
means that the plastic is a mix of multiple polymers, that it is a composite or
lamination with multiple layers, and/or if there are any additives or fillers present in
the polymer. (Shen & Worrell, 2014)
Feedstock recycling is another option as to how low purity plastics can be recycled.
This process means that the low purity plastics are transformed into syngas or liquid
fuel by pyrolysis. The new products can then be used in the steel and iron industry as
a reducer in blast furnaces and to replace coke and mineral oil. (Shen & Worrell,
2014)
Another recycling process would be to chemically recycle the end-of-use plastics. In
this process, the polymers are depolymerized to form monomers and then be again
polymerized to form a new virgin polymer. (Shen & Worrell, 2014)

3. Polypropylene
Since the discovery of polypropylene (PP) in the 1950s, the applications have
diversified over the years and the production of polypropylene has also grown. The
polymer has many desirable properties, such as it being lightweight, strong, and
having high heat resistance. Ease of fabrication is also a feature of polypropylene.
(Spaniol, et al., 2007)
Polypropylene can easily be used to manufacture in high volumes and the plastic can
be dyed different colors, if need be. (Doğan, 2012) PP is one of the most versatile
polymers for different end purposes and can be found in nearly every market of
plastic products (Allahvaisi, 2012).
Polypropylene is a thermoplastic and can therefore be processed with typical
thermoplastic processing techniques, such as injection molding and extrusion
(Doğan, 2012). In the experimental part of the thesis, the samples will be made using
an extrusion process. Extrusion will be discussed further in chapter 3.
In this chapter the basics, degradation, and stabilization of polypropylene will be
discussed, as well as the two types of films used in the thesis and what problems they
could cause during the recycling process.

3.1. The basics of polypropylene
The molecular formula of propylene is C3H6, and after ethylene it is the simplest
olefin. Propylene is called an olefin in the industry, and by using a catalyst it will be
polymerized into polypropylene. The used catalysts are a transition metal catalyst
and a metal alkyl co-catalyst. The usage of these types of catalysts is called the
Ziegler-Natta catalyst, named after Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta. (Malpass & Band,
2012) A figure of how polypropylene is formed using a catalyst is seen in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Polymerization of propylene. (Polymer Science Learning Center, 2021)

In PP polymerization, it is possible for the chains to form in three different manners:
isotactic, atactic, and syndiotactic. This is possible seeing as the methyl group
present in PP is prochiral, meaning that the molecule is not the same as its mirror
image. Isotactic means the same, i.e., all the methyl groups present are oriented in
the same way. An isotactic orientation is the most common in PP manufacturing. An
atactic polymer means that the methyl groups in PP are randomly oriented. This is
6

the least desirable product seeing as how the material will be rubbery, amorphous,
and tacky. The positive side of an atactic polymer is that the product can be used for
example as an adhesive. The third possible orientation of polypropylene is
syndiotactic, which means that the methyl group orientations are alternating from
side to side in a pattern. Both isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene have a
substantial crystalline structure. In Figure 4, the three different stereoisomeric forms
can be seen illustrated. (Malpass & Band, 2012; Busico & Cipullo, 2000; MerriamWebster, 2021)

Figure 4. Different stereoisomeric forms of PP. (Malpass & Band, 2012)

After an extrusion process, the PP pellets can then be used in the making of plastic
films. After the processing, the obtained films will be glossy with a high strength and
a high resistance to punctures. The films will have a moderate barrier against
moisture, gases, and odors as well, and the barrier properties will not be affected by a
change in humidity. Examples of usage of PP films are packages for cookies, snacks,
and dried foods. Other applications for PP are plastic moldings, stationary folders,
plastic tubs, diapers, and so forth. (Allahvaisi, 2012) More about PP films, both
printed and metalized, is discussed further in sections 2.3 and 2.4 of the thesis.
There are generally three main types of PP available: homopolymer, random
copolymer, and impact copolymer (block copolymer). Homopolymer is made in a
single reactor with the help of a catalyst. It is the stiffest and has the highest tensile
strength at yield of the three main types. In its natural state, it is translucent and
therefore has excellent see-through capacity and contact clarity with liquids. The
drawback is that it has a lower impact resistance compared to the other main types,
especially at temperatures below 0 °C. (Ednesajjad, 2013)

7

Random copolymer is made in a single reactor and has a small percentage of
ethylene (<5%) added into the mixture. By adding a little bit of ethylene into the
mixture, it will disrupt the crystallinity of the polymer and therefore the polymer will
be the clearest and the product will be of the most flexible variant. The disadvantage
of adding a small amount of ethylene is that the tensile strength will be the lowest of
the three main groups. (Ednesajjad, 2013)
The third main group is impact copolymer, otherwise known as block polymer. The
manufacturing process is different for the impact copolymer in the sense that
manufacturing is done in two reactors. In the first reactor, the homopolymer matrix is
made. In the second reactor, ethylene as well as propylene are polymerized. This
leads to ethylene propylene rubber being created in the form of microscopic nodules
distributed in the homopolymer matrix. This will have some improvement on the
impact resistance of the final product in both ambient and lower temperatures. The
end-product will then have an intermediate stiffness and tensile strength. Clarity will
also be impacted, and the product will become cloudy. The more ethylene that is
added, the better the impact resistance will be, but this also means that the stiffness
and tensile strength will be lower. (Ednesajjad, 2013)
There is also a possible fourth type of PP available called RAHECO, which is an
abbreviation of random-heterophasic polypropylene copolymer. It is a type of soft
propylene-ethylene copolymer. By having a specific combination of random
ethylene-propylene copolymer matrix and ethylene-propylene rubber, it allows the
polymer to have a unique softness and transparency. The combination also allows for
an enhanced compatibility and a reduction in particle size. (Gahleitner, et al., 2017)

3.2 Degradation and stabilization
Degradation is defined as the irreversible and detrimental changes of a polymer’s
molecular structure and macroscopic properties. These properties include chain
length, configuration of chains, stiffness, and so forth. (Kausch, 2005)
There are several types of degradation that a polymer may be subjected to during its
life cycle. These categories are chemical, thermo-chemical, photo- and/or radiochemical, physical, mechanical, environmental, and biological. For the degradation
of polymers, more than one factor can contribute to the degradation at the same time.
(Kausch, 2005; Yousif & Haddad, 2013) A table showing the origins of different
contributing factors to degradation can be seen in Table 1.

The most noticeable effects of degradation of a polypropylene on a molecular level
are chain scissions, discoloration, and the introduction of functional groups.
Scissioning of a polymer is defined as when a main chain breaks due to a chemical
reaction. MFR can be used as a measure of chain scissioning, it is desirable to find
out what and how much damage degradation has done to the polymer in all studies
and applications. The easiest of tests is the analysis of discoloration, since it can be
done visually. (Horie, et al., 2002)
Degradation can also occur during the polymer extrusion process. One of the
possible causes of degradation besides thermal and mechanical stress during
processing would be the presence of excess amount of oxygen in the molten polymer
inside the barrel. This causes oxidation of the polymer and the fast breaking of the
polymer in question. When the polymer starts to degrade inside the extrusion barrel,
the product outflow will become unstable and run out at a faster rate than it
otherwise would. Discoloration of the product will also occur. Instead of a clear
stream of molten polymer strings, the degraded polymer will be discolored and
exhibit from yellowish to a brownish color. If degradation occurs, it will lower the
quality of the polymer and productivity will also be hindered. (Takeuchi, et al., 1997)
Typical parameters to control during extrusion is the temperature profile, retention
time, and the amount of dissolved oxygen in the polymer inside the barrel in order to
suppress polymer degradation. If degradation occurs, it could be time consuming to
clean the extruder. Optical properties, mechanical strength, and processability, for
example, will be sacrificed by polymer degradation. Prevention of degradation is
vital for the productivity of the plant and steps to prevent degradation are needed
from both a mechanical and a chemical point of view. (Takeuchi, et al., 1997)
From different analyses, the main cause for discoloration, and therefore polymer
breakdown, seems to be the excess amount of oxygen present in the process, which
then causes oxidation in the polymer melt. To prevent polymer degradation and to
make the plasticized polymer stable, some steps can be taken. One option is
decreasing the amount of oxygen in the molten polymer, and another is through heat
history reduction. By changing the screw geometry, the problems with degradation
9

could be solved. (Takeuchi, et al., 1997) Other methods to reduce the dissolved
oxygen inside the molten polymer would be to pump nitrogen (N2) into the barrel
during the process. The task of the nitrogen is to displace the oxygen present and it
could eliminate the degradation of polymers in the extrusion process. (Maiorano,
2020)
Then how does stabilization of polymers work and how is it achieved? Much
research has been done on the subject practically from the beginning of the discovery
of polymers, and it is still being researched to this day. Some progress has been
made, but there is still much to do. By using additives in the form of antioxidants, a
more stable polymer can be achieved. Depending on the wanted properties, different
antioxidants can be used. As mentioned before, less degradation can also be achieved
with the help of different screw geometries, such as to change the temperature
profile. (Solera, 1998)

3.3. Polypropylene printed films
PP film is the most adaptable packaging material, the reason being the low density,
higher melting point, high barrier properties for gases, as well as chemical and
substance resistance (diluted acids, alkalis, grease, oil, and alcohol). Water
absorption is nonexistent, and decomposition is not present when in contact with
fungi and bacteria. PP is also free of bisphenol A and BPA. BPA is non-suitable for
food packaging, seeing as it has been discovered that it will discharge and be
absorbed into food. It has been shown that BPA can have a health effect on the brain
and on children’s and infants’ behaviors. Films from polypropylene are replacing
other packaging materials, such as polyethylene and PVC. The total European plastic
demand is about 51.2 million metric tons out of which around 40% is used in the
packaging sector. (Ednesajjad, 2013; Packline Solutions, 2021; PlasticsEurope,
2019) An example of printed polypropylene film can be seen in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Example of polypropylene printed film. (Alphapolymers, 2021)

10

The films can be manufactured in different ways. The films can be un-oriented, uniaxially oriented, or bi-axially oriented. A film is defined by its thickness. If the
thickness is lower than 0.254 mm, the material is called a film. Anything thicker than
that is defined as a sheet. The most used resins have a melt-flow index of about 2–8
g/10 min. (Ednesajjad, 2013)
Most of today’s packaging films that are multilayered use between 3–12 layers joint
together. By using multiple layers, and different materials for the different layers,
better mechanical and physical property combinations can be achieved. These
properties include puncture, heat and tear resistance, and improved moisture and
oxygen barriers. By combining different polymer layers, the packed products will
have an increased shelf-life. This is done by controlling the rate of oxygen, carbon
dioxide, and moisture that is transmitted. The concentration of the oxygen inside the
packaging is also controlled to preserve freshness of the produce longer than
normally. (Polymer Properties Database, 2021)
Films that need a better mechanical strength or heat resistance than films out of highdensity polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and linear lowdensity polyethylene (LLDPE) will use polypropylene layers. PP will also provide
basic strength to the packaging and act as a moisture barrier. (Polymer Properties
Database, 2021)
Through printing on the films, the consumer is informed of the contents of the
packaging. The importance of using the right ink is that the ink used cannot change
the properties of the films. The ink also cannot be destroyed when packaging the
products or when the consumer buys the product in question. (Gecol, et al., 2001)
Ink can be described as a dispersion of pigments or dyes in a liquid carrier. There are
two commercially used inks: ultraviolet curing printing inks and conventional inks.
Plastic containers and closures, which includes cups, tubes, and lids, use the
ultraviolet curing inks. Flexographic or gravure printing processes use conventional
methods to print on plastic films with conventional inks. (Gecol, et al., 2001)
Conventional inks use pigments, binders, carriers, and additives as the main
ingredients. Pigments, both organic and inorganic, produce the color and opacity for
the inks and impact on the fluidity of the ink. The task for the binders is that the ink
can be dispersed and that the ink will be retained on the plastic film after printing.
Binders are usually low molecular weight polymer resins. (Gecol, et al., 2001)
The carrier is a liquid that makes the ink flow and makes it possible for the ink to be
transferred to the wanted surface. After the carrier has done its job, it should
evaporate completely. Possible additives in inks include waxes, surfactants, drying
agents, and antioxidant additives. (Gecol, et al., 2001)
Conventional inks are classified into two categories: solvent- and water-based. This
classification is done depending on the carrier. Solvent-based inks use solvent,
solvent mixtures, or water-compatible solvent as the carrier, while water-based use
water as the carrier. However, the water can also be mixed with up to 20% of
alcohol. The size of the pigment particles is smaller for water-based inks than inks
with an oil base. (Gecol, et al., 2001)
11

Acidic resins, that dissolve or scatter in water when neutralized by organic bases
(amines), are used as a binder in water-based inks. Acrylics are mostly used in waterbased inks because of the nonfoaming properties, faster drying, better dispersion,
heat resistance, level of gloss, and the longer shelf life. Water based inks have the
pros of being non-flammable, giving fewer toxic vapors, and not contaminating the
products inside the packages. The con with water-based inks is that there is more
energy needed to dry the inks. It also produces a lower quality print than a solventbased film. (Gecol, et al., 2001)
Because of the environmental regulations that restrict the amount of volatile organic
compounds in flexographic and gravure printing emissions, the usage of water-based
inks has become common. (Gecol, et al., 2001)

3.4 Polypropylene metalized film
When more demanding barrier properties are needed for packaging, the plastic films
can be laminated with aluminum foil or then be combined with a metalized film.
With the aluminum layer, the transmission rate of water and oxygen is greatly
reduced. The aluminum also provides a glossier and more metallic look to the plastic
film. It is also a good barrier against vapor and aroma as well as working as a light
barrier. Recently, the use of aluminum foil has been reduced, since it is more
difficult to recycle. Also, since the metalization process has been developed it has
replaced the more expensive aluminum foil laminate. (Polymer Properties Database,
2021) An example of metalized polypropylene film can be seen in Figure 6.

Figure 6. Example of metalized polypropylene film. (IndiaMart, 2021)

12

Metalized films are formed by multiple layers of polymer as well as a single layer of
aluminum. By using a vacuum, the aluminum is evaporated and attached to the
plastic film. It is a common component in the composite structure of food packaging.
Metalized films are also commonly used in confectionaries. The thin coats of
aluminum are just some tens of nanometers thick. These films are produced by
industrial roll-to-roll vacuum web coaters and are called metallizers. This is achieved
by using resistively heated evaporation boats. These can coat films up to a width of
4.45 meters at a material flow of 1000 meters/min. (Struller, et al., 2014; Polymer
Properties Database, 2021)
The biggest motivation for using these thin layers is to give the polymer better
barrier properties that the polymer does not have on its own. One property of the film
is the impermeability of different gases, such as water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and
aromas. (Struller, et al., 2014) Despite the good properties and applications, it is
difficult and not profitable to separate the layers and recover them by traditional
methods, such as mechanical and chemical separations like grinding and dissolution
treatment. It has been discovered that it is hard to separate the layers of the metalized
plastic films, since the surface area of the thinner layers is greater than that of the
bulk material and is more exposed to atmospheric oxygen. This is also why most
metalized films end up in landfills and are burned for energy. (Yousef, et al., 2020)

4. Extrusion
Extrusion is a process which from the outside perspective seems like an easy one. In
actuality, the process is quite complex and has many parameters that need to be
considered to achieve the right product and quality. One, if not the most, important
part of the extruder is the online analysis instrumentation. By being able to measure
the different parameters in the process, it is possible to know what is happening in
the process as well as to be able to control the process. The main reason why
instrumentation is so important to the process is that it is not possible to see what is
happening inside the extruder. (Rauwendaal, 2010)
The most important parameters to monitor during the extrusion process are the melt
pressure and temperature. Other important factors to be considered are screw speed,
engine load, temperature of the barrel and die, power consumption of the various
heaters, what the cooling rate is, as well as the vacuum levels if the extrusion is
vented. (Rauwendaal, 2010)
Then how does the extrusion process work? Extrusion can be defined as any process
that has some kind of material pressed through an opening called a die. The material
is instantly going into a solid state, so that a long stream of product with a constant
diameter is formed. During plastic extrusion, thermoplastics are heated up and
melted before extruding. They need to be cooled down as quickly as possible after
the process, so that the form of the polymer string is maintained. (Levy & Carley,
1989)

13

The raw material that arrives is usually powder or pellets that are kept at room
temperature. When this is the case, the extruder first must melt the pellets and
homogenize the melt before the melt approaches the die. The most used process
equipment of the extruder is the screw extruder, which makes about 95% of the total
thermoplastic extruded products. (Levy & Carley, 1989)
Usually, the extruder is made up of different parts or zones. First, a hopper where the
raw material is being held. Second, the feed throat where the material enters the
barrel form the hopper, followed by the heated barrel that contains the screw that is
driven by an engine. The screw forces the material to the feed pipe. A breaker plate
can also be fitted to filter the material and to maintain pressure. Then there is a feed
pipe where the molten material exits the barrel in order to be delivered to the die.
The die is the final step, in which the material is being pushed through into the
desired shape of the end-product. At the exit there is a cooling system, and it helps
the extruded product to be more evenly solidified. (Ye, 2021)
Onwards from that, the polymer is transported for continued processing. When the
material is being processed, the mass is transformed by multiple factors: shear force,
pressure, cooling rate, shaping, and residence time. (Hyvärinen, et al., 2020)
At the feed throat, the material is being added to the screw channel. The feed throat
is usually fitted around the first couple of flights at the extruder screws. So that there
will not be too much heating of the polymer, the feed throat area is commonly water
cooled. If the temperature of the polymer is too high, the polymer will stick to the
surface of the feed opening. This causes the material flow being restricted, which in
turn causes additional problems in the process. By having the hoppers cross-sectional
shape as circular, it will then enable a steady flow through the hopper. Also, the
gradual compression at the converging zone would need to be considered.
(Hyvärinen, et al., 2020)
The most important part of the extruder are the screws. The screws are rotating in
tightly fitted barrels and they are the ones that transport the material from the feed to
the die end. The screws also have the task of mixing, melting and compressing the
ingredients. Depending on the screws’ outer and root diameters, pitch, and flight
width, the extruder’s capacity is determined. (Senanayake & Clarke, 1999) How the
screw should be put together and what to consider will be discussed in chapter 4.2.

4.1. Single screw vs twin screw extruders
Twin-screw extrusion is widely used in applications that use mixing. This type of
screw can be used in applications that include mixing, compounding, and reactive
extrusion. With the different system configurations, the most used nowadays are the
co-rotating, self-wiping screws. The reason behind this is that they have a good
balance between the efficiency of mixing and their ability to generate pressure. To be
able to optimize the process, the main flow parameters are required at different parts
of the screw. These are also important from the aspect of seeing how different screw
geometries will affect the parameters. Other factors that also impact the main
parameters are the feed rate, screw speed, and/or the temperature of the barrel.
(Carneiro, et al., 2000)
14

The comparison of a single screw extruder and a twin-screw extruder can be seen in
Figure 7. The figure shows the cross section of a single screw and twin-screw
configuration, the left picture being the single screw and the right one the twin-screw
extruder.

Figure 7. Cross section of a single screw and twin-screw extruder.

The single screw extruder is mostly being used in general processing of polymers,
while the twin-screw extruder is mostly used for compounding different fibers,
fillers, and polymer blends before they are molded into their final products. Twinscrew extruders can also be divided into two different categories, i.e., intermeshing
and non-intermeshing. Of these two, the intermeshing screw type has been proven to
be more effective than the non-intermeshing screw. This is due to their ability to
achieve better pumping than that of non-intermeshing screws. The main reasoning
behind this would be the positive displacement of the screws. (Hyvärinen, et al.,
2020)
Depending on the rotation of the screws, the twin screw extruder can be co-rotating
or counter-rotating. The co-rotating twin-screw extruders have their maximum
velocity at the tip of the screws, while the counter-rotating ones have their maximum
velocity at the intermeshing region. Since counter-rotating twin-screw extruders are
reminiscent of gear pumps, it will provide the maximum amount of positive
displacement. This means that it is the choice for profile extrusion, while co-rotating
twin-screw extruders will be better for compounding, mixing, devolatization, and for
chemical reactions. The reasoning for using twin-screw extruders for these
applications is because of how complex the flow in the intermeshing region is. This
in turn provides a good mixing and good compounding characteristics. The problem
with a complex flow is that it makes it more difficult to predict the performance and
makes it difficult to design an extruder for a given performance requirement.
(Hyvärinen, et al., 2020; Shah & Gupta, 2004)

15

The difference between co-rotating and counter-rotating twin-screw extruders can be
seen in
Figure 8.

Figure 8. Co-rotating and counter rotating screws.

The key differences between a single screw and twin-screw extruder are as follows:
A twin-screw extruder has a better mixing capability than the single screw extruder.
This is because of the intermeshing screws and the capability of modifying the
screws to fit the wanted application. By having this capability, the mixing of the
polymer can be adjusted in a more precise way than that of a single screw extruder.
To achieve better mixing in a single screw extruder, flow restrictions can be applied,
but are very limited. (Mayures Gears Pvt. Ltd., 2021)
Twin-screw extruders can perform many different tasks during processing, such as
melting, mixing, cooking, venting, cooling, and the list goes on. For the single screw
extruder, the throughput and the screw speed are dependent of each other and a
screw geometry that has multiple functions in a series is much more restricted than
that of a twin-screw extrusion process. The productivity in the process is also higher
for a twin-screw extruder than that of a single screw extruder. (Mayures Gears Pvt.
Ltd., 2021)
The price of the units is higher for a twin-screw extruder due to the complexity of the
machine and the different variations in screw designs and possible tasks performed
by the extruder. The single screw extruder has a much simpler design, which will
lead to a lower price. (Mayures Gears Pvt. Ltd., 2021)
A twin-screw process is faster, and the plasticizing capacity is higher than that of a
single screw extruder. The final difference between a single and twin-screw extruder
16

is that, since the process is more complex for the twin-screw extruder, there will be a
need for more process control in a twin-screw extruder than in that of a single screw
extruder. The single screw extruder is simpler and will be needing less control during
the process and the process is easier to manipulate. When knowing all these
differences, it would be beneficial to think of what kind of process the extruder will
be needed for and how much customization is wanted from the extruder. (Mayures
Gears Pvt. Ltd., 2021)

4.2. Changes in screw geometry and different screws
As was established in the last chapter, the positive side to the twin-screw extruders is
that there is the possibility to change the screw geometry to something that is useful
for the raw material at hand, and what process it needs to make the wanted product.
Most of the modern extruders have a modular screw design that will help with the
efficiency of mixing inside the barrel (Hyvärinen, et al., 2020). The single screw,
however, is divided into three main sections, them being feeding zone, transition
form, and a metering zone. The residence time is the measured material processing
time. (Hyvärinen, et al., 2020)
There are different thicknesses of the flight designs, thin and thick flight designs in
terms of single screw extrusion. These two can then be mixed to design and build
screws, since the shear conditions are controlled with the flight and the rotational
speeds. (Hyvärinen, et al., 2020)
The job of the screw is to melt the polymer, preparing the melt to be homogenized,
and then moving the molten polymer to the die to be pumped out of the system. The
different characteristics of the finished product depend on the quality of the melt that
is delivered to the die. The basic screw design has three larger sections, and these can
be seen in
Figure 9 below. Here, the feed section or conveying zone has the task of delivering
the product to the transition part of the screw. At the transition section is where most
of the melting is occurring. The final part is the metering section or melt conveying
section. This is where the molten product is being transported to the discharge of the
extruder. (Eslami, 2015)

Figure 9. Simple representation of single screw geometry. (Eslami, 2015)

In single screw extrusion, the channel depth of the screw is one of the most important
aspects of the screw. Usually, it is built as having the largest value at the feed section
and the lowest at the metering section. The depth of the channel is decreasing during
the transition sections. By doing this, it enables the polymer to be worked more. The
root diameter (i.e., the diameter between the bottom parts of the screw threads) is
17

constant at the feed and metering sections, and because of that the channel depth is
constant during these sections. (Eslami, 2015)
For twin screw extrusion, a more detailed description of the different screw sections
can be seen in
Figure 10 below. A more detailed picture of the extruder barrel and screw system is
shown and how multiple different screw elements can be placed to suit the process at
hand.
The first two parts are the same as before. It starts with the feed section, where the
polymer is being inserted by gravity from the hopper. Here, the solid polymer is
preheated and transported towards the melt section, where the polymer is melted and
kneaded to form a homogenous melt. Still during the melt section, additives and
filler can be added into the polymer. After the additives are fed in at a continuous
flow, they are incorporated into the molten polymer. The main point of the additive
is to, for example, make the end-product have some specific characteristics or to help
with separating some unwanted elements that would lower the product quality.
During the degassing stage of the process, the volatiles and gases are removed. The
final stage is the pressure build up zone, where the pressure is increased by
compressing the melt, so that a steady out-stream of polymer string can be achieved.
The polymer is discharged from the process, before cooling and cutting of the
polymer string is done to obtain pellets that can then be made into products.
(Kholgrüber, 2021)

Figure 10. Detailed schematic of the different screw sections in a twin-screw extruder. (Kholgrüber,
2021)

Before starting to design a screw, one must think about many things. What are the
raw materials that are going to be fed into the extruder? Are there going to be any
additives added to the melt? Are there any raw materials being added downstream?
And so forth. It is not as easy as it would seem. (Andersen, 2015)
The form of the polymer makes a big difference as to where the melting zone should
be located in relation to the feed of the barrel and for the configuration of the
conveying section. The usual size of a pellet is 3 mm, which should not cause any
huge problems with the feed. If the pellets are smaller than that, there can be some
problems. The melting section should be moved further down the line if the particles
18

are smaller. This should be done to minimize the risk of a block being caused at the
feed throat. More air is going to be introduced if the particles are smaller. The air is
being forced back towards the feed throat when the powder is entering the melting
section. This happens because of the polymer being compressed before entering the
melting section of the barrel. The excess of air then fluidizes the powder more
quickly and will affect the efficiency of the conveying section. There is also a
possibility for the feed throat to become clogged, which then lowers the efficiency.
This would then lead to the rpm being reduced, as well as an increase in the melt
temperature and mechanical energy. If this happens, the risk of the polymer or
additives breaking down is increased. Other factors would also need to be
considered, so that the risk of the extrusion being unsuccessful can be minimized.
(Andersen, 2015)
There are different screw elements that can be used to build a screw for the
applications needed. The screw design, as mentioned earlier, is an important stage
before the extrusion can be done. If the design of the screw has the wrong element
placed in the wrong place, it will then impact the quality of the product. In Figure 11,
the different elements of the screw can be seen. (Villmow, et al., 2010) These are an
example of different screw elements. There are also more with different lengths and
applications.

Figure 11. Different screw elements. (Villmow, et al., 2010)

Pictures one and two are two different conveying elements, the difference being the
angle and depth of the channel. Element number three is a back conveying element.
The back conveying element’s task is to build up pressure inside the barrel. Elements
four to six are different types of kneading elements. These have different
configurations depending on the wanted applications. The task of the kneading
elements is to achieve dispersive mixing and melting; dispersive mixing meaning
that the smaller particles of the polymer break up into even smaller particles or
droplets. Elements seven and eight are the mixing elements. The mixing elements’
19

task is the distributive mixing of the polymer; distributive mixing meaning that two
different fluids are mixed, so that the physical separation is minimized and diffusion
or a chemical reaction can happen. (Villmow, et al., 2010; Cong & Gupta, 2008;
Bigio, 1995) The difference between dispersive and distributive mixing is that the
distributive mixing increases the randomness of the dispersed phase, while the
dispersive mixing provides both an increase of randomness and breaks up larger
particles from the dispersed faze (Kim, 2019).
How the various screw elements are characterized is different for the various
elements. Length, pitch, and number of flights are what characterize the conveying
elements. Kneading elements are specified by their number of discs and staggering
angles while the mixing elements are specified by their number of cogs. (Villmow, et
al., 2010)

4.3. Challenges during extrusion
Due to melting, mixing, and forming, as well as making the polymer solid again, the
extrusion process is quite an energy consuming process. For every kilogram of
plastic, roughly 0.3 kW/kg/h of energy is needed to process the plastic. A typical
extrusion process would need polymer-drying equipment, processing machinery, and
units to cool down the polymer, usually with cooling water. Compressors would also
be needed to convey the materials and service air. Out of this, about 50% of the
energy is needed by the extrusion. (Vera-Sorroche, et al., 2013)
The barrel is heated up by two different factors, the first being electrical heating of
the barrels and the second being the heating of the screw rotating. Screw heating is
achieved by viscous shearing. Even though extrusion processing is an energy intense
process, it is still often running at not so optimal conditions. This is because of
multiple factors, one being the lack of understanding of how different process
conditions affect the quality of the formed product, and how it affects energy
consumption. This leads to the extrusion process being operated at conservative
rates, so that the risk of disturbances is minimized. Long setup times and then
downtimes are a common occurrence when there are problems with selecting the
right operating conditions. Sometimes the wrong screw geometry is also being used
in the extrusion process, which is because the knowledge is lacking. (Vera-Sorroche,
et al., 2013)
Some difficulties faced by the processing industry are that the quality of the polymer
is dependent on the homogeneity of the polymer feed. The ideal conditions of the
feed would be at a constant pressure, temperature, and the throughput. Something
else to actively be monitoring would be the temperature in the flowing polymer. That
it should be closely monitored is more easily said than done, since it would affect the
flow of the polymer. Some methods have been developed to measure the temperature
of the flow in real time, but these methods are mostly for research purposes rather
than used in an industrial production scale. (Vera-Sorroche, et al., 2013)

4.4. Extrusion of printed films

20

A problem with the recycling of plastics is that there is ink present in the film, which
will then impact the overall properties of the re-extruded plastics. Depending on the
temperature, there is the possibility of some volatiles evaporating, caused by the ink,
and these gases will then be mixed into the plastic. This leads to the re-extruded
plastics only being suitable for specific low value products. Since the flexi film is
lighter in the aspect of bulk density, the process equipment also needs to be dialed in
for this specific purpose, with comparison to rigid plastics. (Horodytska, et al., 2018)
The process will be easier for the mono-material than for multi-material films. This
is due to the vast amount of different materials used for different layers, the
difference in the processing properties, the lack of ways to identify the different
layers, and the lack of a viable separation method to separate the layers. (Horodytska,
et al., 2018)
There are two different types of film wastes, post-consumer and post-industrial.
These two types differ from each other in a big way. The post-industrial waste film is
homogenous, and the scrap is of a known polymer composition and is considered
clean. About 5–12% of the production is going to become waste due to the setting
up, printing, and other processes. The post-consumer waste is usually made up of
multiple polymers, since the different polymer compositions are not collected in
different containers but is rather dumped into a single plastic container. It is also
considered dirty, with a high degree of contamination and it has been subjected to
degradation during its life cycle. (Horodytska, et al., 2018) Of these two types, the
post-industrial waste is the one being used in the experimental part of the thesis.
Before printing, the surface is usually treated to increase the surface energy and to
enhance ink wettability. Some of the used treatments are flame treatments, corona
discharge, UV treatment, and plasma treatment. Of these treatments, the corona
discharge is most common for films. The principle behind the process is that a high
voltage application is done to an electrode that is located near the film. The air
between the electrode and film is ionized. This ionized air does then oxidize the
surface of the film. (Gecol, et al., 2003)

4.5. Neutralization of odor during extrusion
One of the problems with recycling of plastics is that there is a distinct odor present
in the plastics that are recycled. Especially the plastic from post-consumer
applications can have an odor. This would be because of contaminants from the
products contained inside the plastic. There will be a stench when the products are
ready to be recycled, since it will be a long time between when the plastics were left
at the collection facility and they are recycled. One of the biggest challenges of the
recycling of plastics sector is the huge amount of plastic films that are not being
recycled. It is estimated that around 30–50% of the total European plastic waste
comes from films. The biggest problem is the heterogeneity of the films and the
challenges that come from that to recycle films in a closed loop. (Lok, et al., 2020;
Roosen, et al., 2020)

21

Something that is being researched is how the possible odor could be removed. The
aim would be to find a way to minimize the odor in the plastics, by the means of
physical deodorization or by advanced washing techniques. Examples of these are
the addition of hot water or some kind of chemical additive. The problem is that
complete odor removal has not been achieved yet. Usually, the addition of nonenvironmentally friendly chemicals (detergents, absorbers, or entrainers) or a high
energy input are required for that. (Lok, et al., 2020)
The odors are quite diverse by the means of origin and chemical properties. The odor
is not limited only to the surface but can also be found inside the product. When the
odor has been absorbed, it is a big challenge for the odor minimization process. One
possible origin for the odor is residual byproducts (monomers and oligomeres).
These are caused by the breakdown of the polymer chain. Degradation of additives
(inks) is also a culprit, as well as uptake and microbial degradation from the products
inside the packages and cross-contamination from the collection of plastics. With a
combination of all of these, the process can become quite complex. (Roosen, et al.,
2020)
It has been showed that the odor comes from a wide range of different chemical
structures, such as (un-)saturated ketones and aldehydes, phenolic compounds, fatty
acids, and lactones. Other studies have shown that cosmetic fragrances and
washing/cleaning agents are a culprit as well. These are absorbed by varying
phenomena, such as sorption, diffusion, and migration. (Roosen, et al., 2020)
The recycling methods today include using hot or cold water with or without adding
caustic soda and different detergents. These methods are quite good at removing dirt
and organic contaminations from the surface of the plastics. These methods are not
that good at removing every odor contributing component because of the vast range
of physiochemical properties. (Roosen, et al., 2020)
Laboratory analysis of a film before and after cleaning and re-pelletizing showed that
by using industrial water, washing was effective at removing a considerable portion
of the most polar components but was ineffective for un-polar components. It was
also revealed that the concentration of some odor causing components increased after
the washing and reprocessing of the waste. (Roosen, et al., 2020)
According to Strangl et.al., today’s methods of industrial mechanical recycling
processes where water is used to wash the polymers with subsequent drying and
extruding of the recyclates, are not very effective for odor removal. Strangl et.al.
suggested that a combination of different methods would be more effective and
would aid in the removal of microbial activity. It would also be of interest to develop
a more advanced washing technique. (Strangl, et al., 2020) The development of these
techniques for the recycling process would aid the industry to become more
competitive and make the process more efficient. A possible method would be to
combine today’s methods with an organic solvent. (Roosen, et al., 2020)
Some new, more environmentally friendly alternatives are considered for the odor
minimization process. A possible alternative would be probiotics that are usually
being used in the fields of human health and food quality. There are many positives
to using probiotics, including the possibility to displace other microorganisms that
22

would otherwise be harmful. This would be achieved, because when probiotics are
added, they will take up space and eat the nutrients that would otherwise be taken up
by the bacteria. There is also the possibility for the probiotics to discharge enzymes
and antibiotic compounds that would keep pathogens away. (Lok, et al., 2020)

4.6. Recycling process
What the recycling process looks like after the products have been collected from the
consumers can be seen in
Figure 12 below. The first step would be to separate, evaluate, and remove unwanted
materials from the bulk of the raw material, followed by the grinding and washing of
the waste to remove impurities. The washing process can be done either by using
only water or with the addition of cleaning agents. The grounded plastics are dried to
have a minimal amount of moisture present for the following steps. (Santos, et al.,
2005)
After the drying is complete, the ground up materials are transported into silos for
further processing. The next step of the process is compacting, meaning that films
and other products that have a fine thickness are joint together. The second to last
step is extrusion, which is the most interesting part of the thesis seeing as that is the
technique used in the experimental part. After extrusion, the strings that come out of
the outflow of the extruder, are cut into pellets for further processing. (Santos, et al.,
2005)

5. Target of the experiments
In the experimental part of the thesis, the different test methods, the equipment used,
and an analysis of the results from the trials will be presented and discussed. The
purpose of the experiments is to obtain a clear picture of how it would be possible
via extrusion to recycle polypropylene films with print or metallization. There can
also be challenges with the products made from recycled plastics. Possible problems
during extrusion are that the feed rate into the extruder could be lower than normally
when mixing in flakes, or that the product could be of lesser quality or have some
properties that would be undesirable.
In the first part of the experiments, a pre-test was done to achieve a benchmark for
the following test-runs. This benchmark was designed in order to gain some insight
into what the problems with the products during extrusion could be, and through that,
to find a solution to solve the problems that occur.
In the second part of the experiments, a new screw was selected in order to see how
the different screw geometry would process the recyclates with the addition of
nitrogen feed. Here, a vacuum pump was also added in order to be able to eliminate
possible volatiles present in the melt.
In the third part of the experiments yet another screw was selected, so that three
different screw geometries were used during the experiments. Here, a nitrogen feed
was also added in order to displace the oxygen present in the barrel and the barrel
was open at position 11 to allow the volatiles to escape.
Two PP cast film reels (post industrial waste) were used as raw materials.
Both films are three-layer coextruded films with PP homopolymer backbone and
random copolymer as surface for print and for metallization.
A more detailed description of the tests and what equipment is used in them will be
described in the following chapters.

6. Used equipment
Before the raw material could be made into new plastic pellets, it had to be processed
in two stages. The first stage was to press together multiple layers of film into a
compact sheet. The second stage was to shred the pressed sheets of films.
The pressing process was done using a Collin lab line P400S platen press. Before the
pressing could be done, the film had to be cut into smaller pieces, so that they could
fit into the mold placed on the pressing plate. To achieve the maximum thickness of
the sheets, three molds were put on top of each other. Two of the molds were 1 mm
thick and the third was 2 mm thick. The pressing area achieved was about 30x30 cm.
About 300 g of plastic film could be pressed at a time without bigger problems.
Between 5 and 7 kg material was pressed for each test-run.
The setup for the pressing machine is that there are two plates, out of which one goes
on top and the other is placed at the bottom. On the bottom plate, a plastic sheet
25

made from PET is placed to protect the pressing plates and for it to be easier to
remove the pressed sheets of PP. Next, the molds are placed on top of the protective
sheet, so that the first 1 mm mold is underneath, the 2 mm mold is in the middle, and
the second 1 mm mold is on top. Then, the cut pieces of plastic films are placed
inside the molds. Finally, a second protective sheet is placed on top of the second
plate before the metal plate is placed on top of the molds. Then the package is placed
inside the presser.
For the pressing of the films, a shorter than normal program was selected. The new
program runs for a total of 20 minutes instead of the normal 30 minutes. This was to
make the time spent pressing shorter, and because only a partial melting of the films
was needed. The program started with a 400-second heating stage for heating the
films from 40 °C to 210 °C. After the heating stage, the film was not yet up to
temperature, so a 120-second heating wave was done. When it reaches the right
temperature, the machine is holding the temperature at 210 °C for 120 seconds at a
pressure of 50 bar. After that, a final cooling stage is applied to the pressed sheets to
lower the temperature down to about 40 °C. The final product of the film pressing
can be seen in Figure 13.

Figure 13. Pressed printed film (left) and metalized film (right)

26

After the pressing process, the sheets again had to be cut into thinner pieces
lengthwise, so that they could fit into the shredder and in order to achieve the flakes
wanted to be used in the extrusion process. The shredder used was a Moditec low
speed granulator. First, the printed film was shredded and then the metalized film
was shredded. The machine was properly cleaned before and after use to ensure the
risk of contamination would be less likely. The shredded material was collected into
bags, again to have minimal contamination. A figure showing the printed and
metalized flakes can be seen in Figure 14.

Figure 14. Printed film flakes (left) and metalized film flakes (right)

Finally, the shredded, printed, and metalized films could be extruded into pellets.
The extrusion process was done using a Werner & Pfleiderer ZSK-30 twin-screw
extruder. It is a type of co-rotating extruder. The screws used in the pre-test were
screw #1. The plastic strings pressed out of the extruder were transported through a
waterbed. By using the pool of water, proper cooling of the extruded plastic can be
ensured. The strings were transported from the pool to be cut into pellets, which were
collected into bags.
After each test-run, the bag was removed and properly marked, and a new bag was
placed underneath to collect the next batch of pellets. In Figure 15 on the following
page, the Werner & Pfleiderer ZSK-30 twin-screw extruder can be seen as a
reference of the size of the extruder. After the test-runs were completed, the samples
were analyzed.

27

Figure 15. Werner & Pfleiderer ZSK-30 twin screw extruder.

7. Test methods
After every test-run the samples must be analyzed with different methods in order to
be able to compare every test point from a specific test-run and between the different
test-runs. This is done to see whether the products formed with different screw
geometries and additives have helped us achieve a better product compared to where
we started. Two main analyses were done with every test point: melt mass-flow rate
(MFR) and the volatiles measured. Various other analyses were also done.

7.1 Melt mass-flow rate
Melt mass-flow rate is used to measure the melt viscosity or flow resistance of a
polymer sample at a constant load, temperature, and shear rate. The test uses a
specific size of die in a heated barrel which has a piston and a weight on top of the
piston. This is inserted into the barrel and pressed down on the polymer melt to force
it out through the die. (Giles Jr., et al., 2005; AZO Materials, 2008)
Before the test, the barrel is clean, and the desired amount of polymer is added into
the barrel. The polymer is packed inside the barrel with the piston. During a time
interval, the polymer is heated into a molten stage and then the piston pushes the
molten polymer through the die. After the analysis, the barrel and die are cleaned.
(Giles Jr., et al., 2005)
The melt flow index is the amount of molten polymer in grams which is forced
through the die during a 10-minute period (g/10min). Every resin system has its own
specific length of opening and diameter, temperature in the barrel, and load by the
piston. These are defined in the ISO standard of the analysis method. A lower melt
mass-flow index relates to a higher viscosity of the polymer. A higher melt massflow index then shows that the polymer has a lower viscosity. (Giles Jr., et al., 2005;
AZO Materials, 2008)
28

For polypropylene, the used temperature is 230 °C. There are three different tests
which can be done with MFR, all with different loads to the piston: MFR2 with a
weight of 2.16 kg, MFR5 with a weight of 5 kg and MFR21 with a weight of 21.16
kg. The used test in this thesis is MFR2 as it is the standard test for polypropylene.
For polyethylene, other MFR loads are possible. (Wang, et al., 2015)

7.2 Headspace GC/MS analysis
The standard used for the analysis method of Headspace GC/MS is ASTM D4526 –
20. There is no known ISO standard for this method. (BSI group, 2021)
Headspace analysis is a technique in which a sample is analyzed by examining
volatiles from a solid or liquid. Headspace is defined as the gas volume above the
sample. Usually, the sample is held in an airtight container to keep the gas from
escaping. The volatiles are usually the cause of an odor. (Worsfold, et al., 2019)
Once the sample has been collected, it can be analyzed with different methods, out of
which it is usually done with gas chromatography or gas chromatography with mass
spectroscopy detection. The simplest method is to use a gastight syringe to draw
some of the headspace from a closed container. The gas is inserted into the analytical
equipment. (Worsfold, et al., 2019)

7.3. Density
The ISO standard used for the measurement of density is ISO 1183-1:2019(en).
Density is an important property to know when it comes to a solid. The density can
vary for example concerning the change of crystallinity, loss off plasticizers, and
absorption of solvents. There can also be changes in the density of a sample. Usual
causes can be, for example, the difference in crystallinity, porosity, or composition.
(Bag, et al., 2003)
Knowing the exact density of a material will be helpful when determining the
material, following physical changes in a sample, indicating the uniformity of
different samples, determining the average density of a bigger product, and
calculating the weight to cost ratio of a specific product. (Bag, et al., 2003)
The pellets had to be pressed and melted into small discs with a sample size of 7 g
per disc. After obtaining the discs, the samples are first weighted in air to determine
the mass of the sample. The samples are immersed into a liquid and their mass upon
immersion is measured. After the immersion, the densities are calculated based upon
the results. Depending on the liquid used, the standard is categorized into two
different categories: Method A, in which the sample is immersed into water, and
Method B where the sample is immersed into a liquid other than water. Method A is
usually used when the density of a sample is expected to have a density higher than
water and Method B if the expected density is lower than that of water. (Bag, et al.,
2003)

29

By measuring the density of the samples, it can be determined how much of a
difference the addition of recycled film will change the density of the polymers when
metal in the form of aluminum and the print color is added to the natural
polypropylene.

7.4. Color difference CIELAB
The color difference is often measured in order to analytically determine if a product
meets the standards set by the manufacturer. Most analyses are made by visual
inspection, but sometimes other methods are needed to ensure that the product meets
industry standards. (Datacolor, 2008)
Instruments to determine color differences are used to have a quantitative
measurement of how different the color truly is from the reference. The measurement
equipment is CIE L*a*b*, CIE L*C*H*, CMC, and CIE94. Out of these methods,
the CIE L*a*b* is used to determine the color difference between two different film
samples, the first being from the pre-test and the second from test-run 2. These films
are made from the pellets that were made during the different test-runs. (Datacolor,
2008) [Redacted]
The CIELAB system classifies colors based on the opponent theory of color vision.
This theory implicates that colors cannot be seen as both red and green
simultaneously, the same being true for yellow and blue. However, a color can be
seen as a combination of red and blue, red and yellow, green and blue, and green and
yellow. In the analysis, the different color coordinates are as follows:
L* is the lightness coordinate,
a* the red and green coordinate, where +a* indicates red and –a* green,
and b* the yellow and blue coordinate, where +b* indicates yellow and –b* indicates
blue.
The color difference between two samples can then be determined by the difference
in the distances between color locations. By using formula (1) the distance can
typically be determined.
∆𝐸 ∗ = √∆𝐿∗ 2 + ∆𝑎∗ 2 + ∆𝑏 ∗ 2

(1)

Where:
ΔL* is the light difference,
Δa* is the red/green difference and,
Δb* is the yellow/blue difference.
(Datacolor, 2008)

30

7.5 Yellowness index
The yellowness index is a measurement calculated from spectrophotometric data.
This describes the change in color of test samples that are clear or white to yellow. It
is an important property for many industries to measure. By processing multiple
materials, a yellowing of the product can occur. The purity of a product can be
determined by how yellow the product has become. Some environmental factors,
such as UV-radiation, can cause yellowing of the products. (Puková, et al., 2021)
Yellowness index is a dimensionless number that is determined by the spectroscopic
data. Usually, the index shows how the color has changed in a material due to
different weather conditions. By using the same test methods as in the measurement
of color difference, CIELAB is used to determine the yellowness in the color range
of the axis. (Puková, et al., 2021)
The analysis in the thesis is done in order to be able to determine if one of the
polymer samples obtained from the first test-run is broken down and is compared to
the data of the control sample from the pre-test.

8. Test-runs
The pre-tests were done mainly to obtain an understanding of how the equipment
works and for retrieving a benchmark for the following trials. By having this
benchmark, there is the possibility to compare the results of the pre-test with the
results from the follow-up tests in order to determine if the product from the
extrusion process will be better or worse than the benchmark set by the pre-tests.
The test-runs were done by having a combination of both virgin pellets and flakes
made from metalized and printed films. The ratio of virgin pellets and flakes was
50/50. Three test-runs were made with both film flakes. There was also a third
sample with 100% virgin plastics driven through the extruder, which is used as a
control. The virgin plastic used in the blends was a PP homopolymer cast film grade.
The decision of doing test-runs with just virgin plastics was made in order to have a
control sample when analyzing the recyclates, since the virgin plastics have not had
as many heat cycles as the pellets made from recyclates. To be able to ensure that a
constant flow of flakes enter the hopper, there had to be an agitator fitted into the
feed vessel that held the flakes above the hopper. The agitator that was fitted can be
seen in Figure 16.

31

Figure 16. The agitator used to ensure a continuous feed of polypropylene flakes.

The variables chosen during the experiments were feed rate and rpm. These variables
were chosen, so that a scale-up from a pilot extruder could be made. The variables
chosen were to use the normal and maximum values for both the feed rate and rpm.
The values were 5 and 7kg/h feed rate and an rpm variation of 150 rpm and 220 rpm
as shown in Table 2.

When starting the first test-run, it was noticed that the feed was too high for the
printed films at the entry of the screws and the hopper was starting to become
clogged. The maximum feed rate measurement was not used for the metalized film
flakes because of the problems with the printed film flakes. The cause of the problem
was that flakes made out printed films have quite low density, and the screws could
not keep up with the feed rate. The problem occurred for all three test-run
combinations.
A decision was made to seek out the maximum and normal feed rate and rpm
manually, so that the hopper would not be filled up. Based on the results from the
trials, new maximum and normal values for the feed rate and rpm were chosen. The
new combinations of variables after testing can be seen in Table 3.

To make the flakes melt inside the extruder, the different temperature zones would
need to be optimized. The temperature would need to be raised slightly from the
beginning of the screw to the end of the screw. In the extruder used, there are 7
different zones. The selected temperature profile can be seen in Table 4. The end
temperatures were selected, so that it would be close enough to an industrial
extruder. Depending on the runs, the actual temperature profile will have some small
differences. In Table 3, the melt temperature was not included, since the temperature
varies depending on the test-runs. Whereas in Table 4. Temperature profile for the
extruder.the information from the different runs is shown.

Using these three combinations for both the printed and metalized film runs, as well
as for the control, the tests could be run without a problem. Between the different
material extrusions, the extruder needed to be flushed clean in order to get rid of
components from previous test-run materials. The cleaning process was done by
feeding the extruder with virgin pellets. During the cleaning process, it was noticed
that it took a long time to clean the extruder after the extrusion of the printed films.
The print color used seems to stick to the screws or the walls inside the extruder. For
the following trials, it would be preferable to extrude the printed film last. By doing
that, it should cut the time for the test-runs. After the extrusion process, new films
will be made from the formed pellets.
The first real test-run was done at the end of March 2021. Before the test-runs, the
screw geometry was changed in order to investigate if a better product could be
achieved. The new screw to be used in the first test-runs was called screw #2. The
point of this test-run was also to use nitrogen and vacuum.
Nitrogen was used, since it will replace the oxygen in the barrel. With a combination
of vacuum and nitrogen, the volatiles present in the barrel could be removed and thus
a more stable and better product overall could be achieved. If nitrogen and vacuum
would not be used, the volatiles would just be mixed with the molten polymer
instead.

In the second test series, there were control samples run at the same time to be able
to be compared if and to know how the new screw would affect the overall quality of
the recyclates. There were no problems with the control samples.
The next step was to add a vacuum pump and nitrogen. When the barrel was opened
in the latter part of the extruder, the problems started occurring. The polypropylene
at the outflow started to become quite runny and the polymer also got a brownish tint
to it. These findings strongly indicates that the polymer had undergone thermooxidation with subsequent breaking of polymer chains. Reflecting on the literature
part of this thesis, it seems that there was an excess of oxygen present inside the
barrel which caused the problems. The addition of nitrogen and the vacuum pump
did not help to solve the problem. The vacuum pump was too powerful and began
sucking up the melt. A portable oxygen meter was used to measure the oxygen
present at the hopper, and the lowest value measured there was around 1%.
One notable thing was that when the barrel was opened, the melt pressure dropped
significantly from 9 bar to about 3 bar. This indicates that the pieces used for the
screw did not generate a “polymer wall” which was needed to keep the pressure up
when the barrel was open. When the barrel was closed again, the pressure increased,
and the polymer oxidization was not present anymore. Different methods were used
to see if the polymer degradation problem would be resolved, but they were not
successful. The decision was made to stop the test-runs and revert to the previous
screw (screw #1) with some small modifications to the end of the screw, so that the
barrel could be run open during the final test-runs.
The final test-run was done at the end of May. The screw was modified and changed
for the test-run and some more extensive testing was done before the actual test-run
period.
The chosen parameters for the feed rate were 5 kg/h and the rpm was 220 rpm. These
were chosen as the parameters to have the biggest possible production rate. Also, for
each run there was the addition of nitrogen (N2) to displace the oxygen inside the
barrel. The input of the nitrogen feed was added to the hopper. The barrel was also
open at position 11 on the barrel for all test points.

34

Overall, the test-run did go according to the test plan even though a small change had
to be made during the running of the printed film flakes. At the selected feed rate of
5 kg/h, the hopper did start to become clogged. This problem was due to the film
flakes being lighter than the metalized flakes and the natural pellets. To be able to
continue with the test-run, the feed rate had to be dropped down further to 4 kg/h.

9. Results and discussion
In this chapter, the different test-runs and the results will be presented. All the
analyses made for the different test samples will be presented as well and compared
to each other. A discussion of the results will be had to be able to determine if
polypropylene films are recyclable into some sort of quality product.

9.1. Pre-test
During the pre-tests, there were three different test-runs per raw material, which
means nine test-runs in total. The runs started with the printed films, continued with
the metalized films, and finalized with test-runs with 100% virgin pellets. In Table 6,
the different test-runs, variables, and results can be seen.
Table 6. Pre-test test-runs with variables and values.

From the table above, it can be seen that the torque, melt pressure, melt temperature,
and residence time vary depending on the changes of rpm and feed rate. The
residence time was measured by taking a couple of black pellets that were dropped
into the hopper. By using a stopwatch, time was measured from the time the pellets
were dropped into the hopper until the plastic strings that came out of the die turned
black. As can be seen, the higher the feed rate and rpm, the shorter the residence time
will be. In correlation, the slowest rpm and feed rate will have the longest residence
time.
At the highest feed rate of 5 kg/h and rpm of 220 1/min, the pressure and torque
percentage are also the highest. This would be explained by the increase in feed rate.
The machine will have to work harder to keep up with the higher flow of raw
material and the pressure will be higher, since there is more material pushing forward
through the screw. It can also be explained by the fact that at the highest feed, the
rpm was barely enough for the extruder to push the product through. At any lower
rpm, the hopper would start to become clogged again.

35

The lowest pressure in the machine was achieved with the highest rpm and normal
operating feed rate. The torque percentage was also the lowest when considering the
printed film and control extrusion. The metalized film is a deviation of this
observation. It could be explained by the fact that the density of the metalized flakes
was higher than that of the printed films.
In all three different raw materials, the melt temperatures varied with a couple of
degrees from each other. The difference in melt temperature was not big enough to
be of any significance, about a 1% deviation.
In Table 7 below, the temperature profile of the different test-runs can be seen. The
numbering is the same as for Table 6 on the previous page: test-runs 1–3 is the
temperature profile for the printed film flake extrusion, 4–6 is for the metalized film
flakes, and 7–9 for the control sample. As can be seen from the table, small
deviations are noticed from the set temperatures. The deviations in temperature are
again quite small from the set values for each zone. That should not have any
significance in the quality of the pellets produced in extrusion.
Table 7. Temperature profile for the different test-runs by zones.

After the extrusion, some of the pellets were sent to the laboratory for analysis. The
melt index and the headspace volatiles were analyzed.
As was shown in the previous chapter, the melt index varied depending on the
materials used. As expected, the control samples had the melt index closest to the
original pellet of 8 g/10min. Some small deviations can be seen depending on the set
parameters.
Melt index was also measured for the pressed films used in the test-runs. The films
were first pressed together, and small pieces were cut from the sheets, so that the
pieces would fit into the machine. The results from the analysis can be seen in Table
8 below.

Notable here is the values for the melt indexes compared to the value of the melt
index for the pellets made from the film recyclates. It would be expected that the
values should be flipped, so that the printed film would have the lower melt index
when comparing the two. The explanation for this is that the pressed films were not
homogenized as they were in pellet form. If the pressed films would be melted first
and would be able to be stirred, then the results could be different. Another possible
cause to the differences in the melt indexes is that there would be some breakdown
of the polymer with having the metalized film flakes in the mix.
The results from the volatile analysis can be seen in Table 9. All the samples are
from the pre-tests.
Table 9. Results from the volatile analysis from the materials in pre-test.

From the table, it can be seen that the different materials do have slight differences
between them. Listed here are the different lengths of carbon chains. An abnormality
can be seen between the printed films, mainly between C4 where the sample of test
point 1 seems to have a low amount compared to the others. This abnormality could
be explained as an error in the measurement.
Other deviations can be seen in C5, where the printed film pellets and metalized film
pellets have a lower amount of volatiles than that of the control. The same can be
seen in C6 and C9 where there are less volatiles being dispersed for the recycled
pellets. In C8, there is also a difference between the different samples. Here, there is a
higher percentage of volatiles in the printed pellets than for the metalized and control
samples. A conclusion is that the different test-runs with different screw geometries
37

did not significantly affect the amount of volatiles present. The differences noted are
between the different materials used during the experiments. The recyclates did not
have a higher total amount of volatiles present than that of the control samples.

9.2 Test-run 1
The first test-run had six different test points, in which four were for the control
sample and the other two for the recycle films. As mentioned in the previous chapter,
there were some problems with breakdown of the polymer when the barrel was open
and due to this the test points were limited. One of the test points was run with an
open barrel. This was done to obtain a sample of the polymer to be able to analyze
and determine that the polymer had broken down. The melt mass-flow index,
yellowness index, as well as the headspace volatiles were measured and analyzed in
order to motivate the change of screw composition for the last test-run.
It is notable that when the melt mass-flow index (MFR) was measured, the die had to
be changed to a half measure to be able to achieve an accurate measurement. By
changing the die to a half measure, there had to be a correction factor applied to the
value which the equipment gave for the melt flow index value. For polypropylene,
the correction factor is 7.7. By using formula 2, the correction for the die can be
calculated.
𝑀𝐹𝑅𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 = 𝑀𝐹𝑅𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠 ∗ 𝑘

(2)

where:
MFRcorr= the corrected melt mass-flow index,
MFRmeas= the measured value of the melt mass-flow index and
k= correction factor.

After the application of the correction factor, the measured MFR of the sample was
389 g/10min, indicating that the viscosity is low for the polymer. When comparing
with the result that was measured with MFR, the polymers’ attributes have changed
considerably from the natural polypropylene sample that was measured before being
extruded.
The yellowness index was then measured using CIELAB on the sample and
compared to the same test conditions in the pre-test. The yellowness index
comparison between both measured samples can be seen in
Table 10.
Table 10. Measured yellowness index for the test samples.

Test-run 1 control

As can be seen from the table, the control sample from the first test-run has a higher
yellowness index than that of the pre-test sample. This shows that the polymer was
more yellow than the one from the pre-test. It is notable that both samples have a
high yellowness to them when comparing the values with the index of natural
polypropylene. Usually, the value is close to zero. This indicates that re-extruding
natural PP will influence the clarity or whiteness of the samples.
Finally, the headspace volatiles were measured for the possible broken-down sample
of polypropylene. The results from the analysis can be seen in .
Table 11.
Table 11. The measured volatiles of the control sample from test-run 1.

When comparing the result with the ones from the pre-test, they are quite similar to
each other as far as volatiles are concerned. Some deviations can be seen though in
the C5 chains, which shows that there are less volatiles present with the carbon chain
length. The other values are close enough to each other that they can be summed as
deviations in the measurement.
With all the analyses done for the sample, it can be concluded that the polymer had
been broken down during the process. The theory of breakdown from visual
inspection during the test-run has been confirmed. With the known information of
the properties of the polymer sample with having the barrel open during the
extrusion process with the screw #2, it seems that the screw was not suited for the
raw materials and the test-run had been stopped when the product had started to
show signs of breakdown.
39

A possible theory of why the screw was not suited for the wanted purpose is that it
did not build up enough of a pressure wall before the opening of the barrel to
eliminate the oxygen ingress from the hopper. This can be seen in the summary of
the test-runs, where the pressure dropped significantly when the barrel was open
compared to when the barrel was closed. The polymer showing signs of breakdown
was due to the excess amount of oxygen present in the barrel, which then caused the
polymer to oxidize. Even with higher amounts of nitrogen added to the barrel at the
hopper, it did not prevent the oxidization of the polymer. A portable oxygenmeasuring device was applied at the barrel at which the oxygen percentage reached
as low as 1.2%, but the outflow continued to show oxidization of the polymer.
In Table 12, the summary of the first test-run can be seen. Here the pressure drop can
be seen clearly. When the barrel was closed, the pressure was around 7 bar and when
the barrel was opened in test point 6 the pressure dropped down to 3 bar. Torque
percentage during all test points was also about half of what it was during the pretest. This can be explained by the fact that the screw in question is gentler with the
raw material. The residence time was also lower for this specific screw when
compared to screw #1 used in the pre-test. For the rest of the samples, the melt
mass-flow index was measured and analyzed. These will be compared to each other
and discussed later in this chapter.
Table 12. Summary of the test conditions and test-runs for the first test-run.

9.3. Test-run 2
For the final test-run, the screw was reverted to the screw configuration used in the
pre-test, with some small modifications. The modifications were made to the screw
for the barrel to be able to be open at position 11. The modifications were done at the
end of the screw by rearranging the conveying elements to position 11 on the barrel.
The test program could be run through without any considerable difficulties. The
focus of the test-run was on the nitrogen feed into the hopper and to have the barrel
open for venting. One test point for each material was run.
Table 13. Summary of the test conditions and test-runs for the second test-run.

40

Here it can be seen that the torque percentages had risen and were close to the same
as they were in the pre-test which is expected when the same elements were used
with the screws. The pressure dropped a little bit from between 7–9 bar to 4.5–6.5
bar. This can be explained by the fact that the barrel was open during all test points.

9.4. Melt mass-flow index
The different raw materials will be presented and analyzed from an MFR perspective
in order to determine how much the different screw setups, the addition of additives,
and conditions have affected the quality of the polymer and the viscosity. All
samples from the test points were measured two times and the results shown in the
graphs is the median value of both measurements.
9.4.1 Printed film test points
The melt mass-flow indexes for all three test-runs for the printed films can be seen in
Figure 17. From the results, it can be concluded that the MFR differs slightly in the
different test-runs. This shows that there is some difference depending on what kind
of screw is being used during extrusion. It is interesting to notice that the melt massflow index as a combination of the raw materials is lower than that of the raw
materials themselves.

Figure 17. MFR results from all test-runs for the printed film flakes.

The melt mass-flow index for the natural polypropylene was around 8 g/10min when
measured and for the pressed film flakes around 9 g/10min. Yet, a combination of
the raw materials and re-extruded pellets has a lower MFR measurement.

41

An explanation for the results would be that the pressed films from which the MFR
was measured was not homogenized, so the results are not 100% accurate. If the
pressed films had first been melted down before doing the measurement, the polymer
would have had a chance to become a homogenized mass and the melt mass-flow
index could be different. The differences in the MFR can be related to operator
variation. A conclusion is that the printed film flakes did not cause any major
degradation of the polymer under the used test conditions.
From the graphs, it can be noted that the pre-test did have the values furthest from
the reference and thus it could be considered the worst in quality from an MFR
perspective. Based on the theory that has been discussed previously, it would be
expected. The first test-run with screw #2 seems to have made the product better in
terms of the MFR results with the result of the measurement being closer to 7
g/10min. The screw in question had been designed for recycled materials and has
been used in previous experiments, so it would be expected that it would be better for
the materials. It was also a gentler screw in terms of mixing, so it could be of interest
to try to develop that screw further to be able to use it for polypropylene without it
causing a breakdown of PP.
Even though there was no visible change in the color of the pellets, the final test-run
seems to have been the most successful in terms of getting close to the MFR of the
natural polypropylene that was used as a reference in this thesis. A combination of
having modified the screws and the addition of the additives seems to have generated
good results for the recyclates in the case of printed film polypropylene recycling.
The MFR was close to the reference of 8 g/10min in all three different test points.

42

9.4.2 Metalized film test points
In Figure 18, the MFR results from all three test-runs for the metalized film flakes
can be seen in graphs divided by test-run. Notable here is that there are more
differences between the different test-runs than for the printed film flakes. The same
natural polypropylene pellets were used. The MFR for the metalized film was
measured in the same way as for the printed film.
As mentioned previously, the MFR for the metalized film flakes was around
6 g/10min, so a combination of the natural pellets and the film should be around
7 g/10min. That seems again not to be the case and the same assumption could be
made here that the pressed films were not homogenized when measuring the MFR,
which causes the values to shift. However, that should not make a big enough
difference, so that the MFR would be close to the values obtained from the different
test results.
Another possible explanation could be the aluminum that is present in the film and
that it causes polypropylene to degrade more than the samples where aluminum is
not present. Even though it is a small amount of metal, it could be enough to throw
off the results.

Figure 18. MFR results from all trial-runs for the metalized film flakes.

43

The change between the different screws seems to be quite big. The best result was
achieved with the gentler screw in test-run 1 and the addition of nitrogen. In trial-run
2, the addition of nitrogen could not compensate for having an open barrel. The
conclusion is made that the metalized film is more prone to degradation than the
printed film. The worst results in terms of MFR was with the addition of nitrogen
only. Some small breakdown of the polymer could be expected at test point 4 of testrun 2.
9.4.3 Control sample test points
The MFR results in graphs from the control test points can be seen in Figure 19
below.

Figure 19. MFR for all test-runs for the control samples.

From the results from the different test-runs seen above, it seems that there is not a
big difference between which screw is being used in terms of re-extruding the natural
polypropylene pellets. The MFR is somewhat higher than for the natural material,
which is at 8 g/10min. The change in operating conditions do not have a huge effect
on the polymer in question and from a viscosity standpoint it does hold up.
Comparing the results from all test-runs, and with all three materials, the conclusion
that can be drawn is that the films have a considerable effect on how the MFR results
differ. The metalized film does have the biggest problems in terms of achieving a
product that would be close to the original natural pellets as far as the MFR is
concerned.

44

The only substantial deviation was during test-run 1, when the barrel was open and
there was a nitrogen feed. The breakdown seems to be screw-related, and oxygen
was present in larger quantities somewhere in order to cause the polymer to oxidize.
In Figure 20 on the following page, the MFR result can be seen for the oxidized
polymer. Comparing the results from that with the graphs above, it shows that there
was severe degradation of the polymer with the MFR result as high as 389 g/10min.

9.5. Density
The density was measured on all three products from the pre-test. Three rectangle
discs were pressed, and the density was measured from all three discs and an average
value from the results was calculated. After pressing of the discs, it was noticed that
the control sample had noticeable air pockets in the discs. This is due to the form of
the re-extruded pellets. There was a hole right through the middle of each pellet. The
holes appear due to the machinery used in the test-runs. When pressing the pellets
into the discs, the gas in the air holes did not have anywhere to escape and it then
caused the air pockets to appear in them. In Figure 21, the air pockets can be seen in
the discs.

45

Figure 21. The pressed discs for measuring the density of the polymer with air pockets.

By having these air pockets in the discs, it was not possible to achieve an accurate
reading of the density of the different polymer blends. For both the pellets made
from printed and metalized film there was no visible air pockets due to the coloring
of the pellets, but when measured they showed the same signs of air pockets with the
density changing from measurement point to point. It can be assumed that there were
air pockets present in these discs as well.
The measured densities can be seen in Figure 22 as a graph below. It is notable that
the densities presented here are only approximations and do not represent the real
values for the density of the different polymers.

As can be seen in the graph, the highest density is for the printed film followed by
the metalized film pellet and the lowest is the control sample. When comparing these
values with the density of a polypropylene homopolymer cast film grade with the
typical density of 905 kg/m3, the control sample has a lower density than that of the
raw material. This also shows that the results obtained from the density analysis are
only an approximation of the density.

9.6. Cast film extrusion
For the pre-test and for test-run 2, there were films made to see if it was possible to
use the pellets to make new films. For the running of the films, samples of all three
materials were used from both the pre-test and test-run 2. The samples used were test
point 1, 4 and 7 from the pre-test and test points 3, 6 and 7 from test-run 2.
The extrusion of the films was done by mixing the samples with 50% of the same
raw material that was used in the pelletization of the recyclates. The extrusion was
done using a Collin 25 cast film extruder. In Table 14, the results from the test-runs
can be seen for the cast film made from the samples from the pre-test.
Table 14. Summarized cast film extrusion of the pre-test pellets.

From the table, it can be seen that the temperature of the chill rolls varied somewhat
between the different test points. The adjustments were made in order to improve the
film quality. The thickness of the film was not uniform and had some variations
depending on where the film had been measured. The variations in thickness could
be explained by the settings of the extruder or the processability of the pellets.
The scale in the table for the processability and gels goes from best to worst: ++, +,
o, - and --.
In Figure 23 on the following page, the rolls of extruded cast film made from the
pellets from the pre-test can be seen, from left to right the control film, film made
from printed extruded pellets, and film from metalized recycled pellets.

47

Figure 23. Rolls of cast film from pellets from the pre-test.

The processability of the various materials also differs from each other, with the
control being the best in terms of processability and the metalized pellets the hardest
to process. A decent amount of inhomogeneity could be seen in the films, mostly in
the printed and metalized films as pigment agglomerates.
Table 15. Summary of the cast film extrusion of the material from test-run 2.

In Table 15, a summary of the cast film extrusion process from the pellets extruded
in test-run 2 can be seen. As with the previous processing, the same slight changes in
roller temperature can be seen, even though the changes are not as considerable as in
the extrusion prior. The thickness varies here as well, both between the different raw
materials and the two different test-runs.
The processability of the metalized pellet has increased slightly, while the printed
film and control have the same processability as before. The same amount of
inhomogeneities can be seen in these samples as previously.
In both film extrusions, the coloring is the same as before, without any big visible
changes. The films were used in color analysis to be able to determine if there were
any changes in the color of the different pellets compared with each other.
In Figure 24, the rolls of polymer film made from the recycled pellet from test-run 2
can be seen, where the roll on the left is the one made from the control sample, the
one in the middle from the metalized film, and the one the right from the printed
film.

Figure 24. Rolls of cast film extruded films from the pellets form test-run 2.

9.6.1 Color analysis
In Table 16, the values from the CIELAB analysis of the printed and metalized reextruded films can be seen, where L* is the difference in darkness and lightness. If
the value is positive, the sample is lighter and if it is negative, it is darker. a* is the
difference in the red/green spectrum. A positive value indicates redder and negative
greener. b* indicates the difference between yellow and blue, the positive value more
yellow and negative blue.
Table 16. The results from the color analysis of the extruded films. Upper metalized film and lower
printed film.

From the values seen in the table for the metalized film, there seems not to be a big
difference between the two samples. The variations between the two samples may be
attributed to measurement error. By using formula 1 described in chapter 9.4, the
color difference between two different samples can be calculated. By inserting the
values into formula (1), the formula will become:
∆𝐸 ∗ = √(14.17 − 13.67)2 + (−0.65 + 0.66)2 + (0.69 − 0.36)2

(2)

49

Calculating the formula, the value the color difference ∆𝐸 ∗ for the metalized film
∆𝐸 ∗ = 0.68
The value indicates a small change in the color but would still be within
experimental error.
Having a look at the printed film values from the analysis, the trend continues with
no huge differences between the two samples able to be seen. Using the same
formula as for the metalized film, the color difference ∆𝐸 ∗ can be calculated by
inserting the values from Table 17 into equation 1. The equation becomes:

∆𝐸 ∗ = √(4 − 4)2 + (−21.31 + 20.90)2 + (11.28 − 11.77)2

(3)

Solving equation 3 gives:
∆𝐸 ∗ = 0.64
Again, a small difference in color can be seen, but not a significant one, and it can
again be discussed if the deviation is from a measurement error.

9.7 Discussion of the results
Based on the test-runs and the results from the different analyses, it can be concluded
that both printed and metalized polypropylene films are recyclable. The pellets can
be used again to manufacture film, despite the gels and specs that can be found in the
re-extruded films.
The re-extruded films have a slightly worse strength than those made from the
natural pellets used as a control. As a part of the visual inspection, the strength was
tested by ripping it by hand and it was able to withstand some force.
The recyclates, including the metalized film, should be further researched in the hope
of finding a solution in the product quality. The metal in the film has led to some
instability with the extrusion process as well as when casting the films. When ripping
the film, it was noticed that the product was quite low quality, and one did not need
much strength to rip the film. It seems that the aluminum in the film is degrading the
polypropylene, and the removal of aluminum should be something to focus on in the
future in order to be able to obtain a recyclate with better quality.
By starting the research on a small scale, the different methods can be tested before
the development of a large-scale process. There is also the benefit of having less raw
material going to waste if something goes wrong with the tests. Clean up is also
easier to do in a small-scale process. The challenges in scaling up processes is that
the parameters used in a smaller scale would somehow have to be fitted to work with
a bigger system. Some graphs or formulas should be able to be adjusted in order to

50

find the right parameters for the process going forward, and one should also find out
what the small-scale tests would correlate to on a larger extruder, for example.
A further challenge that should be discussed is the screws being contaminated by
coloring and the cleaning of the screws. When these are present, the cleaning of the
screws is a long process, and some raw material is going to waste during the flushing
process.

10. Conclusions
The harms of polymers have been widely discussed in the media during recent years.
This is due to the growing amount of polymers used and thrown away, the littering
by people and, to be frank, the lack of knowledge from different sources. Recycling
the polymers and making new products from the recyclates is a hot topic and is
widely researched today. Being able to recycle plastics will be beneficial for the
environment as well as companies and everyone else. Through recycling, a smaller
amount of trash would be dumped into landfills and into the water streams.
Viable options for recycling will also have to be further researched, so that they are
more economical and energy efficient. Some steps have been taken, but there is still
a long way to go in order to reach the goals set by the EU, for example.
In this thesis, the goals of the EU were presented and discussed. How the raw
material is made, what the challenges of recycling are, and some possible solutions
to the recycling process have also been presented in the literature part of the thesis.
In the experimental part, two different films were used in the experiments. These are
a printed film and a metalized film. Both films underwent the same preparation
process and were extruded under similar conditions. Out of these two, the easier one
to recycle is the printed film, even though the color in the print leaves contaminants
in the barrel. Some good progress has been made in the quality of the product, but
there is a long way to go still. Due to the huge variations in MFR, the metalized film
has been deemed more difficult to recycle and the quality of the polymer as well as
the film is not as good as the printed film. It should be noted that there are different
kinds of ink types and only one has been used in the experiments.
The toolbox created is useful as a starting point for the recycling of the films. It has
been somewhat limited due to the test-run capabilities and should be developed
further. For different types of films and inks, the methods presented in this thesis can
be used to determine if the same operating conditions can be applied to other films as
well.
Further research would still have to be conducted for both films, in order to
neutralize the color of the print and for the aluminum to be removed. However, as
mentioned in the previous chapter, this will be a good starting point in the
development of the toolbox for the recycling process. By continuous research and
development in the field, the challenges should be solved someday soon.
