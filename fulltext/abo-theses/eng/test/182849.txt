Title: Sustainability risk management in supply chains- A case study of Finnish companies
Supervisor: Monica Nyholm
Abstract:
Sustainability has become an important topic of today’s business environment.
Stakeholders are more aware of the sustainability phenomenon and thus require
companies to comply with their sustainability requirements. At the same time importance
of supply chains has increased and competition between companies has switched rather
to competition between supply chains. Supply chains are longer and the number of actors
has increased which has made sustainability management more complex in supply chains.
There is a vast number of sustainability risks in today’s supply chains that can harm
companies. Negative reports, loss of reputation, and losing competitive advantages are
negative impacts that can be a result of realized sustainability risks in a supply chain. A
company is often considered as sustainable as its supply chain. Therefore, companies are
required to manage sustainability risks in their supply chains. In this thesis, a sustainability
risk management framework is presented. In addition, various management tools are
discussed to obtain a holistic view of how sustainability risks can be managed in supply
chains.
This thesis discusses how Finnish companies manage sustainability risks in supply chains.
The three case companies which are Kesko, UPM, and Neste have been chosen from the
2020 Global 100 ranking and thus represent some of the most sustainable companies in
the world. The case companies are analyzed with help of a framework that is presented in
previous literature. The analyzed data consists of companies’ reports and other
information from their websites. In addition, reports from NGOs are utilized to obtain an
objective perspective of the phenomenon. The NGO reports demonstrate that the case
companies have had sustainability issues in their supply chains which is a prove of how
difficult it is to manage sustainability risks, especially in long supply chains.
The main result of the empirical study is that the case companies have clear frameworks
to manage sustainability-related risks in supply chains. The companies utilize similar steps
that include the framework that is presented in the literature review. In addition, they
have similar tools to manage sustainability risks such as code of conduct, certificates, and
supplier development. However, even the case companies have clear operations in
sustainability risks management, they have to further develop their processes.
Sustainability risk management in supply chains is a constant loop where new risks might
occur. Therefore, companies are required to monitor their processes and try to find ways
how to improve practices.

Keywords: Sustainability, supply chain, sustainable supply chain management, risk

1.Introduction
1.1 Problem area
Company evaluation criteria have expanded from the traditional measurements, such
as balance sheets and income statements to sustainability, which has gained increasing
attention and affected companies’ overall presentation. Its impact extends to
companies' core functions, in addition to which the companies’ various stakeholders,
such as suppliers, are evaluated. This, in turn affects the purchasing company
evaluation. Concurrently, the responsibility of companies has extended from
organizational boundaries to cover broader relationships in supply chains. (Shafiq et
al., 2017) Environmental, social, and economic sustainability issues are among the
major challenges organizations face today. These three dimensions form the
sustainability pillars (Xu et al., 2019).
Supply chains cause various risks for companies from the sustainability point of view.
According to Multaharju (2016), many of the environmental and social sustainability
risks are caused by upstream suppliers. Therefore, managing sustainability risks in
supply chains have an important role in the entire sustainability management of a firm
and understanding and managing sustainability risks in supply chains are necessary for
companies. Avoiding negative reports, loss of reputation, and therefore losing
competitive advantage are among the objectives of implementing sustainable actions
in supply chain management (Freise & Seuring, 2015). Other risks can relate to
violations in labor conditions, greenhouse gas emissions, and corruption in supply
chains (Altura et al., 2019).
Sustainability risks in supply chains can damage companies in various ways.
Protection of corporate reputation is seen as one of the strongest drivers for
implementing and maintaining sustainable supply chain management practices.
Negative media attention and boycotts can harm corporate reputation and impact
company revenues negatively. (Hoejmose et al., 2014) Supply chain interruption, legal
and financial costs, as well as penalties can be results of boycotts (Giannakis &
Papadopoulos, 2016). Pressure and expectations towards companies steer sustainable
supply chain management. External pressure is seen as the major actor of risk
1

awareness in supply chain management. Regulatory bodies highlight the importance
of environmental aspects, whereas the social aspect is emphasized by the stakeholders.
(Foerstl et al., 2010)
Supply chain sustainability risk management is a combination of three actions: supply
chain management, sustainability management, and risk management. Managing
sustainability-related risks in supply chains aims to impact all three sustainability
categories of a company. (Valinejad & Rahmani, 2018)

Figure 1. Supply chain sustainability risk management (Valinejad & Rahmani, 2018).

1.2 Purpose and research questions
Awareness of sustainability among various stakeholders has increased and will
continue to do so in the future. Shareholders’ attitudes toward sustainability can have
a significant effect on the operation of a company.
Supply chains have a significant impact on the sustainability level of a company, and
it is difficult or even impossible for a company to be sustainable if its supply chains
have limitations in sustainability. Due to the importance of supply chains, the risks
they pose for companies may be significant. If a supply chain risk is realized, the
stakeholders’ reactions can have far-reaching negative consequences and therefore,
companies have begun to emphasize sustainability risk management in their supply
chains.
This thesis aims to obtain a holistic view of how Finnish companies manage
sustainability-related risk in their supply chains and how they are prepared for the
future. To obtain a comprehensive view of sustainable supply chain management in
the chosen companies, the thesis examines the subject from three perspectives. One
of the research questions is theoretical, two empirical and the last question is
normative.
Theoretical: Which kinds of risks are there in sustainable supply chain management?
Empirical: Which kinds of challenges are there to manage sustainability risks?
Are there differences between industries in how sustainability risks are
managed?
Normative: How can companies improve their sustainability risk management in
supply chains?

1.3 Limitations
This study examines Finnish public companies that are among the 100 most
sustainable companies in the world, according to Corporate Knight’s 2020 list. The
case companies were chosen on the basis of their success in sustainability operations.
This enables obtaining a broad image of how advanced and generally sustainable
recognized companies implement sustainability practices and thus, manage
sustainability risks in their supply chains. The chosen case companies are Finnish but
have international activities and therefore the results can be expected to be valid
internationally. The discussion is mainly related to the companies’ operations in 2019.
However, activities of previous years will also be taken into account, such as
challenges in sustainability management in supply chains.
Two out of three sustainability dimensions are taken into account: environmental and
social. Economical dimension is not considered. According to UNDP (UNDP,
sustainable procurement), sustainable procurement can be defined as a procurement
that has lowest environmental impact and most positive social results. Since this
definition emphasizes only environmental and social dimensions, this master’s thesis
focuses on these two dimensions only.

1.4 Method
The empirical part of this study is a qualitative case study where the case companies
will be examined. The case companies operate in various business sectors. The chosen
method and the diversity of business sectors enable the generalization of the results.
The empirical research are based primarily on companies’ data which is supplemented
with data from various NGOs. This enables a more holistic view about sustainability
risk management and misconducts are taken into account.

1.5 Disposition
The thesis is divided into six chapters. In the first chapter, the master’s thesis is
introduced. A general overview of the thesis is presented, the aim of the thesis and
research questions are discussed. In addition, chosen methods are briefly introduced
and key concepts are defined.
The second and third chapters comprise the literature review. The second chapter
discusses sustainable supply chain management and various risks in supply chains.
Both ordinary and sustainable supply chain risks are described in the chapter. In the
third chapter, the framework of the master thesis is introduced. Sustainability risk
management is discussed more specifically. Thereafter, a sustainability risk
management framework is introduced, which is the core of the empirical phase of the
thesis.
The method phase is discussed in the fourth chapter. The chosen method is introduced
and justified and the analysis phases are also described.
The fifth chapter consists of the empirical analysis of the case companies. The analysis
is based on the sustainability risk management framework which is discussed in the
third chapter. The case companies are examined individually, and at the end of the
chapter, the analysis is concluded.
The conclusion of the master thesis is the last chapter. The research questions are
answered and future research is suggested.

1.6 Definitions and key concepts
Sustainable development: “Development that meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (Brundtland
1987, 37).
Supply chain: Is a combination of product life-cycle processes that consist of various
flows such as physical, information, financial. The aim is to fulfill end-user
requirements with a product or a service. (Ayers & Odegaard, 2017)
Sustainable supply chain management: “Strategic, transparent integration and
achievement of an organization’s social, environmental, and economic goals in the
systemic coordination of key inter-organizational business processes for improving the
long-term economic performance of the individual company and its supply chains”
(Carter & Rogers 2008, 368).
Risk management: This is a combination of preparing to face various risks (pre-riskmanagement phase) and to face their consequences (post-risk-management phase)
(Valinejad & Rahmani, 2018).

1.7 Chapter summary
Importance of sustainability has increased in today’s business. This has affected
companies’ supply chains and thus supply chain management. Different sustainability
dimensions can cause risks for companies and their supply chains. Risks can have vast
consequences from negative reports to loss of reputation. Therefore, companies focus
on sustainability risk management in their supply chain operations. Supply chain
sustainability risk management combines three different dimensions: supply chain
management, sustainability management and risk management. This enables to
manage sustainability-related risks in supply chains. The aim of the master’s thesis is
to obtain a holistic view of how Finnish companies manage sustainability risks in their
supply chains. The empirical study is a qualitative case study where three case
companies will be examined. To obtain an extensive view about phenomenon there
are four research questions. One is theoretical, two are empirical and the last one is
normative. Theoretical question is: “Which kinds of risks are there in sustainable
6

supply chain management”, empirical questions are: “Which kinds of challenges are
there to manage sustainability risks” and “Are there differences between industries in
how sustainability risks are managed?”, normative question is: “How can companies
improve their sustainability risk management in supply chains?”.

2.Literature review
The literature review will discuss previous research on sustainable supply chain
management, supply chain risks, and sustainable supply chain risks. Thereafter, a
framework for managing supply chain risks will be introduced, and different
sustainability risk management tools will be discussed.

2.1 Characteristics of sustainable supply chain management
General opinion today is that companies are fully responsible for their product and
services, even though these would be out of their direct control most of their lifetimes
(Savitz 2013). Supply chain management provides a great opportunity to put the
strategic goals of sustainability into practice. Sustainable supply chain management is
seen as the frontline of sustainability in business. (Meixell & Luoma 2015)
Supply chain management can be described as the design and management of flows
that consist of products, information, and funds. Flows go through networks, including
production and delivery of final products to the end-users. (Wood, 2014) According to
Lambert (2008), supply chain management encompasses key business processes from
original suppliers to the end customer. The value created for customers and other
stakeholders thus passes through an entire supply chain.
Supply chains consist of different stakeholders from multi-tier suppliers to customers,
who are often situated in different locations. Efficiency, timeliness, and stability are
important business performance measurements in supply chain management, but these
are supplemented with sustainable performance (Xu et al., 2019). Sustainable supply
chain management is a broader definition of supply chain management. All three
sustainability dimensions are considered. Carter and Rogers (2008) define sustainable
supply chain management as: “Strategic, transparent integration and achievement of
an organization’s social, environmental, and economic goals in the systemic
coordination of key inter-organizational business processes for improving the longterm economic performance of the individual company and its supply chains”.

8

All three sustainability dimensions are considered in decision-making. The aim is to
analyze processes and minimize the possible negative impacts. Labor rights, chemicals
in products, C02, or the water footprint of a product are examples of issues that might
arise or be influenced at any point of a supply chain and by any of the actors. (Kogg
& Mont, 2012) Hence, companies should pay attention to all phases of a supply chain
where sustainability risks can be reduced. Increased transparency requirements of the
supply chain and source of end products are the some of the factors that affect brand
and image value, as well as reputation risk.
Social dimensions of supply chain management focus on the utilization and
management of labor from the suppliers’ side, whether for raw materials, goods, or
services. Poverty wages and dangerous labor conditions are common factors that
interest global supply chain managers when supply chains are planned. (Wood, 2014)
The environmental dimension in supply chains considers energy savings, reducing
pollution and waste, and ensuring the health and safety of consumers (Lintukangas et
al., 2015). A company´s capability to act in an environmentally sustainable way can
be measured by how well it manages environmental aspects, for example by pollution
controls and prevention, management systems for the environment, environmental
competencies, and improvement measures. (Winter & Lasch, 2016). Environmental
problems, such as pollution and discharge of waste, have a high probability of causing
a risk to the brand and hence undermine a firm’s reputation. Therefore, companies
focus more on environmentally friendly products and the requirements at all
manufacturing stages in all industries are becoming stricter. (Lintukangas et al., 2016)
The various factors that influence companies’ sustainable supply chain management

can be divided into two parts: internal and external. The internal factors include top
management vision, customer demand, and suppliers’ initiatives, whereas external
factors consist of regulatory requirements, stakeholder actions, and the nature of the
business, as well as competitors. (Ageron et al., 2012) Hollo et al., (2012) mention the
importance of customers’ preferences for sustainability in supply chain management.
Understanding the customers’ expectations towards sustainability objectives can be
used in the strategic orientation of a firm. Sustainability practices as part of strategic
orientation may lead to a more comprehensive sustainable supplier co-operation that
9

can improve sustainability actions even more. However, sustainable supply chain
management challenges companies. According to Giunperoet al., (2012),
organizations have difficulties balancing the need to satisfy stakeholders’ short-term
profit goals against sustainability goals in the long term. Hence, organizations should
focus on understanding the expectations of their most important stakeholders and then
satisfy their needs. This enables them to avoid and allay risks in their sustainable
supply chains.
Sustainable supply chain management consists of different aspects and can be done in
various ways. There are differences between companies and industries. Different
sustainability dimensions are emphasized depending on the industry (Juettner et al.,
2020). Hallikas et al., (2002) allege that protecting reputation in some industries is
more substantiated than in some others. The Chemical, pharmaceutical, oil, and gas
industries focus on environmental issues (Rebs et al, 2018). According to Winter and
Lasch (2016), in the fashion and clothing industry, social criteria are more commonly
used compared to environmental criteria. In addition, they state that environmental and
social issues are seen as more significant in the food industry compared to the
engineering industry. Stekelorum et al., (2020) claim that the transportation industry
is more interested in environmental dimensions because it is one of the most significant
contributors to carbon emissions. The social dimension is in its infancy and hence is
not as developed in sustainable supply chain management.
Companies should analyze which of the sustainability dimensions they can affect the
most and make decisions based on these analyzes. It has been found that firms in B2C
pay more attention to sustainability than in B2B market. Even though B2C companies
would have a closer review for sustainable supply chain management the networks of
supply chains affect also B2B companies. In order for a supply chain to be sustainable,
all the actors need to implement sustainable practices. Consumer expectations and
demands are passed on to B2C firms who further pass these down the supply chain to
B2B firms. (Hoejmose et al., 2014) Communication between partners is key because
it facilitates to have partners on the same level. Understanding the expectations of
stakeholders helps companies fulfill their requirements but communicating about
sustainable supply chain management towards stakeholders enables stakeholders to
have a better understanding of why certain actions have been implemented.
10

Sustainability supply chain management challenges all companies regardless of size
and resources. Every year there is announced Top 25 supply chains in the world by
Gartner. The list is based on various supply chain practice parameters. Companies such
as Apple Inc. and Unilever are two companies that consistently top the charts in the
list. Despite their practice in the supply chain and success in the Top 25 list, both
companies face challenges related to sustainability issues in their supply chains.
iPhone factories have been at the center of attention for riots and suicides at their
supplier factories. Unilever has received bad publicity because their suppliers have
released toxic mercury into human settlements. (Gouda and Saranga, 2018) These
examples show that even though organizations obtain credit from supply chain actions
and are be seen as forerunners in sustainable supply chain management, it is difficult
to avoid all the challenges that might occur in a supply chain.
Lack of information is seen as one of the challenges that affect sustainable supply
chain management. It is difficult to obtain sufficient information from all stages in a
supply chain. For instance, following the cotton back from stores to the farms is almost
impossible (O´Rourke, 2014). When information is deficient, there is a greater chance
of various risks that can damage the company. Therefore, sustainable supply chain
management is a challenging task, but it is required to ensure that production has been
done in a way that will satisfy the key stakeholders. Besides, it is important to follow
the process in companies and further develop practices for a more sustainable way.
Sustainability practices in supply chain management have been focusing more on
environmental aspects than social and economic ones. The social aspect has received
less attention due to the difficulties in its assessment. It has been challenging to
discover suitable approaches to assess social-related actors in supply chains.
(D’eusanio et al., 2019) Companies struggle to define, realize, and plan social issues.
It is difficult to realize the competitive benefits that this might have for companies.
(Klassen & Vereecke, 2012) The importance of different sustainability dimensions’
risks differ from others’. Social-related risks are seen as “slightly lesser risks” than
economic or environmental. However, social and environmental risks are seen more
frequently in the media. (Giannakis & Papadopoulus, 2016) Therefore sustainable
supply chain management can be used as a tool for managing risks.
11

According to Olson (2014), there are two types of risks in supply chains: operational
risks and disruptions. Customer demand, supply, and cost consist of operational risks
whereas various disasters such as floods and hurricanes, terrorist attacks and wars,
currency reevaluations, and strikes.

Risks can be divided into ordinary and

sustainability-related risks, both of these should be taken into account in supply chain
risk management. Supply chain disruptions trigger ordinary supply chain risks. The
disruptions can hinder the flow of goods, financial resources, and services. The
difference between the ordinary and sustainability-related risks is that stakeholder
reactions arise from sustainability-related risks. Organizations should focus equally on
both triggering mechanisms. If only ordinary risks are focused on, there is a high risk
that sustainability issues are not noticed or are underestimated. (Hofmann et al., 2014)

2.2 Supply chain risks
Irregular and unpredicted events can have negative effects on supply chains. When
organizations consider supply chain risk-management programs, responding to
irregular events should be included in the processes. Drake, 2012) Supply chain risk
can be defined as “the possibility of unpredictable events resulting in negative
consequences for the firm under investigation in a supply chain” (Hajmohammad &
Vachon, 2016). Zsidisin (2003) defines supply risk as “the probability of an incident
associated with inbound supply from individual supplier failures or the supply market
occurring, in which its outcomes result in the inability of the purchasing firm to meet
customer demand or cause threats to customer life and safety”. Faisal (2009) classifies
risks in supply chains into two parts: risks arising from the supply chain network and
external risks to it.
While globalization enables companies to obtain benefits from the markets, it also
poses problems for companies. Thun and Hoening (2011) state that globalization is
seen as the biggest driver for supply chain risks. When there is an increased number
of actors in a supply chain, companies have less power to control the whole chain.
Globalization has increased the length and complexity of supply chains, which has
been identified as one of the major challenges for supply chains. Because of the
complexity of supply chains, risks can be multidimensional, making it difficult to
12

prepare for them. However, often reward and risk go hand in hand. Although
minimizing different risks is important in supply chain management, companies need
to be prepared to take some level of risk.
There is a plethora of different supply chain risks companies face. According to
Christopher et al., (2011) global sourcing risks can be divided into four different
categories: Supply risk, such as supply disruptions and reliability risks; environmental
and sustainability risk, such as fluctuation in interest rates and carbon emissions in the
supply chain; process and control risk, such as inefficiency in supply teams; and
demand risk, e.g. variations in demand and uncertainty in the market.
There are multiple supply chain risk sources, therefore supply chain risk management
can be implemented in various ways. Thun & Hoenig (2011) state that supply chain
risk management consists of two instruments, preventive and reactive. Cause-related
measurements are preventive instruments. Preventive instruments enable the reduction
of the likelihood of risk occurrence. Whereas reactive instruments aim to mitigate the
negative impact of risks that have realized. It is necessary to have both kinds of
instruments in risk management, since not all of the risks can be prevented but
mitigation is possible

2.3 Sustainable supply chain risks
Hofmann et al., (2014) define a sustainability-related risk as “a condition or potentially
occurring event that may provoke harmful stakeholder reactions”. Giannakis and
Papadopoulos (2016) define sustainability-related supply chain risk is as “a
sustainability risk within a focal firm´s supply chain”. Sustainability-related risks in
supply chains have also been defined as increased vulnerability in a chain due to the
negative impacts of sourcing on economic, social, and environmental sustainability
(Christopher et al., 2011). Sustainability-related risks differ from the traditional risks
in that they might trigger severe stakeholder reactions that may affect the firm
negatively without causing supply disruptions. Therefore, considering sustainabilityrelated risks aims to deal with the negative effects on the stakeholders. Alluding to Xu
et al., (2019) environmental risks are easier to manage by a company’s actions whereas
social risks are more difficult as social factors are seen as exogenous. Social risks
13

depend largely on local socioeconomics conditions. Therefore, society and governance
have a large impact.
According to Busse (2016) supply chain sustainability risks can cause not only
financial costs that are actual monetary costs but also opportunity costs where lost
revenues cause unrealized profits. For instance, environmental risks in supply chains
can be related to violations of laws and regulations that can lead to financial losses
resulting from fines (Valinejad & Rahmani, 2018). Boycotts which can occur due to
loss of reputation are common, and customers can cancel their orders because of the
issues. Sustainability issues in a supply chain might undermine companies by lowering
the value of the brand, decreasing sales, and thus affecting shareholders’ profit.
(Lintukangas et al., 2016) Supplier sustainability risks are associated with a reduction
of 1,00 percent in shareholder value (Kim et al., 2019). Sustainability risks can disrupt
supply chains. Examples such as demonstrations and roadblocks can be results of a
sustainability risk that can lead to financial losses. (Hajmohammad & Vachon, 2016)
Previous examples show that sustainability-related risks in supply chains can affect
companies comprehensively and can have unpredictable outcomes.
Hofman et al., (2014) categorize sustainability-related risks into three different
aspects. Social issues include working conditions and compensation. Child labor is
seen as one of the most pressing social risks due to its severity and the difficulty to
detect it (Giannakis & Papadopoulos, 2016). Ecological issues include input-related
and production output-related aspects. Input-related aspects are such as energy
consumption and utilization of resources whereas emissions and recycling are among
production output-related aspects. Giannakis and Papadopoulos (2016) highlight
natural disasters, greenhouse gas emissions, and pollution as the most important
sustainability risk factors. The third issue is the so-called ethical business conduct.
Corruption and business connections can be linked among them.
Sustainability related risks in the supply chain differ from traditional risks, such as
disruption from the specific materializing mechanism point of view. Disruption in a
supply chain might hinder the flow of goods, financial resources, or services whereas
supply chain risks related to sustainability issues are triggered by stakeholder
reactions. (Hofmann et al., 2014) According to Valinejad and Rahmani, (2018)
14

sustainability-related supply chain risks that focus on the social and environmental
aspects can be risks that organizations have not considered but can damage the social
image, lucrativeness, competitiveness, and sustainability in supply chains in the long
run. Some risks related to supply chains can be operational-related and sustainabilityrelated at the same time. For instance, a chemical accident happens at a manufacturing
plant, it might affect the distribution of the chemical and at the same time provoke
stakeholder reactions. (Hofmann et al., 2014)
Sustainability-related risks in supply chains do not only consist of reputational losses
or stakeholder pressure. These risks may also affect the operational side of the buying
company. For instance, a buying company might face an unexpected shortage of
critical materials if its supplier has to shut down because of an accident. (Vachon &
Klassen, 2006) Christopher et al., (2011) claim that besides reputation effects,
environmental issues might increase the costs of a company. Hallikas et al., (2020)
insist that sustainable purchases mitigate operational supply chain risks that occur due
to disruptions. Sustainable purchasing practices allay risks such as product availability,
delayed orders, and supplier bankruptcy. Hence implementing sustainable supply
chain management practices enable not only managing the buyer company’s
reputation but to avoid operational damages.

Risks can be divided into two parts: internal and external. External risks are risks that
are out of firms´ control and internal risks can be defined as the risks related to the
management of the supply chain. When planning external risk management, plans
should focus on reducing the size of the negative impact. Risk mitigation strategies
among internal risks should focus on identifying the core of the risks and preventing
the risk from realizing by deriving control or coordinating mechanisms. (Kouvelis et
al., 2011) Giannakis and Papadopoulus (2016) state that internal (endogenous) risks
are more important compared to external (exogenous) risks because internal risks
occur due to the actions or inactions of a company or its suppliers.
External risks are often more unpredictable and thus more difficult to manage
compared to internal risks. Not all of the risks can be managed and thus companies
should be able to prioritize what are the most critical risk and how these challenges
can be managed. It is more useful to concentrate on risks that are more probable and
prepare to face these challenges. Even though there is a large number of different
aspects of sustainability companies do not pay attention to all of them. For instance, in
the fashion industry internal social aspect is significantly more important compared to
the external social aspect. It is suggested that the reason why internal social aspects
are seen as more important compared to the external aspects, is that external aspects
go beyond the legal minimum, and in addition, it is more difficult to gather information
from the external aspects. Regardless, environmental and social sustainability aspects
are vital in the supplier evaluation process. Criteria such as no child labor, health and
safety practices, and the existence of a wastewater treatment system must be fulfilled
by a supplier to have a contract. (Winter & Lasch, 2015).

Figure 3. Social related sustainability risks in supply chains (Giannakis and
Papadopoulus, 2016).
Identifying different sustainability-related risks at the suppliers’ end, evaluating them,
and elaborating suppliers’ capabilities in sustainability practices are examples of how
organizations can ensure that suppliers follow sustainable practices. The practices aim
to help increase awareness and enhance sustainability practices at the suppliers’ end.
(Gouda and Saranga, 2018) According to Hoejmose et al., (2014) the whole
organization and supply network entirely needs to adopt sustainable supply chain
management practices to mitigate reputational risks. Customers are more aware when
“greenwashing” is easier to reveal. The negative impact will follow greenwashing
which is why organizations should turn responsible supply chain management into
concrete actions. “Greenwaashing” is easier to prevent, if risks are viewed
comprehensively.

17

There are various methods to manage sustainability risks in supply chains.
Hajmohammed and Vachon (2016) determine four separate strategies in sustainability
risk management strategies: risk avoidance, monitoring risk mitigation, collaborationbased risk mitigation, and risk acceptance. Risk avoidance aims to drive the risk event
probability to zero. It can be done by removing the source of the risk. Hofmann et al.,
(2014) framework for managing sustainability-related risks in the supply chain
consists of four different functions: stakeholder involvement, a translator, supplier
management, and stakeholder management. The functions supplement the traditional
supply chain risk management. With the help of the framework, companies can
integrate stakeholder management into risk management. This can be done by
convening stakeholders’ expectations to the supply side. Stakeholder involvement is
entails identifying the most important stakeholders for the specific business
environment. Stakeholder involvement provides companies stakeholders’ preferences,
perspectives, and criteria on potentially critical issues related to their supply chains.
Processing the stakeholder expectations can be done with the translator function. After
expectations are known these are explicated into assessment criteria. Seuring and
Freise (2015) state that pressure and incentives from stakeholders are the main drivers
in managing risks related to environmental and social issues. In addition, legitimacy is
seen as one of the objectives. Legitimate to operate is earned when a company arranges
activities with the goals and values of the society. The social license must be earned
from the important stakeholders. (Willard, 2012) The third function, supplier
management, communicates the redefined expectations down to the suppliers.
Supplier management can be found from ordinary supply risk management practices
and is the only one in this framework. Suppliers need to follow the criteria that focal
companies expect from them or stakeholders might react negatively. Supplier
management includes following the suppliers’ process in compliance with the criteria.
Therefore, regular audits, quality checks, and participation in compliance initiatives
are an important part of supplier management. The last function in this framework,
stakeholder management, enables companies to display their efforts t and interact with
their stakeholders. Stakeholder management provides companies opportunities to
consider particular sustainability-related risks in supply chains with suitable
management activities and planning an outlook for managing these risks in the future.

18

Sustainability-related risks have a significant impact on supply operations in a
company but besides, they affect the overall presentation of a company. Therefore,
managing sustainability risks improves their overall presentation and avoid financial
losses that can be caused by different circumstances that have been discussed in this
section.

2.4Chapter summary
Companies are seen fully responsible for their products and service, even these would
be out of their direct control most of their lifetimes. Therefore, supply chain
management and especially sustainable supply chain management is a great
opportunity to sustainability into practice. Supply chains are complex entities since
there is a vast number of various actors involved which are often situated in different
locations. In the ordinary supply chain management efficiency, timeliness, and
stability are seen as important performance measurements. However, when
sustainability dimension is taken into account, there is an increased number of factors
companies should consider. For instance, labor rights and C02 emissions should be
considered when supply chains are managed in a sustainable way. If the sustainability
dimensions are not taken into account, companies have a high probability of causing a
risk to the brand and thus undermine a firm’s reputation.
Supply chains face various risks. These irregular and unpredicted events can have
negative impact on supply chain. A supply chain risk is defined as “the possibility of
unpredictable events resulting in negative consequences for the firm under
investigation in a supply chain”. Sustainability-related supply chain risk is an increased
vulnerability in a chain due to the negative impacts of sourcing on economic, social,
and environmental sustainability. The difference between an ordinary supply chain
risk and sustainability related supply chain risk is that sustainability related risks might
trigger severe several stakeholder reactions that may affect the firm negatively without
causing supply disruptions. Sustainability related risks aim to deal with negative
effects on the stakeholders. Sustainability risks affect on supply operations but in
addition, they affect the overall presentation of a company. When sustainability risks
are managed, companies have better possibilities to improve overall presentation and
avoid financial losses that stakeholder reactions might cause.

3.Sustainability Risk Management
Giannakis and Papadopoulus (2016) have made a framework for managing risks
related to sustainability in supply chains. The framework consists of five stages: risk
identification, risk assessment, risk analysis, risk treatment and, risk monitoring, and
control. Management of sustainability risks is crucial because it is impossible to avoid
all of the risks. Planning risk management processes provide companies mature
decision-making processes to face unexpected events that cause unexpected damage
to companies. One of the keys to mitigation is to identify the possible losses that might
occur from unexpected damages. A war-gaming approach can be used when
companies speculate losses. The approach facilitates understanding what kind of plans
can be used in damaging scenarios. (Manuj and Mentzer, 2008)

3.1Risk identification
Risk identification is the first phase of the framework. Different risks can be clustered
into a group when risks are identified. After risks are grouped it is easier to allocate
what kind of supply chain management processes are relevant to each risk. (Rangel et
al., 2014) The aim of identifying the risks is to have a profile of each of the risks which
have been noticed. Juettner et al. (2020), highlight that identifying and assessing all
potentially damaging practices should be the priority of supply chain management.
Profiling consists of elements of the specific risk, is it atomistic or holistic,
quantitative, and/or qualitative, will it affect domestic and/or global operations (Manuj
& Menzer, 2008). An especially challenging task for companies with complex supply
chains is assessing the most vulnerable operations to major sources of uncertainty.
However, it should be seen as a crucial task in risk management. (Drake, 2012)
Organizations have different weights on different sustainability dimensions. For
instance, environmental issues are taken care of more closely if the environmental risks
are more relevant to a company’s business. (Xu et al., 2019) Due to limited resources
and capabilities it is important to focus on the relevant topics, and Lemke et al., (2013)
highlight the importance of risk prioritization. Prioritization determines which of the
risks need immediate attention and which are not as urgent.
Understanding the greatest sustainability-related issues for stakeholders is one of the
first steps in sustainable supply chain management (Maignan et al., 2002) Therefore,
stakeholder involvement should be considered as one of the tools. Assessment of key
stakeholders is an important activity and should be implemented before identifying or
assessing any risks in supply chains. Different stakeholders perceive different
sustainability issues as relevant. Some stakeholders might have specific sustainability
interests and therefore emphasize the importance of them (NGOs), some are more
interested in the narrower supply chain (unions) and some of them are interested in
special investigative skills and knowledge (media). Hence, identifying the most
important stakeholders, and trying to satisfy their expectations is an important task for
companies when managing sustainability dimensions in supply chains. (Busse et al.,
2017)

21

3.2Risk assessment and analysis
After risks are identified, companies assess the risks to determine the most critical risks
for the supply chain. The aim is to recognize the greatest risks in a supply chain,
enabling companies to pay more attention to these. Rangel et al., (2014) suggest
categorizing the identified risks to cover the different risks in a structured and
systematic way. Categorizing, assessing and evaluating the identified risks also
enables companies to acknowledge how risks affect companies. Assessment and
evaluation can be implemented by using different criteria such as potential losses,
probability, impact/consequences, and worst case scenario. (Manuj & Menzer, 2008)
Torres-Ruiz and Ravindran (2018) have a framework for assessing sustainability risks
in supply chains. Three factors are assessed: hazard, vulnerability, and risk
management. Determining a hazard potential is divided into two main parts: Impact
and Occurrence. The level of hazardousness is known when the impact and occurrence
of specific supply segments are taken into consideration. A hazard can impact an
organization’s reputation, access to capital, supply security, regulation, and efficiency
and productivity. These might have consequences in the short, medium, or long-term.
Risk assessment facilitates the prioritizing of risks (Petersen & Lemke, 2015). Foestl
et al., (2010) emphasize the importance of risk assessment in sustainability risk
management since without an effective assessment process, there is only a limited
chance to find sustainability issues that can result in potential financial losses.
Foerstl et al., (2010) survey analyzed companies in the chemical industry. According
to the survey, most of the companies used four different indicators when assessing
risk.: (1) physical properties of the supplier product, (2) the related production process,
this includes how labor is used or involved chemical substances, (3) where the supplier
is located, (4) how the supplier has performed earlier. All of these indicators are used
to assess what kind of risks the supplier might cause and how these risks might affect
the focal company. Four- or five-point scale ratings are used to reflect the probability
of occurrence for each supplier relationship.
When assessing risks, it is useful to look whether there are positive correlations
between two risk factors. This enables the treatment of multiple risks at the same time.
Environmental and economic-related factors and social and economic-related factors
appear to have a positive correlation, whereas social and environmental do not. For
22

instance, child labor is correlated with bribery and financial crises. (Giannakis and
Papadopoulus, 2016) Also Freise and Seuring (2015) state that win-win situations can
be found from environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability.

Risk

assessment should be a comprehensive analysis of possible risks and what can be done
to mitigate these risks. In particular, if there is a lack of resources, managing more than
one risk at the same time can have a substantial positive impact on the overall
performance of a company.
There are various methods of risk assessment that can be implemented. Waitrose Ltd,
a supermarket brand in the UK, has determined a process for supplier risk assessment.
New suppliers are required to complete a self-assessment inquiry and analysis relating
to a pre-defined weighted analysis of areas of vulnerability. High-risk organizations
are required to go through an independent ethical review for responsible sourcing.
Often, if non-compliance is found in reviews, the question is whether the issues are
significant and will suppliers implement corrective actions on these issues. An
important point in Waitrose Ltd’s process is that initial non-compliance does not lead
to de-listing, rather a program of corrective measures. (Spence and Bourlakis, 2009)
Various factors impact the risks that have been identified. Vulnerability assessment
enables companies to explore the exposures to a serious disturbance in the supply
chain. The framework centers on the three sustainability dimensions at the country and
supplier level. Environmental and social sustainability issues at the supplier level
consist of climate change, human rights, and labor practice, resource use, and human
health and safety. Country risks include political and economic, logistics, climate
change, trust, and human rights and labor practice. (Torres-Ruiz & Ravindran, 2018)
According to Reinerth et al., (2019) country risk assessment facilitates understanding
the country-specific supply chain sustainability risks, which enables focusing on areaspecific risks. Expanding their view enables companies to have a comprehensive
understanding of vulnerabilities in supply chains. Therefore, taking suppliers’ country
risks into account enables companies to manage sustainability risks in their supply
chains.

23

Besides reinforcing sustainability practices, risk assessment can positively impact
other performance aspects. Risk assessment facilitates to avoid possible disruptions
that can be results of environmental or social compliance issues. For instance,
environmental accidents can cause delays that affect supplier productivity. Thus,
profound risk assessment facilitates companies to save costs. (Miemczyk & Luzzini,
2019) Hallikas et al, (2002) highlight that root causes and potential consequences of
all the risks should be analyzed after risks have been assessed. When root causes are
known, there are better possibilities to manage the risks and through it affect
consequences.

3.3Risk treatment
Risk treatment in risk management is about reducing or eliminating risk factors. After
risks are identified, assessed, and analyzed, companies have to acknowledge what are
the potential impacts if the risks realize. Risk management strategies aim to reduce the
probability of losses with risk events (Manuj & Mentezer, 2008). Supply chain risk
management has a significant impact on supply chain sustainability. Risk management
enables to impact all three sustainability dimensions in supply chains. (Govindan et
al., 2014) Multaharju et al., (2016) highlight different tools to mitigate supplier
sustainability-related risks. Monitoring, audits, collaboration, certificates related to the
environmental and social dimension, sustainability reporting, self-assessment, Code of
conduct in the contract, different measurements of sustainability aspects, investments
in sustainability practices, sanctions for non-compliance, and assessment and selection
of sub-supplier are among the different tools discussed. Giannakis and Papadopoulos
(2016) suggest that six different strategies are used (avoid, mitigate, prevent,
cooperate, insure, retain). Prevention and mitigating are the most common strategies
when managing sustainability-related risks. Supplier sustainability risk management
aims to ensure that applicable laws are complied with, and sustainability issues are
improved through the entire supply chain. These actions will, besides reducing buying
firms’ financial and reputational risks, increase the attractiveness of the buying
company for sustainability-related customers and financial markets. (Foerstl et al.,
2010)

24

The decision to use each method depends on various factors. For instance, chosen
management tools depend on whether the focal company tries to achieve minimum
standards of sustainability in their supply chains or whether the objective is to be a
frontrunner in sustainability performance. (Kogg& Mont, 2012) Besides, buyersupplier relationships impact the decision. According to Hajmohammad & Vachon
(2016), selected strategies depended on the dependence regime of the specific buyersupplier relationship. This is because the dependence affects the buyer’s power of
implementing the chosen strategy. When a buyer company has dominance or in
interdependence situations, supplier sustainability risks can be mitigated through
monitoring and collaboration-based strategies. The actions depend on how likely the
risks are to occur. When the risk is low, monitoring-based actions are more likely to
be used, whereas when the risk is higher, collaboration is a better solution.
The chosen risk management tools are tailored to different suppliers. For instance, a
self-declaration can be used by non-critical suppliers where the suppliers sign to
signify compliance with the required standards. Whereas critical suppliers are required
to answer a sustainability-related practice questionnaire where they disclose how
different issues are dealt with in practice. Further treatment depends on selfassessment. If there is any doubt of sustainability, an audit is required. If the supplier
is highly critical, audits are done immediately. (Foerstl et al.2010) Lemke et al., (2013)
point out that when choosing different methods to manage risk, focal companies
should consider whether the methods work with their suppliers. Relationships between
the partners affect also the management style, as mentioned earlier.
Gimenez and Sierra (2012) suggest combining different methods if it is deemed
necessary or beneficial. Their research suggests that companies should pursue supplier
assessment and collaboration together. When suppliers’ performance is evaluated first,
it is easier to provide specifications for improvement and training. Besides, audits have
the same kind of effects as supplier assessment. Audits have a significant impact also
after the supplier evaluation. Auditing helps companies understand whether there are
possibilities to improve the supplier´s performance. This enables them to work directly
with their suppliers and improve their social sustainability performance. (Sancha et al.,
2015) Collaboration with suppliers enables companies to achieve improvements in
environmental performance. (Gimenez & Sierra, 2012) Huq and Stevenson (2018)
25

suggest that buyer companies may use a combination of carrot and stick when
managing sustainable supply chains. Sustainability levels of suppliers have been
improved through penalties for violations against requirements, and rigorous audits
are seen as sticks. Building beneficial and trusting relationships with suppliers,
rewarding the best suppliers, taking part in implementation costs, and making longterm deals with suppliers are ways how successful suppliers can be rewarded.

3.3.1 Code of Conduct

A Code of conduct is a document that is part of a contract between a buyer company
and its supplier. It enables the communication of sustainability goals clearly to
suppliers (Cole & Aitken, 2019). Often the first-tier supplier is required to comply
with the code of conduct but should ask its suppliers to follow the same. Hence, a code
of conduct is used to ensure a secure supply chain. Code of conduct is used to ensure
that suppliers perform in line with sustainability strategies (Wu & Pagell, 2011).
Standards of responsibility, the applicable stakeholders, how actions are implemented,
and monitoring mechanism are included in code of conducts. (Zakaria et al., 2012)
Vandenberg et al., (2007) define the code of conducts as a formal statement consisting
of ethical principles that govern the companies’ mode of operations. According to
them, a code of conduct enables the promotion of labor standards and improves
productivity. In addition, improving the company’s reputation, attracting investors,
and obtaining skillful and motivated employees are among the benefits.
According to Pullman and Sauter (2012), a company’s code of conduct is dominated
by standards that are salient for a particular company. If vulnerable resources are used
in manufacturing and supply chain processes, environmental topics dominate the code
of conduct, whereas social sustainable standards are more important in the code of
conduct if labor is used in the developing countries. Hence, it is important to identify
the key issues that might occur in a supply chain so that companies can focus on the
most relevant issues.
One challenge with the code of conduct is that ethical standards and legal requirements
differ between countries. Hence defining which standards should be followed within
the agreement has an important role: whether the local law puts basis to the contract

26

or requirements go beyond the local law. Even though there would not be any
violations against laws and regulations, a company’s stakeholders can react strongly
because the code of conduct is only limited by law. (Zakaria et al., 2012) Code of
conducts do not, however, guarantee that suppliers comply with the code of conducts
after contracts are signed (Egels-Zandén & Lindholm, 2015; Reinhert et al., 2019)
Therefore, the code of conduct is not trouble-free.

3.3.2Certificates

Certifications in specific industries or multi-industry certifications are used as indirect
mechanisms to prove that suppliers meet sustainability standards (Koberg & Longoni,
2019, Fan & Stevenson, 2018; Miemczyk & Luzzini, 2019). Suppliers invest to obtain
certifications such as ISO 14001. With certifications, companies can signal buyers that
sustainability issues are considered and there is a low level of sustainability risks. .
ISO 14001 is the most widespread environmental management system: over 360,000
ISO 14001 certificates are used globally (NQA). Another often used certificate is
ISO26000 which focuses on meeting specific social standards (Miemczyk & Luzzini,
2019).
Certifications are widely used and mentioned but are not without issues. Even though
there would be a badge or sustainability certification this does not mean that the whole
multi-tier supply chain is explored. Multaharju et al., (2017) survey found that even
when the buyer companies had certifications, they or their logistics suppliers do not
require certificates from their sub-contractors. This might become a problem later if a
supply chain is examined more carefully and it is revealed that the supply chain is not
as sustainable as the logo or certification disclose (Hannibal & Kauppi, 2019). Hence,
supply chains should be explored more closely, not just the first tier but further down
the chain. Knowing the entire supply chain will help companies to prevent various
risks such as losing reputation. At the same time, the focal firm has a huge
responsibility to tell consumers how far along the assessing process is implemented,
whether only the first-tier supplier is assessed or there is access to the sustainability
information of the entire supply chain. There is a significant difference between
knowing that the primary supplier is implementing sustainably and knowing that the
entire supply chain is sustainable. Identification of every partner in a supply chain is

27

difficult, especially in complex products, such as cars and electronic devices. (Schöggl
et al., 2016) The importance of certifications is especially high in buyer-supplier
relationships that are not close. It can help suppliers obtain new deals with buyers.
(Fan & Stevenson,2018) In addition, certifications inform external parties that specific
sustainability concerns have been taken into account and the information that is shared
is reliable.

3.3.3. Supplier evaluation and selection

Supplier evaluation has a significant impact on a company´s performance. Taking
environmental and social aspects into consideration, not only enables avoiding
reputation loss, but also creates a competitive advantage (Winter & Lasch, 2015)
Evaluation and selection are case-specific but there are certain actors that companies
pay attention to. Zimmer et al., (2015) state the ten most common sustainability
criteria. Environmental criteria include environmental management system, resource
consumption, ecodesign, recycling, controlling ecological impacts, waster ware,
energy consumption, reuse, air emission, and environmental code of conduct. Social
criteria consist of involvement of stakeholders, staff training, social management
commitment, health and safety, stakeholder relations, social code of conduct,
donations for sustainable projects, the rights of stakeholders, safety practices, and the
annual number of accidents. Winter and Lasch (2016) introduce a different list of
criteria. Social criteria include no child or forced labor, no discrimination, no
disciplinary and security practice, freedom of association, wage and, health and safety
practices. Use of environmentally friendly material and, carbon and hazardous
substance management are included in environmental criteria. It is useful for focal
companies to identify the most important factors for them to select suppliers
efficiently. Foerstl et al., (2010) suggest that companies should focus primarily on
sustainability risks when assessing their suppliers. The earlier the suppliers are
assessed by sustainability criteria, the more likely they are to manage sustainability
risks in their supply chains. This enables focal companies to allocate scarce resources
more effectively. Eventually, when the process in one dimension is done properly,
there is pressure to expand to other dimensions., It is also easier for companies to
implement the expansion as there is already one utilitarian process that can be used.

Figure 5. A list of various criteria used in supplier selection.
According to Foerstl et al., (2010) assessing the suppliers is one of the key operations
in sustainable risk management for supply chains. There are only a certain amount of
resources and that forces companies to focus on selected aspects of sustainability.
Suppliers who are assessed as high risk, get high priority treatment in sustainability
risk management.
Supplier assessment enables companies to evaluate a supplier´s performance and
reduce the risks of suppliers’ illegal and/or unethical actions (Gimenez & Sierra,
2012). Different methods can be used when assessing suppliers. One option is that
buying companies can assess their suppliers directly. However, it is demanding and
dependent on time and human resources. Direct assessing is possible to implement for
first-tier companies but further tiers are significantly more difficult, as it requires
considerable knowledge and direct contact with all members of a supply chain.
Assessing directly poses huge challenges for companies especially in complex supply
chains. (Schöggl et al., 2016) Another alternative in assessing the supply chain is to
use independent third party assessors. Impartial information is more likely obtained
then. The help of NGOs (non-governmental organizations) can be useful when
assessing suppliers. NGOs can have a different perspective for various sustainability
aspects which enables them to have a more comprehensive outlook over challenges in
a supply chain. Using NGOs located in countries of suppliers enables obtaining a more
comprehensive picture of a supplier, since NGOs have a deeper knowledge of
29

conditions and specifics in cultural aspects. (Kogg & Mont, 2012) Cultural distance
between partners in a supply chain can be one of the major barriers to implementing
supply chains in an efficient way (Grimm et al., 2014). Hence, NGOs can be useful
when companies have suppliers in cultural regions other than they are used to working
in. However, buyer companies should be careful with who their third-party assessors
are. There have been instances where a third-party assessor has influenced sourcing
decisions by marketing actively a particular brand. (Hannibal & Kauppi, 2019)
According to Torres-Ruiz & Ravindran (2018) especially when talking about tactical
items (non-critical or routine), it is sufficient to use third-party organizations in
monitoring suppliers. This is due to the aim of minimizing the resources spent on these
items. They add only little value or items, and their suppliers are better known. Thirdparty auditors can be used in assessing the process when suppliers appear to have real
issues and more intense inspections are required (Adesanya et al., 2020). In addition,
when using third-party assessors, buyer companies can use their practices when
exploring sustainability in their supply chains. Suppliers can be asked to self-assess
sustainability-related risks (Foerstl et al., 2010). One alternative is to request the
suppliers to share sustainability-related information such as energy use or material
content of a product. At the same time, suppliers have to pass the same request to their
suppliers. This procedure is called a Casadic assessment.
When dealing with new suppliers, they are also asked to answer the self-assessment
questionnaire. Sustainability related standards are seen as gate-keepers and if
violations occur, the selection processes comes to an end. If the supplier meets the
requirements, audits will follow. Audits are used to ascertain that the supply base will
only have compliant suppliers. (Foerstl et al., 2010)
Trust is seen as an important factor in the supplier selection process. Buying firms
associate supplier trust with striving for mutually beneficial goals for both parties and
linked to non-economic criteria. Trust between partners will also decrease the number
of audits and inspections. Resources can be saved when audits are not done as often
due to lack of trust between the partners. (Cole & Aitken, 2019) These saved resources
can for instance be allocated to relationship improvement which has a significant
impact on the partners. (Vachon & Klassen, 2006) Trust between partners facilitates
further collaboration between partners. Cole & Aitken (2019) highlight four different
30

criteria that improve sustainable supplier development: Trust, transparency,
engagement, and knowledge development. Transparency enhances trust between
partners. When companies are transparent to each other, trust between partners
increases, and sharing sensitive information is more likely, which further facilitates
co-operation. The engagement factor consists of four different factors: collaboration,
commitment, communication, and cooperation. The engagement of suppliers is
required to obtain the most out of the development process. Knowledge development
aims to create a long-term relationship with partners where sustainability performance
can be improved.
Trust between a buying firm and its supplier can facilitate to have a greater impact on
sub-suppliers. Trust could enable suppliers to be more proactive in supporting
initiatives between a buying firm and its sub-suppliers. Suppliers might fear that
buying firms could bypass them and directly from sub-suppliers if there is a lack of
trust between a buying firm and its supplier. Therefore, building trustful relationships
could help to manage sub-suppliers. (Grinn et al., 2013) In addition to relationships,
contract-specified factors have an impact on sustainability levels in supply chains. If
supplier contracts are short-term and the buying firm is ordering limited orders. Then
there is a diminished influence on suppliers and limited possibilities to monitor
working conditions and sustainability issues at the site. (Locke et al., 2016)

3.3.4 Supplier development and collaboration

Collaboration with suppliers is seen as one of the risk-mitigating tools in sustainable
supply chain management (Ageron et al., 2012). Developing relationships enables
minimizing risks through the whole supplier relationship lifecycle (Hardy 2017; Tidy
et al., 2016). Reputational risk management is a strong driver for supplier development
when considering sustainable issues (Cole & Aitken, 2019). Huq and Stevens (2018)
highlight the importance of supplier development when improving the implementation
of sustainability at the supplier’s side. The best possible outcomes are achieved when
all different levels from the suppliers' side are educated about sustainability standards
and actions. Owners need to be educated about sustainability standards and when
workers are educated through training, they become aware of the compliance issues.

31

Supplier development contributes directly to suppliers’ environmental capabilities
which reflect the level of environmental sustainability of products and services. This
will enhance environmental reputation and performance. (Gimenez & Sierra, 2013)
Improvements in working conditions and compliance from the suppliers’ side will
improve the reputation of the buying firm (Sancha et al., 2016). Sustainability cooperation with suppliers has a positive impact on green and social practices. Cooperation has a direct impact on performance in environmental aspects such a cost
reduction and operational performance. (Hollos et al., 2012)
Training suppliers’ personnel has a direct and critical role in improving environmental
performance at the suppliers’ side. When the suppliers’ environmental abilities are
improved, companies can obtain more sustainable products or services. (Gimenez &
Sierra, 2012) The development process enables improvement of the suppliers’
capability of handling social issues. Improvement can be done by providing training,
technology, and technical assistance. Better management of social issues in addition
to transparency and mutual understanding of the importance of social requirements in
the supply chain management are positive outcomes that can be reached through
supplier development. (Subramaniam et al., 2019) When buying firms invest in direct
and indirect supplier development strategies, suppliers’ financial performance and
their communities are improved. These improvements will have direct impacts on the
suppliers’ social and societal performance. Better financial flows enable suppliers to
pay attention to other basic amenities, such as healthcare and access to better
education. (Yawar & Seuring, 2018)
According to Adesanya et al., (2020) sustainable supplier development processes are
triggered by performance evaluation results. Development processes are expensive
and they are mainly applied to a limited number of suppliers that are often strategically
important core suppliers. The development consists often of mentoring and coaching,
not imposing actual training processes. When talking about collaboration both of the
partners must be seen as equal and should be able to express their views. Waitrose Ltd
focuses on understanding the perspective of the suppliers. Feedback is gathered about
what kind of opportunities there are and how the relationship with Waitrose Ltd could
be improved. (Spence and Bourlakis, 2009) Shared vision, systems, resources, and
actions facilitate collaboration between a focal firm and its suppliers (Ageron et
32

al.,2012). Therefore, assessing suppliers has an important role in supplier development
processes. Knowledge of suppliers’ capabilities facilitates the allocation of scarce
resources effectively to the right places. When collaboration processes are planned,
focal companies should have knowledge whether their suppliers have the resources to
implement the development processes. The lack of resources is especially a challenge
with smaller suppliers. (Juetnner et al., 2020) In addition to recognizing partners’
resources, Vachon and Klassen (2006) highlight the importance of understanding each
other´s capabilities and priorities. Lack of knowledge on the social sustainability
requirements is seen as one of the issues in implementing sustainability by suppliers’
side. Even though suppliers are provided with financial support, it will be difficult for
them to be sustainable if expectations are not known. (Subramaniam et al., 2019) This
emphasizes the importance of communication between the partners. According to
Jiang (2009), buying firms from developed countries should focus on the fairness of
contracts with suppliers from developing countries. Unfair rewards and unrealistic lead
times are examples of why some of the suppliers do not meet all sustainability
objectives. Hence buying firms should treat suppliers fairly to obtain sustainable
products or services. A sustainable buyer should see itself as a part of the issue and try
to fix the problem together with the supplier. The aim is to find suppliers where the
power balance is well distributed and both parties can benefit from the collaboration.
(Hardy, 2017)
Besides solving sustainability issues in a supply chain, other positive outcomes can be
obtained through development processes. Competitive advantage can be reached by
developing relationships with the supplier. Purchasing function has become
strategically important which has led to a situation where buyers choose closer
cooperation with selected suppliers (Moeller et al., 2006). Collaboration enables
exchange of knowledge between partners which might have a positive impact on
suppliers’ capability to meet the requirements of sustainability standards. This is
especially beneficial when suppliers have limited resources. (Subramaniam et al.,
2019) Supplier development practices have a direct and positive impact on operational
performance. Motivation among employees increased productivity, and quality
outcomes are greater in more socially sustainable firms. (Cole & Aitken, 2019)

33

Collaboration can be expanded to NGOs. With help of NGOs, companies can increase
predictability and responsiveness. NGOs may offer information that can be used in
sustainable supply chain management. As discussed earlier, NGOs might help in
assessing supplier risks, audit cycles, and contents. Adapting NGOs’ information
enables buyer companies to implement sustainability risk management processes
earlier, more rigorously, and more astutely than their competitors. (Foerstl et al., 2010)
NGOs can be useful when suppliers are assessed since NGOs might have the ability to
see sustainability issues from different perspectives compared to a focal firm. For
instance, Apple and the Fair Labor Association (FLA) built up a partnership where
Apple agreed to follow the FLA´s workplace code of conduct in their entire supply
chain. (Gouda and Saranga, 2018) Collaboration can also occur with competitors and
other actors. For instance, buying companies can put collective pressure on their
suppliers. After an accident at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh where 1129 people were
killed when a couple of factories collapsed, a large number of Western companies
started to collaborate to avoid similar disasters in the future. Two different groups were
established where companies shared audits publicly, which put pressure on the
suppliers. Buying companies collaborated with global and local trade unions that were
supported by NGOs. The groups used similar standards in audits. In addition, one of
the groups shared the costs of improvements. The importance of collaboration between
partners increases when suppliers are in countries where corruption and bribery are
common. Collective actions can replace governmental regulations effectively if laws
and regulations are not followed. (Huq & Stevenson, 2018) Companies have a wide
range of different actors that they can work with. Various actors provide a different
kind of support to implement sustainable supply chain management. Collaboration
requires resources, but with the help of it, risks can be minimized more effectively.
In cases when a buyer company has no other choice but to contract a supplier, Kogg
and Mont (2012) suggest that direct inter-organizational management that includes
both collaboration and, threats of sanctions or positive incentives should be
considered. For instance, when there are no better suppliers or products available, or
the focal company has difficulties in compliance with the standards.
According to Hollos et al., (2012) a buyer company can gain the most out of supplier
co-operation if its own sustainable manners improve at the same time as the suppliers’.
34

This highlights the importance of extending the developing practices to all partners
from suppliers to buying firms as well.

3.4 Risk monitoring and control
Suppliers’ assessing operations continue after the contracts have been made. Different
survey tools, annual self-assessments, and on-site reviews are common practices when
assessing suppliers. Buyer companies often revisit suppliers based on the suppliers’
rating. When suppliers receive a high score, audits are implemented rarely whereas
low scoring suppliers are audited more frequently. After audits, suppliers are given
feedback and improvement guidelines for the future. (Adesanya et al., 2020) When
audits are implemented by buyer companies, they can claim that their supplier
requirements are chained down to possible sub-contractors. (Multaharju et al., 2017)
According to Foerstl et al., (2010) survey, if suppliers do not follow the sustainability
criteria, focal firms emphasize their preference to keep their relationship with
established suppliers rather than terminating the contacts. If the violations are not
serious, focal firms prefer to allow suppliers to improve their actions within a predefined time frame. After improvement is implemented, suppliers will be re-audited.
If violations continue, the next step would be to discontinue the relationships between
the focal firm and its supplier. Supplier development is seen as a responsive and
resource-effective activity which is key in minimizing sustainability-related risks.
Supplier monitoring and control facilitates finding sustainability misconducts and
therefore avoiding or mitigating sustainability risks and their effects.
When suppliers are assessed, it is easier to identify specific points that need to be
improved later. It proves that the whole process is a cycle and to achieve the best
possible results from supply chain management, focal companies need to improve their
supply chains constantly. Both of the partners, buyer companies and their suppliers,
can learn during their partnership and develop processes for a more sustainable way.
Besides, novel risks that require attention may present themselves, which makes it vital
that the management process is constant.

35

3.5Chapter summary
First sustainable supply chain management was introduced. Sustainable supply chain
management is a broader definition of supply chain management. In sustainable supply
chain management, the three sustainability dimensions are taken into account when
supply chains are managed. Sustainability’s negative impacts are tried to be
minimized. Today’s supply chains are long and complex which challenge companies’
possibilities to manage sustainability issues in their supply chains. Especially, social
and environmental concerns are taken into account when supply chains are managed
sustainably. Various labor challenges, such as child and forced labor are emphasized
from the social sustainability point of view. Environmental sustainability considers
reducing pollution and waste, and energy savings in supply chains. Importance of
sustainable supply chain management has increased, hence companies are considered
fully responsible of their products and services even when these would spend most of
their lifetimes outside of their direct control. Companies obtain internal and external
pressure to meet certain sustainability levels in their operations. Therefore, sustainable
supply chain management not only has an important part in companies’ supply chain
management but also in their overall presentation.
Differences between ordinary and sustainability risks are discussed in the literature
part. Supply chain management enables to obtain benefits, such as increased efficiency
and cost savings but in addition there are risks which can harm companies. Ordinary
supply chain risks are unpredictable events that can have negative consequences to a
supply chain and its members. Outcomes of supply chain risks are inability to meet
customer demand or even cause threats to customer life and safety. Today’s business
environment has affected supply chains. Globalization and increased competition have
lengthened supply chains which have affected complexity of supply chains. Therefore,
companies have increasingly paid attention to managing supply chain risks. In addition
to ordinary supply chain risks, sustainability supply chain risks have become more
vital. Those are risks that have potential to provoke harmful stakeholder reactions and
thus harm businesses. Ordinary supply chain risks can cause supply disruptions
whereas sustainability risks negatively affect stakeholders’ opinions.

36

In the third chapter, a sustainability risk management model is presented.
Sustainability risk management in supply chains requires comprehensive activities.
The model is a five-phase framework on which the empirical analysis is based. The
phases are: risk identification, risk assessment, risk analysis, risk treatment, risk
monitoring, and control. Risk identification aims to find factors that can harm
companies' supply chains. However, identifying all of the risks is challenging since
companies face a vast number of various challenges. It is impossible to identify all of
them. Risk assessment is the second phase of the model. The identified risks are
assessed to determine the most critical risks. Risk assessment enables companies to
focus on the most critical risks and through this, the risks can be better managed. Risk
analysis is an essential part of the framework. In the fourth phase of the model, various
treatment operations are discussed. There are a vast number of treatment factors that
facilitate to manage sustainability risks in supply chain management. For instance,
code of conducts, certificates, supplier evaluation and selection, and supplier
development and collaboration are among the most used methods. With help of these
tools, companies have better possibilities to manage sustainability risks and through it
minimize negative impacts these could cause. The last phase of the model is risk
monitoring and control. The risk management process is constant therefore, companies
are required to develop and monitor the development of the risk environment. Usage
of the model is a constant process where the various areas are reviewed at regular
intervals.

4.Method
The empirical part of this master thesis is a qualitative case study where three Finnish
companies will be researched.

4.1 Choice of research method
Qualitative and quantitative research answer different types of questions. In qualitative
research, the purpose is to describe real life and to explore the subject comprehensively
(Hirsijärvi et al., 2007). Tuomi & Sarajärvi (2018), state that qualitative research
enables a good description of the phenomenon. According to Kananen (2017),
qualitative research aims to obtain an answer to a question: “What is the phenomenon
about?”. Qualitative research refers to practice rather than a logical concept (Koskinen
et al., 2005). On the other hand, in quantitative research, the information is reviewed
numerically, and the questions asked can be, for example, “how much” and “how
often”. Vilkka (2007) Besides, according to Kananen (2017), qualitative research
examines mainly processes, which in turn is difficult in quantitative research.
Nonetheless, qualitative and quantitative research are complementary rather than
competing approaches. For instance, qualitative research can be used as a preliminary
test for quantitative tests. (Hirsijärvi et al., 2007)
Sustainable risk management in supply chains is a process where various phases are
considered closely. It is a process that companies follow consistently to make it work
effectively. The master thesis aims to understand how sustainability risks are managed
in supply chains. To obtain results, the case companies’ processes are examined.
Therefore, qualitative research is more suitable for this master thesis compared to
quantitative.
A case study is a study where one or at most a few cases are selected for close scrutiny.
Usually, the focus is on either the company or a specific process of the company. Case
studies are among the most common qualitative methods of business economics
research. (Koskinen et al., 2005) Anttila (1996) state that, case studies give a wellorganized view of the researched subject. Nonetheless, case studies are typically
narrow, and thus are not generalizable. On the other hand, there has not been a

38

completely exhaustive answer, as according to Metsämuuronen (2008) case studies
allow generalization.
According to Metsämuuronen (2008), almost all qualitative studies are case studies.
Differences in qualitative data acquisition strategies are evident in what is the subject
of the research and how the information is acquired. In a case study, the number of
cases is often small - from one or up to a few cases that are chosen for a specific
purpose. This enables to collect a relatively large amount of information from each
case. A case study is rather a research approach, where the core is how the data is
collected and analyzed. Comparative and experimental studies are often used in case
studies. (Koskinen et al., 2005)
This master thesis is a comparative case study. In a comparative case study two or
more cases are systematically compared (Kaarbo & Beasley, 1999). Typically, in a
comparative study, the material is compiled from existing material after a phenomenon
has already occurred (Anttila, 1996). To be able to compare sustainability risk
management in supply chains, three Finnish case companies were chosen. The
comparative perspective emerges when the case companies operate in different
industries, allowing them to find similarities and differences between industries.
According to Koskinen et al., (2005), if a case study covers only one case company, it
allows a limited number of conclusions. Besides, if only one case company is
researched, the choice of the case company should be carefully justified on theoretical
or empirical grounds (Koskinen et al., 2005). Case studies can answer to questions
“how” and “why” and in cases where the researcher has little or no control over events
(Yin, 2003).

4.2 The chosen case companies
The case companies have been chosen from the 2020 Global 100 ranking that lists the
100 most sustainable companies in the world. When the case companies operate in
different industries, it enables to make certain generalizations. Besides, according to
Koskinen et al., (2005), a benefit with case studies is that the researcher is forced to
understand the companies comprehensively in a fairly realistic described environment.
Also, Metsämuuronen (2008) states that case studies are often based on functionality
39

and the results can be applied in practice. The results of this master thesis can be
utilized both by the case companies and other actors who are interested in improving
sustainability operations in their supply chain management.
A benefit of case studies is that they can be targeted and precise. The interest of the
researcher in the matter is emphasized and irrelevant things are left in the background.
(Koskinen et al., 2015) This master thesis focuses on Finnish companies that are
recognized as sustainable by Corporate Knights. The case companies are chosen based
on their sustainability performance which enables obtaining information on how
successful companies have managed to operate sustainability management in their
supply chains. A feature of the case is that data is collected from small unrelated case
companies (Hirsijärvi, et al., 2007). Case studies enable testing of established concepts
and theories (Koskinen et al., 2015). It facilitates to compare companies’ actions to
theory. Besides, the aim of case studies is the description of phenomena (Hirsijärvi et
al., 2017). When the case companies are chosen based on their sustainability
performance, it is possible to compare best practices with theory. Therefore, the
theoretical part is compared to the empirical analyses which enables to obtain a
description of the phenomenon.

4.3 Data collection
The analysis of the empirical part is based on secondary documentation of the case
companies. According to Saunders et al., (2009), case studies are often based on
secondary data. Qualitative research has led to the proliferation of many methods of
data collection that seek to understand actors through self-produced texts (Hirsijärvi et
al., 2007). In this master thesis, the analyzed data consists of case companies’ data
from annual reports from 2019 and additional information from their websites when
needed to deepen knowledge. Annual reports were chosen since there is a formal
structure, which facilitates the acquisition of information. Annual reports inform
extensively about the company’s performance. Besides annual reports, companies’
websites are utilized to obtain more detailed information on the various aspects that
are mentioned narrowly in annual reports.

Nonetheless, usage of secondary

documentation is not entirely problem-free. When secondary documentation is
utilized, it must be viewed critically. (Hirsijärvi et al., 2007; Kananen, 2017; Saaranen40

Kauppinen and Puusniekka, 2006) Companies’ reports can be subjective which makes
it more difficult to obtain objective results. Therefore, the empirical part will consider
different perspectives compared to the case companies’ material. The data about
sustainability violations in their supply chains is collected from various sources to
broaden the perspective of the researched subject. In two cases additional data is
collected from Finnwatch, which is a non-governmental organization that studies the
global impact of business. Information from Friends of the Earth is utilized to obtain
a more comprehensive perspective of one of the case companies.
Another method option could have been interviews where representatives of the case
companies would have been met. Interviews are the most common methods in
qualitative research (Kananen, 2017). Interviews enable obtaining comprehensive
results and are flexible. The interviewee answers the questions, and the interviewer
can continue with more specific questions. Interviews aim to obtain as much
information as possible. However, the weakness in interviews is time and money.
(Tuomi & Sarajärvi, 2018) Besides, Saaranen-Kauppinen and Puusniekka (2006)
suggest the usage of secondary material in research when the researcher has little
experience of research and thus can focus on analyzing the data instead of collecting
it. According to Hirsijärvi et al., (2007), interviews can contain many sources of errors.
Therefore, to avoid errors and have accurate data, the usage of secondary data is
justified.

4.4 Data analysis
To begin the data analysis, the material was read through to get an overview of what
the annual reports contain. During the process, the information was searched one
company at a time following the five-step sustainability risk management framework.
This enabled a consistent process. During the data analysis process, the case
companies’ activities were compared to previous research. After companies’ materials
were analyzed, the NGO’s materials were used to broaden the view. The summary
consists of the similarities and differences in the operation of companies. Empirical
results are based on this process.

41

In qualitative research, there is a vast amount of information that provides challenges
and at the same time makes research more interesting. The researcher is not likely to
be able to utilize all of the data that has been collected and it is also not necessary to
do so. (Hirsijärvi et al., 2007) Therefore, the process started with a quick reading of
the annual reports. This enabled obtaining a more general view of how sustainability
operations are implemented in the case companies. After a general view of the case
companies, their sustainability performance was studied more closely. This provided
a more comprehensive picture of companies’ actions. A general overlook of the annual
reports and additional data enabled us to focus on the most important things.

4.5 Reliability and validity of the research
Reliability and validity are essential parts of research. Both of the terms mean
credibility but reliability means the reproducibility of the measurement results
(Metsämuuronen, 2008). According to Hirsijärvi et al., (2007) reliability and validity
have received different interpretations in qualitative research. Therefore, in qualitative
research, it is essential to inform what has been done and how the results have been
achieved in the study. An important question is whether the explanation is reliable.
According to Koskinen et al., (2005), if the findings are reproducible, it can be stated
that the phenomenon is real and the proposed interpretation can be accepted.
Nonetheless, reliability is a strict requirement, especially in social science. For
instance, if case companies are observed, the companies will change over the years, at
which point the results will also change. (Koskinen, 2005) Changes in companies’
performance are probable and thus cannot affect the reliability of the study. In this
study, the data that is utilized is acquired from public companies and nongovernmental organizations. Especially, the data from the reports can be considered
valid. Annual reports are among generally used data sources in business research and
analyses. The case companies Neste, UPM and Kesko, were selected based on their
success on 2020 Global 100 ranking which is a generally recognized sustainability
ranking. The case companies will be presented in the empirical chapter. Informing
about the sustainability failures in case companies’ supply chains increases the
reliability and objectivity of the study.

42

According to Kananen (2015), there are several reliability criteria to review the
reliability of qualitative research. Evaluability and previous research are among the
reliability criteria. In this master thesis the data that is utilized comes mainly from
public companies. Besides, previous research is used to compare whether the case
companies implement sustainability risk management in their supply chains properly.
Hirsijärvi et al., (2007) consider that the reliability of the study increases when the
researcher gives an accurate account of the conduct of the research. Koskinen et al.,
(2005) emphasize the importance of disclosing how the observations have been
produced. In the data analysis part, the process is explained in detail.
Ethics is seen as an important part of research. According to Eriksson and Kovalainen
(2008), data collection in a research has a vital part of research ethics, especially in
qualitative business research. Therefore, it is described precisely from which sources
data has been collected in order to consider the ethical aspect of the research. Research
can harm companies and therefore, it is important to be transparent about the data
collection process. In case studies, damage can be based on what competitors or the
public sector react to when results of the research are available (Koskinen et al,2005).
The utilized data is public, the case companies’ competitors or public sector can use
the same data. Therefore, chances for ethical problems are low in this master thesis.
There are additional requirements for research ethics. Plagiarism is strictly prohibited,
including plagiarism of others and your own text. The results must be viewed critically
and must not be forged or whitewashed. The method of reporting must be explained
precisely. (Hirsijärvi et al., 2007) The previous requirements have been introduced in
this chapter to demonstrate the ethics of the research.

43

4.6 Chapter summary
The aim of the master’s thesis is to answer to a phenomenon: “How Finnish companies
manage sustainability risks in their supply chain”. Therefore, it is s qualitative
research. The master thesis aims to understand how sustainability risks are managed
in supply chains. To obtain results, the case companies’ processes are examined.
Therefore, qualitative research is more suitable for this master thesis compared to
quantitative. This is a comparative case study since three Finnish companies and their
sustainability risk management actions in supply chains are discovered. This enables
to obtain a comprehensive view if there is some similarities or differences between the
companies. The case companies are Kesko, Neste and UPM. These companies were
chosen since they were among the Corporate Knights global 100 ranking in 2020. The
utilized data was collected from the companies’ own sources. In addition, external
partners information was utilized in order to obtain a comprehensive outlook of
failures as well. Companies’ own reports can be subjective which makes it more
difficult to obtain objective results. Therefore, the empirical part will consider different
perspectives compared to the case companies’ material.

Therefore, data from

Finnwatch and Maan ystävät was utilized.

44

5.The case companies
In this chapter, the chosen case companies will be introduced and discussed from the
sustainability risk management framework point of view. The case companies are
discussed one at a time which enables a consistent review of the process.

5.1 Kesko
Kesko is a Finnish retail store company, which operations are divided into three
sections: grocery trade, home improvement, and specialty goods trade, car, and
machinery trade. 2000 stores are engaged in chain operations in eight different
countries. According to the 2020 Global 100 ranking, Kesko is the 99th sustainable
company. Sustainability governs their mission hence the slogan is: “We will create
sustainability welfare to all of our stakeholders and entire society” (Kesko Code of
Conduct).
Sustainable supply chain management is a combination of various tasks, including
supply chain management, sustainability management, and risk management. All three
dimensions are widely considered at Kesko. Risk management at Kesko is a systematic
process, where the aim is to identify, assess, manage, and control risks. Risk
management is part of supply chain management, which is implemented in
collaboration with K-retailers, suppliers, and service providers. (Kesko KeskoKonsernin Riskiehhallintapolitiikan tiivistelmä) Risks are assessed constantly and risk
evaluation is published quarterly. Sustainable operations and image management are
mentioned among the risks Kesko faces. Sustainable supply chain management is one
of the options to manage the risk. Possible failures to implement sustainability would
cause negative publicity and therefore cause operational and financial damage to
Kesko. Kesko’s corporate responsibility activities faces various challenges, including
communication of sustainability principles to suppliers and through it ensuring the
sustainability of the supply chains. (Kesko Annual Report 2019) Sustainable
purchasing is one of the key operations of Kesko’s corporate responsibility. (Kesko
Principles and Practice of Socially Responsible Trading)

45

The influence of stakeholders has impacted sustainability considerations at Kesko.
Conscious consumption has become more popular which is reflected in customers’
choices: customers are more interested in sustainable products. Shareholders’ interest
in sustainability has increased to an increasing extent, which has affected Kesko’s
operations. Therefore, stakeholder engagement is highly valued at Kesko and the aim
is to respond to the preferences of stakeholders. (Kesko Annual Report 2019) External
pressure is among the reasons why Kesko pays great attention to sustainability in its
operations.
To be able to fulfill the expectations stakeholders have, Kesko is required to develop
its operations. Therefore, Kesko has emphasized improving sustainability practices.
One of the examples is increased transparency. For instance, the names and addresses
of Kesko’s brand manufacturers in the apparel, shoe, and bag industries are published.
It is mentioned in the principles and practices of socially responsible trading, that
customers expect product traceability and socially acceptable manufacturing practices.
Confirming the idea that companies should listen to the most important stakeholders
and implement their actions related to their expectations. Developing processes with
suppliers is mentioned as one of the tools. Especially this practice is implemented with
suppliers that have a long-term relationship with the company. (Kesko Principles and
Practice of Socially Responsible Trading)

5.1.1 Risk identification
Kesko’s supply chains face a vast number of different risks. Hence, sustainability risks
identification and categorizing have pivotal importance in Kesko’s operations. Human
rights violations, environmental damage, financial losses, loss of stakeholder
confidence, and complicating accountability and credibility are considered
sustainability-related risks in supply chains. The outcomes can be caused by a
deviation of supply chain management. Failing in product safety management and
supply chain quality assurance can lead to financial losses, loss of customer
confidence, or in the worst case, endangering the health of customers. (Kesko Annual
Report 2019) Consequently, sustainability issues have a considerable focus when
supply chains are reviewed.

46

Special consideration is on supply chains’ social sustainability and human rights.
These are mentioned as one of the core risks Kesko faces. The environmental
sustainability risks are also taken into account. (Kesko Annual Report 2019) Human
rights have special attention in social sustainability. Rights of freedom of association
and collective bargaining, discrimination and child labor, and occupational health and
safety are focused on when social sustainability is considered. (Kesko Principles and
Practice of Socially Responsible Trading) Environmental risks are divided into three
aspects: transaction, physical, and climate impact. The transaction phase encompasses
increased law and regulations requirements that affect the operational level. Physical
risks include an increase in extreme weather events that affect product availability and
cause disruptions in logistics and the store network. The climate impact consists of the
life cycle impact of products and services for sale on climate change, and climate
emissions from energy solutions and energy consumption. (Kesko Annual Report
2019) The previous examples prove that Kesko has focused on identifying the most
appropriate risks.
Even though risks pose enormous threats, Kesko sees opportunities in their risks. If
sustainability risk management is implemented properly, Kesko can benefit from the
sustainability work. For instance, collaboration with supply chain partners can increase
transparency and at the same time promote responsibility in the supply chain. This can
affect stakeholder confidence positively. (Kesko Annual Report 2019) Kesko has
increased their transparency in supply chains where origins of their Pirkka and KMenu tuna, Pirkka Fair Trade roses, and Prf Timber wood are disclosed. (Kesko
jäljilla). Besides, Kesko has asked its customers which products they would like to
hear about next. Coffee and bananas emerged, and there was a desire to hear more
from factory and farm workers. (Hovi, 2020) Therefore, sustainability risk
management in supply chains is seen as an important part of supply chain management
and the overall presentation of Kesko.

47

5.1.2 Risk assessment and analysis

Kesko purchases products and services across the world. There are certain more
conventional risks in different countries. Therefore, assessing countries and countryspecific risks include to risk management processes. When assessing risk countries,
Kesko uses Amfori’s risk country categorizing. (Kesko Annual Report 2019) Amfori
is a leading global business association, enabling open and sustainable trade. Over
2400 retailers, brands, importers, brands, and associations from more than 40 countries
are brought together. (Amfori) Amfori’s risk country categorizing is based on World
Bank’s published Worldwide Governance indicators. The overall purchases from risk
countries in 2019 were 104 million euros which are 1,1% of all Kesko’s purchases
during the year. These numbers consist of direct purchases to Finland. Kesko
emphasizes the social sustainability dimension when purchases are implemented from
risk countries where the risks of human rights violations are greatest. Special
consideration of human rights issues is given to Asia and Africa. (Kesko Annual
Report 2019)
Some risks are analyzed more carefully. For instance, water risk is among one of the
environmental risks Kesko has a considerable focus on. Water risk has been
highlighted since the most significant effects of our water consumption arise through
marketable products. These consist of water scarcity or pollution-affected areas.
Hence, Kesko focuses on various certifications in fruits and vegetable procurement. In
2019, Kesko launched a program aiming to assess water risks in Pirkka’s mini plum
supply chain. Another example of Kesko’s water risk assessment was in 2018, where
the focus was on avocados. Avocado cultivation needs a vast amount of water.
Therefore, it is seen as a water risk. The avocado risk assessment project consisted of
analyzing all the producers which supplied avocados to Kesko. The assessment was
implemented with help of WWF’s water risk tool. The project permitted Kesko to
analyze its suppliers and identify the riskiest suppliers. In the end, Kesko terminated
procurement from Petroca, Chile which was the most problematic area. Besides,
during 2019 risk assessments were implemented for 904 of the main ingredients of the
food products in Pirkka and K-menu portfolios. (Kesko Annual Report 2019)
Assessment of products and their origins is constant. Processes are developed to obtain
the most accurate information about the products.

48

An important part of sustainable risk management at Kesko is the procurement policy.
The policy is designed to guide the procurement of products, containing raw materials
identified as critical for social and environmental sustainability. There are policies
about cotton, cocoa, plastic, packaging materials, soy, protection of animals, fish and
seafood, palm oil, wood and paper, and GMOs. Prioritizing these themes as important,
prove that Kesko has identified which of their products are especially risky, and have
made special focus principles when buying these materials.
The previous examples demonstrate that Kesko pays special attention to risk countries
and conventional risks there. In addition, certain individual risks are considered more
closely. A good example is the water risk. These are results of risk assessment where
risks and their consequences are assessed more closely.

5.1.3 Risk treatment
Sustainable risk management consists of a wide range of various operations. The
sustainable development policies are developed, audits are implemented, sustainability
development with suppliers, and cooperation with international organizations is used
when the aim is to improve sustainability in their supply chain. Besides, the character
of Kesko’s business facilitates in managing and minimizing sustainability risks in their
supply chains. A considerable part of Kesko’s purchases are procured from Finland or
near Finland which facilitates sustainable supply chain management. Kesko utilizes a
wide range of tools to ensure a more effective sustainability risk management.

5.1.3.1 Code of Conduct

The code of conduct has a vital role in Kesko’s operations and is required from Kesko’s
partners, including suppliers. The aim behind the code of conduct is that all actors that
are involved in Kesko’s operations would follow the same instructions. The code of
conduct requires sub-suppliers to follow the same requirements as suppliers. Human
rights have a special focus on the code of conduct. The code of conduct mentions the
importance of brand image and reputation of Kesko. The aim is to protect both of these
by following the requirements. (Kesko Code of Conduct). Laws and regulations are at
the core of the code of conduct and set the minimum requirements (K code of conduct).

49

The code of conduct requires Kesko’s suppliers to commit to minimizing their negative
impact on the environment. Besides, suppliers are required to develop their processes
constantly to further reduce their environmental impact in the future. The social aspect
requires suppliers to respect human rights. All internationally recognized human rights
must be obeyed. Kesko does not accept child or forced labor use or any other human
rights violations in supply chains. The code of conduct requires suppliers to follow and
anticipate changes in societies and legislation. When suppliers are up to date, there is
less chance of sustainability violations. (Kesko Code of Conduct)

5.1.3.2 Certificates

Kesko’s procurement operations have a significant focus on various certificates. The
goals have been established to become more sustainable and with the help of various
certificates, Kesko has better possibilities to achieve the goals. By the end of 2025, the
aim of Kesko is that 100% of their wood and paper products to be of sustainable origin.
Products are either FSC or PEFC certificated or from renewable materials. Kesko has
committed to improving sustainability in the usage of cotton. By the end of 2024, the
objective is to procure more sustainable cotton for its brands. More sustainable cotton
encompasses certified organic cotton, recycled cotton, Better Cotton Initiative, and
FairTrade cotton. Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) is an organization aiming to improve
cotton manufacturing to have better results for producers, improve sustainability in the
producing process, and improve possibilities in the future. As a partner of BCI, Kesko
has committed to developing cotton production globally. (Kesko Annual Report 2019)
Besides wood products and clothes, Kesko highlights also other industries where
certificates have a considerable impact, one of them is the fishing industry. At Kesko’s
stores, MSC and ASC certified suppliers are favored when procuring fish and seafood.
MSC certificate is granted for products that are supplied from wild fish and shellfish
products from certified, responsible companies. ASC is granted for companies that
show that fish farming is implemented in a socially and environmentally sustainable
manner. In 2019, five K-Supermarkets’ fish counters were granted MSC and ASC
certificates. The aim was to increase the number in 2020. Two hundred of Kesko’s
grocery retail sales in the selection had MSC certificate and 30 were certified by ASC
(Kesko Annual Report 2019) Although previous numbers have been disclosed, there
is no information about the total number of fish products that are sold. Therefore, it is
50

difficult to make an overall assessment of what percentage of products are certified.
However, there have been improvements compared to previous years. In 2017, 178
products had an MSC certificate. (Kesko Annual Report 2017) Certificates are an
important part to ensure that water risk is taken into account. To mitigate water risks,
certificates are used when fruits and vegetables are procured overseas. All of Kesko’s
brands’ imported fruit and vegetables are GlobalGAP certified. The certifications
guarantee that the production of fruits and vegetables follows the requirements of good
use of water. (Kesko Annual Report 2019)

5.1.3.3 Supplier evaluation and selection

Kesko requires that its suppliers obey the principles of Kesko’s Code of Conduct and
Amfori BCI’s Code of Conducts. In addition, certificates have pivotal importance in
supplier evaluation. (Kesko Annual Report 2019) Legislation and regulation are also
an important part of supplier evaluation and selection. Kesko requires suppliers to
follow the international labor standards, applicable national laws and regulations, and
other requirements. Kesko has suppliers around the world, thus suppliers’ national
legislation can be significantly different compared to the Finnish legislation. To ensure
that the criteria are met, independent audits are implemented. (Kesko Principles and
Practice of Socially Responsible Trading)
Other criteria also affect the evaluation and selection process. The aim of purchase
operations at Kesko is to do a long-term, systematic collaboration with suppliers to
guarantee quality. In the longer-term, Kesko favors suppliers that accept Kesko’s
values and principles and is willing to follow these instructions (Kesko
Tavarantoimittajat). When supplier relations are longer-lasting, Kesko has better
possibilities to engage with its supplier and thus improve sustainability operations.

5.1.3.4 Supplier development and collaboration

The importance of supplier development is highlighted at Kesko. Supplier
development practices are implemented around the world with different suppliers.
Supplier development processes are either implemented individually with suppliers or
another option is that Kesko is part of a bigger arrangement with other organizations.
For instance, Kesko is part of a procurement cooperation, ICA Global Sourcing (IGS).
In 2019, Kesko and IGS implemented sustainability training for suppliers in India 51

four suppliers were educated. The training aimed to inform about requirements of
social sustainability, quality of products, and safety. In addition, education focused on
improving audits at factories. Two shoe manufacturers and one building services
supplier were educated in China. (Kesko Annual Report 2019)
Cooperation with several organizations seems to get considerable attention in Kesko’s
operations. In 2019, Kesko and an organization, the Center of Child Rights and
Corporate Social Responsibility (CCR CSR)), opened a summer kindergarten for
employees at a construction site lamp factory in China. The kindergarten enabled
employees to have their children near them instead of living farther apart. 85% of the
children would have been separated from their parents without kindergarten. Kesko is
also a part of the Bangladesh Accord agreement, where the aim is to improve electrical,
fire, and construction safety at garment factories in in Bangladesh through audits,
education, and improvements. Kesko’s brand, my-wear, is required to be part of the
Accord-process and in 2019 six my-wear manufacturers were part of the agreement.
(Kesko Annual Report 2019) Kesko has collaborated in many different fields.
Collaboration is implemented by taking social aspects into account but also developing
suppliers’ capabilities and informing them about the requirements.
To be able to introduce and require sustainability practices from suppliers, employees
need to understand the principles of sustainability. Therefore, Kesko has emphasized
training its employees about sustainability practices. Education includes various
sustainable development procurement guidelines such as high-risk land procurement
certification process, education on the code of conducts, and audits systems. In 2019,
Kesko held five trainings for their employees. (Kesko Annual Report 2019) This is
part of sustainability risk management in supply chains. When their employees have a
clear knowledge of sustainability requirements and practices in supply chains,
suppliers can be informed clearly and effectively.
Previous examples show that supplier development can be implemented in various
ways. When considering sustainability, the focus can be on a number of different
approaches. The kindergarten example implicates that Kesko aims is to have a
comprehensive focus on supplier sustainability. Besides, it can be noticed that a large
share of developing processes are implemented in collaboration with another actor.
52

When developing processes are done with other actors, there can be better possibilities
to contribute to supplier development.

5.1.3.5 Closer to the suppliers

Kesko has a strong emphasis on local production and their aim is to support products
that are produced close to consumers. 81% of all purchases come from Finland and the
overall monetary amount is 5,9 billion euros (Kesko Annual Report 2019). When
Kesko is purchasing a vast amount of their purchases from Finland, it is easier to
reduce risks in supply chains. For instance, the carbon footprint is smaller when the
transportation of goods is shorter.
Kesko has launched different concepts that are intended to increase the importance of
local producers and develop collaboration with local producers. One of the concepts is
called “Local food dates”. The idea behind this concept is to bring Kesko’s
tradespeople and local producers together so that they know and understand each other
better. Another concept “Thank you for the producer”. With this concept, Kesko and
producers aim to increase appreciation of Finnish food. Consumers pay a slightly
higher price for products, but this enables Kesko to pay their producers more. (Kesko
Annual Report 2019)

5.1.4 Risk monitoring and control
Audits have significant importance in Kesko’s supply chains. Audits are especially
important when procuring from risk countries that are introduced in Amfori’s risk
country classification. BSCI -auditing enables auditing especially suppliers from the
risk countries. Besides, other audits are acceptable, if the criteria correspond to the
level of the Amfori BSCI audit and the audit has been performed by an independent
party. Kesko requires that all their suppliers from risk countries have auditing
processes. In 2019, 180 Kesko’s suppliers’ factories and plantations were fully Amfori
BSCI audited. In addition, an Amfori BSCI follow-up audit was carried out at 172 of
the suppliers’ factories or farms. Complying with working time regulations, the factory
management practice and worker protection matters were the most common
deficiencies found during audits. At the end of 2019, Kesko’s suppliers had
implemented 733 social sustainability audits. (Kesko Annual Report 2019)

53

An independent auditing body is preferred at Kesko. Usage of an independent auditing
body enables to obtain the most reliable and cost-efficient way to ensure that
sustainability requirements are obeyed. (Kesko Principles and Practice of Socially
Responsible Trading)
Monitors and controls are implemented at regular intervals. Amfori’s BSCI operating
model consists of full audits every two years. Suppliers are audited according to the
audit protocol. If a supplier does not meet the requirements, a follow-up audit is
arranged within 12 months. Suppliers are required to implement corrective measures
that are then assessed during the follow-up audit. As shown, the aim of Kesko is not
to terminate cooperation with suppliers if misconducts are found. The aim is rather to
help suppliers to improve their practice to meet the requirements. Although, if
agreements of corrective actions are difficult to arrange with suppliers, cooperation
must be terminated. In 2019, Kesko terminated cooperation with nine factories since
agreements were not met. (Kesko Annual Report 2019)
With audits, Kesko ensures that sustainability practices are followed during the
partnerships. Monitoring and controlling sustainability requirements facilitates
addressing grievances early enough before sustainability risks realize. If violations
against sustainability requirements are noticed, Kesko prefers to improve suppliers’
actions instead of terminating contracts. When contract terminations are avoided,
buying companies avoid transaction costs that are the results of new contracts. These
can be expensive, therefore developing collaboration may be a better solution from a
financial point of view.

5.1.5 A different outlook of sustainable performance
Kesko has gained negative publicity from various sustainability violations in its supply
chains.

The most infamous instances have consisted of misconducts in social

sustainability. For example, there have been problems with pineapple juice and tuna
fish manufacturing in South East Asia.
In 2013, Finnwatch disclosed that Kesko’s pineapple juice was manufactured in
questionable circumstances. Natural Fruit factory, located in Thailand, was accused of
illegally low wages and employees were forced to work overtime five to ten hours a
54

day. A large number of the employees were victims of human trafficking, and also
child labor was used. The factory management was accused of confiscating the
workers’ passports and work permits. The employees were prevented from changing
jobs. (Finnwatch, Ananasmehujen taustalla pakkotyövoimaa) The example
demonstrates that sustainability issues are wide-ranging in some parts of the world and
human rights violations can be severe.
The Finnwatch disclosure also accused a tuna fish manufacturer, Thai Union
Manufacturing, of violations against social sustainability. Wages were insufficient for
living, there were deficiencies with written employment contracts and occupational
safety had shortcomings. Although both of the examples indicated misconduct against
social sustainability requirements, Finnwatch recommended sustainable supplier
development instead of termination of the contracts. According to Finnwatch,
termination of the contracts would not improve the conditions. Therefore, it is better
to collaborate with suppliers to improve sustainability practices. (Finnwatch,
Ananasmehujen taustalla pakkotyövoimaa)
Kesko has made substantial improvements considering manufacturers in Thailand. In
2015, a project by Plan was launched where Kesko supported the initiative. The
project enabled 60 children to attend school. Before the project, underaged children
helped partners to fish, process fish, and at home. The project enabled children to have
better possibilities for the future. (Kesko Cooperation between Kesko and Plan helps
children of migrant families to school in Thailand)
In 2018, Finnwatch published a new report of Thai Union factories. According to the
report, Kesko had a significant impact on improving working conditions and social
sustainability levels. Legal social security for workers had improved, recruitment fees
were decreased, democratic workers’ committees were allowed and social dialogue
between workers and management had increased. Previous infamous disclosures have
had a broader impact since Kesko has begun to improve sustainability performance
also in other areas. Violations in Thai working conditions have also led to several
corporate responsibility projects in other high-risk countries. (Finnwatch, Työolot
paranivat Thaimassa)

55

As Finnwatch suggested, if sustainability violations are measured, companies should
implement improvement processes instead of terminating purchasing contracts with
suppliers. Kesko examples indicate the efficiency of improvement actions.
Improvement actions with suppliers have comprehensive impacts on sustainability
issues. If contracts are terminated immediately after misconducts are noticed,
suppliers’ misconducts could continue with other buying companies. Besides, Kesko
was able to continue contracts and thereby avoid expensive transaction costs.

5.2 UPM
UPM is a Finnish forest industry company aiming to create sustainable fossil-free
alternatives for various purposes in the bio-economy. Sustainability is at the core of
UPM’s processes. The vision is to be among the pioneers in bioforestry industry by
offering an alternative to fossil economy solutions. UPM is a global actor that has
operations around the world. As a global actor, UPM has a vast amount of suppliers 24,000 suppliers are used globally. In addition, 18,000 private forest owners sell their
products to UPM. (UPM Annual report 2019) A large supplier portfolio challenges
UPM’s sustainable supply chain management. Because of the large number of
suppliers, there is an increased probability for various risks, including sustainability
risks. Therefore, social and environmental sustainability have a major part of supply
chain management in addition to the financial aspect of sustainability (UPM Annual
Report 2019).
UPM has manufacturing operations in 12 countries around the world and on six
continents. There are employees in 46 different countries. (UPM Annual Report 2019)
Therefore, UPM has a wide range of influence and can be closely involved with
different actors, including suppliers.
Major sourcing categories consist of fiber, chemicals, other raw materials, indirect
purchases, logistics, and energy. Hence, there are a vast number of suppliers in the
supply chain and purchases encompass various items. Therefore, UPM has developed
a platform to standardize and simplify sourcing processes. Supply chain operations
such as demand planning, tendering, contracting, and purchase transactions are
facilitated with the platform. The aim is to improve effectiveness and transparency in

56

supply chains, and improve suppliers’ integration into business processes. (UPM
Annual Report 2019) With these operations, UPM can manage sustainability better in
its supply chains and thus mitigate sustainability risks.
Risk management is one of the strategic objectives of UPM. To be able to reach the
objective, UPM has developed its processes. In 2019, the Code of conduct was revised
and the staff was trained in sustainability practices. Also counterparty risk
management has gotten more attention. The objective in 2020 is to educate UPM’s
suppliers and third- party members of the Code of Conducts. Certificates and audits
are among the different methods of how sustainability risks are managed. (UPM
Annual Report 2019) A wide range of different management methods proves that
sustainability risks in supply chains are considered as potential and severe risks for the
company. Furthermore, the wide portfolio of different methods indicates that risks are
analyzed before deciding which of the methods should be used. Proper sustainable
supply chain management facilitates risk management processes and competitive
advantage can be increased through it. (UPM Annual Report 2019)

5.2.1 Risk identification
UPM has defined a vast number of various risks. The risks are defined according to
description, risk impact, management, and opportunities. Supply chain and third- party
reputation risks are mentioned as some of them. Risks consist of environmental and
social risks. Environmental risks include leakages or emissions as a result of a
malfunction or human error. Social risks include events where physical injuries to
people are possible. Both of these can affect UPM’s image negatively. (UPM Annual
Report 2019)
Risk identification is implemented through various methods. The engagement of
stakeholders has a vital role in UPM processes when risks are identified and discussed.
UPM has developed an analysis called “Materiality analysis” to facilitate risk
identification. The analysis involves knowledge of different sustainability issues that
have a direct or indirect influence on the ability to create, maintain, or acquire
sustainable value for UPM, stakeholders, or society. (UPM Annual Report 2019) The
materiality analysis indicates that UPM takes a broader consideration of sustainability
issues and is willing to discuss with stakeholders what they emphasize as key tasks.
57

The analysis is carried out annually and different stakeholder groups are interviewed
to get a broader view of sustainability concerns. Besides, UPM utilizes a web-based
survey that is filled anonymously by its stakeholders. When results are received, a
third-party actor will analyze results and deliver the analysis to UPM. The analysis
classifies the sustainability dimensions to four different issues. In social dimensions,
special attention is paid to child and forced labor, diversity, employee engagement,
and health and safety. Environmental dimension consists of circular economy and
resource efficiency, climate change, product stewardship, and responsible forest
management and biodiversity. (UPM Annual Report 2019) The UPM’s materiality
analysis demonstrates that stakeholders’ concerns are considered and their view has
an important role in the sustainability process. When different important sustainability
topics are known, it is easier to fulfill the expectations.

5.2.2 Risk assessment and analysis
Supplier risk assessment includes to supply chain management process. Risk can have
multiple and severe consequences - damage to the reputation can lead to loss of
business and competitive position, and besides damage the value of the company.
Previous examples are for the most part results of reputation risks. (UPM Annual
Report 2019) Therefore, risk management has a considerable impact on UPM’s
operations. Sustainable supply chain management aims to manage UPM’s reputation
and thus it has considerable importance in UPM’s operations. Therefore, UPM
assesses and analyzes the identified risks to obtain appropriate treatment options.
Risk assessment has an important role in UPM’s operations. UPM faces a vast number
of different risks, therefore the most severe and probable must be known.
Environmental pollution, occupational health, and safety, working conditions,
protection of children, and forced labor are the key issues on which UPM focuses. In
addition to specific risks, some other factors are assessed in more detail. For instance,
counterparty risk is carefully considered in the risk assessment. UPM has developed
its processes to facilitate counterparty risk management. UPM has launched a project
in 2019, enabling UPM to manage counterparty risks in different countries and
continents. The aim is to know the partners to make procurement more sustainable.
(UPM Annual Report 2019) Assessing counterparty risks facilitates the identification

58

of the most severe and likely risks for UPM and thus find the most suitable options to
manage the risks.
In addition to counterparty risks, some of the industries are assessed more closely. For
instance, UPM has set specific requirements for pulp suppliers. They have special
requirements for environmental performance, social sustainability, forestry, wood
procurement, and reporting. UPM highlights the importance of collecting and
analyzing information on pulp and chemical suppliers. There is a particular focus on
supplier risk management for suppliers in these areas (UPM Annual Report 2019)
Focusing on specific industries indicates that UPM highlights the importance of certain
industries. When pulp and chemical suppliers obtain more specific requirements, it
indicates that risks are more likely to occur in these industries and therefore special
requirements are set.

5.2.3 Risk treatment
UPM has presented a list of different methods that are used to manage sustainability
risk in the supply chain. The core of the methods consists of the UPM Code of
Conduct, the UPM Supplier, and Third Party Code, audits, and certificates. (UPM
Annual Report 2019) Besides, supplier development processes are used as one of the
options, hence, these supplier development practices at UPM will be introduced.
Suppliers are analyzed and the results of analyzes will be the core of the supplier
development process (UPM Annual Report 2019). Even though supplier development
is not mentioned among operations that manage supply chain risks, it can be seen that
supplier development and collaboration are used to ensure sustainability practices
among suppliers.

5.2.3.1 Code of Conduct

Code of conduct is among the tools for how risks are managed in supply chain
management. The UPM Code of Conduct sets the minimum requirements for UPM’s
partners. The minimum requirements consist of all applicable laws and regulations
(UPM Code of Conduct). The requirements must be met also by the sub-suppliers,
suppliers are required to promote the same requirements further down in the supply

59

chains. The idea is that the Code of Conduct would impact the whole supply chain.
(UPM Annual Report 2019)
Child labor is emphasized in UPM’s code of conduct. For instance, there are two
alternatives to using underage at work. Suppliers either follow the instructions of the
International labor organization (ILO) where the minimum age for working is 15, or
local laws. The option chosen should be based on which one is higher. (UPM Code of
Conduct) This proves that the code of conduct is a combination of different
instructions that can be from an organization and laws and regulations.
UPM has launched a practical guide for suppliers. The guide aims to inform suppliers
about the requirements in the code of conduct and therefore facilitate them to fulfill
the expectations. The different requirements of the code of conducts have been
introduced in the guide which is supplemented with examples of how suppliers can
implement practices at their practices. (UPM Practical guide)
However, the code of conduct is not the only way to manage risks. Different industries
are required to fulfill additional requirements in addition to the minimum. All of the
wood, pulp, and recovered paper suppliers are evaluated continuously in different
sustainability dimensions. Raw material suppliers are evaluated by different
certifications and standards. (UPM Annual Report 2019).
UPM has an aim to develop its practices, including utilizing the code of conduct. The
objective for 2030 is to have 100% of the value of purchases from suppliers that have
accepted the Supplier and Third Party Code. (UPM Annual Report 2019) This is an
example of how UPM is constantly striving to improve its operations to be more
sustainable and thus mitigate sustainability risks in supply chains.

5.2.3.2Certificates

Certificates are included in the risk management options. Usage of certificates
facilitates to pursue the sustainability requirements. (UPM Annual Report 2019) There
are various certificates used at UPMs operations, some consider the social aspect and
some the environmental aspect. Therefore, it is important to select the most suitable
certificates to fulfill the requirements.
60

Wood supplied to UPM is covered by third-party-verified, FSC and PEFC certificates.
In addition to the certificates, UPM affirms that EU Timber Regulation, the US Lacey
Act, and other regional requirements are observed by the wood suppliers to the mills.
(UPM Annual Report 2019)
Related to certificates, supplied wood is required to be traceable. Traceability ensures
the sustainability of the procured wood, encompassing environmental and social
aspects. (UPM Annual Report 2019)

5.2.3.3Supplier evaluation and selection

The UPM Supplier and Third Party Code set the minimum requirements for suppliers.
Certificates provide a good basis for supplier evaluation and selection. However, there
are additional requirements. For instance, general safety instructions and specific
requirements for various industry areas, such as pulp, chemical, logistic, packaging,
recovered paper, and wood sourcing, and forestry. Pulp suppliers are required to utilize
the best available techniques from a technical and economical point of view to
minimize environmental load (UMP Pulp Supplier Requirements). UPM uses the EU
Ecolabel Requirements for chemical suppliers. The EU Ecolabel Requirements focus
on emissions to air and water and energy use. (UPM Chemicals and Pigments)
Packaging suppliers are required to minimize the amount of packaging material and
are encouraged to use recyclable and environmental materials (UPM Packaging).
Procurement of recovered paper is based on EN643 (UPM Recovered paper). Wood
suppliers are required to have a third-party certification (UPM Wood Sourcing and
Forestry). The previous examples demonstrate that UPM focuses on certain industries,
where suppliers are evaluated more carefully. It implicates that these industries can be
seen as more vulnerable and therefore risky. With specific requirements, UPM has
increased possibilities to manage sustainability risks.

5.2.3.4 Supplier development and collaboration

UPM Annual Report (2019) highlights the importance of collaboration and supplier
development process among supplier risk and performance management. 1.6 million
tonnes of chemical pulp come from external suppliers and they are required to develop
actions towards a more sustainable way. The process includes collecting and analyzing
61

environmental and social sustainability data. The analysis is used to develop and plan
processes together with the suppliers. UPM has taken part in Together for
Sustainability (TfS) since 2018. This is an initiative that promotes and improves
practices within the supply chain and its members. TfS is a global network of 26
chemical companies where the global standard for environmental, social, and
governance performance of chemical supply chains are informed. (TfS) With help of
TfS UPM can receive supplier data that consists of audit reports and sustainability
assessments. TfS aims to help companies evaluate and improve the sustainability
performance of the suppliers by a standard approach. (UPM Press release 2018) TfS
has enabled UPM to improve the transparency and efficiency of its assessment and
audits. UPM completed more than 400 environmental and social risk assessments with
EcoVadis and TfS audits that are available for companies in TfS. Because UPM has
such a vast number of suppliers it would be a hard task to review and audit all of the
suppliers with its own resources. (UPM Annual Report 2019) Hence, taking part in
TfS has enabled managing sustainability risks more broadly. UPM has had access to a
larger information base which has facilitated the management of risks in their supply
chains.

5.2.4 Risk monitoring and control
Audits have pivotal importance when risks are monitored and controlled.
Implementing supplier audits are mentioned as one of the tools to manage supply chain
risks. Suppliers are audited constantly which includes systematic risk assessment
practices. Audits facilitate implementation of responsible sourcing. In 2019, 185
supplier audits were implemented for UPM. In addition, there were 300 audits on
contractors where the focus was on working conditions. (UPM Annual Report 2019)
UPM has a certain emphasis on supplier audits. For instance, in 2014 UPM began a
program in Thailand where its supplier, Tapioca Starch, a raw material supplier, was
audited regularly and extensively. The aim was to improve working conditions. The
program was launched even though most of the workers were satisfied with the
working and living conditions, as some safety concerns were noticed. Audits enabled
advising the supplier and discussing sustainability concerns. (UPM Annual Report
2019) The example demonstrates that audits can be a part of a longer program where
the aim is to develop processes constantly even though severe misconduct would not
62

be noticed. When preventive actions are implemented, there are better opportunities to
avoid the realization of risks.
If suppliers’ violations towards sustainability requirements are noticed during audits,
UPM prefers corrective action rather than terminating the relationship immediately.
When violations are noticed from the suppliers’ side, they are required to take
corrective action. UPM provides support to its suppliers to improve their actions.
However, if the corrective actions do not reach the required objectives, contracts
between UPM and its supplier can be terminated. (UPM Annual Report 2019)

5.2.5 A different outlook of sustainable performance

There are examples where UPM has been accused of greenwashing. According to
Maan ystävät (Questioning UPM greenwashing campaign), a Finnish NGO, UPM has
informed the external audience of the positive outcomes of their actions in Uruguay,
instead of informing about the negative impacts these actions have on the environment
and locals. The statement of Maan ystävät that has been signed by a vast number of
different organizations and scientists, discloses how UPM produces cellulose in
Uruguay at eucalyptus plantations. The statement accuses UPM of greenwashing since
UPM claims that tree plantations that replace natural grasslands would benefit
expanding biodiversity, help to mitigate consequences of climate change, prevent
deforestation, and cellulose plants would contribute to sustainable water management.
Instead of these positive outcomes that UPM discloses, Maan ystävät points out
various negative outcomes. Cellulose plantations will increase monocultural
plantations which will impact the environment and locals negatively. One of the main
problems with cellulose plantations t monoculture tree plantations. When plantations
are monoculture, the deforestation issues increase Local communities will suffer from
monoculture plantations expansion. When plantations focus on planting certain wood
types, nature around it will suffer. In addition to changes in nature, plantations harm
residents.
Plantations can change local productions, such as food sovereignty. In addition,
plantations can have an impact on soil which may lead to loss of organic matter and
minerals, and water. The plantations have negative impacts also on local residential

63

areas. Locals lose their territories because of plantations and there is increased demand
for infrastructure. (World Rainforest Movement. Local Struggles Against Plantations)

5.3 Neste
Neste is an energy company, the world’s largest producer of renewable diesel and
renewable jet fuel refined from waste and residues. Neste has been recognized as a
sustainable company. In 2020, Neste was in third place on the Global 100 list. Besides,
Neste has been three times in the top three and 14 consecutive times on the list. Neste
has been most consecutive times on the list from energy companies. (Neste Vuoden
2020 Global 100-listalle: Neste maailman kolmanneksi vastuullisin yritys) This shows
that Neste is a frontrunner in sustainable (energy?) business and is aiming to develop
its processes to become more sustainable.
Extensive attention is paid to sustainability practices in Neste’s operations and several
different actors are utilized to obtain a comprehensive view about sustainability. For
instance, a materiality assessment is exploited to understand sustainability
opportunities and challenges. Therefore, the materiality assessment has significant
importance in Neste’s operations. With the materiality assessment, stakeholders’
sustainability concerns are surveyed, and it is implemented every two years. In 2018,
the assessment consisted of 161 stakeholder representatives’ views. Neste emphasizes
the importance of their stakeholders’ opinions about sustainability: the latest
assessment identified nine material topics which provide a sustainability agenda for
Neste. (Neste Annual Report 2019) Neste involves its stakeholders in the sustainability
process to enhance its sustainability operations. When stakeholders are involved,
Neste can understand the expectations and later fulfill them better.
The development of supplier sustainability has been widely considered at Neste. A few
different approaches have been developed to facilitate supplier sustainability and thus
reduce sustainability risks in the supply chains. For instance, supplier engagement and
development processes are pivotal operations at Neste. A portal, Supplier
sustainability portal, has been established for suppliers to manage relationships more
effectively. The portal encompasses several processes, including sustainable sourcing
of renewable raw materials. Supplier evaluation, supplier due diligence, engagement,

64

and submission of proof of sustainability documents are among the processes included.
Suppliers have been involved in developing the portal, which aims to be supportive to
all suppliers. (Neste Annual Report 2019) Besides, risk management processes are
among the core operations in supply chain management. Therefore, supplier
sustainability due diligence is closely monitored at Neste. Neste has developed a
framework: “The Neste Supplier Sustainability Due Diligence Framework”. The
framework has been a basis for a new Principle on Renewable Products (RP) Supplier
Sustainability Approval. The principle is implemented with every counterpart that
supplies renewable raw material for Neste’s renewable products. The approval is part
of Neste’s framework managing counterparty risk. Credit control, compliance review,
and sustainability due diligence processes are included in the framework. A six-step
sustainability due diligence process defines the minimum requirements for supplier
sustainability approval: 1) Review of material approval 2) sustainability risk
assessment 3) supply chain identification 4) review of certain requirements of market
compliance and Neste compliance 5) ESG evaluation and 6) Onboarding audit. The
due diligence framework aims to collaborate with suppliers. It enables to enhance
sustainability performance mutually through engagement, collaboration, and
improvement. Besides, the framework facilitates Neste to know better the subsuppliers. The Neste supplier sustainability due diligence framework and the supplier
sustainability portal support each other, as the portal is used to manage the due
diligence process. (Neste Annual Report 2019)
In addition to sustainable supply chain management, risk management has an
important role at Neste. The operations are constantly developed, aiming to match the
variable internal and external operating environment. The risk model at Neste
classifies risks into three aspects: external, strategic, and operational. The most
important risks among external risks are changes in the external operating environment
and risks related to the partnership network. Supplier management includes
partnership network management. (Neste Annual Report 2019) Supplier risk
management is seen as an important part of Neste’s operations.

5.3.1 Risk identification
The risk management team at Neste leads the risk management cycle that includes
identifying and assessing the most significant liability risks. The sustainability risks
are identified and assessed as part of the annual risk management that is implemented
by the risk management team. The risks are monitored and the risk management team
ensures that risks are adequately mitigated in Neste’s business areas, operations, and
county units. Forced and child labor, discrimination, conditions of employment, and
land and property issues are mentioned as the biggest concerns when suppliers’ social
sustainability is considered.
There are wide-range risks that challenge Neste. Neste’s operations can cause
considerable hazards since the nature of the operations. For instance, maritime
accidents can have enormous impacts on the surrounding environment. Hence, risk
management importance is highlighted in supply chain management. (Neste Annual
Report 2019) A maritime accident is an example where sustainable and ordinary risks
can occur at the same time. If the environment suffers because of the accident, it might
produce reactions in stakeholders, but at the same time, the accident can cause
disturbances that may also damage Neste’s operations. This is an example of why
Neste has an extensive focus on risk management when supply chains are managed.
Sustainability risks are considered but the ordinary risks are not forgotten. The risk of
adverse environmental impact is seen as the environmental risk in supply chain
management. Palm oil has created a reputational risk for Neste during the past years,
hence, it is considered one of the most important environmental risks in supply chain
management. (Neste Annual Report 2019)

5.3.2 Risk assessment and analysis
Risk management assessment is implemented annually at Neste. Risk levels are
monitored, and it is ensured that the risks are mitigated appropriately. Risk
management is described as an essential part of ensuring that Neste reaches the set
strategic goals and business objectives successfully. (Neste Annual Report 2019) The
biggest social risks identified in Neste´s supply chains are forced and child labor,
discrimination, conditions of employment, and land and property issues. The
environmental risks in the supply chains arise from the raw materials that are used in

66

products such as vegetable oils, waste, and residue fats. For instance, palm oil has been
on display and posed a reputational risk to Neste. NGOs and customers are considered
about the usage of palm oil, which has posed a risk reputation. To manage and mitigate
the previous risks, Neste requires suppliers to comply with the Neste Supplier Code of
Conduct which contains strict human rights criteria. (Neste Annual Report 2019)
The Neste Supplier Sustainability Due Diligence Framework has an important role in
assessing sustainability risks. Sustainability risk assessment is the second phase of the
framework and ensures that identified risks are assessed properly and necessary
actions can be implemented. (Neste Annual Report 2019)

5.3.3 Risk treatment
Neste has a wide range of different options for how sustainability risks are managed
in their supply chains. Although, as a global actor, Neste faces challenges to implement
sustainable supply chain management. and there can be difficulties to enhance
relationships with suppliers. Therefore, Neste has established a couple of offices
around the world, to be able to be closer to the suppliers. In 2019, Neste opened two
new offices, one in Shanghai and one in Melbourne. With help of the new offices,
Neste can engage the suppliers and exert more control to ensure high-level
sustainability performance. (Neste Annual Report 2019) The example demonstrates
that sustainability risks can be managed more broadly than only with the traditional
operating models that companies tend to utilize.

5.3.3.1 Code of Conduct

Code of conduct has an essential role at Neste. They are widely used to ensure
sustainability in supply chains and therefore increase the possibilities to mitigate
sustainability risks. The Neste code of conduct is divided into two parts: One of them
is a more conventional code of conduct for all of Neste’s partners, and the other one is
modified for suppliers, which is called “The Supplier Code of Conduct”.
Environmental and social dimensions are presented in the supplier code of conduct.
The environmental aspect emphasizes impacts on climate change and environmental
impacts. For instance, suppliers should support a precautionary approach to
environmental challenges and commit to initiatives to promote greater environmental

67

responsibility. Suppliers are required to meet the applicable environmental
requirements including the laws, regulations, environmental permits in the business
area in which the supplier operates. The social aspect has two aspects: 1) Human rights
and workers’ rights and 2) Occupational health, personal safety, and corporate safety.
Human rights and workers’ rights include that suppliers are required to comply with
and keep appropriate records of applicable laws regarding working hours, minimum
wages, overtime, adequate breaks, and rest periods. From the safety point of view,
suppliers must provide employees a healthy and safe workplace following all laws and
regulations applicable to its operations. Laws and regulations set the core of the code
of conduct (Neste Code of Conduct).
The requirements of the codes of conduct are updated frequently, the latest update to
the Supplier Code of Conduct was implemented in 2019. Updates ensure
correspondence with existing norms and regulations, and stakeholders’ expectations
and needs. In addition to frequent updates, broad usage of code of conduct facilitates
to mitigate the sustainability risks. In 2019, 100% of Neste’s new indirect supplier
contracts, 100% of the renewable raw material volume, and 88% of the fossil raw
material volume that was delivered to Neste were covered by the Supplier Code of
Conduct or equivalent. (Neste Annual Report 2019) The number for fossil raw
materials was 91% in the previous year, implicating a slight decrease.
In addition to the supplier code of conduct, Neste has launched a supplier code of
conduct guide for suppliers. The guide supplements the supplier code of conduct and
advises how the requirements can be reached. Each of the supplier code of conducts
requirements is presented but in addition to this, examples of good practices are given
to help comply with the requirements. For instance, in environmental impact and
climate change, companies are encouraged to establish, implement, maintain, and
communicate the environmental policy. The policy should be appropriate to the
purpose and context of the business. From the social point of view, suppliers should
keep a record of working hours and working hours should be divided into normal and
overtime hours. Neste’s safety guidelines are at the core of guidelines for occupational
health, safety, and security. (Neste resumes sourcing from palm oil company IOI
Available) Neste aims to support the suppliers and assist them in reaching the

68

requirements. Guidelines provide tangible examples of how sustainability concerns
can be taken into account.

5.3.3.2 Certificates

When procuring raw materials, certifications have a significant impact on Neste’s
operations. Certifications ensure the sustainability of renewable fuel production.
Certificates that are used are compliant with the EU or the United States. In the United
States, renewable fuels are required to fulfill the Environmental Protection Agency’s
(EPA) sustainability requirements. Besides, ISCC and RSPO certificates that are
approved by the EPA, are used to monitor renewable material. With these actions,
Neste ensures that its production and raw material sourcing fulfill the EU’s and the
United States’ requirements. (Neste Annual Report 2019)
Certifications ensure that raw material production is implemented sustainably and thus
procurement is will not damage Neste. Special attention that has been paid to, for
instance: raw material used does not come from restricted areas such as high carbon
stock areas or rainforests, biodiversity and endangered species are out of risk, land
grabbing is forbidden, and human rights, including workers’ rights are respected.
(Neste Toimittajavaatimukset) Certifications focus on environmental and social
aspects of sustainability. When certifications are utilized in supply chain management,
Neste enhances sustainability-related risk management among supply chains.
If Neste’s suppliers lose their certificates, Neste will terminate its purchases from the
supplier (Neste f). It is a strong statement from Neste and emphasizes the importance
of certificates. Suppliers’ certificates inform Neste about the sustainability levels they
have.

5.3.3.3 Supplier evaluation and selection

Neste’s suppliers have strict requirements that are evaluated before contracts are
signed. The code of conduct has an essential role in evaluation and selection. The core
of the evaluation and selection process is set with a code of conduct but the other
requirements are emphasized. The requirements for suppliers differ in the importance
and industries of suppliers. Some industries and suppliers are considered more closely,
such as suppliers that supply raw materials for palm oil. The suppliers are evaluated
69

and selected after a comprehensive process. For instance, the suppliers are required to
commit to responsible action, the protection of biodiversity, and respect for human
rights. before any contracts can be signed. Supplier evaluation and selection processes
are considered closely at Neste due to their importance. Various instructional lists
consisting of requirements are used.
All of Neste’s suppliers are required to apply Neste’s responsible sourcing principles
with their suppliers. Neste Code of Conduct This enables Neste to have an impact
further down the supply chain. In addition to the principles, suppliers are required to
adhere to Neste’s Human Rights Commitment and Principles. Industry and marketspecific legal requirements are demanded of the suppliers.
Some of the suppliers have stricter requirements compared to others. Especially
suppliers that supply raw materials for renewable fuels are focused on more closely.
Raw materials for renewable fuels can be highlighted as an essential part of Neste’s
operations, therefore there is an increased focus on them. As a company emphasizing
renewable fuels, palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) is considered as one of the main
waste and residue materials of Neste’s portfolio. PFAD is only purchased from
suppliers that are committed to sustainable working practices and meeting strict
sustainability criteria embedded in the biofuels regulation. Preventing deforestation
and mitigating its risks encompass the strict criteria. Besides, purchased PFAD is
required to be traceable. Neste aims to map PFAD supply chains by the end of 2020
to be able to recognize actors along the supply chain. Mapping allows improved
knowledge about the actors and their actions. (Neste Annual Report 2019) According
to Stevenson and Cole (2018) mapping supply chains and publishing supplier lists
improve the transparency of supply chains. When transparency has increased,
companies have better possibilities to know the various operations in the chains and
therefore be aware of the risks that the chains consist of. Consequently, mapping
supply chains enhances chances to manage and therefore mitigate sustainability risk.
The code of conduct is the core of the supplier requirements which are supplemented
with additional requirements. Although, it is mentioned in the annual report that the
suppliers are required to fulfill the requirements of the supplier code of conduct.
Differences can be found between the requirements of different suppliers. For instance,
70

renewable raw material suppliers are required to meet additional requirements such as
responsible sourcing practices, Human Rights Commitment and Principles, and
industry and market-specific legal requirements. (Neste Annual Report 2019) Some of
the suppliers and industries can be seen as riskier which is why they have stricter
requirements compared to others.

5.3.3.4 Supplier development and collaboration

Supplier development and collaboration with suppliers is considered as one of the risk
management tools at Neste. Supply chain operations are improved constantly. Supplier
engagement is seen as part of the key strategies to improve the supply base. When
suppliers and their concerns are understood better, Neste has better possibilities to
strive for practical solutions, which enhance sustainability risk management. (Neste
resumes sourcing from palm oil company IOI Available) Supplier engagement
increases possibilities for a more beneficial relationship. To have more efficient
partnerships with Neste’s partners, two new offices were established in 2019.
There are various examples where Neste has developed operations with its suppliers.
Since 2015, Neste has arranged workshops with their palm oil suppliers to foster
dialogue and hear supplier’s concerns. Workshops have enabled Neste to better clarify
the requirements and expectations is has set to their suppliers. Collaboration with
suppliers has facilitated Neste to launch the Neste Responsible Sourcing Principle in
2019. (Neste resumes sourcing from palm oil company IOI Available) An important
part is that the suppliers are involved in developing the process of the sustainability
supplier portal. Consequently, the involvement of suppliers by Neste indicates better
possibilities to strengthen sustainability knowledge and therefore managing
sustainability-related risks more effectively.
In 2015, Neste introduced Neste Human Rights Commitment and Principles, aiming
to improve human rights activities in each of the operations from its employees to
supply chains. The aim is to develop its processes constantly to improve performance
from the social aspect. Neste has been part of various projects aiming to improve social
conditions in its supply chains. For instance, in 2019, Neste took part in a program that
aimed to strengthen the rights and protection of children. Neste, among several other
brands, collaborated with Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) and Wilmar to
71

protect the rights of children living on palm oil plantations. The program educated
palm suppliers about pragmatic measures of how to enhance the living conditions of
children. (Neste Annual Report 2019)
A considerable point in supply chain management is related to occasions where
suppliers do not comply with the requirements that have been set for them. If
violations against sustainability requirements have been noticed, Neste emphasizes the
importance of improving supplier capabilities, instead of terminating partnerships.
According to Neste, ending purchases does not resolve problems, therefore
cooperation is seen as a better solution. Although, if sustainability requirements are
not met after improvement processes, contracts will be terminated. If violations against
sustainability are noticed, Neste has a clear framework of how the process is
implemented. The supplier is required to disclose the situation. After Neste is informed
about the situation, the supplier is provided an assessment and if necessary, a supply
chain audit is carried out by Neste or a partner. The following step is to obtain a plan
from the supplier of corrective actions. (Neste h)

5.3.4 Risk monitoring and control
Audits are used to develop sustainability practices at Neste. Audits have pivotal
importance in the due diligence process. (Neste Annual Report 2019) Besides, risks
are identified and assessed annually which enables to control the risk better. When risk
management is developed constantly, Neste has better possibilities to respond to
changing challenges and thereby reduce sustainability risk in their supply chains.
Auditing is constantly developed at Neste to enhance sustainability performance at
suppliers’ sites. In 2019, Neste’s supplier sustainability due diligence process was
developed with a pilot. The launched pilot contains on-site audits for suppliers that
provide used cooking oil. The aim is to further develop audits in the future. (Neste
Annual Report 2019)
In 2019, Neste’s supplier sustainability due diligence process was developed with a
pilot. The launched pilot contains on-site audits for suppliers that provide used cooking
oil.

72

Maritime transport has an important role in Neste’s operations. Raw materials are
transported over sea. Neste considers maritime accidents as major risks. If a maritime
accident occurs, it can realize both sustainability and ordinary risks. Therefore, sea
transportation is examined closely during auditing processes. The external shipping
companies are selected carefully and audits are implemented regularly to ensure the
safety and sustainability of Neste’s operation at sea. (Neste kuljetusten turvallisuus)

5.3.5 A different outlook of sustainable performance
Finnwatch, a Finnish NGO that focuses on studying the global impact of business, has
reviewed Neste and its suppliers about palm oil production. In 2014, Finnwach
published its first survey where Neste’s palm oil supplier, IOI Group, was exposed.
The survey found severe violations. Employees were paid less than required by law
and regulations, employees’ passports were taken, the professional organization was
prohibited and employees paid high recruitment fees. The survey discovered
misconduct in certifications among palm oil industries and audits referring to
certifications. Because of the violations, Finnwatch has kept its focus on IOI Group
and its performance. (Finnwatch, Ananasmehujen taustalla pakkotyövoimaa) Neste
has taken action against IOI Group since the violations appeared. Neste suspended IOI
Group in 2016 because the supplier was suspended from Roundtable on Sustainable
Palm Oil (RSPO) certification. After IOI had improved its sustainable performance
and therefore obtained the certificate, Neste resumed purchasing palm oil from IOI
Group. (Neste Supplier requirements) After the development process employees were
satisfied with wages, living, and working conditions. Because the working conditions
had improved, length of employee relationships was relatively long, 10 years, which
implicates

employee

satisfaction.

(Finnwatch,

Ananasmehujen

taustalla

pakkotyövoimaa)
IOI Group’s example seems to have had an impact on Neste’s sustainable supply chain
management. In 2018, Neste was among the first companies to disclose its palm oil
suppliers. According to Finnwacth (Läpinäkyvyys lyö läpi. Neste teki historiaa), Neste
was the first company to trace almost all of the PFADs it uses to the processing plant
level. In 2014, Finnwatch had recommended Neste to trace and disclose their PFAD
supply chains. This proves that companies listen to a wide range of suggestions from
different stakeholders and therefore develop their processes. NGOs can have a
73

different perspective on certain issues which facilitates companies to have a more
comprehensive outlook about their actions.
Palm oil suppliers have caused Neste bad publicity on several occasions. Chain
Reaction Research (2020) has accused Neste of buying from a supplier, PT Bina Karya
Prima, which has a controversial background. According to Chain Reaction Research,
the supplier’s palm oil come from Indofood and Sawit Sumbermas Sarana. Both of
them have been accused of deforestation on their plantations, side businesses, and the
use of shadow companies to obliterate links to deforestation and violations against
human rights. According to Chain Reaction Research, Neste has been linked to
orangutang habitat destructions in Indonesia through its supply chain.
The previous examples show that tracking down the whole supply chain is a
challenging task, even for big multinational companies. Even though Neste has vast
resources, misconduct has been found in the supply chains. Examples prove that with
help of wide-ranging collaboration, the development process is possible.
There has been development in Neste’s sustainability practices. Neste has become
more transparent with the operations and different reports about their supply chains
have been published. Neste has launched an online service where anyone can report a
grievance or file a complaint. Neste discloses reports on complaints related to the
supply chain of renewable raw materials. By the 9th of December 2020, Neste has
disclosed three reports during 2020. The reports were about February, March, and
April. Reports disclose the target of the grievance, its relationships with Neste, the
parent company group of grievance target, a link to the grievance, and the status of the
grievance. In addition, a link to the direct supplier grievance dashboard is presented.
(Neste i) Increased transparency is one of the tools of how Neste aims to mitigate
sustainability risks in supply chain management (Neste Annual Report 2019).

5.4 Chapter summary
The chapter discuss empirical research based on utilized data. The case companies and
their sustainability risk management practices in supply chains are discussed. Each one
of the case companies are discussed through the framework which consists of: risk
identification, risk assessment and analysis, risk treatment and risk monitoring. When
the case companies are analyzed with these stages, it enables to obtain information of
how sustainability related risk are managed. Later it is easier to compare the case
companies and in addition, practical actions with previous literature. However, this
chapter consider sustainability misconducts in all three companies. When misconducts
are taken into account, it enables to obtain a more objective view of companies and
their actions. It proves that companies have difficulties to manage sustainability risks
even they would have vast resources.

75

6.Results
6.1 Risk identification
Risk identification has an important role in all three case companies. The processes are
comprehensive with a vast number of different actors involved. Stakeholders are
engaged in the risk identification process to obtain an extensive view of their concerns
which can be useful in managing sustainability risks more effectively.
Neste identifies risks annually. Risk identification is implemented by the risk
management team and its intention is to find the risks their supply chains consist of.
Social risks include child and forced labor, discrimination, conditions of employment,
and land and property issues. Environmental risks consist of raw material procurement
such as palm oil that is an important raw material for Neste. In addition to mere
sustainability risks, Neste considers the combination of sustainability and ordinary
risks as pivotal because the nature of business maritime accidents can cause both
ordinary and sustainability risks. Therefore, supply chain risk assessments are required
to have a comprehensive focus. The maritime example shows that ordinary and
sustainability risks can occur at the same time. Therefore, sustainability risk
management can have wide-ranging effects on the company’s operations in general.
UPM has a strong focus on sustainability risks in its supply chains. The materiality
analysis is implemented annually to identify risks. Stakeholders are engaged to obtain
a comprehensive view, including stakeholders’ concerns. Social risks that are
identified are child and forced labor, diversity, employee engagement, and health and
safety. Environmental risks include resource efficiency, impact on climate change,
product stewardship, and responsible forest management and biodiversity.
Kesko observes risk identification as an important part of managing sustainability risks
in the supply chains. Environmental and social risks are considered as key risks in its
supply chains. Environmental risks consist of the transaction, physical, and climate
impact risks. Especially climate impact has great impact on sustainability risks.
Products’ and services’ life cycle impact and climate emissions from energy solutions
and energy consumption are emphasized in the environmental aspect. Kesko has a
special emphasis on several products that are sold. For instance, the use of water in the
76

cultivation of products and tuna production. Social sustainability risks include Rights
of freedom of association and collective bargaining, focus on discrimination and child
labor, and occupational health and safety. Stakeholder engagement is used at Kesko.
Customers are more interested in sustainable consumption which affects sustainable
supply chain management. Shareholders are also interested in sustainability and
therefore the issues are emphasized in supply chain management.
There are similarities and differences between case companies. All the case companies
have a comprehensive risk identification process which consists of regular operations
and stakeholder engagement. Stakeholder engagement has an important role when
sustainability risks are identified in supply chains. The case companies analyze
stakeholders’ concerns about sustainability issues and identify the risks.
There are similarities and differences between sustainability risks. Especially social
risks consist of similar concerns. Social risks such as child and forced labor,
discrimination, and health and safety are concerned closely at the case companies. In
addition, some risks, especially environmental risks, are industry-specific. For
instance, Neste emphasizes maritime accidents, UPM sustainable forest management,
and Kesko how water is used in the cultivation of their products.
Risk identification concludes that there are some universal sustainability risks that the
case companies consider, for instance, usage of child and forced labor. However, these
risks can be hard to notice because of the length of the supply chains. Therefore,
companies pay special attention to these issues, especially as stakeholders consider
child labor as one the most unacceptable factor. Besides common sustainability
practices, the nature of a company’s industry affects sustainability risk identification.
In particular, environmental sustainability depends on the industry in which the
companies operate.

77

6.2 Risk assessment and analysis
At Neste, risks are assessed annually to ensure that the most severe risks are found and
thus risk management is successful. Risks are emphasized by the severity of
consequences. For instance, there are severe risks when palm oil is procured. The
procurement of palm oil has provoked reactions from stakeholders and is therefore
considered a serious risk. Usage of child labor is also considered a severe risk.
Kesko has a strong emphasis on assessing risk countries. Some countries have certain
conventional risks and therefore these countries are monitored closely. Kesko has a
special focus on countries where risks of human rights violations are greatest,
especially in Asia and Africa. In addition, to counterparty risks, some certain risks are
paid more attention to. At Kesko, water risk is among the most considered
environmental risks. Water risk is emphasized due to its strong link to fruit and
vegetable cultivation. There are some special requirements for certain products such
as cotton, chocolate, fish, and seafood. In the previous examples, Kesko has
centralized its focus on certain risks because those are assessed as more severe.
Therefore, risk management needs to consider these risks more closely.
UPM emphasizes certain risks more closely such as environmental pollution,
occupational health, and working conditions. These are seen as important for specific
risks. In addition, counterparty risks are considered closely in the risk assessment. The
aim is to know the counterparties and therefore manage risks that are more likely for
certain counterparties. For instance, country-specific risks are focused on when
counterparties are assessed. UPM pays also special attention to some industries. Pulp
suppliers have special requirements, as do the suppliers in the chemical industry. The
special requirements indicate that certain industries are assessed more closely and need
more attention.
All the case companies have certain sustainability risks that are considered more
closely in their sustainability risk management in supply chains. Social sustainability
risks are considered similarly. Labor conditions are severe risks that are assessed
closely in all of the companies. Otherwise, there is a strong emphasis on the industryspecific risks. For instance, palm oil procurement at Neste, Kesko emphasizes tunafish
procurement and UPM pulp procurement. In addition to some specific products, the
78

case companies focus on certain risk countries and counterparties which have an
increased possibility to sustainability risk realization. This enables companies to focus
on actors who are more likely to have problems with sustainability.

6.3 Risk treatment
The case companies have similar methods that are used to manage sustainabilityrelated risks in their supply chains. Code of conducts, certificates, supplier evaluation
and selection, and supplier collaboration and development are utilized in the case
companies. In addition, the case companies have focused to be closer to their suppliers
and other stakeholders. The case companies have set up offices around the world to
achieve this. When companies are closer to their stakeholders, there is an increased
chance to understand each other better and obtain information of each other which in
turn increases chances to avoid sustainability risks in supply chains. All of the case
companies have very similar methods to treat sustainability risk in their supply chains.

6.4 Risk monitoring
Sustainability risks are monitored and controlled in all three case companies.
Monitoring and controls are used extensively to obtain assurance that suppliers
implement sustainability practices, and contracts and requirements are followed.
Monitoring and controls are important phases of sustainability risk management.
Neste uses audits as one of the core methods in their supplier sustainability due to the
diligence framework. This implicates that audits are pivotal. Neste aims to develop its
audits constantly and thus manage sustainability risk better in their supply chains.
Kesko also emphasizes audits’ importance. Especially suppliers from risk countries
are audited more carefully. All Kesko’s suppliers from risk countries are required to
be audited. Kesko uses an independent auditing body, Neste and UPM use either their
own auditors or partners.

79

6.5 Misconducts
Although the case companies have invested to manage sustainability issues,
misconducts have happened in all of them. Sustainability misconducts provoke
stakeholder reactions and therefore have a significant impact on companies and should
be managed.

Even though the companies have significant resources and clear

processes to manage and thereby avoid various risks, it is challenging for them. The
case companies have frameworks for sustainability risk management in their supply
chains that are improved with help of various stakeholders. Regardless of the resources
the companies have, the example misconducts indicate that there are limited control to
suppliers. If supply chains are long, the case companies might have difficulties
influencing suppliers that are further down in the supply chains. The case companies
have invested increasingly to be able to influence suppliers with various supplier
development programs and being closer to suppliers. These can be seen as significant
operations when sustainability measures are improved. Misconducts of the case
companies demonstrate that sustainability risk management is challenging and
improvement is required to be able to manage and avoid the risks in the future.

6.6 Chapter summary
The sixth chapter discuss similarities between the case companies. This enables to
obtain a comprehensive view about sustainability risk management in Finnish
companies. The different stages of the sustainability risk management are discussed
and case companies’ actions are compared. The results show that companies have
similar management processes and highlight the importance of sustainability risk
management in supply chains. Risks are identified and stakeholders’ opinion are
utilized. In addition, the various risks are assessed and analyzed to obtain information
about the most critical sustainability risks which should be considered. Risk treatment
considers similar methods such as code of conducts, certificates, supplier evaluation
and selection, and supplier collaboration and development are utilized in the case
companies. In addition, the case companies have emphasized the importance of being
close to their suppliers and other stakeholders. With help of this companies are able to
be closer to suppliers and thus have better comprehension of mutual goals and
objectives. The last part of the framework is about risk monitoring. The case
companies highlight the importance of monitoring suppliers’ sustainability practices.
80

It assures that suppliers implement sustainability practices, and contracts and
requirements are followed. However, as mentioned, all the three case companies have
sustainability misconducts. It indicates the complexity of sustainable risk management
in supply chains. Companies are required to improve their practice constantly and be
prepared to face various risks.

81

7.Discussion
This chapter will discuss how the results of the thesis aligned with the literature. All
the framework phases will be considered in order to obtain a comprehensive view of
what kind of similarities or differences the companies have with each other and if
sustainability risk management in supply chains is implemented like literature
suggests. At the end of the chapter, the research questions will be answered.

7.1 Risk identification
All of the case companies emphasize risk identification as an important part of
sustainability risk management in supply chain management. The companies utilize
stakeholders comprehensively to obtain a broader view of sustainability concerns. This
supports the aim of supply chain management. Supply chains aim to produce value to
customers and fulfill expectations (Winter & Knemeyer, 2013; Drake, 2012). When
sustainability issues are taken into consideration in supply chain management,
expectations are easier to fulfill and therefore mitigate risks. Stakeholders value
companies from a different point of view than the traditional aspects such as cost,
quality, and financial performance. Thus, companies have a special focus on
sustainability issues in their supply chains. (Klassen &Vereecke, 2012) In the long run,
it is difficult to be successful if stakeholders are not heard (Norman & MacDonald,
2015). Lintukangas et al., (2015) state that the future actions of a company are driven
by its customers. Therefore, companies must listen to customers’ opinions so that their
needs are heard and understood. The three companies try to fulfill these expectations
when sustainability issues are widely considered.
Giannakis and Papadopoulus (2016) state that these are common social risks in the
supply chain in general. They also state child labor as one of the most pressing social
risks because of its severity and difficulty to discover it. Reinehert et al., (2019)
consider the usage of child and forced labor as the most important factors that cause
stakeholder reactions. All of the case companies emphasize child labor and forced
labor in social sustainability risks. This supports the severity of these issues and
stakeholders' interest in the usage of labor. There are different emphases on
environmental sustainability. Although the main idea is the same - have a small or no
impact on the environment. However, the nature of the case companies’ affects on
82

environmental risks. For instance, Neste focuses on palm oil suppliers when
environmental risks are considered, UPM considers sustainable forest management
and biodiversity as one of the risks and Kesko has emphasized the water risks as their
environmental risks. Therefore, the nature of the company has a considerable impact
on environmental risks.

7.2 Risk assessment and analysis
Sustainability risks in supply chains are assessed to find the most critical and severe
risks that can damage companies. The assessment considers specific risks, industries,
and counterparties. The case companies have certain risks that are given special
attention to – risks that are seen as severe for companies. In addition to certain risks,
counterparty risk management is common. For instance, suppliers coming from risk
countries are focused on extensively. According to Reinerth et al., (2019) when
countries are assessed, it facilitates understanding the country-specific supply chain
sustainability risks. The assessment will help when decisions of which audits,
development, or replacement are made. They consider country risk assessment as an
important tool to prevent stakeholder reactions and thus financial losses. A third
common factor in risk assessment and analysis is that they are specific to the industries.
The case companies focus on certain industries that are perceived as vulnerable and
can therefore damage the company. Similarities in risk assessment processes can be
seen.

7.3 Risk treatment
The case companies have similar tools to manage sustainability risks in their supply
chains. Code of conduct, certifications, supplier evaluations and selection, and supplier
development and collaboration are the core methods of how sustainability risks are
managed in the case companies. In addition, the empirical analysis found that local
procurement and opening offices closer to suppliers and counterparts can be seen as
one of the mitigation options.

83

7.3.1 Code of conducts
The code of conduct is seen as the core of sustainability risk management in supply
chains in all the case companies. The minimum requirements for suppliers are set in
the code of conducts where environmental and social aspects are included.
Management of sustainability risks in the entire supply chain is facilitated with the
code of conduct, the case companies require that suppliers have the same requirements
for their suppliers. Code of conduct can therefore have a great impact on the
sustainability of supply chains.
In their code of conduct, the case companies rely strongly on legislation and
regulations which set the minimum requirements for suppliers. However, there has
been criticism to relying on laws and regulations so heavily. Different countries vary
in legal and regulatory perspective which affects the code of conducts. Even though
there may not be any violations against laws and regulations, a company’s stakeholders
can react strongly because the code of conduct is only limited by law. (Zakaria et al.,
2012) For instance, employment legislation can differ in different parts of the world.
Some countries might have a lower minimum age for employment than some others.
Therefore, only relying on local laws and regulations is questionable. However, the
case companies rely also on international laws and standards. For instance, UPM
requires its suppliers to follow either the introductions of the International Labor
Organization where the minimum age for employment is 15, or local laws. The option
chosen should be based on which one is higher. This demonstrates that the code of
conduct is applied with local legislation and regulation, and international standards.
By combining various requirements, companies can obtain a comprehensive method
that can satisfy stakeholders.
However, this is not a trouble-free approach to the code of conduct. According to
Egels-Zandén and Lindholm (2015), one of the greatest problems with the code of
conducts is that they are unable to guarantee that a supplier stays compliant after
contracts are signed. The case companies require compliance with the code of
conducts, and if violations are noticed measures will be taken by the buyer’s side.
According to Zakria et al., (2012), NGOs and academics have criticized that buying
companies force low-income countries to follow high-income countries’ standards.
Because of this, context-specific conditions and concerns might be ignored. However,
84

suppliers’ concerns can be mitigated if they are informed properly. Code of conduct
enables the communication of the buying firm´s expectations of sustainability to their
suppliers (Cole & Aitken, 2019). When suppliers have signed a code of conduct, they
understand what is expected and it is easier for them to follow the requirements. These
are used to ensure that suppliers obey the buyer company’s sustainability strategy (Wu
& Pagell, 2011). The case companies require their suppliers to sign a code of conduct
that implicates that the code of conduct is utilized to ensure that suppliers follow the
strategies. Neste and UPM have published guides for their suppliers to facilitate the
suppliers’ introduction to the code of conduct. Hughes and Wadd (2012) state that
when suppliers understand the expectations of the buyer, there are better possibilities
to fulfill the expectations and reach the goals. The guides can help suppliers with their
practices and thus mitigate sustainability risks in supply chains and therefore improve
the ability of suppliers to comply with the requirements of the code of conduct. The
guides of Neste and UPM are clear examples of how suppliers are supported in
becoming more sustainable, which helps both of the partners.

7.3.2 Certificates
The case companies emphasize the importance of certificates. Usage of certificates
facilitates ensuring the sustainability of procurement in supply chains, for instance,
when raw materials are procured. All three companies utilize certificates in certain
industries. The industries are considered vital or vulnerable and therefore certificates
facilitate risk management. For instance, Kesko utilizes certificates in fish and seafood,
UPM with wood suppliers, and Neste in palm oil supplies. Neste’s certificates ensure
that rainforests and biodiversity are not harmed when raw material is procured. UPM’s
certificates ensure that supplied wood is in accordance with the EU’s and the US’s
legislation. In addition, the traceability of wood is easier when the wood is certified.
Kesko’s certificates in the fish and seafood industry ensure that social and
environmental issues are considered. With certificates, the case companies can show
that their suppliers meet the sustainability standards (Miemczyk & Luzzini, 2019).
However, certificates do not fully guarantee that the entire supply chain operates
sustainably. Multaharju et al., (2017) state that even when buying companies require
certificates from their suppliers, suppliers might not require certificates from their
suppliers. It is a hard task to ensure sustainability in an entire supply chain (Schöggl
et al., 2016). Therefore, certificates do not guarantee automatically that entire supply
85

chains operate sustainably. However, the usage of certifications facilitates managing
sustainability risks in supply chains. Certifications are especially important when the
buying company does not have a close relationship with its suppliers (Fan &
Stevenson,2018). Nonetheless, utilizing certificates increases the possibility of
sustainable supply chains. The case companies rely heavily on certificates and
certificates are required from a vast group of suppliers.

7.3.3 Supplier evaluation and selection
The code of conduct is the core in supplier evaluation and selection. In addition,
certificates supplement evaluation and selection process. Code of conducts set the
minimum requirements for the three case companies. However, code of conducts have
little detailed information about requirements. Therefore, the companies have focused
on having additional and more specific requirements for certain suppliers and
industries.
For instance, Kesko emphasizes the national law in suppliers’ home countries. In
addition, international standards are considered closely in supplier evaluation. Longterm engagement is emphasized in supplier selection process but also suppliers’
willingness to follow Kesko’s values and requirements. Wagner (2011) presents that
supplier development processes require longer relationships between a buyer its
supplier. Development processes are often implemented in the later stages of the
relationships. Therefore, one of the reasons why Kesko emphasizes long-term
engagement is that supplier development processes often require longer relationships
and with help of development, sustainability can be improved. Talluri et al., (2010)
also emphasize the long-term factor but in addition, the commitment to the process is
seen as pivotal. This supports Kesko’s requirements that suppliers are willing to follow
Kesko’s values and requirements. Thus, sustainability objectives are easier to reach
and risks can be managed.
Some of the industries are considered more closely, therefore all the case companies
have specific requirements for certain industries and suppliers. As discussed in the
assessment and analysis section, some industries and suppliers are seen as more
vulnerable, therefore additional requirements are utilized.

86

7.3.4 Supplier development and collaboration
All of the case companies have focused on developing and collaborating with their
suppliers. Development and collaboration is one option for a greater influence to
suppliers’ operations but the case companies consider complementary activities.
Kesko has emphasized different programs, Neste has had close relationships with palm
oil suppliers to foster dialogue with them, and UPM has been part of a program where
the aim is to improve practices in their supply chains. The study indicates that the case
companies concentrate on having close relationships with their suppliers in order to
improve sustainability practices.

Supplier development and collaboration is

considered as one of the tools of how the case companies can manage risks
(Hajmohammad and Vachon, 2016). Supplier development and collaboration can
include activities such as training programs, compensating costs associated with their
compliance, for instance shared investments in environmental-friendly equipment, and
sponsoring ecological and social conferences to encourage the suppliers to share their
knowledge and experiences. Supplier development and collaboration are widely used
to improve suppliers’ capabilities and thus mitigate risks in the case of companies.
Neste emphasizes that having closer relationships with suppliers facilitates
sustainability risk management and therefore development and collaboration are seen
as one of the management tools. In addition, the case companies prefer supplier
development operations instead of terminating contracts if sustainability violations are
noticed, which emphasizes the importance of development and collaboration
processes. Also NGOs prefer this, since improving suppliers’ operations has a greater
impact than terminating the contracts.
Supplier development and collaboration is a comprehensive tool that can be
implemented in various ways. Companies can have their own projects where their
suppliers are developed, or they can be part of a bigger project where other actors are
involved. In 2019, Kesko was part of a program that was organized by the ICA Global
Sourcing. With help of the program, four of Kesko’s suppliers in India were trained
about requirements, quality of products, and safety. In 2019, Kesko cooperated with
the Center of Child Rights and Corporate Social Responsibility when the aim was to
improve children’s conditions, opening a kindergarten for factory employees’
children. Employees and their children were satisfied with the kindergarten which
enabled them to spend more time together. Employees' well-being has improved and
87

commitment to the company has increased. Subramaniam et al., (2019) state that direct
involvement, such as supplier development and supplier collaboration, has a positive
impact on suppliers’ social performance. Neste took part in a program, where palm oil
suppliers were informed about the living conditions of children. The Tfs network
enables UPM to obtain detailed information about their suppliers and therefore
develop processes with suppliers. Koberg & Longoni (2019) suggest that the buying
firms should take advantage of NGOs or governmental organizations' information in
their supply chain management. With help of third parties, there would be enormous
chances to improve sustainability outcomes in a supply chain. The previous examples
demonstrate that the case companies have wanted to cooperate with other actors to
improve sustainability in their supply chains. Knowledge provided by other actors can
be utilized and thus improve sustainability. In addition, buyer companies can work
together to improve sustainability in supply chains.
An important example of supplier collaboration is from Neste, where suppliers have
had a chance to develop the Supplier Sustainability Portal with Neste. This has
facilitated suppliers’ engagement in sustainability practices and therefore has affected
sustainability risk management. Park et al., (2010) emphasize supplier involvement as
an important factor in the success of supplier development and collaboration processes.
When suppliers are taken into the development process, Neste has better possibilities
to understand suppliers' concerns and take those into account. When suppliers’
strategies, business models, and capabilities are understood it is easier to identify
different opportunities and challenges suppliers have (Hughes & Wadd, 2012). Hollos
et al., (2012) state that a buying company benefits the most from a supplier
development process when the buyer and supplier can improve their practices at the
same time. The Neste’s Supplier Sustainability Portal enables both of the partners to
improve their own practices when the development process is implemented together.
Therefore, taking suppliers into development processes is beneficial and facilitates to
manage sustainability risks.
Suppliers are widely used to improve sustainability practices at the case companies.
Collaboration can include portal development from the buyer’s side or the buyer might
help its suppliers to improve suppliers’ competence. Collaboration processes are
emphasized at all three case companies. Therefore, supplier development and
88

collaboration are among the most important sustainability risk management tools. This
conclusion will strengthen in the next chapter where closer relationship with suppliers
will be discussed.

7.4.5 Closer to the suppliers
Neste has opened new offices around the world and UPM has offices around the world.
Being closer enables the companies to have more effective communication and thus
understand different partners better. The study indicates that the case companies
concentrate on having close relationships with their suppliers in order to improve
sustainability practices. Various sustainability-related projects are easier to implement
when the distance between actors is smaller. Besides, cultural differences are easier to
avoid when partners are closer. According to Klassen and Vereecke (2012)
geographical location is one of the risk factors when risks in supply chain management
are considered. Busse et al., (2016) consider the distance between a buyer and its
supplier as an increasing supply chain sustainability risk factor. It is easier to have a
closer engagement with suppliers when suppliers are close, which enables to address
sustainability-related issues more effectively with suppliers. (Yawar & Seuring, 2018).
For instance, Juetnner et al., (2020) state that big corporations have challenges in
managing the trade-off between requirements of the head quarter and different regional
areas. The difference is dependent on the geographical distance, differences between
the regional and home market context. Lack of awareness and poor communication
were mentioned as some of the reasons. The case companies can manage the previous
challenges by being close to their suppliers. Grimm et al., (2014) highlight the
importance of relationships in developing more sustainable supply chains. Therefore,
the closer distance between the partners enhances possibilities when sustainability
risks are managed in supply chains. Understanding and communicating expectations
between partners increases the likelihood of success (Hughes & Wadd, 2012). When
there is trust between a buyer and its supplier, development processes are more easily
accepted on behalf of the supplier. Consequently, having suppliers closer enables
mitigation of sustainability risks in supply chains.

89

7.5Risk monitoring and control
Using an independent auditor allows obtaining impartial information (Hannibal &
Kauppi, 2019). For instance, it is better to use a third-party auditor than a governmental
auditor. Then there is less chance of various violations. Huq and Stevensons (2018)
survey studied seven apparel industry suppliers in Bangladesh. These suppliers were
audited by a governmental auditor. Although misconducts were noticed, bribes
prevented the buying company from knowing about the misconduct. The
governmental auditor took bribes from the suppliers which affected audit reports.
Hence, using an independent auditor can be a better solution. Egels-Zandén and
Lindholm (2015) state that audits have difficulties finding sustainability violations.
Even when audits are be sophisticated, including off-site interviews with workers,
labor rights violations may not be identified. Subramaniam et al., (2019) state that
suppliers might only follow sustainability standards during audits and evaluation.
Therefore, supplier audits are not a guarantee that misconducts can be found and thus
mitigate sustainability risks in the supply chains. However, with constant supplier
auditing companies can better manage sustainability risks in their supply chains and
the case companies have invested in regular auditing processes. Supplier audits are
only one part of sustainability risk management.
Auditing is a constant process that enhances the ability to manage sustainability risks.
The case companies focus on having constant audits and there are some special
programs implemented with suppliers. UPM has had constant audits with its supplier
in Thailand aiming to improve working conditions. For instance, as Neste considers
maritime accidents as one of the most vulnerable risks shipping companies are audited
more regularly to ensure sustainability. Risks that are assessed as vulnerable and more
likely are audited more closely, thus sustainability risks realization can be prevented
or mitigated. Therefore, it can be seen that sustainability risk management in the
supply chain is a chained process where risk identification and assessment impact later
phases of management.
Supplier audits help to improve supplier relationships and therefore manage
sustainability risks. If violations during audits are noticed, the case companies prefer
corrective actions instead of terminating contracts. For instance, UPM provides its
support to suppliers if needed. Foerstl et al., (2010) suggest continuing partnership
90

even when violations against sustainability requirements are noticed. If improvement
actions have not reached the required level, then it is better to terminate contracts and
find new suppliers. In 2019, Kesko had to terminate nine partnerships with its suppliers
because the suppliers were not able to reach the required sustainability levels.

7.6Critique towards sustainability listing
There has been criticism towards listing the most sustainable companies. Pekka
Seppänen writes in his column (YLE, 2019), that listing the most sustainable
companies is not problem-free. He argues that when companies such as Neste and
UPM are on the list, this raises questions about how sustainability is defined. Neste
has a large part of its business in selling fossil fuels and UPM’s business is based on
felling wood, which reduced carbon sinks. Therefore, it is questionable, how both of
these companies can be among the most sustainable companies in the world.
According to Seppänen, when companies talk about sustainability, they often define
themselves what sustainability is. When companies are able to define sustainability
themselves it might lead to subjective perspective. Then it is more difficult for external
audience to analyze companies’ sustainability practices. Therefore, it is crucial that
some external partners such as NGOs implement own research of companies’
sustainability practices and disclose if misconducts are found. This enables to obtain a
holistic view of sustainability practices in companies.

7.7Chapter summary
The seventh chapter was about comparing results with previous literature. As
mentioned, companies follow similar practices as literature suggests. Sustainability
risk management processes are utilized in supply chain management in order to
manage sustainability risks. In addition, this chapter highlights that there has been
criticism towards companies’ sustainability listing. Since companies can define
sustainability by themselves results might be subjective and therefore external
audience might find it difficult to obtain objective information. When objective
information is not available it is more challenging for external partners to analyze
companies’ sustainability practices. However, it is important that some external actors
such as NGOs analyze companies and their sustainability practices critically and also
disclose analysis. This facilitates to obtain a more transparent and holistic view of
91

companies and their sustainability practices. When external audience is more aware of
sustainability issues it can put pressure towards companies to make their supply chains
even more sustainable.

92

8.Conclusion
The importance of sustainability risks among supply chain risks have increased.
Companies invest to manage sustainability-related risks more effectively to avoid
severe consequences these might cause. In order to be successful, companies need
collaboration with external stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers. Constant
development processes are needed since the requirements for companies tighten from
customers’ and stakeholders’ side. Therefore, open communication helps keeping up
to date with the requirements that can be implemented.
Companies have clear frameworks to manage sustainability-related risks in supply
chains. Risk identification, assessment, and analysis are included in the process. These
activities are followed by risk treatment which consists of various tools that are utilized
to manage risks. The last phase of the management process is risk monitoring which
includes possible changes in processes. These form a loop that indicates ongoing
operations for risk management.
Even though risk management processes are advanced, companies face various
challenges when sustainability risks are managed. Supply chains are long and complex
which hampers supply chain management from the sustainability point of view.
Processes require constant monitoring and development to manage and minimize
sustainability risks. Companies are not yet at the point where they can avoid all
possible sustainability risks. On the other hand, it may take a long time to reach this
point, as stakeholder requirements continue to tighten which challenges companies’
operations. Therefore, companies are required to communicate with their stakeholders
about their expectations and based on expectations develop their sustainability
operations in supply chain management.
The three case companies from Finland are internationally recognized as sustainable
companies. According to the Corporate Knights list in 2020 Neste is third, UPM 24th,
and Kesko 99th most sustainable company in the world. (Corporate Knights, 2020)
According to the list, all of these companies have managed sustainability operations
well which is why these companies were chosen as the case companies. This master
thesis has examined how sustainable companies manage sustainability risks in their
93

supply chains. All of these companies are big public companies which affects the
resources they use. However, this has a downside. All of the case companies operate
in the international field, making sustainable supply chain management more complex
and thus more difficult. Therefore, it has been interesting to discover how
sustainability risks are managed in supply chains.

8.1 Research questions
The research questions of this master’s thesis were divided into three parts: theoretical,
empirical, and normative. The theoretical question was: “Which kinds of risks are there
in sustainable supply chain management?” The empirical part was divided into two
questions: “Are there differences between industries in how sustainability risks are
managed?” and “Which kinds of challenges are there to manage sustainability risks?”
and the normative question was: “: How can companies improve their sustainability
risk management in supply chains?”.
“Which kinds of risks are there in sustainable supply chain management?”
Companies face a vast number of various sustainability risks depending on their
industry. Sustainability-related risks are potentially occurring events that may provoke
harmful stakeholder reactions such as boycotts, and therefore it is important to try to
manage these. The difference between sustainability-related risks and ordinary risks is
that sustainability-related risks can trigger stakeholder reactions without causing
supply disruptions. Social sustainability risks include issues such as misconduct in
working conditions and compensation. Child and forced labor are seen among the most
severe social risks. The risks of social sustainability are similar for all companies
whereas environmental risks are more industry-specific. Environmental accidents,
pollution, energy consumption, and product waste are among endogenous
environmental risks. Natural disasters and water scarcity include exogenous
environmental risks. The risks companies face depend on the industry they operate in.
For instance, some companies operate in areas where natural disasters are more likely
compared to other areas. Another example is related to the workforce utilized in
manufacturing. Some industries are located in areas where misconducts are more likely
to occur. Therefore, sustainability risks in supply chains differ depending on the

94

industry which requires companies to make accurate assessments and analyze to
identify the most likely risks to operate according to these analyzes.
“Are there differences between industries in how sustainability risks are managed?”
The three case companies have clear processes of how sustainability risks are managed
in their supply chains. The sustainability risk management framework is followed by
all three companies. Therefore, no clear differences were found in how sustainability
risks are managed in the case companies. Stakeholders are utilized in risk identification
and assessment processes, there is same kind of management tools such as
certifications, code of conducts, and supplier development processes. In all three
companies risks are monitored to obtain up-to-date information about risks.
Nonetheless, although the case companies operate in various industries, the
management processes are similar.
“Which kinds of challenges are there to manage sustainability risks?”
Even though the case companies have invested in management of sustainability risks
in their supply chains, misconducts occur. Modern-day supply chains are long and
complex which challenges the companies. Avoiding all sustainability risks in supply
chains is practically impossible. Nonetheless, companies aim to manage sustainability
risks and through it avoid them or at least minimize possible consequences. More and
more resources are spent to increase possibilities to avoid sustainability risks. The case
companies have processes that are followed but still, sustainability misconducts occur
in their supply chain which causes sustainability risks. Lack of influence on suppliers
is seen as one of the factors which can cause risks. For instance, requirements can be
indistinct for sub-suppliers even when buying companies have clear requirements for
their suppliers. If requirements are indistinct, there are greater chances that
misconducts occur. Therefore, the case companies have invested in closer
relationships with suppliers to inform about the requirements and develop suppliers’
capabilities.

95

“How can companies improve their sustainability risk management in supply chains?”
The case companies improve sustainability risk management operations constantly.
Improvement operations are implemented inside the companies but also external
partners are taken into account. In order to be able to improve sustainability risk
management, companies are required to collaborate with other actors. For instance,
competitors can have cooperation projects to manage sustainability risks. A joint list
of suppliers that have violated sustainability requirements could be one option. With
help of a joint list, companies could have the same information about incapable
suppliers which would help to avoid sustainability risks. At the same time, the
reputation of the industry could be improved, which would help companies in the long
run. Therefore, increasing cooperation with various actors can be one option when
companies pursue improvements in sustainability risk management. Besides,
cooperation can help the buyer companies to improve their own operations which may
impact sustainability measures.

8.1 Limitations and future research
This master’s thesis has focused only on environmental and social sustainability issues
in supply chain management. Economical dimension is not taken into account. If
economical dimension would be considered it would enable to obtain a holistic point
of view of sustainability risk management. Therefore, in the future it would be
interesting to combine all three aspects of sustainability in sustainability risk
management in supply chains. With help of this, researchers could obtain information
if there are some links between the dimensions and how these links affect sustainability
practices in risk management practices. In addition, the master’s thesis focused on
companies that are generally accepted as sustainable companies. Besides, the case
companies are Finnish public companies with enormous resources. Therefore, in the
future research can focus on smaller companies with significantly fewer resources. It
would be interesting to see whether there are differences between large and smaller
companies in how sustainability-related risks are managed in supply chains. For
instance, if resources have significant differences, do the company’s values affect
sustainability operations. In addition, it could be useful to research companies from
different countries. This would enable to obtain information if there are significant

96

differences in sustainability practices between countries and what are the reasons
behind differences.

8.2Chapter summary
The theoretical question was: ““Which kinds of risks are there in sustainable supply
chain management?” Companies face a large number of different sustainability risks.
Sustainability risks might provoke stakeholder reactions which affect companies
negatively. Misconducts in working conditions and compensation, and child and
forced labor are seen as social sustainability risks. Energy consumption and natural
disasters are among environmental risks. The social sustainability risks are similar for
all companies whereas environmental risks are more industry-specific. The two
empirical questions were: “Are there differences between industries in how
sustainability risks are managed?” and “Which kinds of challenges are there to
manage sustainability risks?” The results show that the three case companies have
similar risk management processes when sustainability risks are managed in supply
chains. No clear differences were found. The case companies have vast resources
which enable them to manage sustainability issues in their supply chains. However,
they face sustainability risks in their supply chains. Avoiding all sustainability risks in
supply chains is practically impossible, as the misconducts prove. Lack of influence
on suppliers is seen as one of the challenges companies face in sustainability risk
management in supply chains. With help of closer collaboration with suppliers these
challenges are tried to be managed. However, collaboration with suppliers requires
vast resources and it is not always possible. The normative question was: “How can
companies improve their sustainability risk management in supply chains?”
Collaboration between various partners is seen as the key to improve sustainability
risk management in supply chains. Collaboration can consider supplier collaboration
but also collaboration between competitors. For instance, competitors can share
supplier information and thus avoid suppliers which have negative reputation. This can
improve reputation of an industry as well.
In addition, this chapter considered discussion about limitation of the thesis and future
research. First limitation of the thesis is that only environmental and social
sustainability dimensions are considered. Economic dimension is not taken into
97

account. If economic dimension would be considered, there could be a more holistic
point of view on sustainability risk management in supply chain. Another limitation is
that only public companies from Finland are considered. Because the case companies
are public companies they have enormous resources. Some smaller companies do not
have same resources. Therefore, it would be interesting to see if there are differences
between bigger and smaller companies. In addition, it could interesting to see if there
are differences between companies that come from various countries.

9. Summary in Swedish
9.1Introduktion
Vikten av hållbarhet inom företagsverksamhet har ökat på senaste tiden. Intressenter
kräver mera av företagen och därför måste de göra sina egna processer hållbarare. I
och med att hållbarheten har blivit viktigare, har mängden av olika hållbarhetsrisker
också ökat. Om risken uppstår kan intressenterna reagera kraftfullt. Intressenterna är
allt mer medvetna om hållbarhetsdimensioner, vilket påverkar företagen.
Intressenternas respons mot hållbarhetsbrott kan ha allvarliga konsekvenser för
företagen. Hållbarhetsrisker i leverantörskedjor kan skada företagen på olika sätt.
Upprätthållandet av företagets goda rykte ses som en av de starkaste drivkrafterna för
att genomföra och upprätthålla hållbar hantering av leverantörskedjor. Negativ
medieuppmärksamhet och bojkotter kan skada företagets rykte och ha en negativ
påverkan på företagets intäkter. (Hoejmose et al., 2014)
Samtidigt

som

hållbarhet

har

blivit

allt

viktigare,

har

betydelsen

av

leverantörskedjehantering ökat. Leverantörskedjorna har blivit allt mer komplicerade
och längre, vilket gör det svårare att hantera dem. En utmaning är att mängden av risker
har ökat, vilket också utgör en del av själva hållbarhetsriskerna. Till exempel
förhållandena på arbetsplatsen och olika miljöincidenter anses vara möjliga
riskfaktorer inom leverantörskedjor. Om dessa riskfaktorer förverkligas, kommer det
att orsaka problem för företagen. Därför behöver alla företag hantera deras
hållbarhetsrisker

inom

leverantörskedjorna.

Hållbarhetsriskhantering

i

leverantörskedjor är en kombination av tre åtgärder: hantering av leverantörskedjor,
hållbarhetshantering och riskhantering. Att hantera hållbarhetsrelaterade risker i
leverantörskedjor innebär att alla de tre hållbarhetskategorierna tas i beaktande i ett
företag. (Valinejad & Rahmani, 2018)
Den

här

magisteravhandlingen

handlar

om

hur

finska

företag

hanterar

hållbarhetsriskser inom leverantörskedjor. Ämnet har blivit allt viktigare eftersom
olika intressenter är intresserade av hållbarhet och agerar kraftfullt om
hållbarhetsproblem uppstår. Avhandlingen är begränsad så att endast miljömässig och
social hållbarhet beaktas. På grund av UNDPs definition (UNDP sustainable
procurement) kan hållbar upphandling definieras som en upphandling som har den
99

lägsta miljöpåverkan och det positivaste sociala resultatet. Eftersom denna definition
endast

betonar

miljömässiga

och

sociala

dimensioner,

fokuserar

denna

magisteravhandling endast på dessa två dimensioner. Magisteravhandlingen är en
kvalitativ fallstudie där tre finska företag undersöks. Fallföretagen är Kesko, Neste och
UPM. Företagen har valts på grund av deras framgång inom hållbarhetsarbete. De tre
företagen finns på Corporate Knights 100 Global där de 100 mest hållbara företagen
är listade.
Denna magisteravhandling strävar efter att besvara sammanlagt fyra forskningsfrågor.
Den teoretiska frågan är: ” Vilka typer av risker finns i hållbar hantering av
leverantörskedjor?”. De två empiriska frågorna är: ”Vilka utmaningar finns för att
hantera hållbarhetsrisker?” och ” Finns det skillnader mellan branscher i hur
hållbarhetsrisker hanteras?”. Den normativa frågan är: ” Hur kan företag förbättra sin
hållbarhetshantering i leverantörskedjor?”.

9.2 Litteraturöversikt
Företag anses ansvariga för sina produkter och tjänster, även om dessa skulle vara
utom företagets direkta kontroll för den största delen av produkternas och tjänsternas
livstid (Savitz 2013). Därför är hantering av leverantörskedjorna och särskilt hållbar
leverantörskedjehantering ett utmärkt tillfälle för att ta hänsyn till hållbarhet i
praktiken. Leverantörskedjor är komplexa enheter eftersom det finns ett stort antal
olika

leverantörskedjehanteringen ses effektivitet, aktualitet och stabilitet som viktiga
prestandamätningar. När hållbarhetsdimensionen beaktas finns det ett ökat antal
faktorer som företag bör beakta. Till exempel bör arbetarrättigheter och koldioxidutsläpp beaktas när leverantörskedjor hanteras på ett hållbart sätt. Om
hållbarhetsdimensionerna inte beaktas, finns det en stor risk att företagets varumärke
och därmed också rykte undergrävs.
Leverantörskedjorna står inför olika risker. Dessa oregelbundna och oförutsedda
händelser kan ha en negativ påverkan på leverantörskedjorna. En risk kan definieras
som en oförutsägbar händelse i en leverantörskedja som kan leda till negativa
konsekvenser. (Hajmohammad & Vachon, 2016). Till exempel bojkotter och
100

värdeförsämring kan vara konsekvenser som kan bli följden av leverantörskedjerisker.
Hållbarhetsrelaterade leverantörskedjerisker är en ökad sårbarhet i en kedja på grund
av de negativa effekterna av inköp på ekonomisk, social och miljömässig hållbarhet.

leverantörskedjerisk är att hållbarhetsrelaterade risker kan utlösa flera allvarliga
intressentreaktioner som

kan påverka företaget

negativt

utan att

orsaka

leveransstörningar. Hållbarhetsrisker påverkar inte endast leveransverksamheten, utan
dessutom företagets övergripande presentation. När hållbarhetsrisker hanteras har
företagen bättre möjligheter att förbättra den övergripande presentationen och undvika
de ekonomiska förlusterna som intressenternas reaktioner kan orsaka.

9.3 Hållbarhetsriskhantering
Hållbar

leverantörskedjehantering

är

en

bredare

definition

av

leverantörskedjehantering. Inom hållbar leverantörskedjehantering tas de tre
hållbarhetsdimensionerna i beaktande när leverantörskedjorna hanteras. Målet är att
minska de negativa effekterna riskerna kan ha. Dagens leverantörskedjor är långa och
komplexa, vilket utmanar företagens möjligheter att hantera hållbarhetsfrågor i sina
leverantörskedjor. Särskilt sociala och miljömässiga problem beaktas när
leverantörskedjor hanteras hållbart. Olika arbetsutmaningar, såsom barn och
tvångsarbete, betonas ur social hållbarhetssynpunkt. Miljömässig hållbarhet består av
att minska föroreningar och avfall samt energibesparingar i leverantörskedjor. Vikten
av hållbar hantering av leverantörskedjor har ökat, vilket är orsaken till varför företag
anses vara fullt ansvariga för sina produkter och tjänster även om dessa skulle
tillbringa större delen av sin livstid utanför företagens direkta kontroll. (Savitz 2013)
Företag får internt och externt tryck för att möta vissa hållbarhetsnivåer i sin
verksamhet. Därför har hållbar leverantörskedjehantering

inte bara en viktig del i

företagens leverantörskedjehantering utan också i deras hela verksamheten.
Leverantörskedjehantering gör det möjligt att uppnå fördelar, till exempel ökad
effektivitet och kostnadsbesparingar, men dessutom finns det risker som kan skada
företag. Vanliga risker i leverantörskedjan kan vara oförutsägbara händelser som kan
få negativa konsekvenser för en leverantörskedja och dess medlemmar. Resultaten av
riskerna i leverantörskedjan kan vara oförmåga att möta kundernas efterfrågan eller
101

till och med orsaka hot mot kundernas liv och säkerhet. Dagens affärsmiljö har
påverkat leverantörskedjorna. Globaliseringen och ökad konkurrens har förlängt
leverantörskedjorna, vilket har påverkat komplexiteten i leverantörskedjorna. Därför
har företagen alltmer uppmärksammat hanteringen av risker i leverantörskedjan. Det
finns risker, vilka kan orsaka skadliga reaktioner från intressenterna och därmed skada
företag. Vanliga risker i leverantörskedjan kan orsaka leveransstörningar medan
hållbarhetsrisker påverkar intressenternas åsikter negativt.
För att kunna hantera hållbarhetsrisker behöver företagen olika processer.
Hållbarhetshantering

i

leverantörskedjor

kräver

omfattande

aktiviteter.

I

magisteravhandlingen presenteras en modell som kan användas när hållbarhetsrisker
hanteras. Modellen är en femfasram som den empiriska analysen bygger på. Faserna
är riskidentifiering, riskbedömning, riskanalys, riskbehandling samt riskövervakning
och kontroll.
Riskidentifiering syftar till att hitta faktorer som kan skada företagens
leverantörskedjor. Olika risker kan grupperas i en grupp när risker identifieras. Efter
att riskerna är grupperade är det lättare att fördela vilka typer av processer för
leverantörskedjehantering som är relevanta för varje risk. (Rangel et al., 2014) Syftet
med att identifiera riskerna är att ha en profil för var och en av de risker som har
upptäcks. När olika risker identifieras är det viktigt att företag förstår vilka
hållbarhetsrelaterade risker som är viktiga för deras intressenter (Maignan et al., 2002).
Att identifiera alla risker är dock utmanande eftersom företagen står inför ett stort antal
olika utmaningar. Det är omöjligt att identifiera dem alla. Därför är det viktigt att
företag bedömer olika risker som har hittats.
Riskbedömning är modellens andra fas. De identifierade riskerna bedöms för att
fastställa de mest kritiska riskerna. Riskbedömning gör det möjligt för företag att
fokusera på de mest kritiska riskerna och genom detta kan de hanteras bättre. Genom
att kategorisera, bedöma och utvärdera de identifierade de riskerna kan företag också
uppfatta hur riskerna påverkar företag. Bedömning och utvärdering kan genomföras
med hjälp av olika kriterier som potentiella förluster, sannolikhet, påverkan,
konsekvenser och värsta scenarier. (Manuj & Menzer, 2008) Vid bedömning av risker
är det användbart att se om det finns positiva samband mellan två riskfaktorer. Detta
102

möjliggör behandling av flera risker samtidigt. Miljö- och ekonomirelaterade faktorer
samt sociala och ekonomiskt relaterade faktorer tycks ha en positiv korrelation, medan
sociala och miljömässiga inte har det. Till exempel barnarbetskraft korrelerar med
mutor och finansiella kriser. (Giannakis and Papadopoulus, 2016) Riskanalys är en
väsentlig del av ramverket.
I modellens fjärde fas diskuteras olika behandlingsinsatser. Riskbehandling i
riskhantering handlar om att minska eller eliminera riskfaktorer. Efter att riskerna har
identifierats, bedömts och analyserats måste företagen erkänna vilka potentiella
effekter det kan ha om riskerna förverkligas. Riskhanteringsstrategier syftar till att
minska sannolikheten för förluster med riskhändelser (Manuj & Mentezer,
2008).

Riskhantering av leverantörskedjor har en betydande inverkan på

leverantörskedjans hållbarhet. Riskhantering gör det möjligt att påverka alla tre
hållbarhetsdimensioner

i

leverantörskedjor.

Det

finns

ett

stort

antal

behandlingsfaktorer som underlättar hanteringen av hållbarhetsrisker inom hantering
av leverantörskedjor. Exempelvis är uppförandekod, certifikat, utvärdering och urval
av leverantörer samt leverantörsutveckling och samarbete bland de mest använda
metoderna. (Multaharju et al.,2016) Med hjälp av dessa verktyg har företag bättre
möjligheter att hantera hållbarhetsrisker och minimera negativa effekter som dessa
risker kan orsaka.
Den sista fasen i modellen är riskövervakning och kontroll. Leverantörernas
utvärderingsverksamhet

fortsätter

efter

att

kontrakt

har

ingåtts.

Olika

undersökningsverktyg, årliga självbedömningar och utvärderingar på plats är vanliga
metoder vid bedömning av leverantörer. Köparföretag återkommer ofta till
leverantörer baserat på leverantörernas betyg. När leverantörer får en hög poäng
genomförs revisioner sällan medan leverantörer med låga poäng granskas oftare. Efter
granskningar får leverantörer feedback och förbättringsriktlinjer för framtiden.
(Adesanya et al., 2020) När leverantörer bedöms är det lättare att identifiera specifika
punkter som behöver förbättras senare. Det bevisar att hela processen är ett kretslopp
och för att uppnå bästa möjliga resultat från leverantörskedjehantering måste
fokusföretag ständigt förbättra sina leverantörskedjor. Både partners, köparföretag och
deras leverantörer kan lära sig under sitt partnerskap och utveckla processer för ett mer

103

hållbart sätt. Dessutom kan nya risker som kräver uppmärksamhet dyka upp, vilket gör
det viktigt att hanteringsprocessen är konstant.

9.4 Empiri
Magisteravhandlingen

är

en

kvalitativ

fallstudie.

Hållbar

riskhantering

i

leverantörskedjahantering är en process där olika faser övervägs noga. Det är en
process som företag följer konsekvent för att få det att fungera effektivt. Syftet med
avhandlingen är att skapa en förståelse av hur hållbarhetsrisker hanteras i
leverantörskedjor. För att nå ett resultat undersöks fallföretagens processer.
Denna magisteravhandling är en jämförande fallstudie. I en jämförande fallstudie
jämförs två eller flera fall systematiskt. För att kunna jämföra hållbarhetshantering i
leverantörskedjor valdes tre finska fallföretag. Det jämförande perspektivet framträder
när fallbolagen verkar i olika branscher, så att de kan hitta likheter och skillnader
mellan branscher. Fallföretagen och deras metoder för hantering av hållbarhetsrisker i
leverantörskedjor diskuteras. Fallföretagen har valts utifrån 2020 Global 100
rankningen som listar de 100 mest hållbara företagen i världen. När fallföretagen
verkar i olika branscher möjliggör det vissa generaliseringar. Var och en av
ärendeföretagen diskuteras genom ramverket, vilket har presenterats tidigare. När
fallföretagen analyseras med dessa stadier möjliggör det att få information om hur
hållbarhetsrelaterad risk hanteras. Senare är det lättare att jämföra fallföretagen och
dessutom praktiska åtgärder med tidigare litteratur. I detta kapitel behandlas dock
hållbarhetsbrott i alla tre företagen. När oegentligheter beaktas är det möjligt att få en
mer objektiv syn på företag och deras handlingar. Det visar att företag har svårt att
hantera hållbarhetsrisker även om de skulle ha stora resurser.
Analysen av den empiriska delen bygger på sekundär dokumentation av fallföretagen.
Enligt Saunders et al., (2009) är fallstudier ofta baserade på sekundära data. Kvalitativ
forskning har lett till spridning av många metoder för datainsamling som försöker
förstå aktörer genom självproducerade texter (Hirsijärvi et al., 2007). I detta
examensarbete består de analyserade uppgifterna av fallföretagens data från
årsrapporter från 2019 och vid behov ytterligare information från deras hemsidor för
att fördjupa kunskapen. Årsrapporter valdes eftersom de följer en formell struktur som
104

underlättar inhämtning av information. Årsrapporter informerar utförligt om företagets
resultat. Förutom årsrapporter används företagens webbsidor för att få mer detaljerad
information om de olika aspekter som nämns snävt i årsrapporter. Ändå är
användningen av sekundär dokumentation inte helt problemfri. När sekundär
dokumentation används måste den ses kritiskt. (Hirsijärvi et al., 2007; Kananen, 2017;
Saaranen-Kauppinen och Puusniekka, 2006) Företagens rapporter kan vara subjektiva
vilket gör det svårare att få objektiva resultat. Därför kommer den empiriska studien
att överväga olika perspektiv jämfört med fallföretagens material. Data om
hållbarhetsbrott i företagens leverantörskedjor samlas in från olika källor för att vidga
perspektivet för det undersökta ämnet. I två fall samlas ytterligare data in från
Finnwatch, som är en icke-statlig organisation som studerar verksamhetens globala
påverkan. Information från Friends of the Earth används för att få ett mer omfattande
perspektiv på ett av fallföretagen.

9.5 Resultat
Det sjätte kapitlet diskuterar likheterna mellan fallbolagen, vilket möjliggör en mer
övergripande syn på hållbarhetshanteringen i finska företag. De olika stadierna i
hållbarhetshanteringen diskuteras och fallföretagens ageranden jämförs. Resultaten
visar att fallföretagen har liknande hanteringsprocesser samt att de betonar vikten av
hållbarhetshantering i sina leverantörskedjor. Riskerna identifieras och intressenternas
åsikter används. Dessutom bedöms och analyseras de olika riskerna för att få
information om de mest kritiska hållbarhetsriskerna som bör beaktas. Alla fallbolag
använder liknande metoder i deras riskhantering, som till exempel uppförandekod,
certifikat, utvärdering och urval av leverantörer samt leverantörssamarbete och
utveckling. Dessutom har fallbolagen betonat vikten av att vara nära sina leverantörer
och andra intressenter, då det hjälper dem att få en bättre förståelse av deras ömsesidiga
mål. Den sista delen av ramverket handlar om riskövervakning. Fallföretagen
understryker betydelsen lyfter fram vikten av att övervaka leverantörernas
hållbarhetspraxis, eftersom det hjälper dem att försäkra att leverantörerna faktiskt
implementerar hållbarhetsreglerna samt att hållbarhetskraven och -kontrakten
uppfylls. Som tidigare nämnts har dock alla de tre fallbolagen begått hållbarhetsbrott,
vilket påvisar komplexiteten i leverantörskedjornas hållbara riskhantering. Företagen
måste ständigt förbättra och uppdatera sin praxis.
105

Företagen har både likheter och skillnader i deras hållbarhetsrisker. Särskilt de sociala
riskerna består av liknande faktorer. Sociala risker, så som barn- och tvångsarbete och
diskriminering samt berörs av företagen. Miljörisker är å andra sidan mer
branschspecifika, Neste betonar till exempel sjöolyckor, medan UPM talar om hållbar
skogsförvaltning och Kesko nämner hur vatten används i odlingen av deras produkter.
Inom riskidentifieringen kan man dra den slutsatsen att det finns några universella
hållbarhetsrisker som fallföretagen överväger, till exempel utnyttjandet av barn- och
tvångsarbete. Dessa risker kan dock vara svåra att lägga märke till på grund av
leverantörskedjornas längd, vilket är varför företagen ägnar särskild uppmärksamhet
åt dessa frågor.

9.6 Diskussion
Fallföretagen

följer

liknande

metoder

som

tidigare

litteratur

föreslår.

Hållbarhetshanteringsprocesser används i hantering av leverantörskedjor för att
hantera hållbarhetsrisker. Å andra sidan det har varit kritik mot företagens notering av
hållbarhet. Eftersom företag kan definiera hållbarhet själva kan resultaten vara
subjektiva och därför kan extern publik ha svårt att få objektiv information. En kolumn
av Pekka Seppänen diskuterar hur det är möjligt att ha Neste och UPM på en
hållbarhetslista. Neste har en stor del av sin verksamhet inom att sälja fossila bränslen
och UPM:s verksamhet bygger på avverkning av sko, vilket reducerar kolsänkor.
Därför är det tveksamt hur båda dessa företag kan vara bland de mest hållbara
företagen i världen. När objektiv information inte är tillgänglig, är det mer utmanande
för externa partner att analysera företagens hållbarhetsmetoder. Det är dock viktigt att
vissa externa aktörer såsom icke-statliga organisationer analyserar företag och deras
hållbarhetsmetoder kritiskt och också publicerar sina analyser. Detta underlättar att få
en mer transparent helhetssyn på företag och deras hållbarhetsmetoder. När extern
publik är mer medveten om hållbarhetsfrågor kan det sätta press på företag att göra
sina leverantörskedjor ännu hållbarare.

106

9.7 Slutsats
Hållbarhetsriskernas betydelse bland riskerna i leverantörskedjor har ökat. Företag
investerar i att hantera hållbarhetsrelaterade risker mer effektivt för att undvika
allvarliga konsekvenser som dessa kan orsaka. För att bli framgångsrika behöver
företag samarbete med externa intressenter, till exempel kunder och leverantörer.
Företag har tydliga ramar för att hantera hållbarhetsrelaterade risker i
leverantörskedjor. Riskidentifiering, bedömning och analys ingår i processen. Dessa
aktiviteter följs av riskbehandling som består av olika verktyg som används för att
hantera risker. Den sista fasen av hanteringsprocessen är riskövervakning som
inkluderar möjliga förändringar i processer. Dessa bildar en slinga som indikerar
pågående verksamhet för riskhantering.
Även om riskhanteringsprocesser är avancerade står företag inför olika utmaningar när
hållbarhetsrisker hanteras. Leverantörskedjor är långa och komplexa vilket försvårar
hantering av leverantörskedjor ur hållbarhetssynpunkt. Processer kräver konstant
övervakning och utveckling för att hantera och minimera hållbarhetsrisker. Företag
kan ännu inte undvika alla möjliga hållbarhetsrisker. Å andra sidan kan det ta lång tid
att nå denna punkt, eftersom kraven på intressenter fortsätter att skärpas, vilket
utmanar företagens verksamhet. Därför måste företagen kommunicera med sina
intressenter om sina förväntningar och utifrån förväntningar utveckla sin
hållbarhetsverksamhet inom leverantörskedjehantering.
Denna magisteravhandling har fyra forskningsfrågor. Den teoretiska frågan: ”Vilka
typer av risker finns det i hållbar hantering av leverantörskedjor?” Den empiriska
delen delades in i två frågor: "Finns det skillnader mellan branscher i hur
hållbarhetsrisker hanteras?" och "Vilka utmaningar finns för att hantera
hållbarhetsrisker?" och den normativa frågan var: ”Hur kan företag förbättra sin
hållbarhetshantering i leverantörskedjor?”.

107

"Vilka typer av risker finns det i hållbar hantering av leverantörskedjor?"
Företag står inför ett stort antal olika hållbarhetsrisker beroende på branschen.
Hållbarhetsrelaterade risker är potentiellt inträffade händelser som kan framkalla
skadliga intressentreaktioner som bojkotter, och därför är det viktigt att försöka hantera
dessa risker. Skillnaden mellan hållbarhetsrelaterade risker i leverantörskedjor och
vanliga leverantörskedjarisker är att hållbarhetsrelaterade risker kan utlösa
intressentreaktioner utan att orsaka leveransstörningar. Sociala hållbarhetsrisker
inkluderar frågor såsom oegentligheter i arbetsförhållanden och ersättning. Barn- och
tvångsarbete ses bland de allvarligaste sociala riskerna. Riskerna med social hållbarhet
är lika för alla företag medan miljöriskerna är mer branschspecifika. Miljöolyckor,
föroreningar, energiförbrukning och produktavfall hör till endogena miljörisker,
exogena miljörisker inkluderar naturkatastrofer och vattenbrist. Riskerna som företag
står inför beror på branschen de verkar i. Till exempel vissa företag verkar i områden
där naturkatastrofer är mer sannolika jämfört med andra områden. Ett annat exempel
är relaterat till arbetskraften som används vid tillverkning. Vissa industrier är belägna
i områden där det är mer sannolikt att det uppstår missförhållanden. Därför varierar
hållbarhetsriskerna i leverantörskedjorna beroende på branschen vilket kräver att
företagen gör noggranna bedömningar och analyser för att identifiera de mest
sannolika riskerna för att fungera enligt dessa analyser.
"Finns det skillnader mellan branscher i hur hållbarhetsrisker hanteras?"
De tre fallbolagen har tydliga processer för hur hållbarhetsrisker hanteras i deras
leverantörskedjor. Ramverket för hållbarhetshantering följs av alla tre företagen.
Därför hittades inga tydliga skillnader i hur hållbarhetsrisker hanteras i fallbolagen.
Intressenter används i riskidentifierings- och utvärderingsprocesser, det finns samma
slags hanteringsverktyg som certifieringar, uppförandekod och processer för
leverantörsutveckling. I alla tre företagen övervakas riskerna för att få aktuell
information om riskerna. Trots att fallföretagen verkar inom olika branscher är
hanteringsprocesserna likartade.

108

"Vilka typer av utmaningar finns det för att hantera hållbarhetsrisker?"
Trots att företagen har investerat i hantering av hållbarhetsrisker i sina
leverantörskedjor, uppstår missförhållanden. Moderna leverantörskedjor är långa och
komplexa vilket utmanar företagen. Att undvika alla hållbarhetsrisker i
leverantörskedjor är praktiskt taget omöjligt. Ändå strävar företagen efter att hantera
hållbarhetsrisker och genom det undvika dem eller åtminstone minimera eventuella
konsekvenser. Fler och fler resurser används för att öka möjligheterna att undvika
hållbarhetsrisker. Fallföretagen har processer som följs men ändå uppstår
hållbarhetsbrott i deras leverantörskedjor som orsakar hållbarhetsrisker. Bristande
inflytande på leverantörer ses som en av de faktorer som kan orsaka risker. Till
exempel krav kan vara otydliga för underleverantörer även när de köpande företagen
har tydliga krav på sina leverantörer. Om kraven är otydliga finns det större risk att
oegentligheter uppstår. Därför har fallföretagen investerat i närmare relationer med
leverantörer för att informera om kraven och utveckla leverantörernas kapacitet.
"Hur kan företag förbättra sina hållbarhetshanteringar i leverantörskedjor?"
Fallbolagen

förbättrar

hållbarhetshanteringsverksamheten

beständigt.

Förbättringsåtgärder genomförs inom företagen men även externa partners beaktas.
För att kunna förbättra hållbarhetshanteringen krävs det att företag samarbetar med
andra aktörer. Konkurrenter kan till exempel ha samarbetsprojekt för att hantera
hållbarhetsrisker. En gemensam lista över leverantörer som har brutit mot
hållbarhetskrav kan vara ett alternativ. Med hjälp av en gemensam lista kan företag ha
samma information om ohållbara leverantörer, vilket skulle hjälpa till att undvika
hållbarhetsrisker. Samtidigt kunde branschens rykte förbättras, vilket skulle hjälpa
företag i längden. Därför kan ett ökat samarbete med olika aktörer vara ett alternativ
när företag fortsätter att förbättra hållbarhetshanteringen. Dessutom kan samarbete
hjälpa köparföretagen att förbättra sin egen verksamhet som kan påverka
hållbarhetsåtgärder.
Denna magisteravhandling har endast fokuserat på miljö- och sociala hållbarhetsrisker
inom hantering av leverantörskedjor. Den ekonomiska dimensionen beaktas inte. Om
en ekonomisk dimension skulle övervägas skulle det möjliggöra att få en helhetssyn
109

på hållbarhetshantering. Därför skulle det i framtiden vara intressant att kombinera alla
tre aspekterna av hållbarhet inom hållbarhetshantering i leverantörskedjor. Med hjälp
av detta kan forskare få information om det finns några kopplingar mellan
dimensionerna

och

hur

dessa

länkar

påverkar

hållbarhetspraxis

i

riskhanteringsmetoder. Dessutom fokuserade magisteravhandlingen på företag som
allmänt accepteras som hållbara företag och fallbolagen är finska offentliga företag
med enorma resurser. Därför kan forskningen i framtiden fokusera på mindre företag
med betydligt färre resurser. Det skulle vara intressant att se om det finns skillnader
mellan stora och mindre företag i hur hållbarhetsrelaterade risker hanteras i
leverantörskedjor. Till exempel, om resurser har betydande skillnader, påverkar
företagets värderingar hållbarhetsverksamheten. Dessutom kan det vara användbart att
undersöka företag från olika länder. Detta skulle göra det möjligt att få information om
det finns betydande skillnader i hållbarhetspraxis mellan länder och vad som är
orsakerna bakom skillnaderna.
