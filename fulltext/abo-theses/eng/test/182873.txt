Dust in kraft recovery boilers is primarily formed when compounds originating from
sulphur and sodium released during black liquor combustion react with each other and
the surrounding gases. Sulphur is released through several reactions during
devolatilization. Sodium is released during char burning as a product from the reduction
of sodium carbonate by char carbon.
The objective of this thesis was to study how the in-flight time of the black liquor droplets
affects the release of sodium and sulphur and, thus, the formation of dust in kraft recovery
boilers. The maximum capacity of recovery boilers has steadily increased since the end
of the 1990s, and larger boilers have a higher liquor burner elevation, which supposedly
results in a longer in-flight time of the black liquor droplets. However, the in-flight time
of black liquor droplets is affected by furnace size, dry solids content of the liquor, and
boiler load, along with the burner elevation. No field studies about the effect of in-flight
time on dust and its composition have been published, and the in-flight time of the black
liquor droplets has not been measured in real life situations. This contributes to the large
uncertainty regarding the outcome of this study and the credibility of the release
predictions.
Sulphur and sodium release, and the formation of dust compounds, were studied in
literature, and a model was created to predict the amount of dust and its composition in
recovery boilers. The model forecasts that the sodium carbonate content in the dust
increases with increasing sodium release when no significant amounts of SO2 are emitted.
The predictions indicate that the sodium release increases with a longer in-flight time at

constant temperature. A higher furnace temperature, however, has the same effect on the
sodium release.
The release predictions for sulphur seem realistic, although a more accurate temperature
model for the black liquor particle and the surrounding gas phase would be needed. For
sodium, the model heavily overestimates the release at high temperatures, and the release
increases too rapidly as the temperature rises. In the model, it is possible to manually set
the sodium and sulphur release to a certain value by changing the temperature. The model
then predicts the dust composition and amount based on these release factors.

Introduction

1 Introduction
The Tomlinson kraft recovery boiler was introduced and patented in the early 1930s and
is today the dominating technology in use in pulp mills. In Finland, the concept was
introduced in 1937 when the first kraft recovery boilers, with the capacity 120 tDS/d,
were started up. By 2019, 55 kraft recovery boilers had been built in Finland, 17 of which
are still in operation (Salmenoja, 2019).
Before the 1960s, the capacity of all existing recovery boilers was below 400 tDS/d. In
the 1990s, 3,000 tDS/d was reached. This capacity was considered the maximum, since
the belief was that there would not be sufficient mixing in the furnace if the capacity was
further increased. However, CFD simulations (computational fluid dynamics) showed
otherwise, and in 2004 the world’s at that time largest recovery boiler, with the capacity
4,450 tDS/d, was started up. In 2016, the recovery boiler at PT. OKI Pulp & Paper mill
in Indonesia, with the capacity 12,000 tDS/d, started operating and became the largest
recovery boiler built so far. The steady increase in boiler capacity is shown in Figure 1
(Salmenoja, 2019). A higher capacity tends to require larger furnaces and a higher
placement of the liquor burners (Vakkilainen, 2005). A higher placement of the burners
supposedly prolongs the in-flight time.

Figure 1. Increase in boiler capacity from 1950 to 2020 (Salmenoja, 2019).

Other trends in the recovery boiler technology are the increase in the dry solids (DS)
content in the black liquor and the increase in the hearth heat release rate (HHRR)
(Salmenoja, 2019). The DS content has risen from about 50% in the 1950s to about 65%
in the 1960s, to finally reach 80-85% in modern kraft recovery boilers. As the DS content
reached above 75%, emissions of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and sulphur dioxide (SO2)

Introduction

from the kraft recovery boilers were close to eliminated (Vakkilainen, 2005). The amount
of dust entering the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) is predicted to increase with increased
HHRR, as shown in Figure 2 (ANDRITZ, 2021).

Figure 2. Recovery boiler dust load as a function of HHRR (ANDRITZ, 2021).

A higher furnace temperature in the recovery boiler seems to favour an increased release
of sodium (Na) compared to sulphur (S), and the increased excess sodium leads to a larger
carbonate (CO3) content in the ESP dust (Hupa, 1997). Apart from sodium sulphate
(Na2SO4) and carbonate (Na2CO3), dust also contains small amounts of potassium (K)
salts and sodium chloride (NaCl) (Tran, 1997).
The aim of this thesis was to determine how the in-flight time of black liquor droplets
affects the amount and composition of dust, and to predict the formation of dust in
recovery boilers. Observations from large recovery boilers with high heat load and high
DS content indicate that there on the average is more carbonate in the precipitator ash
compared to smaller boilers. This points towards that the release ratio of sodium to
sulphur is different when the HHRR and DS content are higher (ANDRITZ, 2021).
In Chapter 2 the kraft recovery boiler is introduced, followed by a description of black
liquor and its combustion in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4, the available literature on sulphur
and sodium release is presented along with release mechanisms and release expressions.
The formation of dust particles is briefly described in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, a
description of the created dust formation model is provided, and the results are presented
and discussed in Chapter 7 and 8.

2.1 Introduction to the kraft recovery boiler
The kraft recovery boiler has two purposes in a pulp mill: to recover the spent pulping
chemicals and to produce steam that is used for power production from the organic part
of the black liquor. These two parallel functions make the design more complex and
different from other kinds of boilers (Adams, 1997).
A side view of the kraft recovery boiler at PT. OKI Pulp & Paper mill in Indonesia is
presented in Figure 3. The different parts of the boiler are indicated with numbers and
explained in Table 1. The recovery boiler can roughly be divided into the furnace section
and the convective heat transfer section, which are traditionally separated at the bullnose
(Adams, 1997), but for instance at OKI, some superheaters directly face the furnace and
are exposed to radiative heat as well as convective heat.

Working principles of the kraft recovery boiler

The kraft pulping process has been described by for instance Tran and Vakkilainen
(2008). In the process, a mixture of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulphide
(Na2S) called white liquor is used to separate the fibres in the wood from the rest of the
organic matter. The spent pulping chemicals form weak black liquor together with the
dissolved organics from the pulping process, and this weak black liquor is washed from
the pulp to be used in the kraft recovery cycle (Tran & Vakkilainen, 2008). Weak black
liquor contains about 15% dry solids, which means that the other 85% is water. To
decrease the water content before firing the black liquor into the recovery boiler, the weak
black liquor is processed in evaporators, where it is concentrated to about 65-85% DS
content (Adams, 1997). “High solids firing” or “high dry solids firing” refers to when a
liquor with more than 75% DS is fired in the boiler (Tran & Vakkilainen, 2008).
The black liquor undergoes drying, devolatilization and char burning. The remnants after
devolatilization are called char, which burns mostly on the char bed that covers the
furnace floor. The char bed consists of an active layer, about 15-20 cm deep, and a layer
of frozen smelt (Grace & Frederick, 1997). The furnace gas below the liquor burners is
deficient in oxygen, which allows the Na2SO4 in the black liquor particles to be reduced
to Na2S. It is of great importance that enough char carbon reaches the char bed, since the
carbon is needed in the reduction. Ideally all Na 2SO4 is reduced and all char carbon
oxidised to carbon monoxide (CO) or carbon dioxide (CO2) (Adams, 1997). It is
important that wet black liquor does not reach the char bed, since this decreases the char
bed temperature and might inhibit the burning (Adams, 1997).
The sodium carbonate in the char mostly remains unreacted, and forms smelt together
with Na2S and some small amounts of other components. The smelt flows down through
the char bed and is removed through smelt spouts in the furnace wall to be mixed with
water in the dissolving tank. This mixture is called green liquor. To recover NaOH, the
4

Johanna Brink

The kraft recovery boiler

green liquor is processed in the causticizing plant, where calcium oxide (CaO) reacts with
Na2CO3 to form NaOH and calcium carbonate (CaCO3). After the causticizing, the liquor
is separated from the CaCO 3 and returned to the pulping process. The CaCO 3, or lime
mud, is heated in a lime kiln so that the CaO is regenerated (Tran & Vakkilainen, 2008).
During devolatilization, when the organic matter is combusted, and during char burning,
when the gas compounds are fully oxidised, heat is released. Part of this heat is transferred
by radiation to the boiler walls that are constructed out of water-containing tubes. The
water starts to boil and rises inside the tubes. More heat is transferred from the flue gas
to the steam or the feed water in the heat transfer section of the boiler, mostly by
convection. Water is also evaporated in the boiler bank, and the produced steam is heated
to 400-500 °C in the superheaters. At the economizers, heat remaining in the flue gas is
used to pre-heat the feed water almost to its boiling point (Adams, 1997).
The superheated steam is used in a turbine to produce electricity, and the low-pressure
steam from the turbine outlet is used in various processes in the pulp mill (Adams, 1997).
The boiler efficiency can be described by its steam parameters: flow, temperature and
pressure. As an example, the steam outlet temperature at the OKI Pulp & Paper mill is
515 °C and the steam pressure 110 bar. Firing 12,000 tDS/d, the steam production in the
plant is 580 kg/s (Salmenoja, 2019).
The thermal efficiency of the recovery boiler is decreased by fly ash deposits forming on
the heat transfer surfaces. The fly ash originates from two different sources: carryover
and fume, which is evaporated alkali. Carryover consists of entrained black liquor
droplets with size ranging from 100 μm to 3 mm, and fragments from burning droplets
that are slightly smaller in size. Dust particles are formed as the alkali vapours condense
(Tran, 1997). The formation of dust is discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.
Carryover particles deposits mainly on the superheaters, while fume primarily condenses
and sticks to the heat transfer surfaces at the boiler bank and economizers once the flue
gas has cooled down. Dust collected in the ESP mostly consists of fume particles.
Deposits that fall or are knocked away by soot blowers from the boiler bank and the
economizers are collected in ash hoppers and mixed with black liquor in the mixing tanks
before the black liquor is fired into the furnace (Tran, 1997).
Air is usually fed into the recovery boiler at three main levels as primary, secondary and
tertiary air. Primary air is fed at about 1 m above the furnace floor, where it controls the
5

Johanna Brink

The kraft recovery boiler

shape of the char bed and keeps it off the furnace walls. Secondary air is fed at about 2 m
above the floor and is needed for oxidation of CO produced at the char bed and during
the combustion of pyrolysis gases. These two air levels contribute with 50-85% of the
total air. The tertiary air ports are situated above the liquor burners and ensure complete
combustion and mixing of the furnace gases (Adams, 1997).

2.1.2

Furnace temperature

Two parameters can be used to describe combustion in the recovery boiler furnace: The
hearth heat release rate (HHRR), which describes heat released per furnace floor area,
and adiabatic temperature (Tad), which is the theoretical maximum temperature in the
furnace that can be reached during combustion without any heat losses. Tad depends on
the heating value and DS content of the black liquor. A lower DS content means that
more water needs to be evaporated and, thus, consumes energy that otherwise could have
raised the furnace temperature (Välimäki, et al., 2010).
According to Välimäki et al. (2010), the lowest recommended value for maintaining
stable combustion is 2.5 MW/m 2 for HHRR and 1450 °C for Tad. For boilers in operation,
these values are expected to be higher. For instance, for a recovery boiler with the
capacity 4,700 tDS/d, firing a black liquor with 80% DS content and a higher heating
value (HHV) of 14 MJ/kg, the calculated T ad was 1738 °C, while HHRR was 3.08 MW/m2
(Välimäki, et al., 2010). The actual furnace temperature is lower than the adiabatic
temperature (Adams, 1997), and for instance, the temperature is around 1300-1400 °C
directly below the liquor burners the (Mikkanen, 2000). In Figure 4, the horizontally
averaged temperature profile in the furnace of an older recovery boiler model with a
vertical air system is shown. The main furnace processes are indicated as well. At the
bullnose, the temperature is approximately 1000 °C, while the maximum temperature
(1300 °C) is reached below the liquor burners.

The dry solids content in the black liquor is one of the factors affecting the temperature
in the furnace. In Figure 5, the calculated flame temperature (Tflame) is shown as a function
of the DS content in the black liquor. The main difference between Tad and Tflame is that
Tflame considers the heat transfer from the furnace gases to the water in the boiler walls.
The flame temperature increases with increasing dry solids content (Adams, 1997).

2.2 Black liquor firing
2.2.1

Black liquor burners and droplet size

Black liquor is fired into the recovery boiler with liquor burners. The number of liquor
burners varies with the recovery boiler size (Adams, 1997), and for instance at OKI, there
are as much as 30 liquor burners (ANDRITZ, 2021). The liquor burners are typically
placed at 5 to 9 m above the furnace floor (Vakkilainen, 2005).
The opening at the end of the liquor burner is called the nozzle. The most common nozzle
type is the splash plate nozzle, but sometimes swirl cone nozzles or beer can nozzles are
used (Vakkilainen, 2005). The nozzles produce a spray that consists of 0.5 to 5 mm
droplets (Adams, 1997), with an average droplet diameter of 2 to 3 mm (Vakkilainen,
2005). The black liquor droplet size affects both the in-flight time and the duration of the
different combustion stages, shown in data retrieved from a CFD simulation representing
the typical operation of a recovery boiler firing 5,300 tDS/d (Engblom, et al., 2018).
The working principle of a splash plate nozzle is shown in Figure 6. The black liquor is
fed through a pipe and bounces off a circular plate attached to the opening. This creates
a flat sheet of liquor that spreads out into the furnace (Karami, et al., 2013).

Figure 6. Splash plate nozzle (Karami, et al., 2013).

The black liquor is fed into the furnace at a temperature of 10 to 20 °C above its
atmospheric boiling point, which is around 120-135 °C depending on DS content
(Vakkilainen, 2005). This results in flashing of the black liquor. Flashing occurs when
the water contained in the black liquor rapidly forms steam, and this accelerates the flow
(Miikkulainen, et al., 2001) and increases the droplet velocity (Karami, et al., 2013).

The kraft recovery boiler

Violent flashing results in a fully shattered liquor sheet and small droplets that are easily
entrained (Karami, et al., 2013).

2.2.2

Black liquor droplet trajectories

In-flight time is defined as the time it takes for the black liquor droplets to reach the char
bed from the liquor burners. The in-flight time depends on, among other factors, droplet
diameter and on how much the droplets swell during combustion, which impacts the
droplet density. Droplets that swell to a larger extent are more easily entrained in the gas
flow. The same applies to droplets with a diameter smaller than 2 mm (Frederick & Hupa,
1997). Frederick and Hupa (1997) gave the value 1-2 seconds for the in-flight time.
In Figure 7, the flight paths of different sized droplets are presented. The first case
represents droplets that are completely entrained in the gas exiting the furnace due to
their small size. The second case applies to slightly larger droplets that are first entrained
because of swelling but that falls toward the char bed once char burning reduces the
particle size. The third case represents the optimal flight path, where the droplets reach
the char bed while still burning, contributing with char carbon to the char bed. The last
case shows droplets that are too big and that reach the char bed while still drying . This
can cause the bed temperature to decrease (Frederick & Hupa, 1997).

1997).

3.1 Black liquor as a fuel
Black liquor provided 12% of the total energy use in Finland in 2019 and was the third
largest source of energy after fossil fuels and nuclear power. A total of 46.2 TWh of
energy from black liquor and other liquors from pulp production was used. This made up
almost 33% of all renewable energy used in Finland in 2019 (LUKE, 2020).
Compared to other fuels, black liquor has a high water content of 15-35% and a very high
ash content, usually around 40% of the DS, due to the large fraction of inorganics that
are used in the cooking and recycled back into the recovery cycle. The heating value of
black liquor is very low, around 13 MJ/kg dry solids (Vakkilainen, 2005)

3.1.1

Black liquor composition

On elemental basis, black liquor contains mainly carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O),
Na, and S. The typical composition of black liquor and the common range of the elements
are presented in Table 2. Hupa (1997) and Frederick (1997) presented the composition of
black liquor typical for the 1990s, while the composition marked as Andritz contains data
from samples taken from 2002 to 2020 (ANDRITZ, 2021). The liquor composition used
for calculations in Chapter 6 and 7 is presented in the column RB1. In modern boilers,
the cooking process is more efficient, which can be observed as a smaller carbon content
in the black liquor.

Black liquor

The black liquor solids consist of about 1/3 inorganics and 2/3 organics. The organics
consist of lignin, more than 20 different aliphatic carboxylic acids, and small amounts of
polysaccharides, extractives, and numerous other organics. Carboxylic acids originate
from the degradation of hemicelluloses. The carboxylic acids with the largest
concentrations are formic acid and acetic acid. The degradation of lignin results in many
different compounds, of which phenolic compounds are the most important. (Niemelä &
Alén, 1999). The shares of the different compounds found in a pine kraft liquor are
presented in Table 3.

The inorganics are divided into inorganic compounds, mostly NaOH, Na 2S, Na2CO3,
Na2SO4, Na2SO3 (sodium sulphite), Na2S2O3 (sodium thiosulphate) and NaCl, and sodium
bound to organics as different sodium salts, which make up 11 w-% of the total DS
(Niemelä & Alén, 1999).
The various forms of sulphur present in unoxidised black liquor are presented in Table 4
as percentage of total sulphur. Scandinavian liquors usually have a higher sulphur to
sodium ration than North American liquors, because of a higher sulphidity in the pulping
process (Hupa, 1997).

Char composition and reduction degree

The combustible material remaining after the devolatilization is called fixed carbon.
Around 50% of the carbon in the black liquor usually remains, while all organic oxygen
is released during the pyrolysis. Roughly 17% of the sodium is bound in Na2S, 17% in
Na2SO4 and 66% in Na2CO3 after all volatile material has been released (Vakkilainen,
2005).

Johanna Brink

Black liquor

During char burning, Na 2SO4 is reduced to Na 2S. The reduction degree is here defined as

reduction degree = 100 ∗

[Na2 S]
[Na2 S]+[Na2 SO4 ]

(1)

The reduction degree in char directly after devolatilization is around 50%, and it increases
to 95-98% in the smelt in modern recovery boilers (Vakkilainen, 2005).

3.2 Black liquor combustion
There are four stages of black liquor combustion, all presented in Figure 8: drying or the
evaporation of water, devolatilization, which is also called pyrolysis, char burning, and
finally smelt coalescence (Frederick & Hupa, 1997). As a result of large droplet sizes,
the combustion stages may overlap; the particle centre may still be drying while the
surface starts to volatilize, and once devolatilization is completed on the particle surface,
a char layer is formed (Järvinen, 2002).

Figure 8. Combustion stages of black liquor. From the left: drying, devolatilization, char burning, and
smelt coalescence (Åbo Akademi University black liquor database).

Data obtained from a simulation case representing typical operation of a 5,300 tDS/d
recovery boiler shows that the average drying time of a 5 mm black liquor droplet is about
0.5 s, the average devolatilization time roughly 1 s, and the average char burning time
about 3 s (Engblom, et al., 2018).

3.2.1

Devolatilization

During devolatilization, or pyrolysis, the organic material in the black liquor is released
and degraded to CO 2, CO, H2O (water), H2, small hydrocarbons, mercaptans and other
organosulphur compounds, H 2S, and some nitrogen species. About half of the original
carbon content in the black liquor is released and combusted in a flame surrounding the
12

Johanna Brink

Black liquor

particle. A typical behaviour of black liquor is droplet swelling during devolatilization,
when water vapour released from inside the droplet increases the surface area of the
particle. Char carbon and inorganic components remain in the black liquor after
devolatilization (Frederick & Hupa, 1997).
During devolatilization, Na2CO3 is formed through different reactions. When lignin
reacts with NaOH or Na 2S during the pulping process, sodium phenolates are formed.
These react with CO 2 to form phenols and Na 2CO3. Organic sodium acids with high
molecular weight originating from cellulose or hemicellulose decompose into sodium
carboxylates, such as sodium acetate, and volatiles. Sodium acetate decomposes to
Na2CO3 at temperatures above 400 °C (McKeough, et al., 1995).
Several reactions connected to the release of sulphur occur during devolatilization. These
are described in more detail in Chapter 4.1.2.

3.2.2

Char burning

Devolatilization is followed by the char burning stage, during which the char reacts with
O2, CO2 or H2O to form CO or CO2. The inorganic material in the particle melts, and the
particle size decreases as carbon is burnt off. During this stage, sulphate is reduced to
sulphide (Frederick & Hupa, 1997). Char burning can start already during the in-flight
but occurs mainly on the char bed, and to some extent on the furnace walls (Adams,
1997).
The following carbon consuming reactions are possible during char burning:
C (s) + ½ O2 (g) → CO (g)

(R1)

C (s) + H2O (g) → CO (g) + H 2 (g)

(R2)

C (s) + CO2 (g) → 2 CO (g)

(R3)

(Hupa, 1997).
Sulphate is reduced to sulphide according to
Na2SO4 (l) + 4 C (s) → Na2S (l) + 4 CO (g)

13

(R4a)

Johanna Brink

Black liquor

(Hupa, 1997), or alternatively with CO 2 as the product:
Na2SO4 (l) + 2 C (s) → Na2S (l) + 2 CO2 (g)

(R4b)

(Sricharoenchaikul, et al., 2003).
Another important reaction during char burning is the reduction of sodium carbonate,
which will release elemental sodium. This reaction is presented more thoroughly in
Chapter 4.2.2. Some sulphur release is possible during char burning, even though most
of the sulphur is released during devolatilization. These reactions are presented in
Chapter 4.1.2.

3.2.3

Smelt

Smelt coalescence occurs when the black liquor droplet collapses after char burning and
forms a molten smelt bead (Frederick & Hupa, 1997). Smelt is formed on the char bed
from the remaining molten inorganics as a part of the char continuously burns out. If a
droplet is fully burnt before it lands on the char bed, it will contribute with only smelt to
the bed. The smelt flows out from the furnace through smelt spouts for further treatment.
Smelt roughly consists of one third Na 2S and two thirds Na 2CO3 (Adams, 1997).
The conditions at the char bed must be reducing. If oxygen is present, sodium sulphide
in the smelt might be oxidised back to sulphate according to
Na2S (l,s) + 2 O2 (g) → Na2SO4 (l,s)

(R5)

(Wåg, et al., 1997).

3.3 Experimental methods to study black liquor combustion
The combustion of black liquor droplets can be studied as such in single droplet reactors
or furnaces (SDF), suitable for combustion, gasification and pyrolysis experiments.
Droplets with a diameter of 1.5 to 3 mm are usually prepared for the experiments
(Frederick & Hupa, 1997). One droplet is placed on a platinum hook or wire and inserted
into a laboratory furnace. A muffle furnace is used for stagnant gas tests, and in these
experiments, a camera records the combustion. Tube furnaces, where the droplet is
inserted into a quartz tube, are used for tests with a gas flow, and the outgoing gas is
analysed (Frederick, et al., 1995). The temperature in a muffle furnace is usually 70014

Johanna Brink

Black liquor

800 °C but can range from 350 °C to 1050 °C (Frederick, et al., 1995). In a tube furnace,
the temperature commonly is 900 °C (Vakkilainen, 2005).
Dried black liquor particles with a size around 100 μm can be tested in a laminar
entrained-flow reactor (LEFR) or in a heated grid reactor (HGR). The small particle size
ensures rapid heating and no temperature gradient within the particle. The LEFR can be
heated up to 1200 °C and is suitable for pyrolysis or combustion experiments. The
particle residence time is usually around 1 s and can be controlled by regulating the gas
flow or moving the particle collector (Frederick, et al., 1995). In the HGR, the particles
are placed between two electrically heated grids. A nitrogen flow through the grid
removes the released material from the particles. The experiments in an HGR have a
longer duration than in a LEFR, and the temperature is usually set to 900 °C (Kauppinen,
et al., 1995).

Sulphur and sodium release

4 Sulphur and sodium release
Optimally, all sodium and sulphur in the black liquor will be bound as Na 2S and Na 2CO3
in the smelt. Most of the sodium and sulphur that, for some reason, does not end up in
smelt is captured as fly ash from the flue gas in the ESP and recirculated back to the
furnace, if there is no need to purge the fly ash. The release of sodium and sulphur during
black liquor combustion mostly depends on temperature, which in turn depends on the
location of the particle in the furnace (see Figure 4). Sulphur is released mainly during
devolatilization, while sodium is released primarily during char burning (Hupa, 1997).
In Figure 9, the equilibrium curves for all sulphurous compounds and all sodium
compounds in the lower furnace gas and the char bed are presented. As comparison to the
equilibrium curves, release trends based on measurements in recovery boilers in the 1990s
are indicated. The equilibrium concentration of sulphur decreases rapidly up to 800 °C,
and then levels out. The equilibrium concentration of sodium increases with rising
temperature. The trends based on boiler measurements show that the real concentrations
of released sodium and sulphur are much higher than predicted, and that the temperature
dependence is not as dramatic as the equilibrium curves suggest (Hupa, 1997).

Figure 9. Equilibrium curves for sulphurous and sodium compounds, and measured sulphur and sodium
release trends (Hupa, 1997).

Johanna Brink

Sulphur and sodium release

4.1 Sulphur release
Sulphur is released mainly during devolatilization as H2S. Hupa (1997) claimed that the
release happens mainly between 300 and 400 ℃, and that the longer the black liquor
droplets stay in this temperature interval, the more sulphur is released. Harper (1989), in
turn, concluded that sulphur release is at its maximum at 490 °C, and McKeough et al.
(1995) similarly concluded that this occurs at 500 °C. The release expression proposed
by Frederick et al. (1995) gives a maximum release at 600 °C. The release expression
given by Frederick et al. (1995) predicts around 20% sulphur release at recovery boiler
temperatures.
Since the amount of sulphur release primarily depends on the time the droplets spend at
temperatures below 500 ℃, the DS content of the black liquor is important. Firing with
high DS content, the drying time for the droplets will be shorter than for droplets with
lower DS content. Devolatilization takes place in a hotter environment, due to a higher
furnace temperature and a shorter drying time. With higher DS content, the flame
temperature is higher, and a shorter drying time leads to devolatilization higher above the
char bed. The heating rates are higher in a hotter furnace, and the amount of released
sulphur will decrease with higher heating rates (McKeough, et al., 1995).

4.1.1

Published studies on sulphur release

Harper (1989) studied the sulphur release from black liquor in pyrolysis experiments.
Different sulphurous compounds were added to soda black liquor to determine their
individual contribution to the total sulphur release. The sulphurous compounds that were
tested included Na2SO4, Na2SO3, Na2S and Na2S2 O3. Very small amounts of sulphur were
released from sodium sulphate and sodium sulphite, while up to 40% sulphur could be
released from sodium thiosulphate or sodium sulphide (Harper, 1989).
Frederick et al. (1995) conducted pyrolysis experiments on sulphur release and compared
the results to those collected from three earlier studies where the total release of sulphur
during black liquor combustion had been measured. The sulphur loss from all these
experiments is shown in Figure 10. The maximum sulphur release was measured at
approximately 600 °C. They also measured the sulphur release rate and concluded that it
was independent of droplet size at temperatures above 600 °C (Frederick, et al., 1995).

measurements, after Frederick, et al. (1995).

McKeough et al. (1995) conducted pyrolysis experiments with HGR and proposed a
mechanism for sulphur release. The suggestion was based on the results from several
experiments, of which those done with a heating rate of 750 °C/s and various holding
times are presented in Figure 11. Sulphur release reached its maximum at 500 °C. To
obtain the sulphur loss from the particles, the concentration of volatile species and
sulphur remaining in the char were measured. In some experiments, more than 100%
sulphur was accounted for (McKeough, et al., 1995).

4.1.2

Sulphur and sodium release

The mechanism of sulphur release

Sulphur is released from black liquor mainly during devolatilization. The four main
sulphurous species found in the pyrolysis gases are H 2S, methyl mercaptan (MM),
dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS), although DMDS is only
formed in very small quantities. MM and DMS degrade to H2S (McKeough, et al., 1995).
Na2SO4 and Na 2SO3 in the black liquor do not contribute to sulphur release (Harper,
1989).
Prior to the actual release reactions, thiosulphate is reduced and forms sodium
hydrosulphide (NaHS) or sodium sulphide as
(Na2S2O3 → NaHS / Na 2S)

(R6)

(McKeough, et al., 1995). Thiosulphate decomposes at 330 °C (Frederick, et al., 1995).
The sulphur release mechanism as proposed by McKeough et al. (1995) starts with lignin
demethylation reactions. The primary release reaction is the formation of MM:
Lignin-OCH3 + NaHS → lignin-ONa + CH3SH.

(R7)

The formation of methyl mercaptide ion,
CH3SH + NaOH → CH3SNa + H2O

(R8)

followed by the formation of DMS according to
Lignin-OCH3 + CH3SNa → lignin-ONa + (CH3)2S,

(R9)

are secondary reactions (McKeough, et al., 1995).
H2S is released by thermal decomposition of MM or DMS:
CH3SH / (CH3)2S → H2S + CHx
(McKeough, et al., 1995)

19

(R10)

Johanna Brink

Sulphur and sodium release

H2S can also be formed during char burning according to
Na2S + H2O + CO 2 → Na2 CO3 + H2S.

(R11)

Sulphur can be released as COS during char burning by the following reaction:
Na2S (l,s) + 2 CO2 (g) → Na2CO3 (l,s) + COS (g)

(R12)

(Wåg, et al., 1997). These reactions with Na 2S, resulting in the release of H 2S or COS,
are controlled by chemical equilibrium with more sulphur release favoured at lower
temperatures. At furnace conditions, sulphur release during this stage can be neglected
(Frederick, et al., 1995).

4.1.3

Sulphur release during devolatilization

The total sulphur release during devolatilization clearly depends on the furnace
temperature. Frederick et al. (1995) presented the following expression for sulphur loss,
as percentage of total sulphur in black liquor, based on collected results from different
sulphur release studies:
When 250 ℃ < T < 1018 ℃:
𝑆𝑣𝑜𝑙 (%) = −163.27 + 0.9171𝑇 − 1.150 ∙ 10−3 𝑇 2 + 4.283 ∙ 10−7 𝑇 3

(2a)

and when T > 1018 ℃:
𝑆𝑣𝑜𝑙 (%) = 458.85 ∙ 𝑒 −2.666∙10

−3 𝑇

(2b)

where T is the furnace temperature given in ℃. The calculated sulphur release using the
previous expression is presented in Figure 12. With a temperature of around 12001300 ℃, the expected sulphur release will be about 14-19% of the total black liquor
sulphur.

(Wåg, et al., 1997). The sulphur release during char burning, however, is low and can be
neglected when compared to the amount of sulphur released during devolatilization
(Frederick, et al., 1995).

4.2 Sodium release
Sodium is released during char burning as sodium vapour. About 10-15% of the total
amount of sodium in black liquor is expected to be released (Vakkilainen, 2005),
(Järvinen, 2002). However, according to the literature, the total sodium release cannot be
expressed as a function of temperature only.

4.2.1

Published studies on sodium release

Li and van Heiningen (1990) conducted experiments on sodium release between 675 °C
and 800 °C with focus on determining the reaction rate of the reduction of sodium
carbonate by char carbon. They carried out two different series of experiments in a helium
(He) atmosphere. In the first set, they measured the sodium loss after heating the black
liquor solids to the final temperature with the heating rate 20°C/min. In the other set of
experiments, the black liquor solids were heated to and held at a constant temperature
until no more mass loss could be detected. The reaction times were approximately one
hour. The total release of sodium was between 6 and 47% for the first set of experiments,
and between 9 and 82% for the second set (Li & van Heiningen, 1990).
Li and van Heiningen (1990) also investigated the role of CO and CO 2 in the suppression
of sodium release at 750 °C and 800 °C by heating the samples in 12% CO and in a
gasification atmosphere containing 20% CO2 and 12% CO for 30 minutes, and comparing
with samples held in 100% He. The release of sodium was almost completely suppressed
when CO and/or CO2 was present (Li & van Heiningen, 1990).
Pyrolysis experiments with focus on sodium release conducted by Kauppinen et al. (1995)
showed that sodium release is quite insignificant at temperatures below 900 ℃. Different

22

Johanna Brink

Sulphur and sodium release

experiments were conducted in a single droplet furnace (SDF), a laminar entrained-flow
reactor (LEFR) and in a heated grid reactor (HGR), in 100% N2. In the LEFR, dry black
liquor particles with a diameter of 90 to 125 μm were used in the experiments. In the
HGR, 100 mg dry black liquor powder with particle size 100 μm was used. In the SDF
experiments, approximately 2 mm large black liquor droplets with 78% DS content were
tested (Kauppinen, et al., 1995).
In these experiments, sodium was released as vapour. The release was insignificant at
temperatures at and below 800 ℃, since only 3% of the sodium in the black liquor was
released with a residence time of 6 s. At 900 ℃ and 1100 ℃, with only 1 s residence
time, the release was 6 and 14%, respectively (Kauppinen, et al., 1995). Wåg et al. (1997)
pointed out that results from SDF and LEFR experiments are not directly comparable.
Frederick et al. (1995) collected the results from experiments conducted in a fume reactor
and in a LEFR. Some experiments were conducted in pure N2, some with different levels
of O2, and some with the addition of 5% CO. The difference in sodium release between
different black liquors was also tested. The experiments in the fume reactor had a duration
of either 15 seconds or 5 minutes, while the black liquor particles in the LEFR
experiments had a retention time of 0.6 to 0.8 seconds (Frederick, et al., 1995).
The total release of sodium ranged between 11 and 20% in the fume reactor experiments
in 100% N2, but was only 5% when CO was present. In the fume reactor experiments with
oxygen present, the sodium release was 1.5 to 14%. The LEFR experiments in N2
(nitrogen) showed that the sodium release increased from 2.5% at 700 °C to 11.5% at
1100 °C. When 21% oxygen was present, the release was substantially higher at all
temperatures, while merely 4% O2 seemed to affect the release only at the highest
temperature (Frederick, et al., 1995). The experimental results from the LEFR are
presented in Figure 13.

Wåg et al. (1997) used the results from the LEFR experiments conducted by Frederick et
al. (1995) to describe the sodium release as a function of the calculated particle
temperature. The release increased with temperature as shown in Figure 14. In their
article it was stated that sodium loss during devolatilization had been accounted for, that
is, a sodium loss of 13% at 900 °C and 18% at 800 °C was assumed. Sodium loss during
char burning was calculated as the sodium remaining after char burning and the sodium
loss during devolatilization subtracted from the initial black liquor sodium.

Sulphur and sodium release

700 °C in inert atmosphere. They also carried out experiments on the suppression of
sodium release in the presence of CO and CO 2. In inert atmosphere, the sodium release
increased from varying between 5 and 20% at 500-700 °C to about 75% at 900 °C, with
a rapid increase especially between 700 and 800 °C. The samples were held in the reactor
for 1 minute. Below 700 °C, the sodium release was probably due to physical ejection,
while above 700 °C, the reduction of Na 2CO3 started contributing to the sodium release.
Gairns et al. (1995) concluded that a sodium release of 5-8% by physical ejection could
be expected in recovery boiler conditions during devolatilization.
In the presence of 10% CO at 800 °C, the sodium release was only 15%, compared to at
least 45% in 100% He. At 900 °C, sodium release was completely suppressed when 15%
CO2 was added. It was observed that the sodium release in droplet pyrolysis experiments
usually was greater than the 10% of the incoming sodium found in the precipitator ash
(Gairns, et al., 1995).
In 2001, Tamminen et al. (2001) discovered that 90-95% of the dust is formed from the
combustion of black liquor, and that merely 5-10% originates from the char bed. They
conducted full-scale experiments in two operating recovery boilers, where the black
liquor flow was cut off for a few minutes and the boiler conditions were maintained with
only oil burners. During the tests, the flue gas composition and dust amount were
measured on-line (Tamminen, et al., 2001).
Sricharoenchailkul et al. (2003) conducted pyrolysis experiments in LEFR to measure the
amount of fixed carbon, sodium and carbonate in char depending on temperature and
residence time. The experiments were conducted in 100% N2 at temperatures between
700 °C and 1000 °C and with residence times varying from 0.3 to 1.3 s. Sodium appeared
to be released by the reduction of sodium carbonate. The sodium loss grew as the
residence time increased, and became higher with rising temperature. The sodium loss at
different temperatures and residence times is presented in Figure 15 (Sricharoenchaikul,
et al., 2003).

4.2.2

The mechanism of sodium release

Sodium is released primarily during char burning by the reduction of sodium carbonate
by char carbon (Hupa, 1997). Sodium can be released either in-flight from the black
liquor droplets or from the char bed. Only 5-10% of dust is formed from sodium released
from the char bed (Tamminen, et al., 2001).
The reduction of sodium carbonate is kinetically controlled and becomes significant when
the liquor temperature reaches 900 ℃. The amount of released sodium increases with
increased temperature and increased reaction time (Hupa, 1997). Frederick et al. (1995)
suggested that the sodium carbonate reduction and the release of sodium are controlled
by both chemical kinetics and film mass transfer, and that the reaction is highly
temperature dependent. The reaction would become significant already at temperatures
above 800 ℃, and at high temperatures, mass transfer would be the limiting factor to the
overall release rate. For temperatures at and below 800 ℃, CO and CO2 possibly suppress
the release of sodium.
Sodium carbonate is reduced by char carbon, resulting in the release of elemental sodium
according to
Na2CO3 (l) + C (s) → 2 Na (g) + CO (g) + CO 2 (g)

(R13a)

(Li & van Heiningen, 1990), while, for instance, Vakkilainen (2005) proposed that the
products would be CO and elemental sodium:

26

Na2CO3 (l) + 2 C (s) → 2 Na (g) + 3 CO (g).

4.2.3

(R13b)

Sodium release rate

Elemental sodium is released by the reduction of Na 2CO3 with char carbon (R13).
According to Frederick et al. (1995), the release rate (RNa) depends on both the chemical
kinetics (RcNa) and the film mass transfer rate (RmNa). They presented the following rate
equation for modelling the sodium release during char burning:

The overall rate of sodium release is calculated as the inverse sum of the reciprocal rate
of the gas transport process and the reciprocal kinetic reaction rate multiplied by an
efficiency factor η. RNa is expressed in moles per second.
The rate of mass transfer slows down the overall release rate of sodium, and is calculated
as
(9)

𝑅𝑚𝑁𝑎 = 𝑘𝑚,𝑁𝑎 𝐴𝑝 𝐶𝑁𝑎

where km,Na is the gas film mass transfer coefficient of sodium vapour (in m/s), Ap the
external surface area of the char particle (in m2), and CNa the concentration of sodium
vapour in the gas film around the particle (in mol/m3) (Wåg, et al., 1997).
The gas film mass transfer coefficient km,Na is estimated with a Sherwood number

Sodium release with char carbon dependence

Verrill and Wessel (1998) used a variable stoichiometry for the sodium carbonate
reduction reaction:
(2-f) Na2CO3 + C → 2(2-f) Na + f CO + (3-2f) CO2.

(R13c)

They proposed that the rate of sodium vaporisation was controlled by the kinetics of
sodium carbonate reduction, and that the reaction was inhibited by CO and CO 2. Since
no mass transfer resistance terms were available, they chose to use a first order
dependence on char carbon instead. The reaction rate (in kmol/s) was calculated as
𝐸

𝑚

𝑅 = 2−𝑓 ∙ 𝑘 ∙ 𝜌 ∙ [𝐶(𝑠)][𝐶𝑂3 ] ∙ 𝑒 −𝑅𝑇

(19)

where m = char particle mass (in kg), k = 109 m3/(kmol∙s) and E = 244 kJ/mol.
Concentrations are given in kmol/kg char (Verrill & Wessel, 1998).
To use this model, reaction rates for the gasification and oxidation of carbon are needed.
Järvinen (2002) collected the reaction rates relevant to black liquor burning and offered
the following reaction rates for carbon gasification and oxidation (in mol/m 3/s):

4.2.5

Equilibrium-limited sodium release

Another approach for modelling sodium release has been proposed by McKeough (2010),
who focused on the equilibrium partial pressure of sodium hydroxide. According to his
theory, sodium release is thermodynamically constrained, and sodium can be released as
sodium hydroxide if the equilibrium pressure of NaOH at the particle surface is larger
than the local bulk gas partial pressure of NaOH. In the hottest furnace zone this
equilibrium pressure can be reached quickly around the black liquor particles.
In this modelling approach, the release of sodium and the formation of NaOH is expressed
according to the following reaction:
Na2CO3 (l,s) + H2O (g) → 2 NaOH (g,l,s,) + CO2 (g)

(R14)

(McKeough, 2010).
The equilibrium pressure (in atm) can be calculated according to:

lg(𝑝NaOH,eq ) = 0.528 ∙ lg(xNa2 CO3 ,initial ) −

where xNa2CO3,initial is the initial mole fraction of molten Na 2CO3 in the char particle, and
[H2O] and [CO2] are the molar concentrations in the bulk gas of the component concerned
(McKeough, 2010). The equilibrium pressure is pictured in Figure 16, using a
(H2O)/(H2O+CO2) ratio of 0.5. The legend indicates the initial fraction of Na 2CO3. The
equilibrium pressure increases with rising temperature and a higher initial fraction of
Na2CO3.

initial fraction of Na 2CO3.

McKeough’s (2010) model predictions of sodium release are presented in Figure 17. The
sodium release clearly increases with increasing temperature, and slightly depends on the
initial fraction of Na 2CO3. (McKeough, 2010). Depending on the conditions, 5 to 16% of
the sodium is released.

Figure 17. Predictions of sodium release (McKeough, 2010).

Jukola et al. (2014) used McKeough’s (2010) approach to sodium release in a CFD
simulation. Most of the release was assumed to occur in-flight, and sodium release during
devolatilization was considered insignificant. The DS content of the black liquor was
80.8%, and the average temperature in the lower furnace was around 1200 °C or less. The
simulated conditions corresponded to approximately 70% of the full load. Using these
parameters, almost 10% of the black liquor sodium was released, and all SO2 was most
likely captured inside the furnace (Jukola, et al., 2014).

Dust formation

5 Dust formation
The terms dust and fume are both used in literature as synonyms for the same particles.
In this chapter, dust is used to describe the particles that are formed in the recovery boiler
from the released sodium and sulphur.
Dust mainly consists of sodium sulphate and sodium carbonate. Aside from these two
compounds, dust also contains small amounts of NaCl and the corresponding potassium
salts (Tran, 1997). Potassium reacts in the same way as sodium. The alkali chlorides NaCl
and KCl vaporise from the black liquor during combustion and condense on dust particles
once the flue gas has cooled (Hupa, 1997). An example of the composition of precipitator
dust is given in Figure 18. The typical dust size is 0.5-1.3 μm. Apart from dust,
intermediate-sized particles that are 1-100 μm, and 100 μm to 2 mm carryover particles
also contribute to ash formation in recovery boilers (Vakkilainen, 2005; Verrill & Wessel,
1998).

Figure 18. Composition of ESP dust, after Tran (1997).

Leppänen et al. (2014) measured the dust composition in a boiler firing 3,400 tDS/d, with
79.3% DS content. A comparison is made with more recent measurements from three
different recovery boilers, KA, KB and KC (Kronqvist, 2021). The dust compositions are
presented as w-% Na, K, Cl, SO 4 and CO3 in Figure 19, where L refers to Leppänen and
K to Kronqvist. In boiler KA, the carbonate content in the dust is remarkably high. The
fraction of sodium is of the same magnitude in all four boilers, while the SO 4/CO3 ratio
varies significantly between the boilers.

5.1 Dust formation reactions
Dust formation reactions start once sulphur in the form of H2S and elemental sodium have
been released from the black liquor. The elemental sodium released by the reduction of
sodium carbonate (R13) reacts with water vapour and oxygen to form sodium hydroxide,
2 Na (g) + H2O (g) + ½ O2 → 2 NaOH (g).

(R15)

SO2 is formed when H2S reacts with oxygen according to
2 H2S (g) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 SO2 (g) + 2 H2O (g)

(R16)

(Vakkilainen, 2005).
Sodium hydroxide reacts with available SO2 and forms sodium sulphate:
2 NaOH (g) + SO 2 (g) + ½ O2 (g)→ Na2SO4 (g) + H2O (g).

(R17)

If all SO2 is consumed by reaction (R17), any excess NaOH reacts to form sodium
carbonate according to
2 NaOH (l) + CO 2 (g) → Na2CO3 (l) + H2O (g)

33

(R18)

Johanna Brink

Dust formation

(Hupa, 1997). Reaction (R18) involves condensed sodium, since Na2CO3 does not exist
in gaseous form. NaOH is condensed at temperatures below 900 °C. Reaction (R18) is a
competing reaction to (R17), especially when the furnace is cold and NaOH starts
condensing before all SO 2 has formed sulphate. In this case, some SO 2 will be present in
the flue gas (McKeough & Janka, 2001).
If the mixing of the furnace gases is poor, some SO2 might remain unreacted before NaOH
condenses, and react with already formed Na 2CO3:
Na2CO3 (l,s) + SO2 (g) + ½ O2 (g)→ Na2SO4 (l,s) + CO2 (g)

(R19)

This is more likely in older boilers, where the furnace heat load and the dry solids content
of the liquor used to be low (McKeough & Janka, 2001).
The dust compounds are formed mostly in the upper furnace, and to some extent in and
after the superheater zone (Hupa, 2007). The possible reaction paths of released sodium
and sulphur are presented in Figure 20 and Figure 21.

Figure 20. S and Na reactions in flue gas. Cold furnace, S/Na 2 in flue gas = 1.5 (Hupa, 1997).

34

Johanna Brink

Dust formation

Figure 21. S and Na reactions in flue gas. Hot furnace, S/Na 2 in flue gas = 0.8. (Hupa, 1997).

If there is a shortage of NaOH, caused by cold furnace conditions and/or high sulphidity
in the black liquor, some SO2 will be oxidised to SO 3. This SO3 might react with Na 2SO4
and water to form sodium bisulphate (NaHSO4). In this case, scarce amounts of Na2CO3
will be formed and the flue gas will contain SO 2, as pictured in Figure 20 (Hupa, 1997).
Figure 21 shows what happens in a sufficiently hot furnace with no SO2 emissions.

5.2 Dust particle formation
Dust is formed through three mechanism: homogeneous condensation or nucleation,
heterogeneous condensation, and agglomeration. Homogeneous condensation occurs
when vapour particles stick together creating aerosol particles, in the case where no other
particles are present. This is only possible when the vapour, for example Na2SO4, is
highly supersaturated, that is, when its partial pressure is much larger than its equilibrium
pressure. If particles already are present in the gas, e.g., small amounts of metal oxides,
the vapour particles will condense on the surface of these metal oxide seeds instead. This
process is called heterogeneous condensation and occurs at lower supersaturation ratios
than homogeneous condensation. When liquid or solid particles collide and stick together,
the process is called agglomeration (Jokiniemi, et al., 1996).
Figure 22 describes the formation mechanism of dust particles. When NaOH leaves the
boundary layer around the black liquor particle, it reacts with SO2 to form Na 2SO4, that
condenses on minuscule metal oxide particles (seeds, MxOy). Once Na2CO3 is formed
from CO2 and remaining NaOH, it condenses on the already existing dust particles. Any
35

Johanna Brink

Dust formation

chlorides present will then build up on the outermost layer of the dust particles
(Jokiniemi, et al., 1996).

Figure 22. Dust formation mechanism in recovery boiler (Jokiniemi, et al., 1996). c = condensed form.

Na2SO4 starts to condensate at approximately 1310 °C and Na2CO3 at 1120 °C
(Jokiniemi, et al., 1996). Since the condensation of Na2SO4 occurs lower in the furnace
compared to the condensation of Na2CO3, dust particles formed in the lower part of the
furnace will grow bigger and have a larger SO 4/(Na+K) ratio than particles formed further
downstream (McKeough & Janka, 2001).

Modelling of dust formation

6 Modelling of dust formation
Note that for simplicity, when Na or sodium is used in the following chapters, it replaces
the expression M that was used in the developed model. M consists of both Na and K,
since they were assumed to react identically.

6.1 Development of the model
The release of sodium and sulphur from a single black liquor droplet and the composition
of the dust formed by the released matter was calculated using Excel. As input, the black
liquor composition including C, H, O, Na, S, K, Cl and N, given as weight-% DS, droplet
mass, black liquor DS content (%), average temperature (°C) along the droplet trajectory,
and in-flight time (s) were needed. A 20 mg droplet with 5 mm diameter was selected as
the initial test object. A flowchart of the principles of the model is presented in Figure
23.

Figure 23. The principles of the developed model.

37

Johanna Brink

Modelling of dust formation

Using the black liquor composition given in weight-% and the mass input, the molar
amount of all elements was calculated. All release calculations were based on the molar
amounts of sodium and sulphur.
Complete devolatilization was assumed to occur prior to char combustion and, thus,
sulphur release was calculated before sodium release. The sulphur release was estimated
using equation (2). The expression only required temperature as input and gave the
percentage of released sulphur. The amount of released and remaining sulphur in the
black liquor were calculated.
After obtaining the estimated sulphur release, a theoretical char composition was created
using stoichiometry. The sulphur remaining after devolatilization will be bound in either
Na2S or Na2SO4 in the char particle, and the ratio between them is determined by the
reduction degree, which was assumed to initially be 50%. Chlorine was assumed to be
partly vaporised as NaCl during devolatilization; the release factor assumed to be 34%,
as proposed by Leppänen et al. (2014). The remaining chlorine was assumed to be bound
as NaCl in the char.
The sodium not bound in Na 2S, Na2SO4 or NaCl was assumed to form Na2CO3 in the char
particle. The carbon needed in Na2CO3 was subtracted from the initial carbon amount,
and 50% of the remaining carbon amount was assumed to be fixed and the rest to
volatilize.
The rate expression (8) provided by Frederick et al. (1995) was used to predict the sodium
release during the in-flight. The amount of sodium carbonate was needed for the
calculations. The model user could control the char burning temperature by setting a
temperature difference between the gas and the char particle. The char burning time was
calculated as the in-flight time subtracted with the time for devolatilization.
Calculations were carried out for small time steps (Δt) of size 0.01 s. At the initial time
step, the reaction rate RcNa (R14) was calculated from the initial amount of sodium
carbonate. The rate of mass transfer of sodium vapour from the particle (R9) was assumed
to be constant and was estimated through several steps (R12, R13, R10b, R11 and finally
R9).
The efficiency factor (R15) was obtained by first calculating the reaction rate constant
(R17), followed by the Thiele modulus (R16) and its hyperbolic tangent. The reaction
38

Johanna Brink

Modelling of dust formation

rate (R14) was multiplied by the efficiency factor (R15), and the obtained value was
inversed and added to the inversed mass transfer rate to obtain the overall inverse rate
(R8).
The reduction rate was given as mol/s and to obtain the amount of Na2CO3 reduced per
time step, this rate was multiplied by Δt, in this case 0.01 s. The reduced amount of
Na2CO3 was the same as the amount of released Na 2. The reduced amount was subtracted
from the amount used at the beginning of the time step, and the new value was used for
calculating R cNa in the next time step. The calculations were repeated for every time step.
In total, the reduction rate of Na 2CO3 was calculated for 10 seconds, which should be
well above the average in-flight time.
Both the reduced amount of Na2CO3 and the released amount of total sodium was
calculated for every time step. The reduced or released amount was divided by the initial
amount to acquire the reduced or released fraction (in %). Since some sodium is bound
to sulphur in char, not all sodium can be released. The maximum sodium release that can
be predicted by the model is about 70%. Complete (100%) reduction of Na 2CO3 is only
possible if enough reaction time is provided.
The Excel function VLOOKUP was used to obtain the total sodium release for a given
in-flight time. As the value to be retrieved, the cell containing char burning time, which
is calculated as in-flight time minus time for devolatilization, was selected. The function
worked with the columns containing time through all the rate calculations, ending with
the Na2CO3 reduced (in %). Since this was the desired return value, the index of this
column (16) was selected as the last input value to the function. From the percentage of
reduced Na 2CO3 and the initial Na 2CO3 amount, the amount of Na2 released in-flight,
excluding release as NaCl, was calculated.
The total sodium release was adjusted according to the accepted knowledge that about
5% of dust is formed from the char bed (Tamminen, et al., 2001). If less than 95% of the
carbonate had been reduced, it was assumed that the sodium released in-flight made up
95% of all released sodium, and that 5% was released from the char bed. If more than
95% of the Na 2CO3 had been reduced, 100% sodium release was assumed.
After having obtained the sulphur and sodium release the dust composition was
calculated. All released sulphur was assumed to form SO2 (R16), while all released
sodium (from R13) was assumed to form NaOH (R15). One mole of SO2 reacts with
39

Johanna Brink

Modelling of dust formation

2 moles of NaOH and forms one mole of Na2SO4 (R17). The amount of sulphur was
compared to the amount of 2 Na. If there is more S than Na 2, there will not be enough
NaOH in the gas for all SO2 to form Na 2SO4, and the excess SO2 is assumed to exit with
the flue gas as SO 2 emissions. Further reactions with SO 2 were not considered in the
model. In this case, there would be no carbonate in the dust. If there is an excess of Na 2,
all SO2 reacts with NaOH and the remaining NaOH was assumed to form Na 2CO3 (R18).
The amount of Na 2SO4 and Na2CO3 was divided by the initial amount of black liquor dry
solids to obtain the dust formation expressed as mol/kgDS. By multiplying that value by
the molar mass, the dust amount was expressed as g/kgDS. The total amount of dust was
calculated as the sum of NaCl, Na 2SO4 and Na2 CO3 and the different compounds could
be expressed as w-% of the dust. The mass of CO3 and SO4 was also compared to the total
mass.
As model output, the sulphur and sodium release were given (as %), along with the dust
composition (w-%) and the dust amount (g/kgDS). Possible SO2-emissions were also
given (as mol/kgDS). The total sodium release was calculated as

[Na,released]
∙
[Na,initial]

100%,

where NaCl was included in the released amount.

6.2 Approximation of parameters
Since actual values could not be found, many parameters used for the calculation of the
mass transfer rate needed to be approximated. Their impact on the dust formation is
discussed in Chapter 6.4. In the calculations below, the average gas temperature along
the droplet trajectory was set to 1200 °C, which was close to the temperature in a CFD
simulation by Engblom et al. (2018).
The density of the furnace gas is approximated using the ideal gas law
(23)

𝑝𝑉 = 𝑛𝑅𝑇

𝑚

The density is defined as 𝜌 = 𝑚/𝑉, and the molar amount can be replaced by 𝑛 = 𝑀 . The
ideal gas law is rewritten in the form

𝑝𝑀 =

𝑅𝑇
𝑉

= 𝜌𝑅𝑇

(23)

and by rearranging, the density can be solved:
𝑝𝑀
.
𝑅𝑇

𝜌=

(24)

The molar mass of air, 28.97 g/mol, is used, since the composition of the furnace gas
varies depending on the location. However, at any given location, the main part of the
gas consists of N2, which has a molar mass close to that of air. The pressure is assumed
to be atmospheric pressure, and T is the average gas temperature. At 1200 °C, the
approximated density of the furnace gas equals 0.24 kg/m3.
The dynamic viscosity of the furnace gas, μ, is approximated as the dynamic viscosity of
air. The dynamic viscosity of air ranges from roughly 48 μPa∙s at 1000 °C to 55 μPa∙s at
1300 °C (Engineering ToolBox, 2003). In the model, the value at 1200 °C, 52 μPa∙s, is
used.
The slip velocity (u) between the black liquor particle and the furnace gas is assumed to
be 10 m/s. Data extracted from a simulation case representing the typical operation of a
5,300 tDS/d recovery boiler shows that the slip velocity varies widely. However, 10 m/s
is close to the average value (Engblom, et al., 2018).
The diffusivity of sodium vapour (DNa) is approximated using a molar mass correlation
between Na and CO2, and the diffusivity of CO2 in N2. At 298 K, the diffusivity of this
gas pair is 0.165 cm2/s (Bird, et al., 2007). The diffusivity of sodium vapour in N2 at 298
K is calculated from this value using

𝐷𝑁𝑎

With 298 K as the reference temperature, the diffusivity at another temperature (in K)
can be approximated as

(26)

Using this equation, the approximated value of DNa at 1150 °C is 2.38 cm2/s or
0.000238 m2/s.

Modelling of dust formation

pressure and temperature. Using this expression, the maximum concentration of sodium
vapour, CNa, in the gas film around the particle can be calculated as 𝐶𝑁𝑎 =

At a char

burning temperature of 1150 °C and a pressure of 1 atm, CNa is approximately 8.6 mol/m 3.
The model user is required to define the average gas temperature along the droplet
trajectory, e.g., 1200 °C. The temperatures of devolatilization and char burning are
determined by another user-defined parameter: the temperature difference (ΔT) between
the black liquor particle and the furnace gas (Tparticle-T gas). For devolatilization, the
difference is 0 °C by default. The char burning temperature is somewhat lower than the
furnace gas temperature because of the endothermic gasification reactions. Data extracted
from a CFD simulation of the typical operation of a 5,300 tDS/day recovery boiler shows
that the average temperature difference between the char particle and the surrounding gas
is about 50 °C for a 5 mm particle (Engblom, et al., 2018). For instance, if the gas
temperature is 1200 °C, the char burning temperature is assumed to be 1150 °C. ΔT for
the char burning is set to -50 °C as default value.
Since the char burning stage is assumed to start instantly after the devolatilization is
completed, the time for devolatilization needs to be defined. The CFD case mentioned
above (Engblom, et al., 2018) is used to determine an average time for devolatilization.
For a 5 mm particle, the duration of devolatilization is approximately 1.5 s. This is used
as the default value for the time of devolatilization. The time available for char burning
will be the in-flight time subtracted with the devolatilization time. As an example, the
available char burning time when the in-flight time is 2.5 s and the devolatilization time
1.5 s will be 1.0 s.
The particle diameter is set to 5 mm, since the modelling of swelling during
devolatilization and decreasing size during char burning was too complicated. This
particle size is the same as the average black liquor droplet size in a CFD simulation
(Engblom, et al., 2018).
The influence of droplet size on the time for devolatilization and the temperature
difference between the char particle and the furnace gas is shown in Table 5. The data is
obtained from a simulation case representing the typical operation of a 5,300 tDS/d
recovery boiler (Engblom, et al., 2018).

The dry solids content was set to 81% and the droplet mass to 20 mg. The in-flight time
was set to 3 s, 1.5 s of which were reserved for devolatilization. The average gas
temperature was set to 1100 °C, with a 50 °C difference between the char particle and the
gas temperature. The particle diameter was 5 mm and the slip velocity 10 m/s. A
volatilisation fraction of 0.34 was chosen for chlorine. In this case, DNa was 8 mol/m 3.
The combination of these parameters is referred to as the reference case.
The dust composition (in w-%) estimated by the model is presented in Table 8.

In total, 24% sulphur and 22% alkali were released. Under these conditions, 28%

black liquor composition, the sulphur release remained unchanged, and the released alkali
decreased to 21%. The carbonate reduction did not change.

In total, 119 g/kgDS dust was predicted to be formed when the virgin black liquor was
used as input. With the as-fired composition, the amount of dust practically remained the
same.
The fraction of reduced sodium carbonate in the char particle as function of char burning
time for the reference case is presented in Figure 24. At the beginning of the char burning,
the fraction of reduced carbonate rapidly increases, since the reduction rate is high. As
the char burning continues, the amount of carbonate in char decreases and the reaction
rate slows down, which results in less carbonate reduced per time step. The reduction rate
of Na2CO3 is presented in Figure 25.

6.4 Sensitivity analysis
Since some parameters had to be approximated in the model (Chapter 6.2), a sensitivity
analysis was conducted to study how critically changes in the d, u, CNa, μ and DNa affect
the dust composition. Alterations of these parameters will only impact the carbonate
reduction rate and either increase or reduce the sodium release. Since the released amount
of sulphur will remain constant, the total amount of dust and the dust composition are
expected to change. One parameter at a time is changed and the dust composition, with
focus on Na 2CO3, is compared to the reference case. The liquor composition presented in
Table 6 was used. The values used in the sensitivity analysis are presented in Table 12.

The sensitivity analysis was performed at 1100 °C. At 1300 °C, the dust composition
remained unchanged, since the carbonate reduction was close to 100% almost regardless
of the parameter.
When the particle diameter was increased from 5 to 8 mm, the amount of Na2CO3
increased with only 1%. When the diameter was reduced from 5 to 2 mm, a 6% decrease
in Na2CO3 was observed. The dust composition was barely impacted when the slip
velocity was varied. A low slip velocity, 2 m/s, only lowered the Na2CO3 amount with
2%, and when increased from 10 m/s to 15 m/s, the change in dust composition was
negligible. The gas viscosity decreased the Na2CO3 amount by 5% when lowered to
20 μPa∙s from 53 μPa∙s, but when set to 250 μPa∙s, the change was insignificant.
Additionally, the model was tested for sensitivity to the molar mass of the furnace gas.
Within the range of 27 to 33.5 g/mol, the carbonate reduction was not affected.
The diffusivity (DNa) and concentration of sodium vapour (CNa) significantly affected the
Na2CO3 amount at low values. When CNa was reduced from 9.2 to 1 mol/m 3, the Na2CO3
content dropped by almost 23%, and the dust amount decreased with the same magnitude.
When CNa was increased from 9.2 to 17.4 mol/m 3, the amount of Na2CO3 grew by only
1%. Similarly, Na2CO3 decreased by almost 22% when DNa was changed from 2.1 to
0.16 cm2/s, which is the diffusivity at room temperature, but increased by only 2% when
the value was changed from 2.1 to 10 cm2/s.
The largest value used for CNa was determined as the average of the vapour pressure of
sodium and the concentration of sodium in the bulk gas. The concentration in the bulk
gas was assumed to be 0 mol/m 3. The vapour pressure of sodium (in atm) can be
calculated according to

At a char burning temperature of 1050 °C, the saturation pressure of sodium vapour is

7.1 Effect of temperature
The dust composition and amount, when one black liquor droplet was combusted, were
predicted for nine cases. The combination of in-flight time, time for devolatilization, and
temperature difference between the gas and the char particle (ΔT) were different in every
case. The parameters of the cases are presented in Table 13. For each case, the dust
composition and amount were calculated for temperatures varying from 1000 to 1300 °C
with an interval of 25 °C. The reference case parameters defined in Chapter 6.3 were
applied in the predictions.

The composition and amount of dust in case 3, 4, and 5 are presented in Figure 26, Figure
27 and Figure 28. The dust composition in RB1 is indicated in all figures. At the lowest
temperatures, there is not enough sodium release to form Na 2CO3, and the small amount
of dust will consist of NaCl and Na 2SO4 only. Once the temperature rises, sodium
carbonate begins to form, and the dust amount increases. At 1300 °C, the carbonate
reduction has reached almost 100%, and the dust composition remains mostly unchanged
at approximately 10% Na 2SO4, 2% NaCl and 88% Na 2CO3. The dust compositions and
amounts for all cases are collected in Appendix C.

time on dust formation

Figure 27. Dust composition and amount in case 4.

In case 4, the char burning time is 1 s longer than in case 3. This is achieved by using
different in-flight and devolatilization times. A prolonged char burning time causes the
sodium release to be higher at any given temperature, resulting in more carbonate in dust
and a larger amount of dust.

49

Johanna Brink

The effect of temperature and in-flight
time on dust formation

Figure 28. Dust composition and amount in case 5.

When cases 4 and 5 are compared, there is a difference of 50 °C in ΔT. A larger ΔT
implies a lower char burning temperature, which results in less sodium release, and the
furnace temperature must be higher before the SO 2 emissions are decimated and Na2CO3
appears in the dust. In case 4, carbonate appears at 1050 °C, while in case 5, a temperature
of 1075 °C is required, and the fraction is significantly smaller than in case 4.
The dust amount as a function of temperature for cases 1-9 is presented in Figure 29. At
the lowest given temperature, 1000 °C, the amount of dust is the least in case 6;
10 g/kgDS, and the highest in case 9; 85 g/kgds. The dust amount of case 9 reaches its
maximum at the lowest temperature; 1200 °C, while the dust amount of case 6 is still
increasing at 1300 °C. To reach 100 g/kgDS of dust, case 9 requires a temperature of
approximately 1015 °C, while case 6 requires 1165 °C. The dust amounts of the other
cases are continuously between these two extremes. Case 1, which has identical
parameters to the reference case, requires a temperature of 1085 °C to reach 100 g/kgDS,
and its maximum amount of dust is reached at 1254 °C. The absolute maximum dust
amount appears to be slightly decreasing as the temperatures rises above 1200 °C.

The amount of dust is proportional to the amount of released sodium, and increases with
rising temperature, as indicated in Figure 30. Once all Na 2CO3 has been reduced, the
maximum amount of dust is reached. If the temperature is further increased, a small
decrease in the amount can be seen, as a result of slightly more sodium bound to sulphur
in the char particle.

The effect of temperature and in-flight
time on dust formation

The fraction of reduced sodium carbonate at 3 s in-flight time for the reference case is
shown as a function of temperature in Figure 31. The fraction of reduced carbonate is
very close to 0% at temperatures below 900 °C, then rapidly increases between 1000 and
1250 °C before it reaches 100% at 1300 °C.

7.2 Effect of in-flight time
Three cases were modelled to predict the effect of in-flight time on the dust composition
and amount. The reference case parameters were used, ΔT was set to -50 °C and the
devolatilization time to 1.5 s. The temperature was set to 1300 °C in case 10, decreased
to 1200 °C in case 11, and in case 12, the temperature was as low as 1100 °C. The inflight time was varied from 1.51 to 3.3 s, with an interval of 0.2 s. Case 11 is presented
in Figure 32. The dust compositions for all cases are collected in Appendix C.

Figure 32. Effect of in-flight time on dust formation at 1200 °C.

52

Johanna Brink

The effect of temperature and in-flight
time on dust formation

When the in-flight time equals the assumed time of devolatilization, the negligible
amount of dust contains no Na2CO3, and almost equal amounts of NaCl and Na 2SO4. The
amount of dust increases from approximately 5 to 70 g/kgDS within the first 0.2 s of char
burning time, and at 1.7 s in-flight time, the dust consists of almost 40% sodium
carbonate. The amount of dust and the sodium carbonate content increase with a longer
in-flight time once the char burning has started. After 3 s of in-flight, the curves start to
level out. The effect of a longer in-flight time on the dust composition is the same as that
of a higher temperature.
The amount of dust as a function of in-flight time at various temperatures is presented in
Figure 33. Temperatures are indicated with different colours. At 1000 °C and 1100 °C,
the dust amount increases nearly linearly up to a char burning time of 5 s, while at
1200 °C and 1300 °C, the dust amount quickly approaches its maximum. Thus, a linear
approximation cannot be applied to these curves. At 1200 °C, the maximum dust amount
appears to be larger than at 1300 °C. This behaviour is a result of less sulphur released at
1300 °C than at 1200 °C, therefore, more sodium is bound to sulphur in the char particle
and is not available for releasee.

Figure 33. Dust amount as a function of in-flight time at various temperatures.

7.3 Reverse release calculations
Three sets of calculations were carried out to observe how changes in the release factors
affect the dust composition and amount. The initial step was to set the sulphur release to
53

Johanna Brink

The effect of temperature and in-flight
time on dust formation

a specified value and to calculate the sodium release required for a target dust amount.
The values for RB1 were used as a base. In the following step, the sulphur release was
kept constant, and the sodium release required for a high Na2CO3 content, 40%, in the
dust was calculated, to observe by how much the amount of dust would increase. The aim
of the last step was to obtain the same high carbonate content by changing the sulphur
release while the amount of dust was kept at 10% of the DS. The model was only used to
retrieve the temperature required for the release factors. The black liquor composition
that was used is presented in Table 7. Chlorine release was fixed to 34%.
Initially, the sulphur release was set to 31%, and the amount of dust to 97.5 g/kgDS.
These values corresponded to those in RB1. The temperature required for 31% sulphur
release, 1010 °C, was manually retrieved. Using this release-%, the molar amount of
released sulphur was calculated, which was the same as the molar amount of Na2SO4.
This corresponded to 77.7 g/kgDS Na2SO4. At 1010 °C, there was not enough sodium
release to actually form this much Na 2SO4. Released alkali chlorines formed 2.6 g/kgDS
dust, and the remaining 17 g/kgDS, after the amounts of Na2SO4 and NaCl were
subtracted from the total amount of dust, consisted of Na 2CO3. This amount was divided
by the molar mass of Na 2CO3 and multiplied by kgDS to obtain the molar amount of
sodium bound in this compound. The total amount of released sodium from one droplet
was calculated as Na 2CO3 + Na2SO4 + ½ NaCl, which equalled 12 μmol or 16.1% of the
total sodium. Whether the release happened in-flight or on the char bed was of no
difference.
The required temperature to obtain 16.1% sodium release was close to 1076 °C. If the
sulphur release was kept at 31% and only the char burning temperature was changed, the
required temperature for the sodium release would be 1074 °C. The difference of 2 °C
between the cases can be explained by a slight variation in the initial char particle
composition. The calculated values are presented in Table 14, and the calculation
procedure is summarised in Figure 34.

Next, the required change in sodium release to obtain a higher carbonate content in the
dust, for example 40 w-% Na2CO3, when the sulphur release was kept at 31%, was
calculated. The change in the amount of dust was observed. The amounts of Na2SO4 and
NaCl made up 60% of the total amount of dust, and the amount of Na 2CO3 had to be
53.5 g/kgDS to make up the other 40%. The molar amount of Na2CO3 and the total molar
amount of released sodium were calculated. The amount of dust increased to
133.8 g/kgDS, which corresponded to an increase of almost 4 percentage points in the
fraction of dry solids ending up in the dust. The total sodium release increased to 23.6%,
and the required temperature for the sodium release increased to 1104 °C. Values from
this calculation are presented in Table 15, and the calculation procedure in Figure 35.

Finally, the dust amount was kept at 9.8% of incoming DS, and the required sulphur
release to obtain 40 w-% Na2CO3 in the dust was calculated. The amounts of NaCl and
Na2CO3 were subtracted from the total amount of dust, and only Na2SO4 remained. This
amount (g/kgDS) was converted to molar amount. The molar amount of sodium (Na2)
was calculated according to Na2CO3 + Na2SO4 + ½ NaCl. The required sodium release
was 17.3%, and the sulphur release 22.4%. The temperature for the sulphur release
increased to 1132 °C. The calculation procedure is summarized in Figure 36, and values
from this step are presented in Table 16.

When the calculations were repeated using the composition of virgin black liquor (Table
6), the amount of released sulphur was smaller in all three cases, and the sodium release
did not have to change as drastically to impact the dust composition. In the second step,
the dust amount was still within 9-12% of the DS, and in the ultimate step, the
devolatilization temperature did not exceed the char burning temperature.

7.4 Simulation of ESP ash data
Calculations were performed to confirm the measured dust compositions at six recovery
boilers. The as-fired black liquor composition and the assumed release factors for sodium
(11-15%) and sulphur (31%) were given. Chlorine release was assumed to be 34%. Using
57

Johanna Brink

time on dust formation

these release factors, it was not possible to match the real dust compositions. In 4 out of
6 cases, insufficient amounts of sodium to form any Na 2CO3 were released, which implied
that huge SO2 emissions would exist. Such emissions would have been observed at the
boilers if this had been the real case. Na2CO3 was formed in two of the simulations, but
not to the expected extent.
The dust compositions found in practice in recovery boilers could be predicted by the
model only when the temperatures for devolatilization and char burning were separately
defined, and even by doing so, the predicted release factors did not match those given
along with the dust composition. The model managed to approximately predict either the
dust composition or the amount of dust, but not both simultaneously. The predictions for
RB1 are presented in Table 17, along with the given dust composition. The temperatures
used in the predictions are presented in the last row. Model prediction 1 matched the dust
amount, while model prediction 2 was the closest to the dust composition. The real and
predicted dust formation for all six boilers, along with the black liquor composition and
DS content of the liquor, are presented in Appendix D.

Discussion

8 Discussion
8.1 Sulphur release
According to the literature, sulphur release is not affected by the in-flight time. The
release expression (2) used in the model developed in this work only required the furnace
temperature as input, and approximated the sulphur release according to the bell-shaped
curve (Figure 12). Sulphur release seems to be well covered in literature and the release
mechanism is generally agreed upon, but various opinions about at what temperature the
maximum sulphur release occurs are found. At 1100 °C, the predicted sulphur release
was 25%, which is close to the expected value in recovery boilers.
The sulphur release during devolatilization primarily depends on the heating rate, which
to some extent depends on the droplet size. However, as Frederick et al. (1995) stated,
the release is independent on the droplet size at temperatures above 600 °C. Thus, the
prediction of sulphur release in the model developed in this work would not be improved
by considering different particle sizes.

8.2 Sodium release
Results from sodium release experiments described in literature are notably different.
Some of the sodium release experiments are conducted under inert conditions (He or N2),
while some are done with the addition of O 2, H2O, CO or CO2. Under inert conditions,
the only reactions that can occur are the reduction of Na 2CO3 (R13) and Na2SO4 (R4),
while, if not, other reactions consume the char carbon as well. The sodium release in
many reported experiments seems to be much higher than what is found in operating
recovery boilers.

8.2.1

The release expression and the reaction rate

In the Excel model developed in this work, the sodium release expression provided by
Frederick et al. (1995) was applied. However, after several model runs and having
difficulties with the mass transfer limitation, the credibility of the expression was
questioned, especially since the sodium release rate seemed to be too heavily depending
on the temperature.
If given enough time, the model predicts complete carbonate reduction. However, there
is no connection to the char carbon, which is needed for the reduction of Na2CO3, but
59

Johanna Brink

Discussion

also for the reduction of Na 2SO4, and consumed in gasification reactions and in
combustion with any available O2. The consumption of carbon by other reactions could
lead to burn-out of the particle before all sodium has been released, and limit the sodium
release (McKeough, 2021).
Further investigations whether CO and CO 2 affect the reaction rate at higher temperatures
would be of interest, since inhibition tests have been done only at temperatures at and
below 900 °C. Supposedly, the actual reduction rate would be slower than the original
rate proposed by Li and van Heiningen (1990). Tamminen et al. (2001) discovered that
90-95% of the dust is formed during the black liquor combustion and only 5-10% from
the char bed, which was earlier believed to generate most of the dust. However, no
explanation for this was proposed. Since conditions at the char bed are reducing, the
atmosphere will be rich in CO, a product from the gasification reactions (R1) and (R2),
and this could possibly inhibit the reduction of Na 2CO3.
Sodium release is affected by changes in both the in-flight time and the gas temperature.
The similarities between the change in dust composition over temperature and in -flight
time are pointed out in Chapter 7.2, and the dust compositions for the different cases in
Chapter 7.1 and 7.2 are collected in Appendix C. For instance, at 1100 °C and 1 s char
burning time, the sodium release is 15.9%. If the char burning time is increased to 2 s,
the sodium release increases to 28.4%. Correspondingly, if the temperature is changed
from 1100 °C to 1150 °C, the sodium release increases to 29.3%, which is almost
identical to the amount that the increase in char burning time resulted in. Further
increasing the char burning time to 2 s at 1150 °C gives a sodium release of 47.8 %, while
increasing the temperature with another 50 °C gives 46.6 % sodium release.

8.2.2

Mass transfer limitation

The mass transfer limitation is questionable, especially since it was a result of Frederick
et al. (1995) trying to create an expression that worked for all gas compositions. The mass
transfer limitation was used by Frederick et al. (1995) only when O2 was present in the
gas surrounding the black liquor particle. In those experiments, the sodium release was
much higher than in other gas compositions, and the real explanation to the higher sodium
release probably was that the particle burned hotter in O2 (McKeough, 2021).
Mass transfer ought to be the limiting factor, for instance, when reactants need to diffuse
into a particle from an environment with a larger concentration of reactants. The
concentration of sodium is larger inside and on the surface of the particle than in the bulk
60

Discussion

gas, and sodium needs to be transported away from the particle. However, sodium is not
a limiting reactant, but a product of the carbonate reduction (R13). The concentration of
sodium should not affect the reaction rate unless a partial pressure close to the equilibr ium
pressure is approached around the particle.
In the model, there is a small difference in the fraction of reduced Na 2CO3 if only the
kinetic expression (14) or if the complete expression including mass transfer (8) is used,
as demonstrated in Figure 37. The magnitude of the reduction will be the same regardless
of the expression. At 1200 °C, the largest difference in the fraction of reduced sodium
carbonate is 6%, while at 1100 °C, the largest difference during 5 s in-flight time is only
1.4%. Using the complete expression, the sodium release and dust amount can only be
underestimated, compared to if only the kinetic rate is considered.

Figure 37. Fraction of reduced Na 2CO3 using different rate expressions, T=1200 °C.

If the kinetic expression only (14) is used, the fraction of reduced Na 2CO3 at any given
time will be the same regardless of the initial amount of Na2CO3 in the char particle. This
amount depends on the sodium and DS content of the liquor, the droplet mass, and the
sulphur release, which determines how much sodium must be fixed to sulphur in the char
particle. When the complete expression is used (8), the fraction of reduced Na 2CO3 is
smaller at any given time if the initial amount of Na 2CO3 is increased.

8.2.3

Effect of CNa

When conducting the sensitivity analysis, the concentration of sodium vapour, CNa, in the
gas film around the black liquor particle appeared to be the most critical parameter,
61

Johanna Brink

Discussion

mainly because its magnitude was unknown. An iterative approach to calculating C Na was
tried out in hope of finding the value that would match the released amount of sodium for
each time step. For the first iteration, R Na was calculated using the value for CNa at
saturation pressure. The sodium vapour flux (in mol/s/m2) from the particle was
calculated as 𝑅𝑁𝑎 /𝐴𝑝 . The required concentration difference to allow for this release was
calculated as 𝑁𝑎𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑥 /𝑘𝑚,𝑁𝑎 . A new value for CNa was approximated as the average of the
bulk gas concentration and the concentration previously calculated. The smallest value
for CNa, that is, either the initially given CNa, the maximum concentration in 1 m 3, or the
recently approximated value, was used in the next iteration. A new Rm was calculated
with this newly obtained CNa. The iteration was repeated five times within the time step.
In practice, iterations were carried out only in the first time step, but the same effect
would be seen on any given time step. When this iterative approach was applied, nothing
was accomplished except that C Na was halved with every iteration, which caused RNa to
decrease towards 0. The iterative approach to finding C Na did not give any useful results,
and this led to further questioning the usefulness of the mass transfer limitation in
equation (8).

8.2.4

Predictions of literature data

Two attempts to simulate published sodium release experiments were made. The model
could not predict the experimental results of Li and van Heiningen (1990), when only the
kinetic rate of carbonate reduction (14) was applied. Model predictions for their series of
experiments, where the black liquor was heated to a final temperature, were made. The
target temperature was used for the predictions, thus, that the heating of the particle was
not considered, since only one temperature was allowed as input to the model. Using the
highest temperature resulted in an overestimation of the release at every time step.
However, the predictions were underestimating the sodium release for 4 out of 6
experiments.
The second attempt to reproduce experimental results was made for the single droplet
experiments and the modelled sodium release reported by Wåg et al. (1997). Predictions
were made for all experiments with a different combination of reaction time and
temperature. The different gas compositions were not considered. Using the expression
including mass transfer (8), the estimated sodium releases seemed to only sparsely match
the ones reported in their article. In most cases, the Excel predictions were not within the
reported experimental confidence interval.

62

Johanna Brink

Discussion

In these attempted predictions, the Excel TREND function was used. The TREND
function used a linear expression to describe the reduced fraction of Na2CO3 from 0 to
10 s. However, the reduction curve levels off as 100% reduction is approached, but the
extrapolation done for long experimental times did not consider this, and as a result, the
sodium release was overestimated. The Excel TREND function was not very useful for
the predictions of experiments with a long duration. Nevertheless, since some predictions
for the experiments by Li and van Heiningen (1990) were underestimations even if the
model should have made severe overestimations, and since the predicted results for the
work by Wåg et al. (1997) were too scattered, the sodium release expression applied in
the model most likely worked incorrectly.

8.2.5

Other approaches to modelling sodium release

Verrill and Wessel (1998) provided an expression including char carbon for the release
rate of sodium. The expression was based on the work by Li and van Heiningen (1990),
and did not include mass transfer. Later, Verrill and Wessel (Wessel, et al., 2004) put
more focus on ISP; An assumption that sodium would be released during devolatilization
due to physical ejection of very small particles from the black liquor droplet. Even if
Wessel et al. (2004) managed to model a sodium release of the same magnitude as what
was observed in recovery boilers using this approach, the measured amount of ISP was
much smaller (McKeough, 2021).
In an initial attempt to use the approach by Verrill and Wessel (1998)in the Excel model,
it turned out to be very difficult to estimate the carbon consumption while keeping the
model simple and focusing on only sulphur and sodium release. Reaction rates for other
carbon gasification and oxidation reactions were collected by Järvinen (2002). The idea
of using this expression was quickly discarded. The approach to sodium release proposed
by McKeough (2010) was not applied in the model developed in this work, since it had
some limitations.

8.3 Model predictions of CO3 and SO4 content in dust
Figure 38 shows the predicted carbonate and sulphate content (in w-%) in dust as a
function of temperature. When the in-flight time is 3 s, carbonate appears in the dust at
temperatures above 1044 °C. At 1200 °C, the carbonate content has increased to almost
50%. Within the same temperature interval, the sulphate content decreases from
approximately 60% to 10%.
63

Johanna Brink

Discussion

Figure 38. Model predictions for SO 4 and CO 3 content in dust, 3 s in-flight time.

The carbonate content in precipitator ash typically varies from 0% up to 25%. According
to the model predictions, the highest possible temperature would be 1085 °C, while the
temperature in cases with no carbonate in dust would have to be less than 1050 °C. In
comparison with data from the CFD simulations conducted by Engblom et al. (2018),
temperatures below 1100 °C appear to be somewhat low, since the CFD output suggested
an average gas temperature between 1200 and 1300 °C. When these temperatures are used
as input in the model, the dust amount is predicted to be 2.8-3.4 times larger than the
value in real recovery boilers. This implies that the overall release rate of sodium is too
strong a function of temperature. A slower release rate would result in a broader
temperature interval than the one in Figure 38, but the proportions between the carbonate
and sulphate content would remain unchanged.

8.4 The formation of dust
The dust formation mechanisms presented by Hupa (1997) (Figure 20 and Figure 21)
covered the assumed mechanism of dust formation at that time. The reason behind the
clearly higher observed release factors compared to the equilibrium (Figure 9) could not
be explained. It was not until the research of Tamminen et al. (2001) that the high release
of both sulphur and sodium could be explained, since their research proved that most of
the dust was formed by in-flight reactions, and were independent of the equilibrium at
the char bed. If this knowledge had been available earlier, it is possible that many release
experiments might have had a different approach.
64

Johanna Brink

Discussion

In the model, dust is assumed to form according to the procedure in Figure 21. All
reactions are calculated using stoichiometry only, but in reality, the reaction rates would
probably slow down when the reactants are consumed. The formation of Na 2SO4 possibly
continues along with the formation of Na 2CO3, but in the model Na 2CO3 is assumed to
form strictly after the formation of Na 2SO4 is completed. Any possible intermediate
reactions are not considered, nor any temperature dependence of the main reactions.
Neither are any decomposition reactions included. The dust formation predicted by the
model is the absolute maximum amount that can be formed, when all NaOH and SO 2
react.
The amount of dust in a recovery boiler is typically between 9 and 12% of the incoming
DS, equalling 90-120 g/kgDS. For instance, when the temperature is set to 1300 °C, the
model predicts a dust amount of 341 g/kgDS, which is more than three times the expected
amount. However, using 1100 °C as temperature input, the predicted dust amount is
within 9-12% of incoming DS.
In Figure 19, the fraction of sodium is similar in all four given dust compositions, even
though the CO3/SO4 ratios vary. According to the model predictions, the sodium content
increases slightly as the content of Na 2CO3 increases. This can be explained by the
difference in molar masses between Na 2SO4 (142.05 g/mol) and Na 2CO3 (105.99 g/mol).
In Na2CO3, the weight fraction of sodium is larger than in Na 2SO4, and as the share of
Na2CO3 in dust increases, the fraction of sodium will grow as well. According to the
model predictions, the fraction of sodium in dust increases with around 10% when the
temperature is increased from 1050 °C to 1300 °C.
A difference in release factors between sodium and potassium, and a temperature
dependence of the release of chlorine could be part of the reason why the model
predictions could not match the real dust compositions. The molar mass of potassium is
39.10 g/mol, while the molar mass of sodium is 22.99 g/mol. Since these two elements
were treated together in the model, the actual amount of dust could be somewhat larger
due to the heavier mass of potassium. Since the release of chlorine is fixed to 34% in the
model, this causes the dust to mainly consist of NaCl at very low temperatures where the
amount of released sodium is low. An improvement to the chlorine release could be made
by using an enrichment factor, where the chlorine in dust would depend on the amounts
of sodium and potassium in dust.

65

Johanna Brink

Discussion

8.5 Other limitations of the model
The model does not consider that Na 2CO3 can be reduced already during devolatilization
due to overlapping combustion stages within the droplet. While the sodium release in the
model starts after, for instance, 1.5 s, there would already have been some sodium release
in real cases. In this work, it was not investigated how this impacts the total sodium
release. If the black liquor particle was divided into layers to allow for different
combustion stages simultaneously, then the expression of the mass transfer rate (9) would
probably become problematic. The innermost layer of the particle would not be in contact
with the furnace gas, and, for instance, Reynolds number, which depends on slip velocity,
droplet diameter and the gas density and viscosity, would not be applicable to that layer.
Thus, the mass transfer rate could not be correctly calculated.
It is most probably incorrect to assume that the devolatilization temperature is the same
as the average temperature along the droplet trajectory, and that the char burning
temperature is 50 °C lower than the devolatilization temperature, as in the reference case.
It is likely that there are relevant differences in the temperature histories of droplets of
different sizes and trajectories in the boiler. Such details cannot be taken into account in
the current model. The assumption that the char burning temperature is 50 °C lower than
the devolatilization temperature, as in the reference case, is questionable. This statement
is backed up by the calculations in Chapter 7.4, where the gas temperature required for
the predicted sodium and sulphur release were constantly different. At temperatures
above 1000 °C, the effect of temperature on the sulphur release is smaller than the effect
on sodium release. A slightly higher sulphur release could be achieved if the
devolatilization temperature was set to a lower value than the average gas temperature.
The different compounds in as-fired black liquor are not considered in the model, and
neither is the combustion of non-condensable gases (NCG), which introduces additional
sulphur to the balance. Recirculated Na 2SO4 and Na2CO3 from the ESP alter the fractions
of sulphur and sodium in the black liquor composition used as model input. The sodium
and sulphur from the fly ash will be treated identically to that in the black liquor.
According to Harper (1989), the sulphur release mechanism does not include Na 2SO4,
and so, the sulphur from the recirculated fly ash is probably not released. If this is the
case, neither will the sodium in the ESP Na 2SO4 be released. Na2CO3 from the fly ash,
however, could possibly be subject to carbonate reduction by char carbon, identically to
some of the black liquor sodium.

Conclusions

9 Conclusions
The work reported in this thesis aimed to explain the sodium and sulphur release and the
formation of dust in increasingly larger recovery boilers. Comparisons with ESP ash data
show that the created model predicts too high a sodium release, which results in an
unrealistically high amount of dust at expected furnace temperatures. The amount of
sodium carbonate in dust, as well as the total amount of dust, are predicted to increase
with a rising furnace temperature and a longer in-flight time. The sulphur release
predicted by the model is reasonable and not depending on the in-flight time of the liquor
droplets.
The sodium release rate expression suggested by Frederick et al. (1995) does not produce
good results or may not be sufficient to estimate the sodium release. The reduction of
Na2CO3 requires enough available char carbon, but the expression does not consider the
other carbon consuming reactions taking place during the char burning. To obtain a more
credible sodium release rate, these reactions should be included as well. The mass transfer
limitation is questionable, since it applies to the transportation of sodium vapour from
the particle to the bulk gas and not the transportation of a limiting reactant , e.g. oxygen,
into the particle. A clear knowledge gap was identified here.
When the model output was compared to data from real recovery boilers, it appeared that
the model could predict either a dust composition very similar to the actual dust, or the
same amount of dust as in the real boiler, but not both at the same temperature. At a gas
temperature of 1200 °C, the estimated dust amount was much higher than what is found
in real boilers: 28% of dry solids compared to the typical 10%.
Both an increase in temperature and in-flight time have a very similar effect on the dust
composition and amount. If, for instance, a 50 °C temperature change does not notably
impact the dust composition in recovery boilers, neither should an increase in in-flight
time of 1 s. Similarly, if the carbonate content in dust increases due to changes in boiler
operation, it is difficult to verify whether that increase is due to increased temperature or
increased in-flight time.
Future work on the subject could with advantage include research on the in-flight time of
black liquor droplets, especially with focus on different-sized boilers. Improvements on
the model could be made by including all possible char consuming reactions , and by
67

Conclusions

better estimating the droplet or char particle temperature for every time step. Correlations
between time and the local temperature and composition of the surrounding gas would be
needed. These are available in a CFD model. For a more accurate dust composition, the
release of chlorine ought to be better modelled, and the difference between the release
factors of sodium and potassium should be considered.

Inverkan av svartlutsdropparnas flygtid på stoftbildning i
sodapannor
Sodapannornas maximala kapacitet har ökat kraftigt sedan slutet av 1990-talet (se Figure
1), och en av förändringarna som observerats är en högre halt av natriumkarbonat
(Na2CO3) i stoftet som samlas upp av elektrofiltret (eng: electrostatic precipitator, ESP).
Orsaken till denna ökning är oklar men den har antagits bero på antingen en högre
temperatur i eldstaden eller möjligtvis en ökning hos svartlutsdropparnas flygtid, eller en
kombination av båda. I detta arbete presenteras teorin bakom stoftbildningen, i vilken
svavel- och natriumavgång ingår, och en modell som uppskattar stoftsammansättningen
och stoftmängden utifrån temperatur och flygtid presenteras. Med hjälp av denna modell
kan man avgöra hurdan inverkan flygtiden och eldstadstemperaturen har på
stoftbildningen.
Svartlutens flygtid är den tid det tar från att luten sprutas in i eldstaden tills lutdropparna
når koksbädden. Flygtiden är svår att mäta men kan uppskattas till exempel med hjälp av
datormodeller baserade på datorstödd strömningsmekanik (eng: computational fluid
dynamics, CFD). Ett allmänt vedertaget värde på flygtid är ca 2 s (Frederick & Hupa,
1997).
Svartlut används som bränsle i sodapannor och är en restprodukt från kemisk
massatillverkning där sulfatprocessen tillämpas. Luten består till ungefär två tredjedelar
av organiskt material, främst lignin, som lösts från träfibrerna, och en tredjedel
oorganiska salter, som använts till upplösningen. Typisk svartlutssammansättning
presenteras i Table 2. Jämfört med andra bränslen har svartlut en mycket hög natriumoch svavelhalt, som till största delen härstammar från de oorganiska salterna NaOH och
Na2S som används i massatillverkningen. Dessutom har svartluten en mycket hög
vattenhalt, ca 85 %, innan den förs igenom indunstare där vattenhalten minskas till ca
15 % (Hupa, 1997).
En schematisk bild av sodahuset presenteras i Figure 3. Sodapannans syfte är att bränna
den organiska delen av svartluten och samtidigt reducera natriumsulfat till natriumsulfid
så att de oorganiska salterna kan återanvändas. Brännluten, dvs. svartlut blandad med
69

Johanna Brink

Svensk sammanfattning – Swedish
summary

aska och ersättningskemikalier, förs in i eldstaden genom lutsprutor. Förbränning av
svartlut kan delas in i fyra steg: torkning, pyrolys, koksförbränning och smältareaktioner.
Koksförbränningen pågår till stor del på koksbädden på eldstadsbottnen, där också
reduceringen av Na 2SO4 till Na 2S sker. De oorganiska salterna Na 2S och NaCO3 formar
en smälta som rinner ut genom löphål och smältrännor (Tran & Vakkilainen, 2008).
Optimalt skulle allt svavel och natrium i svartluten hamna i smältan, men i verkligheten
kommer en del att avgå under förbränningen. Svavel avgår som H 2S under pyrolysen då
tiosulfat sönderfaller och sönderfallsprodukterna reagerar vidare (reaktion R6-R10)
(McKeough, et al., 1995). Den maximala svavelavgången, som motsvarar ca 65 % av allt
svavel i svartluten, sker vid ungefär 600 °C. Svavelavgången kan uppskattas som funktion
av endast temperatur (ekvation 2) och beror alltså inte på flygtiden (Frederick, et al.,
1995). I sodapannor förväntas ungefär 15-25 % av den totala mängden svavel avgå.
Natriumavgång är kinetikberoende, d.v.s. hur mycket som frigörs beror delvis på
reaktionstiden. Natrium frigörs under koksförbränningen då Na 2CO3 reduceras med koks,
och slutprodukterna är natriumånga och CO/CO 2 (R13) (Li & van Heiningen, 1990).
Endast 5-10 % av stoftet formas från natriumavgång från koksbädden (Tamminen, et al.,
2001), och därför kunde flygtiden ses som den tillgängliga reaktionstiden. I litteraturen
finns väldigt avvikande resultat från Na-avgångsexperiment, och de flesta experiment är
utförda vid mycket lägre temperaturer än den i sodapannans eldstad. Temperaturen strax
under lutsprutorna är maximalt ungefär 1300 °C (se Figure 4), och påverkas av bland
annat svartlutens torrhalt och sodapannans last per bottenarea (eng: hearth heat release
rate, HHRR) (Adams, 1997), medan den maximala temperaturen i de flesta
laboratorieexperimenten var endast 900 °C. Gemensamt för experimenten är ändå att
andelen natrium som avgår ökar då temperaturen ökar. Natriumavgången i sodapannor är
ca 10-15 %. I modellen antas klor delvis avgå som NaCl, medan kalium antas reagera på
samma sätt som natrium. För att beräkna andelen natrium som avgår används ekvation 8,
som kräver att en reaktionshastighet och en massöverföringshastighet först beräknas
(Frederick, et al., 1995).
Stoft formas då det svavel och natrium som avgått reagerar till SO 2 respektive NaOH.
Förenklat reagerar SO2 med NaOH och bildar natriumsulfat (R17). Ifall det finns ett
överskott av NaOH kommer det att reagera med CO 2 så fort temperaturen sjunkit
tillräckligt för att natriumkarbonat ska kunna bildas i kondenserad form (R18). De bildade
stoftpartiklarna är ungefär 1 μm stora och fångas upp av elektrofiltret för att sedan

70

Johanna Brink

Svensk sammanfattning – Swedish
summary

återcirkuleras till brännluten. Ifall det inte finns tillräckligt med NaOH för att fånga upp
all SO2 kommer detta att observeras som svavelutsläpp i rökgaserna (Hupa, 1997).
I modellen som skapades i detta arbete för att uppskatta askmängden och
asksammansättningen beräknas först svavelavgången (i mol) och hur mycket natrium som
förångas som NaCl. Utifrån den kvarvarande mängden svavel och natrium räknas en
ungefärlig kokspartikelsammansättning. Därefter beräknas natriumavgången som en
stegvis process där reaktionshastigheten för reaktion R13 beräknas separat för varje
0,01 s stort steg. Ifall tillräckligt med tid finns kommer all Na 2CO3 att reduceras och det
natrium som fanns bundet till karbonatet frigörs. Vid 100 % reducering frigörs ungefär
70 % av allt natrium i svartluten. Reaktionshastigheten (ekvation 8) kräver att många
parametrar uppskattas, och en känslighetsanalys utfördes för att undersöka dessa
parametrars inverkan på den slutliga asksammansättningen. Asksammansättningen
beräknas stökiometrisk utgående från den frigjorda mängden svavel och natrium, och
anges sedan i g/kg torrsubstans och i vikt-%. I sodapannor ligger askmängden på ca 10 %
av inkommande mängd torrsubstans (ANDRITZ, 2021). Den uppskattade askmängden
vid olika temperaturer visas i t.ex. Figure 27.
Det visade sig vara mycket svårt att förutspå askmängden eftersom uttrycket för
natriumavgång (ekvation 8) inte fungerade felfritt. Na 2CO3 -reducering kräver att det
finns kol tillgängligt i kokspartikeln, men uttrycket beaktade inte de andra
förgasningsreaktionerna som kan ske under koksförbränningen och som också
konsumerar kol. Massöverföringsbegränsningen bör ifrågasättas bland annat eftersom det
i uttrycket handlar om transport av natriumånga ut ur kokspartikeln och inte diffusion av
t.ex. syre in i partikeln, vilket kan begränsa en reaktionshastighet ifall syre är en reaktant.
Reaktionshastigheten för Na 2CO3 -reducering ökade mycket drastiskt då temperaturen
ökade, och det är svårt att avgöra om en ökning av andelen karbonat i stoftet beror på en
större flygtid eller en temperaturhöjning i den nedre delen av eldstaden. Jämförelse med
stoftdata från riktiga sodapannor visade att modellen antingen kunde förutspå ungefär
samma stoftsammansättning eller stoftmängd, men inte båda två samtidigt.
Med hjälp av modellen är det ändå möjligt att uppskatta mängden svavel som avgår. Ifall
Na2CO3 -reduceringshastigheten justerades med hänsyn till andra kolkonsumerande
reaktioner kunde det vara möjligt att använda modellen till att uppskatta
stoftsammansättningen och stoftmängden vid en viss temperatur och flygtid.
