Abstract:
Professionals within the judicial system sometimes believe they can assess whether someone is
lying or not based on cues such as body language and emotional expression. Research has,
however, shown that this is impossible. The Finnish Supreme Court has also given rulings in
accordance with this demonstrated fact. There has also been previous research on whether party
or witness statements are assessed differently in court depending on whether they are given
live, via videoconference, or via prerecorded video. In the present study, we investigated how a
Finnish sample of district judges (N=47) assigned probative value to different variables
concerning the statement or the statement giver, such as body language and emotional
expression. We also investigated the connection between the judges’ beliefs about the relevance
of body language and emotional expression and their preference for live statements or
statements via videoconference. The judges reported assigning equal amounts of probative
value to statements given live and statements given via videoconference. However, judges
found it easier to detect deception live, and this preference correlated with how relevant they
thought body language is when assessing the probative value of the statement. In other words, a
slight bias to assess live statements more favorably than statements given via videoconference
might still exist. More effort needs to be put into making judges and Supreme Courts aware of
robust scientific results that have been the subject of decades of research, such as the fact that
one cannot assess whether someone is lying or not based on cues such as body language.

Abstrakt:
Rättssystemets aktörer kan ha en uppfattning att de kan bedöma huruvida någon talar sanning
eller inte utgående från personens kroppsspråk eller känslouttryck. Rättspsykologisk forskning
har dock visat att detta är omöjligt. Högsta domstolen i Finland har även gett prejudikat i linje
med detta. Tidigare forskning har vidare undersökt huruvida det finns en skillnad i hur partsoch vittnesutlåtanden bedöms beroende på om de ges fysiskt på plats i rättssalen, via
videokonferens eller som videoinspelade utsagor. I vår studie undersökte vi hur ett sampel av
finska tingsdomare (N=47) tillmäter bevisvärde åt olika variabler gällande en parts utlåtande
eller partens beteende, såsom partens kroppsspråk eller känslouttryck. Vi undersökte även
huruvida det finns ett samband mellan domarnas uppfattningar om hur viktiga kroppsspråk och
känslouttryck är i samband med bevisvärderingen och huruvida de föredrog utlåtanden givna på
plats i rättssalen eller via videokonferens. Domarna angav att de tilldelar lika mycket
bevisvärde åt utlåtanden givna live och utlåtanden givna via videokonferens. De ansåg dock det
vara lättare att bedöma om någon talar sanning eller inte när en part hörs på plats i rätten, och
denna preferens korrelerade med hur viktigt de ansåg kroppsspråk vara i bevisvärderingen över
lag. Med andra ord kan det ännu finnas en preferens för utlåtanden givna live. Mera insatser
behövs för att öka medvetenheten bland domare och Högsta domstolar om sådana
forskningsresultat som varit föremål för decennier av forskning, såsom det faktum att man inte
kan bedöma huruvida någon talar sanning eller inte utgående från personens kroppsspråk.

Finnish District Judges’ Assessments of Live Versus Video-Mediated Party Statements
in Court
Research on deception and deception detection has increased in the last decades, and
new methods for differentiating between truthful and deceptive accounts are constantly being
devised and envisioned (Curtis, 2021; Gamer, 2014; Levine, 2014; McCornack et al., 2014).
Bond and DePaulo’s (2006) meta-analysis comprising 206 studies with 24,483 deception
assessments showed that assessments of whether someone is telling the truth or not are
correct about 54% of the time (Bond & DePaulo, 2006). In other words, this performance
hardly surpasses that of a coin flip. It has moreover been argued that the around 4% that is
above chance is due to identifying a small group of liars that are very easy to spot (Levine,
2010, 2014; for a summary on deception detection research, see, e.g., Landström 2008, 2012;
Granhag et al., 2015; Schelin, 2006; Strömwall, 2010; Vrij 2014; Väisänen & Korkman,
2014). The legal community has also become increasingly aware that assessing deceit based
on nonverbal cues is not reliable (KKO 2021:5; KKO 2019:84; KKO 2013:97; KKO
2013:96). When judges engage in deception detection this ultimately affects the outcome of
the case through the legal concept of probative value (fi. näyttöarvo; sv. bevisvärde). The
court determines what has been proven and what has not been proven in the case and shall
consider the probative value of the evidence on the basis of free consideration of the evidence
(Finnish Code of Judicial Procedure, Chapter 17, Section 1, in force as of 1 January 2016). In
doing so, the court is required to first assess the probative value of every individual piece of
evidence (e.g., a witness statement or a party statement given for probative purposes) and
subsequently assess the probative value of all pieces of evidence as a whole (HE 46/2014 vp;
KKO 2019:2; Rautio & Frände, 2020; Virolainen & Martikainen, 2010). In other words,
when district judges engage in deception detection, it should always be done within the
framework of assessing a statement’s probative value.
Aside from the research focusing on nonverbal indicators of deceptions, other studies
have focused on the statement itself to establish if there are any criteria-based differences
between truthful and fabricated statements. Several models have already been suggested,
such as the Swedish formal structure analysis by Trankell and its German counterpart
statement validity assessment (SVA), the reality monitoring (RM) approach, and Sapir’s
Scientific Content Analysis technique. SVA has been the focus of much research, and its
most salient part is the criteria-based content analysis, which is a set of 19 criteria that should
be prevalent in deceitful statements. RM, with its roots in cognitive psychology, also focuses

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

2

on the differences between truthful and deceptive statements and contains a list similar to the
one in criteria-based content analysis. The lists in the SVA and RM approach contain criteria
such as “logical consistency”, “superfluous details”, “spontaneous corrections”, “clarity”,
“reconstructability” and “realism” (see, e.g., Hirvelä, 2006; Masip et al., 2005; Schelin, 2007;
Trankell, 1982; Willén & Strömwall, 2012). Many of the studies assessing the discriminatory
power of these models, especially older studies, have been criticized for having
methodological problems (Masip et al., 2005; Vrij, 2005). There has also been a call for more
integration between the approaches, especially between the CBCA and the RM approach
(Masip et al., 2005). In other words, the models have shown a discriminatory power above
chance, but more research and refinement of the criteria are needed before they can be used
in criminal cases. For such use, a model would need to reach a scientifically established
discriminatory power that exceeds the evidential threshold of “beyond reasonable doubt” (fi:
“ei jää varteenotettavaa epäilyä”, Rautio & Frände, 2020).
When these models have been tested, some criteria have received more empirical
support than others. In the CBCA approach, the criterion “quantity of detail” has received
substantial support and may confidently be used as a discriminator (Vrij, 2005). Some studies
have also shown support for the criterion “clarity”, sometimes operationalized as
“clarity/vividness”, while other studies do not support it as a reliable discriminator. (Masip et
al., 2005). Furthermore, there is convincing research evidence of the fact that false narratives
may be internally coherent and logical (Vrij, 2005). This means that the coherence of a
statement is not a valid criterion that can be used to discriminate between truthful and
deceptive accounts. There is also research suggesting that the consistency between statements
that have been given by the same statement giver but at different times, for example, during
the pre-trial investigation contra the main hearing in court, may not be a reliable
discriminator between truthful and deceptive accounts (Granhag, Strömwall & Jonsson,
2003). This has been thought to be an effect of the repeat versus reconstruct hypothesis,
according to which those giving deceitful accounts will try to repeat the same things they
have stated previously, whereas those who tell the truth merely try to remember what
happened and do not concern themselves that much with what they said previously (Granhag,
Strömwall & Jonsson, 2003).
So-called “paraverbal” indicators of deception, such as length of the statement, have
also been studied. In a meta-analysis by Sporer and Schwandt (2006), it was shown that
message duration was slightly, but significantly, lower for deceitful statements than for

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

3

truthful ones (unweighted effect size: Cohen’s d = -.113, weighted effect size: Cohen’s d = .080). This is a good example of how statistical significance alone cannot be used as a basis
for practical recommendations. The effect sizes are so small as to be practically irrelevant in
the court context, something which was highlighted by the researchers themselves (Sporer &
Schwandt, 2006). According to Cohen (1988), an effect size like this is similar to statistically
comparing the mean height of 15- and 16-year-old girls. This height difference, although
observable in large groups, is insufficient and not reliable enough when trying to assess a
teenage girl’s age based on her height. In other words, when analyzing whether statement
length differs between truthful and deceptive accounts, a slight difference can be found when
analyzing large amounts of data, but in the individual case, statement length is not something
the judge can use to discriminate between truthful and deceptive statements.
Deception Detection Amongst Legal Professionals
Although research strongly shows that there are no reliable cues to deception, people
continue to erroneously believe that such cues exist (DePaulo et al., 2003). International
studies including people with highly varied backgrounds have shown that the most common
cue people look for is gaze aversion (Global Deception Research Team, 2006; Granhag &
Strömwall, 2004). Research has shown that this is also thought to be the most reliable cue for
detecting deception amongst practitioners within the legal field (Granhag & Strömwall,
2004). One of the reasons for why this erroneous belief persists is the lack of feedback.
Practitioners seldom learn whether their assessment of deception were right or not. Judges,
police officers, and other professionals tend to be more confident in their deception detection
skills than lay persons, but research has shown that their deception detection is at the same
level as that of laypersons (Kassin, Meissner & Norwick, 2005; Landström, 2008; Porter et
al., 2000; Rosenfeld & Penrod, 2011; Schelin, 2006; Strömwall & Granhag, 2003; Vrij, 2010,
2014).
One further source of error that judges and other persons who try to discern truth from
lies tend to be affected by is the Othello-Error. The Othello-Error is the tendency to see signs
of nervousness as indicative of deception. Especially relevant for the courtroom scenario is
the finding that a person who has no intention to lie may be just as nervous as another person
who is lying (Vrij, 2014).
There is also research regarding emotional reactions to such events as sexual abuse,
trauma, and stress, as well as how these reactions are displayed in the court room and
subsequently affect the probative value assessment. However, victims of stressful events may

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

differ quite markedly regarding the valence and the strength of their expressed emotional
reactions. Some may cry, some may smile, others may exhibit restlessness or other signs of
nervousness, whereas others yet may be neutral and not emit any emotion (HäkkänenNyholm, 2017; Magnussen & Wessel, 2010).
To borrow the term used in the clinical psychology setting, the above presented body
of research shows us that there is an obvious scientist-practitioner gap between legal
psychology research and legal professionals, especially regarding the beliefs legal
professionals hold (for presentations on the scientist-practitioner gap as it relates to clinical
psychology, see, Cautin, 2011; Lilienfeld et al., 2013; Sobell 2016).
Case Law from the Finnish Supreme Court
The Finnish Supreme Court has given several precedent rulings regarding how judges
are to assess the probative value of party and witness statements. To a certain extent the
Finnish Supreme Court has referenced legal psychology research and issued guidelines in
accordance with this research (references to Christianson & Ehrenkrona, 2011; FinniläTuohimaa, 2009; Granhag & Stridbeck, 2010; Santtila & Weizmann-Henelius, 2008, in KKO
2013:96 and references to Duodecim, 2013; Melinder & Korkman, 2010, in KKO 2013:97;
see also KKO 2014:48). Other rulings, however, differ from what we would expect based on
legal psychology research. In other words, and in addition to the scientist-practitioner gap
presented above, there also exists a scientist-case law gap. Table 1 summarizes the most
salient legal guidelines from relevant Finnish Supreme Court rulings pertaining to the
probative value of a statement as well as a differentiation of what the individual variables are
that affect probative value.

The fact that the injured party’s
statement is deemed more credible
than the defendant’s is not enough
for a verdict. Even if it seems real
and is convincing, it needs indirect
evidence to support it. The reliability
of
witness

(fi.
henkilötodistelu) cannot be based on
the way the person talks, his or her
facial expressions or gestures or
emotional reactions. What is more
important is the statement itself, such
as the coherence, realism and
constancy in its salient content as
well as the amount of detail in it.

The way in which the statement has

that the right kind of interviewing has
been conducted, so that as much

Live Versus Video-Mediated Statements in Court
Similar to many other countries, a party being heard for probative purposes can be
heard using videoconference or other suitable technical means of communication in Finland
(Code of Judicial Procedure, Chapter 17, Section 52, in force as of 1 January 2016; see also
Ministry of Justice, Finland [OM], 2020). Statements given via videoconference or prerecorded video versus statements given live in the courtroom have been the subject of some
research. From a legal point of view, the most prominent concern raised has been that of
whether videoconferencing compromises the parties’ constitutional rights (Johnson &
Wiggins, 2006; Rowden et al., 2010). Should research show that statements given via
videoconference put the statement giver in a worse position than statements given live,
videoconferencing would probably be prohibited in the courts altogether.
As regards the medium of the video, there has been some research regarding whether
the camera angles or camera shots affect the assessment of witness or party statements and
the ensuing sentence (Dahlberg, 2013; Johnson & Wiggins, 2006; Landström, 2008; Rowden
et al., 2010; Thielmeyer, 1992); some research regarding the concerns of judges and other
legal professionals in relation to videoconferencing (Rowden et al., 2010; Wallace &
Rowden, 2018); some research regarding the limitations of communication when hearing
someone via videoconference (Wallace & Rowden, 2018); some research regarding how the
court’s authority is affected when the physical premises and some of the court “rituals” are
removed or restricted when hearing someone through videoconference (Dahlberg, 2013;
Mulcahy, 2008; Rowden et al., 2010; Wallace & Rowden, 2018;); as well as some research
regarding how the social interactions in the courtroom are affected by infusing modern
technology into it (Dahlberg, 2013; Wallace & Rowden, 2018; Rowden et al., 2010). While
this research and the debate as well as the concerns raised in connection with it are important,

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

7

this research has not shown that a statement given via videoconference would put the
statement giver in a worse position merely because of the medium of the video.
Some research has also focused on the view of the injured party, for example., how
much distress injured parties experience when confronting their attackers or how it feels to
recall a traumatic experience, such as rape, in front of the court (Häkkänen-Nyholm, 2017;
Kenniston, 2015; Thielmeyer, 1992). This line of research suggests that injured parties
experience less distress when heard via videoconference.
Furthermore, there has also been previous research and debate regarding whether
actors in the legal system assess statements given via videoconference or pre-recorded video
differently from those given live in the courtroom (Johnson & Wiggins, 2006; Kenniston,
2015; Landström, 2012, 2008; Levén & Wersäll, 2011; Perry, 2008; Thielmeyer, 1992). This
line of research and debate usually concludes that presentation mode should not matter at all,
seeing as there is such strong research evidence showing that deception detection rarely
exceeds the level of chance. Landström’s (2008) doctoral dissertation contained four studies
where truth-telling and lying adult and child witnesses gave statements that were assessed by
adult mock jurors with the aim of investigating, among other things, whether there were
differences in adults’ perception, deception detection, and memory of the statements as a
function of presentation mode (live versus video environment) as well as different camera
perspectives (close-up, medium shot, long shot, and more). Landström’s results indicated that
live statements were perceived more positively than statements given via pre-recorded video
for both adults and children, and that live statements by children were perceived more
positively than those given via videoconference. The results also showed that those who saw
a close-up shot were not as ready to believe the child’s statement compared to those who saw
a long camera shot. In other words, different presentation modes did give rise to different
evaluations. As regards deception detection on the other hand, Landström concluded that her
studies failed to find an effect where deception detection accuracy would differ between the
observers depending on which presentation mode (live / pre-recorded video /
videoconference) is used. Taking into consideration the research on deception detection
accuracy (or the lack of it) presented above, this is not surprising.
In another study by Landström et al. (2012), Swedish district judges were somewhat
more inclined to believe party statements given live than via videoconference or pre-recorded
video. Live statements were also assigned slightly more probative value than those given via
videoconference or pre-recorded video, supporting the conclusions drawn in Landström,

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

2008. However, there has also been at least one study where the mode of presentation has not
had any impact on assessments made about the statement givers (Ellison & Munro, 2014).
On yet another note, there is also research indicating that deception detection may
decrease in accuracy when using visual cues compared to audio or text presentations (Bond &
DePaulo, 2006; Dahlberg, 2013). Although deception detection accuracy may decrease, there
is research from both psychology and communication sciences showing that visual cues are
important in a communicatory sense. The presentation and message may be more vivid and
easier to understand when told live, because we also use body language, tone and the likes in
communicating our message. They may not be important indicators of deception, but they are
still important in communication and making ourselves understood as well as influencing
each other (Cordell & Keller, 1993; Dahlberg, 2013; Müller et al, 2013; OM 2020; Rowden
et al., 2010). Furthermore, videoconference fatigue and attention issues during
videoconference meetings have been shown to be an issue during the recent increase in
videoconferences due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Bennet et al., 2021). Technical difficulties
may also hamper the hearing, and obviously this is a problem that is not present in live
hearings (Powell & Wright, 2009; Rowden & Wallace, 2018).
The Current Study
Terminological Challenges
To study probative value, reliability and credibility in either the legal psychology or
the legal context it is important to consider how these terms are used in research and practice.
In the Finnish Code of Judicial Procedure (1734), the terms “credible evidence”, “reliable
piece of evidence”, “reliability of the piece of evidence”, and “reliable evaluation of the
credibility of the person being heard” all appear (Chapter 17 Section 2 subsection 2; Chapter
17 Section 8 paragraph 4; Chapter 17 Section 25 subsection 3; Chapter 17 Section 52
paragraph 3). In the preparatory works, it is stated that it is essential for the court to write
down its standpoints regarding the witness’ credibility and the witness statement’s reliability
(HE 46/2014 vp).
A distinction where factors regarding the statement giver are assigned to the term
“credibility” and factors regarding the statement itself are assigned to the term “reliability”
has been quite common in the legal literature (Holmgård, 2019; Landström et al., 2012).
However, this distinction has not been used consistently in either scholarly work or Supreme
Court practice. Sometimes “credibility” may refer to the person’s willingness to speak the
truth whereas “reliability” may refer to the person’s capability of rightly rendering and

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

9

expressing what happened (Holmgård 2019). Rasilainen (2006), on the other hand, defines
credibility as the correctness of the observation that the person is expressing and doesn’t use
the term reliability at all. In KKO 2021:5, the term convincing appears alongside the term
reliability (par. 98). In KKO 2017:12, the Supreme Court refers to credibility, even though it
is clear the “classical” distinction would refer to the matter at hand as one of reliability (see
the conclusion that the defendants’ statements were unrealistic and not credible, par. 27).
Again, in KKO 2013:96, the Supreme Court refers to the credibility of the injured party’s
statement and not the credibility of the statement giver.
Petterson (2017) concluded that these terminological inconsistencies constitute bad
legal concept formation. In her doctoral dissertation, Petterson, now Bergius (2021), suggests
not using the term “reliability” and goes forth developing the term “credibility” further,
dividing it into three categories: perception, memory and retention. Väisänen and Korkman
(2014), to the contrary, suggest not using the term “credibility”, seeing as credibility in the
Finnish legal context pertains mostly to the nonverbal cues of the statement giver, which,
according to legal psychology research, cannot be used to ascertain whether someone is
telling the truth or not. Therefore, they suggest using the term “reliability”.
Due to these inconsistencies, it was clear to us that we would encounter difficulties in
our survey were we to ask judges about credibility and reliability, since the contents of these
constructs would vary depending on the judges’ definition of the terms. To circumvent this
potential source of error, we chose to only use the term “probative value”, since irrespectively
of how reliability or credibility is defined, the question is ultimately how much probative
value judges assign to different variables.
Aims of the Study
The first aim of our study was to increase the above presented body of research from
the perspective of Finnish district judges, to see if the predictions that previous research gave
rise to held true, both regarding the judges’ views on deception detection and whether they
assessed live statements differently from those given via videoconference. This was the first
study of this kind in a Finnish context. We also conducted statistical analyses to see if the
views of the district judges differed as a function of their years in office, seeing as previous
research has shown that professionals are more confident (but not more accurate) in their
deception detection skills than laypersons, and that this confidence may vary as a function of
experience (Porter et al., 2000; Vrij, 2010).

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

The second aim of our study was to examine what probative value variables district
judges considered important, whether there were any differences in the weights given to these
different variables and whether there was a difference between how the statement of the
injured party vis-à-vis the defendant was assessed. To our best knowledge, there have been
no prior empirical studies similar to ours and therefore this second aim of our study was of a
more exploratory nature.
Hypotheses
Our hypotheses were the following:
1. We expected district judges to report assigning probative value to parties’ body
language and emotional expression differently than what research and Supreme Court case
law would call for.
Although our first hypothesis could have been extended to several other factors that
research has deemed important in the assessment of probative value of party or witness
statements, the scope and scientific rigor required for such analysis was far beyond the scope
of this thesis and as such, we restricted our hypotheses to the factors we deemed most
important for the current study, that is, body language and emotional expression.
2. We expected the district judges with more years in office to report assigning
probative value differently to party statements than district judges with fewer years in office,
especially regarding body language and emotional expression.
3a. We expected district judges to report assigning probative value differently to party
statements given via videoconference than to party statements given live.
3b. We expected the amount of probative value assigned to party statements given via
videoconference to vary as a function of how important the judges reported body language
and emotional expression to be in the assessment of probative value.
Our third hypothesis followed partly from the assumptions that were behind the first
hypothesis, namely, that district judges as a group would not be aware of research in legal
psychology regarding deception detection. If the first hypothesis was true, we expected the
third hypothesis to be true as well.
4. We expected that there would be a difference in how easy/difficult district judges
reported the act of deception detection to be depending on whether it would be done live or
via videoconference. We expected this difference to vary as a function of how important the
judges generally reported body language and emotional expression to be in the assessment of
probative value.

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

11

5a. We expected that there would be a difference regarding the importance of the
different probative value variables, that is, certain variables would be reported to be more
important for the assessment of probative value than others.
5b. We expected that there would be differences in the reported importance of these
probative value variables as a function of whether the statement that would be assessed would
be given by an injured party or a defendant.
The fifth hypothesis was more exploratory than the previous ones, as we were not
aware of any previous empirical research regarding the subject matter.
Method
Ethical Permission
The study received ethical permission by the Åbo Akademi committee for research
ethics within the field of psychology. Before accessing the online survey, clients read
information about the study and gave their consent to voluntary participating in the study.
Participants
The sample consisted of 47 district judges from various District Courts in Finland.
Materials
The present study was part of a larger research project done as a research consortium,
consisting of Åbo Akademi, the European regional institute in the United Nations Criminal
Justice and Crime Prevention programme network HEUNI, Tampere University and the
National Courts Administration. Alongside our research questions, the other members of the
research consortium investigated different aspects of how common the use of video
technology was among Finnish district judges, how the judges reported responding to videomediated hearings cognitively as well as what kind of training they reported being in need of.
We created an online survey for the present study, containing questions regarding the
importance of several variables when evaluating the probative value of party statements, the
media environment, deception detection as well as some background questions. These
variables are presented in Table 2 and 3. Closed questions on a five-point Likert-scale and a
five-point Osgood-scale were used to improve the reliability of the survey and analyzability
of the data. The scale and legend used for different survey questions can be seen in Table 3.

Procedure
Prior to the actual data collection, we piloted the survey twice regarding its contents
by having two persons that had previously worked as district judges but had later started
working with different assignments within the court system fill in the survey in real time and
simultaneously give us feedback. We modified the survey based on these feedback
discussions. After this, we time-piloted the modified survey thrice to get an estimate of how
long it would take to fill out the survey, the result being approximately 30 minutes.
The data was collected via Webropol in April 2021. The National Courts Authority
sent links to the online survey to all District Courts, from which the final respondents
volunteered to act as participants.
Results
Statistics and Data Analysis
We conducted all statistical analyses using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows,
Version 27.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Prior to analyses, we checked for possible
violations of assumptions. Violations are reported below, whereas met assumptions are not
reported.
1. Probative value assigned to parties’ body language and emotional expression.
The scores on all four of the following variables were not normally distributed, as assessed by
Shapiro-Wilk’s test (p < .05) and visual inspection of Normal Q-Q plots. Due to sample size
(Central Limit Theorem) as well as the nature and robustness of the one sample t-test, the
analysis was continued.
We conducted one sample t-tests to determine if the sample data differed significantly
from the theoretical value of 1, that is, that body language and emotional expression would
have no relevance for the assessment of probative value. Four one-sample t-tests were carried
out and tested against a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level of .0125 (.05/4). Results are reported
in Table 4.

2. Association between experience and how probative value is assigned to certain
variables. The scores on all four of the following variables were not normally distributed, as
assessed by Shapiro-Wilk’s test (p < .05) and visual inspection of Normal Q-Q plots. Due to
the nature and robustness of the independent-samples t-test, the analysis was continued, and
the results were interpreted with the limitation of this violation of assumption in mind.
We conducted independent-samples t-tests to compare the reports of district judges
with more than 6 years in office with district judges with 0-5 years in office on the variables
Body language, Emotions, and Live vs. Video (Deception detection). Six independentsamples t-tests were carried out and tested against a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level of .008
(.05/6). Results are reported in Table 5.

3a. Probative value assigned to statements given live vs. statements given via
videoconference. The scores on both of the following variables were not normally
distributed, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk’s test (p < .05) and visual inspection of Normal Q-Q
plots. Due to sample size (Central Limit Theorem) as well as the nature and robustness of the
one sample t-test, the analysis was continued.
For Hypothesis 3a, we conducted one sample t-tests to determine if the sample data
differed significantly from the theoretical value of 3, that is, that party statements given live
are assigned the same amount of probative value as those given via videoconference. Two
one sample t-tests were carried out and tested against a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level of
.025 (.05/2). Results are reported in Table 6.

Note. The t-tests compared reported scores to the theoretical value of 3, which represented “equal amount of
probative value to statement via videoconference compared to live” on the scale used.

Because there was close to zero variability between the different media environments,
further analysis in accordance with Hypothesis 3b was not conducted.
4. Connection between perceived difficulty of detecting deception live vs. via
videoconference and probative value assigned to body language and emotional
expression in general. Multiple linear regressions were calculated to predict how much more
difficult/easier the judges reported detecting deception to be live versus via videoconference
based on how relevant they reported body language and emotional expression to be in the
assessment of probative value in general. Two multiple linear regressions were calculated,
with two independent variables each and tested against a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level of
.0125 (.05/4). For both regressions, one leverage value above 0.2 was found. However, as no
Cook’s Distance values exceeded 1, there was no violation of assumption in this respect.
For detecting deception in the injured party, a significant regression equation was
found (F(2,41) = 5.25, p = .009), with an R2adj of .165, which was found to be below Cohen’s
(1988) convention for a small effect. For detecting deception in the defendant, a significant
regression equation was also found (F(2,41) = 5.26, p = .009), with an R2adj of .162, which

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

was also found to be below Cohen’s (1988) convention for a small effect. The coefficients for
both models are reported in Table 7.

Note. 95% confidence intervals reported in parentheses. A negative regression coefficient represents a
preference for deception detection live when the independent variable is considered important for probative
value. A positive regression coefficient represents a preference for deception detection via videoconference
when the independent variable is considered important for probative value.

5a. Differences regarding the importance of different probative value variables.
The scores on the probative value variables were not normally distributed, as assessed by the
Shapiro-Wilk’s test (p < .05) and visual inspection of Normal Q-Q plots. Due to sample size
(Central Limit Theorem) as well as the nature and robustness of the one-way repeated
measures ANOVA, the analysis was continued. There were also a few outliers in the data, as
assessed by inspection of the boxplots for values greater than 1.5 box-lengths from the edge
of the box. However, there were no extreme data points and no theoretical reason to remove
these outliers, and so they were included in the data and the results were interpreted with
these outliers in mind. Due to both non-normality and some outliers, the power of the oneway repeated measures ANOVA was decreased but Type I error rate was not substantially
affected.
To test whether there were any differences in how the probative value variables were
assessed, we conducted one-way repeated measures ANOVAs to compare the effect of
probative value variable type on importance for probative value assessment for the injured
party and defendant statements. Two one-way repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted
with 14 levels and 13 levels respectively on the independent variable probative value variable
type and the models were tested against a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level of .025 (.05/2).
For the one-way repeated measures ANOVA regarding the injured party, Mauchly’s
test indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated, χ2(90) = 225.29, p <.001;

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

19

therefore, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected tests are reported (ε = .48). The results show that the
importance for probative value assessment was significantly affected by the probative value
variable type, F(6.26, 269.17) = 63.40, p < .001.
For the one-way repeated measures ANOVA regarding the defendant, Mauchly’s test
indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated, χ2(77) = 117.60, p <.001;
therefore, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected tests are reported (ε = .55). The results show that
importance for probative value assessment was significantly affected by probative value
variable type, F(6.54, 268.43) = 70.93, p < .001. The levels of the independent variable, that
is, the different questions included in the questionnaire, are presented for both injured party
and defendant statements in Figure 1, in descending order from most important to least
important, ordered according to the scores for the injured party statement.

Theorem) as well as the nature and robustness of the paired-samples t-test, the analysis was
continued. There were also a few outliers in the data, as assessed by inspection of the
boxplots for values greater than 1.5 box-lengths from the edge of the box. However, there
were no extreme data points and no theoretical reason to remove these outliers, and so they
were included in the data and the results were interpreted with these outliers in mind. Due to
both non-normality and some outliers, the power of the paired-samples t-tests were decreased
but Type I error rate was not substantially affected.

Hypothesis 5b was tested by comparing the confidence intervals between injured
party statements and defendant statements on the one-way repeated measures ANOVAs, and
for those confidence intervals that did not seem to overlap or only overlapped to a minor
extent (as required for 95% confidence intervals), we followed up by performing pairedsamples t-tests on these particular probative value variables. Four follow-up paired-samples ttests were carried out and tested against a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level of 0.0125 (0.05/4)
A study of the confidence intervals in Figure 1 revealed four probative value variable
pairs (injured party vs. defendant) that might be significantly different: Convinced, Genesis
of story, Details, and Not convinced. Paired-samples t-tests were carried out for these four
pairs. Results from the paired-samples t-tests carried out on these variables are reported in

Discussion
In the current study, we investigated how well certain legal psychology research
findings and Finnish Supreme Court rulings regarding the assignment of probative value as
well as deception detection in different media environments (live vs. videoconference) have
been incorporated in the judicial practice of district judges in Finland. We also investigated
whether party statements given for probative purposes are assigned different probative value
depending on the media environment in which it is given. Lastly, we also explored whether
different variables regarding the party, such as the body language and emotional expression
of the party, or variables regarding the party’s statement, such as how detailed, how long, or
how coherent the party’s statement is, are assigned different amounts of probative value by
district judges. In connection with this, we also analyzed whether the amount of probative

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

22

value assigned to these variables differed for the injured party’s and the defendant’s
statement. To study these questions, we developed an online survey that the National Courts
Administration distributed to all District Courts in Finland, and the received survey answers
were then analyzed statistically.
The results of the current study suggest a concerning gap between the assessments
that district judges do and the scientific evidence from the field of legal psychology regarding
how important a party’s body language and emotional expression is for the assignment of
probative value. As noted above, research has consistently shown that body language and
emotional expressions should not have any relevance for the probative value of the statement.
These research findings are also reflected in the Finnish Supreme Court ruling stating that
body language and emotional expressions should not matter when assessing probative value
(KKO 2013:96). Despite this, the respondents of our study clearly deemed these variables to
have some importance. Taking the variable body language as example, only around 25% of
the district judges in our study gave the “correct” answer as called for by research and case
law, that is, that body language does not matter for probative value, whereas around 30%
answered that body language either is quite important or very important for the statement’s
probative value. The remaining 45% answered something in between. On average and
contrary to our hypothesis, judges with 0–5 years in office and judges with more than 6 years
in office held these same erroneous views to a similar degree.
Interestingly, although the role of body language and emotional expression in the
assessment of probative value seems to have been valued far too highly amongst district
judges in Finland, they did not report assigning different probative value to statements given
live as opposed to statements given via videoconference. As such, Landström et al’s (2012)
results from Sweden were not replicated in our study. Any other result could have had
problematic consequences. Seeing as recent developments in both Finland and Sweden have
led or are about to lead to an increased usage of video-recorded witness and party statements
in the court process, specifically the stages of appeal, a result showing that presentation mode
affects probative value would undermine the foundations of these developments (Dahlberg,
2013; OM 2020; Proposition 2004/05:131). At worst, it would also entail that parties giving
their statements in different presentation modes are not being offered legal equality.
Apart from asking how the judges assign probative value to statements given in
different media environments, we also asked whether the judges found it easier to assess
whether someone is lying live or via videoconference. Responses indicated that judges found

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

23

it slightly easier to detect deception live as opposed to via videoconference. Furthermore, our
results showed that the more weight judges reported giving to body language when detecting
deception, the stronger their preference for live statements was. There is a discrepancy here if
this result is compared to the fact that the judges reported assigning equal amount of
probative value to statements given live and statements given via videoconference. They
reported assigning equal probative value to statements given in the different media
environments, but at the same time they reported preferring the live setting when detecting
deception. There are at least two explanations for this discrepancy. The first explanation is
that judges may separate their mental processes into two dimensions, a factual and a
normative dimension. In the factual dimension, the judge would scan for cues of deception
through a more intuitive and perhaps automatic process, using such cues as body language,
which may be easier to assess in a live setting. In the normative dimension, the result of this
scanning would be ignored, and the judge would evaluate the party and their statement
through more deliberate reasoning, drawing conclusions and assigning probative value in
accordance with the legal framework that the judge considers applicable law. This
explanation would form a dual model with some parallels to that of Kahneman’s (2011)
model of System 1 (fast, automatic, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, deliberate, analytical)
thinking. There are two reasons why the first explanation is improbable. First, the
questionnaire contained numerous questions regarding probative value and had to be
answered from the perspective of the judges acting in their roles as professional judges, not as
people casually assessing other people on a more automatic and intuitive basis. Second, the
question regarding body language was presented in the context of whether it is important
explicitly for the probative value of the statement. The second explanation is simply that the
judges knew that they should answer that live and video-mediated states are assigned equal
probative value but in truth, a slight bias to assess live statements more favorably might still
exist.
As regards the relative weights of the different probative value variables, the results
show that certain components weigh more than others in the assessment of probative value.
These results were not surprising. For example, if parties are subjectively certain that their
statements are true, this should obviously not weigh as much as the fact that there is hard
evidence speaking against a party statement. The most interesting part of this analysis,
however, is two-fold. The fact that we can now present a profile with different probative
value variables is valuable in itself, since it dissects the probative value assessment process

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

24

into smaller pieces, as judges are required to do (HE 46/2014 vp; KKO 2019:2). This also
gives us the possibility to compare the weights given to different variables regarding the
statement or statement giver to what research, and case law for that matter, state regarding
these variables. Such a comparison reveals that there are certain variables where the
alignment of Supreme Court case law, legal psychology research and judicial practice remain
incomplete. The most salient of these are the variables of body language and emotional
expression, as has been discussed above. Other variables worth highlighting are statement
constancy over different utterances as well as coherence. The judges rated these variables to
be very important for the probative value of the statement. The Supreme Court of Finland has
also ruled that a statement that changes over time should be assessed as having less probative
value than a statement which remains the same across process phases and different questions
and, likewise, that a statement’s coherence is an important variable in the assessment of
reliability (KKO 2019:54; KKO 2013:96). According to legal psychological research, the
association is not that clear. Truthful and untrue statements may undergo changes in similar
amplitudes (Granhag, Strömwall, & Jonsson, 2003). There is also research evidence that the
coherence of a statement is not a reliable discriminator between truthful and deceptive
accounts (Vrij, 2005). Considering this research, the judges’ reported values on these
variables (Change - Process phases; Change - Questions; Coherence) are somewhat
concerning, as their responses indicate that these variables were quite or very important for
the assessment of probative value. The problem, however, is that district judges do not have a
choice. The scientist-case law gap, detailed below, prevents them from giving these variables
anything but high values.
Judges also tended to value the statements given by injured parties differently from
those given by defendants. How convinced parties are over the correctness of their
statements, how detailed the statement is, as well as how, when and where the statement
came to be (e.g., a statement arising pursuant to psychotherapy), were all considered more
important for an injured party statement than a defendant statement. How uncertain parties
are over the correctness of their statements was also given somewhat more weight for the
injured party compared to the defendant. These results indicate that there is a slight injured
party bias when it comes to assessing the probative value of party statements (for a discussion
on other, closely related biases in criminal cases, such as confirmation bias and the anchoring
effect, see Dahlman, 2018; Imhoff & Nickolaus, 2021; Lidén, Gräns, & Juslin, 2018).
Whether this injured party bias can be justified or not quickly turns into a debate in legal

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

25

philosophy: In a sense, one might say that the entire accusatory court process in criminal law
cases is a form of practical hypothesis testing, where the injured party comes forth with a
claim (a hypothesis) that is subsequently tested against alternative hypotheses in the form of
alternative courses of events (fi. vaihtoehtoinen tapahtumainkulku; Dahlman, 2018; Diesen,
1994; Marjosola et al., 2021; Schelin, 2007). If the injured party’s claims “survive” the pretrial investigation and proceed to deliberation in a main hearing in court, they will,
statistically speaking and on average, often have a basis instead of being fabricated arbitrarily
(see Dahlman, 2018, who discusses this thought from the perspective of Bayes’ theorem; see
also Hirvelä, 2006). It remains unclear, however, whether this is enough to grant them a
certain precedence over the defense or whether the risk of wrongful conviction when the
defendant is not guilty is enough of a counterweight to balance the scales, so that the
probative value variables at hand should be given equal weights for both parties. To try to
answer these questions would require another thesis but suffice to say that the injured party
bias that was revealed by our survey was somewhat surprising and should be the subject of
more research, as it may, at worst, endanger party equality.
The Scientist-Case Law Gap
Previous research has shown that there is a scientist–practitioner gap in the context of
legal psychology as regards judges’ assessments in the context of deception detection (Porter
et al., 2000 Vrij, 2010). The present study was in line with this research and showed that this
is also the case in Finland. There is also some research indicating that there might be a
scientist-practitioner gap in relation to how statements given live or via videoconference are
assessed (Landström et al., 2008, 2012). Results from the present study indicate that this gap
is not as large as expected, at least in Finland, which is a positive finding for the different
actors involved with the judicial process. It is also a good thing considering that in the future,
video-recorded statements and videoconferencing will only become more prevalent. The
most important finding in our study was that district judges did not report assigning probative
value differently to statements given via videoconference compared to those given live,
although they did betray a slight preference for live statements when explicitly asked in what
media environment they thought deception detection was easier.
Out of the different gaps discussed in this thesis, the most crucial may well be the gap
between the science of legal psychology and case law. The reason for this stems from the
legal system and its rule that lower-level courts are obliged to follow the rulings of the
Supreme Court (for a comprehensive presentation of the Finnish precedent ruling system, see

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

26

Launiala, 2020). As such, if the scientist – case law gap is vast, this should lead to a large gap
between legal psychology research and practitioners (i.e., district judges) as well. This
problem was also observed by Strömwall (2010) in the Swedish legal context, when
discussing the fact that the judges of lower-level courts need to apply a method that had been
validated by the Swedish Supreme Court but not by legal psychology research. Luckily, both
the Swedish and the Finnish Supreme Court have given new rulings since 2010 that are more
in line with legal psychology research and have, thus, decreased at least the scientist – case
law gap. It still exists, however, and there are certain variables regarding which the Finnish
Supreme Court still needs to be made aware of the legal psychology research evidence. Three
such variables are constancy of party statements between different process phases (Change –
Process phases), constancy of party statements between different questions (Change –
Questions) as well as the coherence of the statement (Coherence), as argued above.
Future Research and Practical Implications
At this point, there is already such a substantial body of research evidence on
deception detection as well as credibility and reliability assessments that they should guide
the probative value assessments in judicial processes. In Finland, many of these theses have
already been introduced to the legal profession via Supreme Court cases and by legal
scholars. However, there remains a gap between practitioners, legal psychology research and
Supreme Court case law, which is concerning. The current study was an attempt to increase
awareness of how district judges assess party statements’ probative value and how these
assessments align with research. This is important, as it can decrease the risk that erroneous
beliefs influence the probative value of a statement (Magnussen & Wessel, 2010). Currently,
it appears that if a party is giving a statement in court, it would be better to present the kind of
body language and the kind of emotions that are congruent with what judges believe is
important. If parties do not, they run the risk of giving a statement which is assigned less
probative value (see also the meta-analysis by Nitschke et al. (2019) regarding the “emotional
victim effect”, where the authors came to a similar conclusion).
While some variables, such as perceived cues to deception, have been the subject of
decades of research, other variables still need to be subjected to more study, preferably both
experimentally and observationally (see Johnson & Wiggins, 2006, for proposed research
designs). After that, we need meta-analyses and reviews that gather all the research evidence
so far and present it in a format which is easy to read and understand. This is especially
important for legal psychology, because there is also a scientific gap between the discipline

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

27

of law and the discipline of psychology (Marjosola, 2021; Stanikić, 2015). Empirical
methodology and the scientific-evidential value of different types of research is not widely
known amongst lawyers, at least in Finland (Hirvelä, 2006; Marjosola, 2021; see also
Schelin, 2006 from a Swedish perspective).
Strömwall (2010) suggests that the Swedish courts should apply the scientific
methods of SVA and RM in their assessment of witness or party assessments or, preferably,
that the courts would appoint experts to use these methods on the statements at hand. In fact,
SVA assessments have been accepted in some courts in North America as well as in parts of
Western Europe (Vrij, 2005). However, if one knows how the SVA tool works, it is not
difficult to give statements that appear more valid considering the SVA criteria than the
statements really are (Vrij, 2005, 2014). As such, the SVA or RM tools in their current forms
may not be the answers to our problems regarding probative value assessment of witness and
party statements. This has also been noted by Masip et al. (2005), who state that the
discriminative power of the RM approach is still too low, as well as by Vrij (2005), who
states that the SVA instrument’s error rate is still so high that the evidential threshold
“beyond reasonable doubt”, which is used in criminal cases, cannot be exceeded by using the
instrument. That is not to say that the tools are without value, only that we need more
research and that the tools need to be cultivated before they can be applied in the court
context.
As regards videoconferencing technology, it is likely that it will only continue to
improve. Kenniston (2015) states that the videoconferencing tools in Australia are already so
developed that you can “see sweat on the forehead of a witness” and predicts that, in the
future, there will not be any noteworthy differences between participation live or via video.
When this day comes, perhaps the debate regarding the probative value of video-mediated
versus live statements will be redundant. To a certain extent it already is. The question
whether it is easier or more difficult to detect deception on video versus live is not that
relevant, since the only noteworthy difference between these presentation modes is how well
one can discern the statement giver, such as his or her body language and emotional
expressions. Research clearly shows that no inferences can be made pursuant to these
variables anyway.
The reform in the Swedish court system, which started in 2008, and the one currently
underway in Finland (OM, 2020) may also be seen as statements from the legislator that
video material is not to be assigned any less probative value than material given live, which

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

28

was also noted by Dahlberg (2013). Although these reforms do not deal with
videoconferencing per se but video-recorded statements from the lower-level courts to be
used in later stages of appeal, the take-home message is the same: the medium of the video
does not decrease the richness of the statement in such a way that an assessment of its
probative value would suffer.
Limitations
There are some limitations that need to be borne in mind when interpreting the results
of our study.
As is the case for most empirical sciences, psychological research also quite often
suffers from sample selection bias, our study included (see, e.g., Coolican, 2014; Ziliak &
Mccloskey, 2008). This mostly stems from the fact that we used a volunteer sample, which
may lead to self-selection bias (Sterba & Foster, 2008), which in turn may decrease the
generalizability of the results. In our study, this limitation may have been somewhat
countered by the fact that our survey was sent through the Finnish National Court
Administration, who sent it out to all district judges in Finland.
Some violations of assumptions were found for the statistical analyses. However,
these did not cause any direct problems with Type I error rates or with the interpretation of
the results, due to either the tests being robust enough to stand the strain of violated
assumptions, considering the sample size (Central Limit Theorem), or due to the results all
showing the same type of outcome, with highly significant p-levels for all the different tests.
For the one-way repeated measures ANOVA, a violation of Mauchly’s test of sphericity was
corrected for by using Greenhouse-Geisser corrected values. Type I error rates for our
statistical analyses were also lowered because we used stringent alpha levels (Bonferronicorrections for familywise error rate). However, this did entail that the Type II error rates
were increased, resulting in low power for the tests used on those of our hypotheses that were
subjected to several simultaneous statistical tests. Therefore, the analyses might have failed to
find some significant differences between the variables under study as a trade-off of studying
numerous variables simultaneously (Field, 2013).
The present study used self-report measures, which sometimes suffer from a
decreased accuracy since respondents may not always be aware of their own internal mental
processes or because they answer in accordance with their theories of how certain mental
processes work. Both context, such as question order, and limitations of memory may also
affect survey responses. Furthermore, social desirability bias may distort some self-reported

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

29

measures (Holbrook, 2008). However, since the respondents in our survey gave their answers
anonymously, social desirability bias should not have been a major issue for our study.
The Likert scale used in our self-report measure may also have suffered from a few
limitations. Although widely used and often subjected to statistical analyses in the form of
parametric statistical tests, the assumption of equidistance between the Likert points is
sometimes not on par with reality and a more conservative approach would be to treat the
scores as ordinal data instead of interval level data. The scores on Likert items may also be
distorted due to central tendency bias, which may prevent some respondents from selecting
the outermost scores on the continuum (Brill, 2008).
Conclusions
The present study investigated certain aspects of the scientist–practitioner gap
between legal psychology research and district judges in Finland. District judges reported
assigning more probative value to body language and emotional expressions than legal
psychology research and Finnish Supreme Court rulings would call for. Regarding certain
other variables that are relevant for judges’ probative value assessments, our results also
highlight a scientist–case law gap. This can be seen in that certain probative value
components that the Supreme Court has deemed relevant lack empirical support.
Furthermore, our results indicate that there seems to exist both an injured party bias and a
slight preference for party statements given live. The preference for party statements given
live is somewhat concerning, as it may, at worst, endanger party equality and seeing as the
use of video technology in the court room is becoming more common. More research on and
refinement of different methods and instruments that may be of help when assessing the
probative value of party statements is needed. More effort also needs to be put into making
judges and Supreme Courts aware of what current legal psychology research has shown,
especially regarding robust scientific results that have been the subject of decades of
empirical research.

Swedish Summary – Svensk sammanfattning
Finska tingsdomares bedömningar av partsutlåtanden givna på plats i rätten eller via
videokonferens

Forskning och teorier om lögn och lögndetektion har ökat markant de senaste
decennierna, och det publiceras och planeras konstant nya metoder för att skilja mellan
sanningsenliga och icke-sanna utsagor (Curtis, 2021; Gamer, 2014; Levine, 2014;
McCornack et al., 2014). I dagsläget vet vi dock att endast runt 54 % av bedömningar av
huruvida någon talar sanning eller inte är korrekta, ett resultat som knappt är högre än det
man skulle få genom att singla slant (Bond & DePaulo, 2006). Olika juridiska aktörer har
även blivit alltmer medvetna om forskningsresultatet att lögndetektion till följd av ickeverbala indikatorer inte är tillförlitligt (HD 2021:5; HD 2019:84; HD 2013:97; HD 2013:96;
för en sammanfattning av forskningen inom lögndetektion, se t.ex. Landström, 2008, 2012;
Granhag et al., 2015; Schelin, 2006; Vrij 2014; Väisänen & Korkman, 2014). Trots en ökad
medvetenhet bland jurister har forskning ändå visat att olika professionella aktörer inom
rättsväsendet ännu kan ha vissa felaktiga övertygelser om lögndetektion. De har visat sig vara
mera självsäkra över sina lögndetektionsfärdigheter än lekmän, men när dessa färdigheter
testats har resultaten varit mer eller mindre på samma nivå som lekmännens resultat (Kassin,
Meissner & Norwick, 2005; Landström, 2008; Rosenfeld & Penrod, 2011; Schelin, 2006;
Strömwall & Granhag, 2003; Vrij, 2014). Med andra ord finns här en diskrepans mellan
forskare och praktiserande jurister (eng. scientist–practitioner gap), inte långt olik den som
uppmärksammats inom den kliniska psykologin (Cautin, 2011; Lilienfeld et al., 2013; Sobell,
2016).
I Finland är det möjligt att höra en part i bevissyfte med anlitande av videokonferens
eller annan lämplig teknisk metod för dataöverföring (Rättegångsbalken 17:52, i kraft sedan
1.1.2016; se även Justitieministeriet [OM], 2020). Sådana utlåtanden givna via
videokonferens, samt videoinspelade utlåtanden, har varit föremål för en del forskning. Det
största orosmomentet i samband med denna debatt har varit huruvida användningen av
videokonferens kan utgöra ett hot mot parternas grundläggande rättigheter (Johnson &
Wiggins, 2006; Rowden et al., 2010). Inom detta forskningsområde har man hittat
preliminära resultat som tyder på att domare skulle ha en högre beredskap att tro på
utlåtanden givna fysiskt på plats än sådana som givits via videokonferens (Landström, 2008;
Landström et al., 2012).

Vår studie var ett led i forskningen om partsutlåtandens bevisvärde i olika
mediemiljöer samt ett led i forskningen angående vad domare anser är relevant vid
bedömningen av bevisvärde och hur detta hänför sig till ovannämnda rättspsykologiska
forskningsresultat. Vidare hade vår studie vissa exploratoriska hypoteser.
Våra hypoteser var följande:
1. Tingsdomare förväntades tilldela bevisvärde åt parternas kroppsspråk och
känslouttryck annorlunda än vad rättspsykologiska forskningsresultat och Högsta domstolens
rättspraxis skulle föranleda.
2. Tingsdomare med mer erfarenhet förväntades tilldela bevisvärde åt partsutlåtanden
annorlunda än mindre erfarna tingsdomare, speciellt vad angår kroppsspråk och
känslouttryck.
3. Mängden bevisvärde som tilldelas partsutlåtanden förväntades skilja sig mellan
utlåtanden givna via videokonferens och utlåtanden givna fysiskt på plats i rättssalen.
4. Det förväntades finnas en skillnad i hur lätt eller svårt tingsdomare anser att
lögndetektion är beroende på huruvida lögndetektionen sker fysiskt på plats i rättssalen eller
via videokonferens. Denna skillnad förväntades ha ett samband med hur viktiga domarna
anser kroppsspråk och känslouttryck vara i bevisvärderingen överlag.
5a. Tingsdomare förväntades ge vissa bevisvärdesvariabler mera vikt än andra.
5b. Vikten olika bevisvärdesvariabler får förväntades skilja sig beroende på om
utlåtandet ges av målsäganden eller svaranden.
Metod
Etiskt tillstånd
Studien blev godkänd av Åbo Akademis forskningsetiska nämnd för psykologi och
logopedi innan datainsamlingen påbörjades. Deltagarna fick information om studien och gav
sina medgivande till att frivilligt delta i den.
Deltagare
Samplet bestod av 47 tingsdomare från olika tingsrätter i Finland.
Material och tillvägagångssätt
Studien var en del av ett större forskningsprojekt gjort som ett forskningskonsortium,
till vilket Åbo Akademi, HEUNI, Tammerfors universitet samt Domstolsverket hörde.
Vi skapade en online-enkät som innehöll frågor angående vikten av olika variabler när
domare tilldelar bevisvärde åt partsutlåtanden, mediemiljön, lögndetektion och vissa

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

32

bakgrundsfrågor. Enkäten piloterades flera gånger, både angående dess innehåll och tiden det
tog att fylla i den. Datainsamlingen skedde via Webropol i april 2021. Domstolsverket
skickade ut en länk till enkäten till alla tingsrätter i Finland.
Resultat
Vi utförde alla analyser med programvaran IBM SPSS Statistics 27.0. För att testa
hypoteserna 1 till 3 utförde vi ett antal t-test. För att testa hypotes 4 utförde vi en multipel
regressionsanalys och för att testa hypotes 5 utförde vi en ANOVA med upprepade
mätningar. I samband med alla statistiska test granskade vi potentiella brott mot våra
antaganden för testen i fråga samt använde oss av Bonferroni-korrigerade alfanivåer.
Resultaten rapporteras i tabellerna och texten nedan.

Diskussion
I vår studie undersökte vi huruvida domare ansåg att mediemiljön i rättssalen (live
kontra videokonferens) inverkar på partsutlåtandens bevisvärde samt vilka variabler domare
ansåg vara relevanta vid bedömningen av bevisvärde och huruvida de är i linje med
rättspsykologiska forskningsresultat. Våra resultat tyder på att det ännu existerar en
diskrepans mellan de bedömningar tingsdomare gör av parters kroppsspråk och känslouttryck
och hurdana bedömningar de borde göra om man utgår från rättspsykologisk forskning och
Högsta domstolens rättspraxis (HD 2013:96). Exempelvis gav endast 25 % av tingsdomarna i
vår studie det ”korrekta” svaret vad angår betydelsen av kroppsspråk i samband med
bevisvärderingen, det vill säga att det inte har någon betydelse. Såväl gruppen domare med
0–5 års domarerfarenhet som gruppen domare med över 6 års domarerfarenhet hade dessa
felaktiga uppfattningar. Detta är oroväckande, eftersom det innebär att en part som uppvisar
ett sådant kroppsspråk och sådana känslouttryck som är kongruenta med det en domare tror
att hör till ett sanningsenligt utlåtande bedöms mera positivt, något som i tidigare forskning
kallats ”det känslomässiga offret”-effekten (Nitschke et al., 2019).
Intressant nog uppgav domarna att de inte tilldelar bevisvärde annorlunda beroende på
om utlåtandet ges fysiskt på plats i rättssalen eller via videokonferens. Vi frågade även
huruvida domarna anser att det är lättare att bedöma on en part talar sanning när parten hörs
fysiskt på plats i rättssalen jämfört med om parten hörs via videokonferens, och på denna

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

37

fråga svarade domarna att de anser det vara något lättare att göra en sådan bedömning live.
Denna preferens för live-förhör korrelerade även med hur relevant domarna ansåg
kroppsspråk och känslouttryck vara i bevisvärderingen över lag. Det är möjligt att domarna
svarat på den första frågan utgående från vad de vet att de borde ha svarat, medan en djupare
analys ändå visar på en preferens för live-förhör med resultatet att en part som ger sitt
utlåtande via videokonferens i värsta fall kan sättas i en något sämre position i rättsprocessen.
Våra resultat visade vidare att vissa variabler i samband med bevisvärdering bedöms
ha mera vikt än andra och vi skapade en profil där dessa viktningar framgår. Nyttan med en
sådan profil är att domarnas bevisvärdering kan spjälkas i mindre delar samt att vi kan
jämföra dessa viktningar med vad de borde vara i ljuset av rättspsykologisk forskning och
Högsta domstolen rättspraxis. Utöver variablerna kroppsspråk och känslouttryck bör
variablerna utlåtandets konstanthet mellan olika yttranden samt utlåtandets koherens
uppmärksammas. Preliminära rättspsykologiska forskningsresultat antyder att sanningsenliga
och icke-sanna utlåtanden går igenom ungefär lika mycket förändring mellan olika gånger då
berättelsen yttras (Granhag, Strömwall, & Jonsson, 2003). Det finns även starkt
forskningsunderlag som visar att ett utlåtandes koherens inte är en tillförlitlig variabel för att
särskilja mellan sanningsenliga och icke-sanna utlåtanden (Vrij, 2005). Tingsdomarna i vårt
sampel ansåg ändå att dessa variabler är mycket viktiga för bevisvärderingen. Problemet är
dock att tingsdomare inte har något val, eftersom Högsta domstolen i Finland gett riktlinjer
enligt vilka dessa variabler är viktiga vid bedömningen av ett utlåtandes tillförlitlighet (HD
2019:54; HD 2013:96), och tingsdomare är bundna av den högsta rättsinstansens prejudikat
(Launiala, 2020). Med andra ord finns här utöver en diskrepans mellan forskare och domare
(eng. scientist–practitioner gap) även en diskrepans mellan forskare och rättspraxis (eng.
scientist–case law gap).
Slutligen visade våra resultat även att vissa variabler ges mera vikt när de bedöms i
samband med målsägandens utlåtande jämfört med svarandens utlåtande. Det är inte lätt att
tolka detta resultat, eftersom det även kan vara en konsekvens av hur brottmålsprocesser är
uppbyggda (Dahlman, 2018; Diesen, 1994; Marjosola et al., 2021; Schelin, 2007).
Hursomhelst är det viktigt att vara medveten om att en sådan här snedvridning i förmån till
målsäganden existerar, och det bör vara föremål för framtida forskning, eftersom den i värsta
fall kan hota partsjämlikheten.
Vår studie hade även vissa begränsningar som bör hållas i åtanke när man tolkar
resultaten. Volontärbias kan ha förekommit eftersom vi använde ett sampel av frivilliga

FINNISH DISTRICT JUDGES’ ASSESSMENTS IN COURT

38

respondenter (Sterba & Forster, 2008) vilket kan påverka generaliserbarheten av resultaten.
Vår studie använde även självrapporterade värden vilka kan påverkas av social
önskvärdhetsbias och leda till nedsatt exakthet (Holbrook, 2008). Dock gav deltagarna sina
svar anonymt, vilket minskar på risken för social önskvärdhetsbias. Vi använde oss av en
Likert-skala i samband med enkätfrågorna och antagandet om ekvidistans mellan Likertpoängen motsvarar inte alltid verkligheten. Likert-poäng kan även förvrängas något till följd
av central tendensbias (Brill, 2008). Vissa brott mot statistiska antaganden låg för handen,
men risken för typ I fel var ändå mycket låg. Detta innebar dock att risken för typ II fel var
högre.
Sammanfattningsvis antyder vårt studie att det ännu finns områden gällande domares
bevisvärdering där rättspsykologisk forskning, rättspraxis och rättstillämpningen inte står i
linje med varandra. Insatser behövs för att göra såväl tingsdomare som Högsta domstolen
medvetna om de mest robusta rättspsykologiska forskningsresultaten, så att både objektivitet
och partsjämlikhet kan tryggas i brottmålsprocesser.
