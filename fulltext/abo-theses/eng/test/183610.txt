Title: How children experience positive education - a qualitative study focusing on positive relationships
Supervisor:Katarina Alanko
Abstract:

Supervisor: Åse Fagerlund

Positive relationships are an integral part of both mental and physical wellbeing. As such they have been a focal
point of many positive education programs, but few studies have looked at the mechanism through which
positive change is made. This is problematic as educators have expressed difficulty in utilizing tools from positive
education in the classroom as a result of the vastness of the field. The current study attempts to gain an
understanding of how children internalise teachings from positive education and how this information is
translated into their daily lives. The study examines the effects of five lessons on positive relationships as part of
a positive education program spanning 32 weeks in total. Participants were children aged 10-12(N=72) from
several Finnish schools. The aim of this qualitative study was to understand mediating factors of change in social
wellbeing. Participants were interviewed in focus groups consisting of 4-6 students following the lessons. The
data was analysed using qualitative content analysis using an inductive approach. Three main categories
emerged: conflict management, listening and massage. The students had gained new ways of navigating conflict
and could use the lessons on listening to enhance their social cognition. Teaching students how to give a massage
served as a way of signalling differences between students and how touch and relaxation can be intertwined. The
analysis showed that important factors for transfer of material taught in class to students’ daily lives were peer
interaction, educators using an active pedagogy in class and use of stories as prototypes for social interaction.
Additionally, the results suggest that theoretical constructs can be remembered well by students in this agegroup, but a concrete experience is required for a change in behaviour. Recommendations for further research is
discussed.

Titel: Hur upplever barn lektioner om relationer inom ramen för positiv pedagogik- en kvalitativ studie

Handledare: Åse Fagerlund

Att kunna ta del av positiva relationer med andra är en betydelsefull del av både den mentala och fysiska hälsan.
På grund av detta har många program inom den positiva pedagogiken fokuserat på hur man kan stärka dessa
relationer. Trots detta fokus är mekanismerna bakom hur stärkta positiva relationer resulterar i en förbättring av
välmående efter en intervention i stort sett okänd. Detta är problematiskt då många pedagoger pekat på
svårigheter med att använda sig av verktyg från den positiva psykologin i sina klassrum. Denna studie ämnar bilda
en förståelse för hur barn internaliserar lektioner inom positiv pedagogik samt hur denna information används i
vardagen för att öka välmående. Studien undersöker effekterna av en 5 veckor lång intervention gällande positiva
relationer som var del av ett större interventionsprogram på 32 veckor. Deltagarna i studien var barn i åldern 1012(N=72) från skolor runtom i Svenskfinland. Målet med denna kvalitativa studie var att kartlägga de mekanismer
som bidrog till förändringar i välmående. Deltagarna intervjuades i fokusgrupper beståendes av 4-6 elever. Datat
som insamlades analyserades med hjälp av en induktiv innehållsanalys. Tre huvudkategorier framkom:
konflikthantering, att lyssna och massage. Eleverna hade lärt sig nya sätt att hantera konflikter och kunde
använda lektionerna om lyssnande för att reflektera kring faktorer bakom problem i relationer. Eleverna hade
även lärt sig att ge någon annan en massage vilket även gav dem information om hur beröring och avslappning
kan höra ihop. Analysen pekade på att interaktion med jämnåriga då materialet lärdes ut var viktigt för dess
inverkan på barnens vardag. Lärare som använder sig av aktiva undervisningsmetoder verkade även ha bättre
effekt, att använda sig av historier och prototyper för beteende var även effektivt. Resultaten visade även på att
barn i denna åldersgrupp kan använda sig av och komma ihåg konstrukt från den positiva psykologin, men att
konkreta exempel eller övningar var nödvändiga/hjälpsamma för att informationen skulle ha en effekt på
barnens vardag. Rekommendationer för vidare forskning diskuteras.

Introduction
Schools are important environments for the integration of the individual into society and an
important learning environment for skills and thinking strategies that contribute to well-being and, thus, a
viable arena for the acquisition of such skills (Seligman, 2011). For this reason, governments have
encouraged schools to socialise their pupils into a modern and changing world while preparing them for
dealing with possible problems with mental health. In Finland, the values of the national curriculum
emphasize maximising the potential of the individual, enabling the individual to find personal strengths, a
positive identity, and the tools to manage a modern world (Finnish national curriculum 2014, p. 18). These
values are in line with the theoretical model of positive psychology and shows the conceptual applicability
of positive education in the education system. The prospect of finding robust and effective interventions to
reach the abovementioned goals is becoming increasingly important, as mental well-being in adolescents
seems to be experiencing a downward trend in many parts of the world (World Health Organisation, 2020).
Studies examining the trends in the United States show an alarming increase in the prevalence of mental
illnesses in schoolchildren and the population at large during the last 10 years (Twenge et al., 2019). A
similar trend was seen in a report conducted by the World Health Organisation which noted unprecedented
rates of mental illness among adolescents in Europe and Canada (World Health Organisation, 2020).
Additional support for this decline can be found in studies from the UK, Australia and the USA which
indicate that adolescents are experiencing higher rates of depression, anxiety and suicide ideation
compared to previous generations. (Bloch, 2016; Bor et al., 2014; Patel et al., 2007). These statistics extend
to Finland where longitudinal data has shown a steady increase of mental illnesses during adolescence
(Gyllenberg et al., 2018). In addition to anguish suffered by the individual, a decline in mental health affects
societies economically and functionally. As such an increased interest in how best to build interventions

1

and systems to prevent or even revert this trend has emerged from both governments and individuals
worldwide.

Positive Education
Positive education is an umbrella term defined as the application of techniques, philosophies and
strategies derived from positive psychology, applied in a school environment. In the words of its founder
Martin Seligman positive education is “education for both traditional skills and for happiness” (Seligman et
al., 2009). The goal of positive education is thus to promote positive mental health in a school environment
(Norrish et al., 2013). Positive education has been developed to be actionable and combines elements from
research on positive psychology with the best practice guidelines from education (Slemp et al., 2017).
Interventions are often modelled after the PERMA model of well-being and integrated into the already
existing curriculum. The PERMA model consists of five distinct areas believed to be integral for flourishing:
Positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning and achievement. Interventions are often modelled
to cover them all. Positive education has the ambition to provide an increase in well-being and function as a
buffer for mental illness. With success-stories such as the Geelong grammar school gaining traction,
interventions incorporating elements of positive psychology are becoming ever more frequent (Slemp et
al., 2017; International Positive Education Network. 2017). This seems to be a global phenomenon as
educators and psychologists all over the world are implementing positive education (Seligman & Alder
2018). More and more evidence is showing that that interventions derived from the PERMA model are
effective at solidifying and strengthening well-being and are well suited for application in schools (Norrish
et al., 2013; Seligman, 2011; Seligman et al., 2009:Kern et al., 2015; Shoshani et al., 2016; Waters, 2011). A
meta-analysis on positive psychology interventions in education from 2013 showed that significant but
modest effects can be achieved on subjective and personal well-being in addition to a decrease in
depressive symptoms (Haverman et al., 2013). This development, both scientific and political, has made it
clear that positive education is here to stay. However, research is urgently needed to guide the
development of best practice guidelines and implementation standards.

2

A review of well over 500 implementation studies on various types of health promotion and
prevention studies pointed out that effect sizes are two to three times higher in a context where a program
is carefully implemented, i.e., pays attention to contextual factors and is truthful to its source material
(Durlak & DuPree, 2008). As positive education shares characteristics with these programs it can be
assumed that the effectiveness of an intervention could be affected by implementation style. As such it
becomes crucial to understand the mediators of this change to be able to replicate the positive effects of
positive education. A decline in efficacy of positive psychology interventions compared to previous reviews
and meta-analysies has been observed in a recent meta-analysis and while the effects on wellbeing stay
significant, effect sizes have dropped (Carmela et.,al 2019). This decline in efficacy calls for an observation
of mediators underpinning successful interventions. Within recent years many research projects have
focused on the effectiveness of positive education interventions , yet little is known about the mechanisms
mediating this change and what implementation praxis should be used (Halliday et al., 2019a, p.174). This is
problematic as it has been shown that the vastness of the field makes it hard for educators to grasp and
consequently implement positive education interventions (White & Murray 2015; White 2016; White &
Kern 2018). In other words, evidence and knowledge of how best to implement it in complex school
systems is scarce (Conoley et al., 2014). Schools are multifaceted environments with multiple mediating
variables which need to be understood to develop robust and replicable interventions. Many studies have
used questionnaires to report the efficacy of positive education interventions (Crawford & Henry 2010;
Diener, 1984). Quantitative methods such as questionnaires serve a purpose in allowing the phenomenon
to be observed and evaluated empirically and compared to other school-based interventions but is illequipped to identify mediating variables. The fact that respondents are children also presents
methodological problems as the developmental profile of the child regarding memory capacity and verbal
processing makes understanding written questions and summarising ones thoughts more difficult. (Leeuw,
2011). Qualitative designs then become crucial, as this is information not easily conveyed solely by
quantitative means.

Positive Relationships
Having fulfilling relationships is a key part of living a meaningful and happy life. Positive
relationships are defined as being able to rely on others for support while feeling that these connections
are secure and authentic (Seligman, 2011). There is ample evidence that relationships contribute to
important factors relating to well-being such as engagement, academic success and resilience while
preventing loneliness, attendance problems and social anxiety (Shoshani et al., 2016; Slone & Shoshani,
2008, Hymel et al., 1996). Positive relationships have been shown to be able to elevate the level of positive
emotion experienced which has crucial connections to subjective well-being (Vittengl & Holt, 1998).
Positive education tries to create a foundation for positive relationships by making students more aware of
different ways of interacting with others and provide avenues for connection and friendship. Interventions
focusing on these elements have been shown to significantly strengthen relationships (Boehm &
Lyubomirsky, 2009).
While the PERMA model is a powerful tool for predicting well-being, the elements of the model are
correlated moderately highly (range .37 to .79, mean = .61) with each other (Forgeard et al., 2011). As such
it is possible that there is a varying degree of influence exerted on well-being by different elements of the
model. In the current study one of the elements of the PERMA model, relationships, is examined and it
could be hypothesised that relationships exert a larger effect on well-being than other elements of the
model. This is supported by findings that the upper 10% of consistently happy people differ from less happy
people in terms of their relationships, and that relationships are a must for reaching such a state (Diener &
Seligman, 2002). A meta-analysis of 39 studies regarding social capital showed that the prevalence of good
relationships increased the likelihood of good health by 27%. These odds were further increased if variables
such as reciprocity (39%) and trust (32%) were present (Uchino et al., 1996). Reciprocity and trust are at the
core of positive relationships and could be an important variable in explaining why positive education
increases well-being. A description of how participants internalised and benefitted from the concepts of
positive relationships is important for understanding the mechanisms mediating a change in well-being.

The Building Blocks of Fostering Positive Relationships
Many different methods of facilitating positive relationships have sprung up over the years. The
common denominator seems to be to learn strategies for communicating and interacting with others. To
be able to interact with others in a balanced fashion, emotional regulation is important. In order to able to
regulate ones emotions, emotional intelligence is required. Therefore, strategies focusing on strengthening
emotional intelligence are often integrated in positive education and refers to the teaching of cognitive
strategies with the goal of improving regulation of emotion-eliciting events. Mayer and colleagues have
modelled emotional intelligence as consisting of the following areas: (a) perceiving emotions, (b) using
emotions to facilitate thought, (c) understanding emotions, and (d) managing emotions in a way that
enhances personal growth and social relations (Mayer et al., 2001). The following sections will detail the
theoretical underpinnings of methods used in strengthening emotional regulation in the current study:
teaching children new models for social interaction, honing listening skills and social reciprocity and giving
and receiving a massage as an arena for exploring reciprocity and touch.

Teaching Models for Social Interaction
A prevalent way of achieving change is by teaching new models for dealing with emotions and
social situations. Programs focusing on social emotional learning have had positive effects on emotional,
social, and academic performance, as highlighted by a meta-analysis of 213 interventions on social
emotional learning (Durlak et al.,2011). Positive education incorporates both how to deal with negative
emotions and how to note and increase the frequency of positive emotions. This allows participants to
develop greater psychological flexibility, which has been proven to be a key correlate for life satisfaction
(Gruber et al., 2013; Kashdan & Rottenberg 2010; Quoidbach et al., 2015).
One important aspect of social interaction is assertiveness, the ability to express one's
personal needs and wishes while also taking into account and respecting others (Rakus, 1991). It has been
shown that not being able to be assertive is associated with reduced well-being (Sarkova et al., 2013).
Adolescents have particularly much to gain from assertiveness as there is evidence to suggest positive
effects on social interactions with adults and peers, improved academic performance and a reduction in
5

aggressive behaviour (Farley & Kim-Spoon 2014; Laursen & Mooney 2008;Plenty et al., 2014; Eslami et al.,
2016). The ability to be assertive when needed allows one to give signals to others on how you wish to be
treated and serves as a buffer for stress. One model for enhancing assertiveness is the DESC model, which
details four distinct steps to follow when being assertive: Describe, Express, Specify, and Consequences
(Bower & Bower, 1991). The model offers a template for giving feedback that does not cause a threat
response in the recipient, instead focusing on clarifying the matter in a balanced way and thus increasing
the chances for further collaboration.
Another behaviour pattern often utilised is how to react to positive events. It has been shown that
the style used when someone else is sharing a positive event is a better predictor for the well-being of a
relationship than responses to negative events (Gable et al., 2004). The mechanisms of this are thought to
be that additional positive emotion is generated if the person’s experience is properly validated and that
these positive interactions become a template of how relationships ought to be, thus strengthening them.
On the contrary, not acknowledging positive emotion may dampen and eradicate their expression. Thus,
being able to boost positive affect becomes an upward spiral increasing the quality of relationships
(Fredrickson, 2001). Active-constructive responding (ACR) is a commonly used model for teaching this skill.
The model focuses on facilitating relationships by fostering empathic listening, acknowledging and
validating what has been said while being an active conversationalist. In practice, the model divides
conversation partner styles into four groups where the goal is to show the advantages of being active and
constructive and the drawbacks of not doing so (Gable et al., 2004.; Gable et al., 2006; Magyar & Moe,
2009).
While evidence is scarce on the efficacy of the model, studies have shown that the model can have
significant effects on gratitude (Woods et al., 2014). Additionally, using an active-constructive
conversational style was found to be beneficial regarding relationship satisfaction (Gable et al., 2004.;
Gable, Gonzaga & Strachman, 2006).

Kindness and Gratitude
An integral part of many positive education interventions is being kind to oneself and others.
6

Interventions have therefore focused on teaching the value of valuing oneself and forgiving oneself and
others for failures. A higher degree of gratitude has also been linked to more satisfactory relationships
(Froh et al., 2009). The idea is that an increase in gratitude is an important mediator for improving
relationships. As such, interventions have been put forth with this goal in mind.
The act of actively being grateful for events and experiences has been linked to an increase in positive
affect and interpersonal benefits (Emmons & Mccullough, 2003). A common way to practice this skill is to
list things that the person is grateful for and ponder ways of increasing the frequency of such events.
Methods commonly used include gratitude journaling, writing a letter where gratitude is expressed or
writing one which aims to forgive. Another common method is to encourage students to perform acts of
kindness which entails that students show gratitude or are kind to another person. (Waters, 2011). A metaanalysis looking at the effect of those performing the random acts of kindness showed there to be a small
to medium effect size on subjective well-being, in addition to creating a less hostile and more
compassionate environment (Curry et al., 2018).
Another venue for teaching kindness and gratitude is through mindfulness. A 2018 review of the
effects of meditation on predictors for prosocial behaviour i.e., positive interactions with others, concluded
that mindfulness can be used to increase the likelihood of prosocial behaviour and increase compassion
(Luberto et al., 2018).

Physical Touch and Oxytocin
Oxytocin is a neurotransmitter involved in bonding between primates and is released
through touch. In humans, it has been shown that oxytocin plays an important role in social cognition,
bonding and prosocial behaviour (Viero et al., 2010). One way of achieving an increase in oxytocin is giving
and receiving a massage as both have been shown to increase oxytocin levels while, additionally,
decreasing adrenocorticotropin levels, which reduces the secretion of stress hormones such as cortisol
(Morhenn et al., 2012). It is hypothesised that these hormonal changes are a big part of why social
relationships reduce morbidity rates. While the field is still in an early stage regarding scientific scrutiny, a
7

meta-analysis from 2004 showed that a single massage can have an effect on state anxiety while lowering
blood pressure and heart rate (Moyer et al., 2004). A 6-month study on pre-schoolers concluded that a
massage lasting 5-10 minutes could be an easy and inexpensive way to reduce somatic, social and
behavioural problems relating to aggression (Knorring et al., 2008). Another study found that aggressive
behaviours could be reduced in elementary schools by having children give each other massages, indicating
a use for massage in reducing aggressive behaviour in elementary schools (Gonçalves et al., 2017). In
positive education, tasks that involve students massaging each other can be used as a tool to convey how
we all react differently to the same stimuli. It can also illustrate how touch can have a soothing effect while
illustrating the importance of recovery.

The Current Study
The current study formed part of a larger study in which an intervention spanning the entire
PERMA model was implemented in several Finnish schools (Laakso et al., 2020). The focus of this paper is
the positive relationship unit, which utilised exercises and theory from the areas detailed above, specifically
the DESC and ACR model, a massage instruction, and a loving kindness meditation exercise. Additionally,
theory regarding positive psychology was introduced through normal teaching and dramatizations.
The current study aims to extract data about how children internalise lessons on positive
relationships and how the information is translated into their daily lives. This examination is important, as a
gap exists in the positive education literature regarding factors influencing learning and application of
positive relationship concepts in the daily lives of students. A qualitative analysis of the intervention adds
perspectives on positive education that can be used for the conceptualisation of new theory while
providing insight into how the intervention affects participants. An equally important goal was gathering
ecologically valid information that can be used to bridge the researcher-practitioner gap and, thus, aid
interdisciplinary enrichment and formation of best practice guidelines. Consequently, the study aims to
uncover mechanisms for change in well-being attained from lessons on positive relationships. As there is
ample evidence regarding the importance of positive relationships for well-being, examination of its use in
positive education is warranted and crucial for further evolution of the field.
8

The design of the study is inductive and exploratory and utilizes qualitative content analysis as its
method. No hypotheses were formulated a priori. The research questions “How have the participants
internalised the lessons on positive relationships?” and “How have participants used the lessons to modify
their well-being?” were formulated to reflect this goal. The aim of the paper is twofold:

1.

To gain insight into how children understand social interaction following lessons on positive
relationships

2. To gain a greater understanding of how the knowledge gained through the lessons is translated
into everyday life

Method

Context and aim
This study was part of a larger study examining the effect of implementing weekly positive
education classes for an entire school year. The intervention spanned five different areas all derived from
the PERMA model and was organised in Swedish-speaking schools in metropolitan and western Finland.
(Laakso et al., 2020). The purpose of the study was to assess how the effects of lessons on positive
relationships manifested itself in grade 5 primary school students (ages 10-12). The current study explores
positive relationships which was one of the five dimensions focused on during the intervention.
The study was conducted by researchers who belong to the same socioeconomic and cultural group
(Swedish-speaking Finns) as the students and were, thus, sensitive to dialectal differences and methods of
expression in the sample.

The Intervention
The aforementioned intervention started out from lessons in the book Personal Well-Being Lessons:
Positive Psychology in action for 11-14 year olds (Bonniwell et al., 2014) and also used several other sources
to construct the intervention (Laakso et al., 2020).
9

The curriculum was created using multiple sources and regarding positive education application in
schools (Laakso et al., 2020). The program spanned 32 lessons categorised into five different
themes(positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships, achievements) focusing on fostering
different parts of well-being.
The positive relationship block spanned 5 lessons total and are detailed in the matrix below:
Table 1
An Overview of the Lesson Plan for the Positive Relationships Unit

Unit 3 Positive Relationships, Lessons

1. A Good Friendship: Active constructive responding theory: Nonviolent communication, Oxytocin, and
massage practice (Gable, 2004).
2. Toxic Friendship: Active constructive responding theory:(Gable 2004), The DESC model, application, and
discussion
3. Forgiveness: Strengths regarding forgiveness, what forgiveness is in practice, writing a forgiveness letter
based on Seligman (2002)
4. Listening and Empathy: Theory and exercises designed to make the material come alive. Discussions about
empathy and active listening
5. Kindness and Gratitude: Discussions about the importance of kindness and gratitude, writing a gratitude
diary, loving kindness meditation

Sampling Strategy and Data Collection
The participants of the study came from four Swedish-speaking middle schools, situated in
metropolitan or western Finland. Participation was not compulsory and 83% of the pupils gave their
informed consent to participate, totalling 72 students participating in the intervention. The participants had
an advantaged socioeconomic status (SES) with 57,4% categorizing themselves as having a high
socioeconomic status. Data regarding SES was retrieved from ratings made by parents of pupils
participating in the intervention regarding income level, occupation and education level. This does not,
however, differ from the Finnish population where 60% of children participating in the nationwide PISA
10

exam were categorised as high SES (Salmela-Aro & Chmielewski 2019). The intervention took place
between May of 2016 and May of 2017.
First, students were given the opportunity to individually write down their reflections
regarding the lessons through open-ended questions. This was done to allow for better recall of the
intervention and help students focus on their own opinions (rather than one student dominating the group)
during the group interview. Students were then divided into smaller focus groups of 4-6 children. The focus
group interviews used the same questions as the individual questionnaire. Discussions were held in empty
classrooms and lasted 10 minutes on average, depending on the talkativeness of the group. The questions
can be found in table 2.

Focus Groups
Focus groups are a common way to study a phenomenon in a qualitative way. The procedure is
characterised by being akin to an informal discussion regarding a preselected topic. The group is moderated
by the interviewer who is responsible for steering the conversation in an investigative direction. The
moderator asks the questions provided by the interview guide but then acts as a catalyst for group
discussion. This is achieved by asking questions, pitching in with different perspectives, encouraging
members to speak and not allowing one member to dictate the direction of the conversation. This
approach for older schoolchildren is supported by research, as it has been shown that they have the
capacity to point out if they do not understand questions in an interview (Feldman, 2011). The role of the
moderator is, thus, to allow all members to express their opinions and facilitate discussion. The resulting
conversation often has the characteristics of an informal discussion.
This setting provides a good way to clarify middle school children's perceptions of health and
mental well-being. As middle schoolers are undergoing the developmental transition to adolescence, it can
be difficult to talk about sensitive topics with an adult stranger (Christensen, 2004; Holmes, 1998). This
barrier is lessened by providing peer support in the form of a focus group, thus, allowing for more relaxed

11

explorative answers (Homer, 2000). Hence, focus groups provide a way to investigate the perceived effect
of the intervention in an ecologically valid way.

Data Processing and Analysis

Qualitative Content Analysis
As the data was derived from a semi-structured interview and the research questions were clearly
defined, qualitative content analysis (QCA) was selected as the method of analysis. QCA is a procedural
process that sorts data into different categories in order to answer questions posed by the researcher. No

12

holistic overview is sought, instead the research questions are used to generate a coding frame which then
categorises the data according to their relevance to the research question (Mayring, 2000; Schreier, 2013).
The core of a qualitative content analysis is the coding frame which determines how meaning
bearing statements form different categories. The coding frame is generated either by a theoretical
framework or inductively by procedurally tuning the coding frame using pilot data. Once the coding frame
has been developed and has reached consensus among the researchers involved it is applied on the entire
dataset.
The first step in the analysis was to get the interview data transcribed, this was done by a professional
to ensure high quality. Once transcribed the data was read through multiple times spread out over 3
months. It was decided that an inductive approach was best suited for the dataset. The main factors
guiding this decision was the dearth of literature that would have provided a theoretical backdrop and that
inductive formation of categories reacts well to the often-incoherent speech found in schoolchildren. Also,
the nature of the material made an inductive method for generating categories ideal as big chunks of the
material was not suitable for analysis (indistinct chatter, random questions and topics, interruptions etc.).
To generate categories the irrelevant data had to be excluded. The whole dataset was analysed, and
statements were extracted if they were concordant with the research questions. This first coding was
dichotomous with text being assigned either as included or not included. The procedure can be categorised
into five steps (Mayring, 2010):

1. A research question is formulated on a theoretical backdrop
2. A selection criterion is established, categories defined
3. The text is worked through, new categories are formulated
4. Revision of categories and rules after analysing 10-50% of the data
5. The material is worked through and put through a validity and reliability check using a third-party
coder

13

After the initial rough coding highlighting relevant information in the interviews the data was extracted
and organised again with the interview questions for both datasets as a coding frame. Meaning bearing
statements from the initial coding were grouped with the questions they answered. Before a full coding
was conducted, the coding frame was piloted on 25% of the data by one psychology student and one
researcher. The coding frame was revised and then applied to the data. The full coding of the data using
this coding frame was completed.
After the process was completed, additional categories were created using the process of Inductive
Category Formation (Mayring, 2010 p.79). The text was read line by line and if a new category explained
the statement better, one was created. New categories were created until saturation was obtained, i.e., all
the data could be subsumed into existing categories. The two main research questions were used as main
headings.
At this point the coding frame had 23 categories. The coding frame was then evaluated by two
researchers and two psychology students not directly involved in the study and consequently revised one
more time. Categories were either expanded upon or subsumed into other categories. It was decided that
no one category should contain less than 2 meaning bearing statements as such categories were too
specific. Such cases were simply included in a similar category and a new one was not created. The focus
was mostly on creating categories that exposed themes in the text and thus a reduction in categories was
necessary. The research questions guided the formation and subsummation of categories to make the
categories capture the differences in the answers while simultaneously creating coherent categories. After
all categories had been established the data was coded using this final coding frame. Once the coding had
been made no more changes were made to the structure of the coding frame.

Trustworthiness of the Analysis
Trustworthiness is a central concern in qualitative research. Thus, several steps were taken to
ensure trustworthiness. Bias regarding categorisation and analysis was controlled for by having a different
person interview and analyse the data. To ensure that the data was transcribed correctly and without

14

interpretation, transcription of the material was done by a professional versed in Finnish-Swedish dialects.
Documentation of all data and files throughout the coding process were kept record of.
To ensure that the coding frame was reliable the entire dataset was coded by two separate coders
using the same coding frame. An interrater-reliability score of 0.825 was extracted using the formula
described in Miles and Huberman 1994.

reliability = number of agreements / number of agreements + disagreements

An interrater score between 80% and 95% is seen as sufficient and thus the study met this criterion
for reliability (Miles and Huberman, 1994).

Results
The current study aimed to answer how 1. children internalised the material taught in class 2.) how this
knowledge was used for their benefit. The results for each of the areas examined are presented with both
domains in mind. Three main categories could be extracted from the data based on the interview structure:
1. Conflict management
2. Listening
3. Buddy massage

Note: Categories are ranked based on frequency in the material, where the first ones had more material
than the last ones. The “practical use of” categories were made into distinct main categories to match the
research questions and adhere to the interview structure.

Theme 1: Conflict Management
A central goal of the positive relationship lessons was to improve the understanding of how
one’s own actions impact others. The results showed that the pupils had an easy time categorising
emotional states and response styles. They also emphasised the importance of forgiveness and speaking
one's mind in conversations.
Ability to discern between different ways of responding to conflict
Children were able to remember and apply the categories and theory of the DESC model:
“It feels better when you react in a firm but kind way, you don't get sad, when you don't react at all it
makes you feel bad”.

A more nuanced understanding of the others inner world
Students gained a better understanding of what others might be thinking and feeling. One pupil
summarised this category “I have gained an understanding of how it all works (other people) and how I in
turn can react differently in different situations. In case it all goes wrong or something”.
In a similar vein, another pupil applied this notion of trying to understand where the other is
coming from to conflict management:
For example, if a friend has a different opinion than you it makes them feel mad about that you do
not share that opinion. But you are allowed to have your own opinions, it's all about how you
express it, so your friend doesn't get sad.

Gained understanding of a model for conflict management

17

The accessibility of information regarding conflict management was made easier using the DESC
model for conflict management. Many students showed that they had internalised its contents, however, it
was more difficult to see the applicability of it. Most children repeated what had been taught in class
directly, much like answering a test. First, you are to describe the situation and then express it, how you
feel at that moment and specify that the other is to remember this for the next time.
While most students did not apply any value judgement to the model, some commented on its
potential use in the future: “Well maybe I’ll use it more now that I know that it exists, or now that you
know it you can use it”.
The value of forgiveness
Forgiveness was a theme that was brought up a few times. Statements focused on a change
of mindset regarding the importance of forgiveness and that it is a skill that is much needed in
relationships. “It's easier to forgive someone now that I understand the value of it”.
Why it is important to stand your ground without being aggressive
One of the most prominent themes was that of responding to conflict, more answers were
collected for this category than any other, signifying that it was an important theme.
Most statements underlined the importance of not escalating the problem but still not giving in.
“It’s important to react firmly but kindly if a conflict occurs, well if you do the friend understands your
viewpoint without getting even more angry”.

Practical use of conflict management
Able to Better Stand up for Themselves.
Children were able to use the lessons to stand up for themselves more in their daily life. This
was done by using the models for conflict resolution taught by the DESC-model.
“It's been easier to tell people how you feel, for example if someone comes in late, I tell them that they
didn't really check the time this time”.
Fights can be Resolved Faster

18

The children felt that fights were not as drawn out as before and that escalation of conflicts
could be more easily avoided. A participant remarked that: “Before (the intervention) I could fight for a
very long time but now I get angry, and I tell the other person and it makes it go away”. Answers from other
participants also hinted that the DESC model had been used to great effect: “ (talking about the benefits of
the program) I think the best thing is that we don't fight as much, because we have learned from that DESC
model”
The Examples From Class Were Used as Prototypes for Behaviour in Relationships.
A common theme for practical application of the lessons were that behaviours observed through
drama and examples made students aware of how they could change their interactions with the world
around them, highlighting integration of lessons about ACR. The following statement from a participant
gives an example of this interaction:
Those examples were actually true, because it happened the same way when my sister had been
studying really hard for a test. She got a good result and showed it to my dad who said, “You got
really lucky”. But then I told dad about the example and then he gave a lot of praise and my sister
got really happy
Another pupil brought up that the examples had had an impact on how interactions were handled in
groups. Examples ranged from extracurricular activities to schoolwork, but all had in common that the
examples were used to positively affect how they interacted with others.

Theme 2: Listening
Listening was taught to students through theory and drama. The Active Constructive
Responding ARC model was a headstone in these teachings. Results showed that students had been able to
grasp the ACR model and the value of listening and were able to extend this knowledge to their everyday
life.
Learned That Listening is Important

19

Pupils emphasised that their view on the importance of listening had changed because of the
intervention. This category had more answers than others: “Well listening actively and being interested is
very important, so that you really listen and don't like look in another direction and don't really care”
The Others’ Mood is Affected by How You Listen
Children also brought up how they have started to think more about how their way of having
a conversation might affect the mood of others, ideas prevalent in active constructive responding. A
student pinpointed this: “Others might get sad if they notice that you don't really care (by not listening)”
Learned to Balance the Roles When in a Conversation
The children were taught that questions are an important part of conversations and that it
makes others feel better if questions are asked, something ACR deems as important. “Your friend becomes
happier if you look him or her in the eyes and ask more questions.
Using the ACR Model in Conversations
Children could count the categories of listening and responding taught during the lessons but
could not apply it to a context. It seemed like they were not able to apply the teachings directly. Many
students reported that they had not used the model at all and that it was confusing.
Attending Behaviours
The pupils displayed an increased understanding of how listening affects others and started
to employ it in their daily lives. It allowed children to have more close and shared experiences with their
friends.
Participants seemed to have latched on to the sentiment of attending behaviours and expressed it through
“It’s really important to listen because it's a lot more fun for the friend you are with, because if you do you
can experience the situation together, that makes it much more fun!”
Another benefit was that students were able to tell others if their conversation partner was not
listening. Children were able to use the information and models generated in class to tell others if they
were not being an active listener. “If I notice that someone is not listening, I try to tell them “hey you are
not listening” and then I also try to listen better myself”
20

Theme 3: Buddy Massage
Students were taught a model for how to give a massage and practiced this skill on each other.
Simultaneously students were given information on oxytocin and its effects on the body and mind.
Students gained an understanding of the impact a massage has on the body, and how we all like to be
touched differently. Students appreciated the acquisition of the skill of giving a massage, and it was used
outside of school as well.
How a Buddy Massage can Reduce Stress
Pupils listed several things that they had been taught about giving a friend a massage. The main
new things were that it could be something used after a stressful day and that massages could give more
energy for cognitive tasks. The students expressed this in statements such as” You get more energy and you
can be a better thinker after one”.
Learning to Know Others Through Massage
The massage symbolised that different people have different tastes and feel sensations differently.
The massage allowed children to ponder how different we all are, not everyone reacts the way they
themselves would. It illuminated the need to communicate for the best results “Well that you should not
do it too hard and not too soft but instead ask what the other wants. If the person says harder, then you
can do it harder”
Learned how to Give a Buddy Massage
Children experienced that they had learned to give a massage to others, a skill they had not
had before: “I have learned that it's actually pretty easy to give a massage and then others get that nice
feeling into them (referencing oxytocin)”.
The Value of a Buddy Massage
Getting a massage was perceived as fun by most students and regarded as something
positive. Many described the experience of having someone else massage them as fun and liked when it
was part of the curriculum: “Many in our class liked it very much, we often ask if we can do it again”
Practical implications for the buddy massage

21

Peers
The massage was found to be hard to use outside of class as is summarised well by the
following quote: “No i haven't found it useful, but that's because others don’t take it seriously if they would
have i surely would have had a lot of use”. Some use it as a way to calm down after a fight was described
but most had not used it with their peers.
Family
A lot of use in the family was described by the students and many had used it on their parents or
family. It was perceived as something positive in this environment. Participants described scenarios such as
“I got a buddy massage from mom” and “I can massage my mom if she feels stressed” as things gained
from the intervention.

Benefit of the Intervention was Unclear
For some pupils, the benefits were unclear, and they did not understand how it was to be
implemented further. One participant stated that: “I haven't learned anything special, and I don't know if it
has affected my day in any particular way”, a thought which was shared by a few other participants.
Another student expressed uncertainty regarding the intervention but remained hopeful. “I do not know,
maybe I’ll have some use for it in the future”.

Discussion
The current study aimed to conceptualise and gain understanding of themes of positive education
on enhancing relationship qualities. The study aimed to examine how children internalised the material
used in class, and how this knowledge was translated into real life.
The results showed that the participants had gained an increased understanding of how their own
actions affect others. The intervention had thus allowed children to be more emphatic and caring towards
their peers. The main pathway for this change was that participants had gained access to models for
breaking up fights or responding to conflict and could use these models to speculate on how people felt in
22

different situations. They could also describe which interaction styles are best for resolving conflict and
were more sensitive to nuance in conflict situations. Importantly, participants understood that it is not
always what you say, but rather how you say it that matters most. These findings highlighted that the key
concepts from the DESC model and ACR had been added to the toolbox of students, allowing for their use
when thinking about ways to respond in social situations (Bower & Bower,1998: Gable et al., 2010).
Similarly, the listening domain contained many examples and thoughts on how their own actions affect
others in social interactions, which signifies that the students had gained new ways of thinking about
listening. This understanding allowed children to notice when they themselves were a poor listener or
actively tell others if they felt like they did not listen. The analysis showed that while the children's
understanding of the conflict resolution model (DESC model) was at a very basic level, they were able to
extract the main points of the model through examples and experiential learning in the classroom. This
could be a result of the developmental profile of students where their current profile makes abstract
reasoning difficult unless latched on to something concrete (Leeuw, 2011). However, the results showed
that models can be a tool used when trying to foster assertiveness in children
Children frequently described situations in which they felt they had gained knowledge of how to
react. These experiences echoed the teachings from class but were described using an example or
experience. Theory learned in class that was put into practice using examples, discussions and experiences
with other peers was well remembered by participants, signalling that a potential mediator for transfer
would be experiential learning through peer interaction. This is supported by a recent meta-analysis which
concluded that peer interaction is more effective for learning than traditional teaching (Tenenbaum et al.,
2019).
Additionally, participants reported that the examples from class were used as prototypes outside of
class, which is closely related to Albert Bandura's social learning theory, according to this theory, learning is
achieved and reinforced through direct experience or by observing the behaviour of another (Bandura,
1977). The interviews indicated that rehearsal of behaviours through drama and play aided their
consolidation. Participants were able to use models experienced in the classroom and reproduce them in
23

an outside setting. These observations align with the emerging field of embodied cognition, where sensory
experiences are integral in memory consolidation. The theory stipulates that the richer a representation is,
regarding different channels of stimuli, the more robust the memory trace will be (Shapiro, 2011). This
theory has scientific support in a classroom setting where it has been shown that encoding incorporating
more senses and bodily interaction allows for better recall and use of that information (Fugate et al., 2018).
The analysis suggests that information gained in this manner was more readily available and usable. Use of
dramatizations, games, examples and so on was described by the participants as having the best transfer to
the daily lives, indicating that this approach is important when transferring the learning to everyday
interactions. This was echoed in another qualitative study where it was established that learning
experiences are most effective when teachers employ an active pedagogy (Riedel et al., 2020). Similar to
Vygotskian theory, it would seem that concrete situations and social interaction provided the best results
and theoretical constructs were outside the children's zone of proximal development (Hogan & Tudge
1999). This need for engagement and interaction highlights the importance of positive education equipping
educators with tools and guidelines to bridge the gap between the theoretical and practical. If this is not
the case, it may be that participants only gain a theoretical understanding, If any understanding at all, with
no tangible effect on their relationship skills.
The effectiveness of engaging pedagogy was exemplified in the case of the buddy massage, where
children appreciated the applicability of it while it was a road to deepening understanding of touch and
friendship. The massage was practical in nature and many children appreciated this approach. Children's
knowledge about how stress reduction and new friendships can be a result of a massage was intertwined in
their own experiences from giving and receiving a massage. It allowed them to understand themselves and
others better and was perceived as something fun. Children seemed to particularly enjoy the practical skill
gained through the teaching, as they now had a way of interacting with others. However, these interactions
were mostly focused on family members rather than peers. Thus, the massage served the purpose of
teaching children how others react differently than themselves, the benefit of touch regarding stress, and

24

gave them a way to connect with their families. A feeling of accomplishing something was also prevalent
when describing massage as a tool to make someone else happy.
The findings demonstrate the importance of connecting the material taught to real life situations. In
addition to making the material familiar, the study highlighted the importance of active participation from
students. Theoretical constructs seemed to be remembered well by this age group, but it was exercises and
examples that allowed children to translate what they had learned into a real-life setting.

Limitations

The current study is only able to analyse the opinions expressed during the interview. Thus,
it is possible for it to sway the results in a more positive way. Questions that were asked heavily implied
that positive experiences were to be talked about and as such demand characteristics may have influenced
the answers given. Thus, it is possible that children that had negative views on the program did not answer
these questions the way they truly felt. Unfortunately, not enough data was available to analyse these
neutral or negative experiences. Children in some classes did not answer the questions at all, using
statements such as “I do not know”. With all of this combined, it would be beneficial to study what makes
students feel that the intervention was unenjoyable.

Conclusions
The results highlighted the importance of using material that mimics real life situations, is interactive
and utilises peer participatory mechanisms. This would suggest that interventions fostering relationships
are effective when children learn from each other and examples are given in a vivid and practical way. The
current study suggests that interventions focusing on positive relationships should focus on these
elements, as they are perceived as useful and fun by students and possible mediators for establishing
change in behaviour and well-being. Directions for further study would be:

education setting

Summary in Swedish-Svensk sammanfattning
Inledning
Positiv psykologi
Positiv psykologi är en rörelse som uppkommit under 2000-talet som en motreaktion mot
den traditionella psykologins fokus på psykopatologi och avvikande utveckling (Peterson et al., 2009). Målet
med positiv psykologi är att upphöja individers potential och ge dem redskap för att utveckla kreativitet,
hopp, optimism och andra positivt betonade egenskaper. Sedan rörelsens begynnelse har fokus lagts på att
hitta sätt att främja mental hälsa och hitta de faktorer som tillsammans utgör ett balanserat och lyckligt liv.
Viktigt att poängtera är att den positiva psykologin inte eftersträvar den semantiska betydelsen av ordet
lycka utan snarare ett tillstånd där individen lever ett meningsfullt och tillfredställande liv (Seligman, 2009:
Ryff & Singer 2006). En av de mest framstående modellerna för denna konceptualisering av lycka är
PERMA-modellen som består av fem separata områden som enligt dess skapare, Martin Seligman, utgör
grunden för ett lyckligt liv. Dessa områden är: positiv affekt, engagemang, positiva relationer,
meningsfullhet och att uppnå något. Termen ”blomstra” är ett centralt begrepp inom den positiva

26

psykologin och innebär att kriterierna för PERMA-modellen uppfylls och att individen upplever positivt
fungerande i vardagen, på ett psykologiskt plan och i sina sociala relationer.
Positiv pedagogik
Skolornas roll som förmedlare av kunskap och socialisering av ungdomar utgör en lämplig
arena för implementering av positiv psykologi. Modellen där positiv psykologi integreras i undervisningen
har blivit populär och omspänner nu hundratals program världen över (Seligman & Alder 2018). Denna
kombination av traditionell skolning och positiv psykologi har benämts positiv pedagogik och dess mål
beskrivs som utbildning för både akademiska förmågor och välmående.
Syfte och ämnesmotivering
Syftet med avhandlingen är att undersöka effekterna av fem veckors lektioner uppbyggda för
att främja positiva relationer. Positiva relationer har visat sig ha många hälsofrämjande effekter och
studier tyder på att de är nödvändiga för att leva ett lyckligt liv och fungerar samtidigt som en buffert för
psykopatologi (Seligman 2011). Forskning har visat på att ungdomar i Finland och världen uppvisat en
ökning i prevalensen av psykopatologi i en rad olika länder och populationer (Gyllenberg et al., 2018). Detta
är mycket problematiskt och regeringar världen över sätter allt mer tid och resurser på att främja den
mentala hälsan hos sina medborgare. Såvida är insikter om hur positiva relationer kan främjas av intresse
för folkhälsan och utgör en byggsten för vidare förståelse av interventioner i skolmiljö.
Textens mål är att undersöka hur effekterna av en intervention inom positiv pedagogik konkret får uttryck i
barns vardag. Barnens egna upplevelser och tankar gällande interventionen är även i fokus. Detta skiljer sig
från mycket annan forskning på området som undersöker fenomenet ur ett kvantitativt perspektiv där
mycket av den praktiska förankringen går förlorad. Detta är viktigt eftersom studier som haft en kvantitativ
och holistisk inblick i positiv psykologi resulterat i instruktioner och metoder som har visat sig vara svåra för
pedagoger att använda sig av i skolor.
Presentation av metod och material
Denna studie är en del av ett större forskningsprojekt där man undersöker effekterna av positiv pedagogik i
finlandssvenska skolor. Interventionen i positiv pedagogik bestod av totalt 32 veckor och omspände alla
27

element i PERMA-modellen. Totalt sex skolor och totalt 72 elever deltog i interventionen Denna studie
undersöker specifikt blocket om sociala relationer som bestod av totalt 5 lektioner.
Datainsamlingen genomfördes genom intervjuer i små grupper. Samtliga grupper bestod av 4-6
elever som intervjuades av en forskare eller forskningsassistent. Dessa intervjuer bandades in och
transkriberades av en utomstående aktör.
För den kvalitativa analysen av datat valdes kvalitativ innehållsanalys. Kvalitativ innehållsanalys
innebär en process där data kategoriseras enligt olika nämnare för att få en ram som kan användas för att
förstå materialet bättre. Processen är induktiv och består av många iterationer där man hela tiden jobbar
för att finslipa kodningsramen. Metoden valdes eftersom den fungerar bra i samspel med
semistrukturerade intervjuer och ett induktivt synsätt är lämpligt då forskning görs på gräsrotsnivå utan
tidigare forskningsunderlag.
Resultat
Tre stycken huvudkategorier med därtill hörande underkategorier framkom efter analysen. Dessa
kategorier var Konflikthantering, Att lyssna och Massage. Resultaten för de olika huvudkategorierna
beskrivs i korthet nedan:
Konflikthantering
Eleverna hade fått en insikt i hur deras handlingar påverkar andra och kunde kategorisera
och fundera kring deras emotioner och sinnesstämmning. Eleverna förde även fram vikten av förlåtelse och
att hävda sig själv i interaktion med andra. Praktiska inslag och övningar hade möjliggjort en bro till
användning utanför skolan.
Lärde sig: Förmåga att skilja mellan olika sätt att reagera på en konflikt, en förståelse av den andres inre
värld, fick en modell för konflikthantering, värdet av att ge förlåtelse, varför det är viktigt att hävda sig själv
Nytta i vardagen: Bättre på att hävda sig själv, kan lösa konflikter snabbare, exempel från klassrummet
användes som modell för beteende
Att lyssna

28

Att lyssna instruerades genom drama-och teoriundervisning. Barnen hade lätt att lära sig de olika delarna
av en modell som och resultaten visade på att de använt sig av denna kunskap i deras vardag. Speciellt
viktigt visade sig dramainslagen ha varit då elever kunde använda sig av de situationer som framkommit
som prototyper för beteenden i vardagen. De märkte även av att de blivit bättre lyssnare och sagt till ifall
någon inte lyssnade.
Lärde sig: Lärde sig att lyssnande är viktigt, den andras humör påverkas av hur man lyssnar, lärde sig hur
man kan balansera rollerna i ett samtal, lärde sig hur man kan använda ACR-modellen i samtal med andra
Nytta i vardagen: Började uppmärksamma den andras signaler och lyssnade reflektivt i större grad
Kompismassage
Barnen uppskattade det praktiska med att lära sig att ge en massage och många kände att de
lärt sig en ny färdighet i och med lektionerna. Centrala teman i utsagorna var hur beröring kan minska på
stress men att det även finns individuella skillnader i hur vi vill bli berörda. Många av barnen uppskattade
även att de nu kunde massera personer även utanför skolan, såsom deras föräldrar.
Lärde sig: Hur en kompismassage kan minska på stress, lärde sig att man kan lära känna andra genom en
massage, lärde sig hur man ger en kompismassage, värdet av en kompismassage
Nytta i vardagen: Att massera jämnåriga var trevligt i skolan, men inte utanför. Inom familjen var massagen
uppskattad.
Diskussion
Syftet med studien var att undersöka vilka element inom positiv pedagogik som möjliggör
förändring i ungdomars sociala interaktioner. Resultaten visade på att eleverna hade tagit till sig hur deras
egna handlingar påverkar andra och kunde analysera olika situationer med de modeller som använts under
lektionerna. Modellerna utgjorde en grogrund för ökad mentaliseringsförmåga. Trots att modellerna hade
haft en positiv effekt på elevernas sociala fungerande var inkörsporten för denna förändring de praktiska
övningarna som de gjort på lektionerna. Eleverna refererade ofta till att de känt igen en situation eller
förstått samband genom dessa upplevelser. Eleverna hade även lärt sig vikten av att lyssna på andra. De

29

beskrev att de nu i större grad märker ifall de själv är en dålig lyssnare och kan säga till om de upplever att
någon annan inte lyssnar.
Ett tema som framkom är hur eleverna kunde överföra kunskapen från klassrummet till det
vardagliga livet genom praktiska exempel och övningar. Detta fenomen är nära besläktat med teorin om
Kroppsligt förankrad inlärning (Eng. Embodied cognition) vars huvudpoäng är att multisensorisk
processering av en situation innebär ett robustare minnesspår. Denna studie visar på att information som
barnen tagit till sig genom att själv ha en aktiv roll var en viktig faktor för överföringen av informationen till
livet utanför skolan. Resultaten tyder på att positiv pedagogik bör integrera element av multisensorisk
processering i form av drama och övningar för att få det bästa möjliga resultatet.
Massagen gillades även eftersom den var praktisk och lätt gick att överföra till andra
domäner i personens liv. Massagen möjliggjorde en ny möjlighet för interaktion även om massagen främst
användes inom den egna familjen snarare än jämnåriga. Eleverna var även stolta över att de lärt sig en ny
förmåga och kunde använda massagen som ett sätt att tala om stress och beröring.
Resultaten tyder på att praktiska element som kopplas till vardagliga situationer hade de
bästa effekterna på positiva relationer i barnens liv. Teori och modeller kunde barnen memorera men hade
svårt att använda sig av denna teori utan praktiska exempel, något som återspeglas i Vygotskis teori om
proximal utvecklingsszon (Hogan & Tudge 1999). Utöver detta var interaktion med jämnåriga samt en aktiv
utlärningsstil något som verkade ha påverkat barnens förmågor att lära sig, något som även framkommit i
en annan kvalitativ studie med samma tema (Riedel, Vialle, Pearson, & Oades, 2020). Vidare forskning
kunde fokusera på:
1. Att jämföra traditionell undervisning med aktiv undervisning där kroppsligt förankrad inlärning
används
2. Kroppsligt förankrad inlärning och interaktion med jämnåriga och dess effekter på inlärning i andra
domäner av PERMA-modellen
