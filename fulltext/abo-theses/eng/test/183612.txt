Title: Internationalization and market potential assessment in B2C contexts: A case study in the
packaged consumer goods sector
Supervisor: Wilhelm Barner-Rasmussen
Abstract:
Many companies are interested in entering new markets but identifying suitable markets with high
market potential may be challenging. Moreover, the need for market potential frameworks taking
industry specific factors into consideration still exists. The purpose of this thesis is developing a
framework for market potential assessment in the packaged B2C goods sector in specialist retail,
combining earlier research with practice. The thesis was conducted for a large multinational
company and the author has been part of a market research project at the case company.
The

theoretical

framework

includes

internationalization

(examining

why

companies

internationalize, presenting the Uppsala model for internationalization and how Finnish companies
have internationalized in the past), market potential assessment (earlier research regarding the
evaluation of market potential and presentation of chosen models for the thesis) and market entry
modes. The thesis is a mixed method study, where quantitative market data provided by Company
X, as well as a few other relevant, identified factors are analyzed quantitatively and the qualitative
le market research
project.
The results of the thesis indicate that companies buy relevant market data directly, instead of
focusing on general numbers. They conduct market potential assessment incrementally and focus
more on industry and product specific indicators than previous frameworks have demonstrated.
Furthermore, companies might assess markets objectively, but internationalization can still happen
as presented in the Uppsala model, when there are multiple interesting markets with high potential
to choose from. Culture might also play a more minor role, than presented in earlier frameworks.
The created market potential assessment framework consists of four steps, containing both
important factors presented in literature, as well as important factors identified during Company

1 Introduction
accessible, global world are interested in entering new, foreign
markets in order to grow and increase their sales (Hollensen 2007). In the modern world,
it is even possible for small businesses to internationalize. There are many reasons why
companies might be interested in entering new markets: foreign markets might offer
higher profits, new resources for innovation or help companies stay competitive.
(Czinkota, Ronkainen & Zvogbo 2011)
Nevertheless, companies do not only need to make a decision whether to enter new,
foreign markets or not, they also need to choose which markets to enter. When selecting
which market to enter, it can be difficult to choose from multiple options and challenging
to delineate the markets with the highest potential (Kotler, Keller, Brady, Goodman &
Hansen 2009). How can companies then compare markets, in order to find markets that
suit them? Many different frameworks for comparing the potential of different markets
have been created, but the most commonly used ones are international market selection
and foreign market opportunity analysis (Ozturk, Joiner & Cavusgil 2011). Even though
internationalization, few empirical studies have been conducted in this field (Leonidou et
al. 2002, Papadopoulos & Mart n 2011, Steenkamp & Ter Hofstede 2002; Ozturk et al.
2011). Furthermore, few previous studies have focused on market selection in consumer
products or services (Malhotra & Papadopoulos 2007; Ozturk et al. 2015), which implies
that more can be learned in this sector.

In addition to the different market selection frameworks, there are multiple factors that
climate, consumption behavior and attitudes towards imported products) (Cavusgil, Kiyak
& Yeniyurt 2004). Different authors and different market assessment models identify
various market potential indicators, which can make it challenging for businesses to decide
which factors are important in their industry and sector. This implies, that companies still
need to make several decisions regarding how to find interesting markets and identify
market potential relevant for them. Furthermore, what companies identify as important
regarding market potential could be interesting to investigate.

1.1 Problem discussion
Certain companies pursue international activities from their start, but most internationalize
progressively over time, as entering a new, unfamiliar country can be seen as is risky
(Czinkota et al. 2011). In order for businesses to succeed in their internationalization,
preparation is required (Hollensen 2007). Moreover, when companies are interested in
internationalizing, background information needs to be learned, in order to be able to find
and compare the most interesting markets (Czinkota et al. 2011). Several different theories
exist, and multiple studies have been conducted regarding market potential assessment.
Companies seeking to expand abroad are faced with the complex task of screening and
evaluating foreign markets

et al. 2004 p. 607).

Assessing potential in foreign markets is the primary objective of most international
market research (Czinkota & Ronkainen 2010; Sheng & Mullen 2011). Even though
market potential has been investigated by many researchers, a need for a flexible,
extensive, and cost-effective model still exists (Cavusgil et. al 2004, Green & Allaway
1985, Papadopoulos et. al 2002; Sheng & Mullen 2011). Several authors have tried to
create a new, flexible model that works across industries (cf. Sheng & Mullen 2011,
Ozturk et. al 2015), but how can business executives know which model is suitable for
their businesses and involves relevant factors for them? Furthermore, how do business
executives usually conduct foreign market research, in practice? Cavusgil (1985), has
researched how managers conduct foreign market research and which topics they typically
include when comparing market potential. Are the same research topics still relevant
today, when internationalizing or should other factors be investigated?

1.2 Purpose and research questions

markets with high potential for companies in the packaged B2C goods in special retail.
The thesis was conducted for a large multinational company in packaged consumer goods
in the special retail industry, as part of a project regarding market research in Europe
within the company. Due to matters of confidentiality, the company will be referred to as

Company X. During the project the author helped Company X in their investigation to
find markets with the highest potential and additionally, help them analyze these highpotential markets more deeply. The created market analysis tool aims to be suitable for
other companies and with modifications for other industries as well, to use as support when
comparing and finding new markets. The market potential framework consists of four
steps: a preliminary step; where general market information is examined, second a general
phase; where multiple markets will be analyzed, followed by an in-depth phase; where a
few markets with high-potential will be analyzed more thoroughly and lastly, an
investigation of a chosen market; where one chosen, suitable market with high-potential
will be analyzed in order to make the final decision, whether to enter this market or not.
a set of 13 European markets, in order to find a new interesting market to enter.
The thesis aims to address the four following questions:
Theoretical question:
What conceptual approaches to the assessment of market potential exist in previous
research?
Empirical questions:
In B2C businesses focusing on packaged, physical goods in specialist retail, (a) How is
the evaluation of market potential executed? (b): Which other factors are relevant to
market selection besides market potential?
Normative question:
What should managers, in B2C businesses focusing on physical goods, do to conduct
successful market evaluation processes?

the analysis in the thesis, first working with quantitative, secondary data and later learning
more about an interesting market by desk researching it. The quantitative data in the thesis
is market data offered by company X. Detailed market data from the chosen markets will
not be presented in the thesis, including both country names and specific numbers
regarding the markets. The kind of data available and used for the research, and which
factors are considered when analyzing the data is discussed. The qualitative data for the
thesis was collected throughout the whole market research project at Company X and
during the whole writing process. The qualitative data will be in the form of observations,
presenting how an actual company conducts foreign market research and how the research
topics develop throughout the process, as well as presenting how a company acquires a
better understanding of one interesting market. Furthermore, a real-life case of market
potential assessment is compared with frameworks presented in literature, in order to be
able to create a market potential assessment framework, which is a mix of theory and
practice.
steps in the market research will be used as qualitative data in the thesis as well.

In this study, only one company and their internationalization process were observed.
stores. Their products are sold in many countries, including Finland. The research method
of this study was a mixed method research, due to the nature of the project; where
quantitative market data was available, but additional desk research needed to be
performed to be able to understand the interesting markets further. The thesis was limited
to 13 European markets and focused on the B2C packaged consumer goods in the special
retail industry.

1.6 Structure of the thesis
The thesis consists of seven main chapters. After the introduction, the second chapter
focuses on the first part of the theoretical framework with internationalization, while the
third chapter focuses on the second part with market potential assessment and market entry
being a few of the topics. The following chapter focuses on methodology and the chosen
research method, presenting both its strengths and weaknesses and how these are
considered in the thesis. The fifth chapter focuses on the analysis of the quantitative and
qualitative data gathered for the thesis with the help of the theoretical framework presented
in chapters two and three. In the sixth chapter the findings will be discussed along with
the conclusions, limitations, and recommendations for future research. The last chapter
contains a summary of the thesis in Swedish.

2 Internationalization
In this chapter, the term internationalization is explained and the Uppsala model for
internationalization is presented. A few risks and barriers related to internationalization
are also presented, as well as two studies regarding how Finnish companies have
internationalized in the past.

2.1 The concept of internationalization
Multinational enterprises continuously look for new markets to enter, small and medium
businesses seek international customers more than ever, and born-global firms undertake
substantial internationalization early in their evolution.

p.120)

According to Hollensen (2007), internationalization happens when companies move
business activities abroad (e.g. manufacturing, sales or research and development).
However,

, VotoupalovÃ¡ & ToulovÃ¡ (2009) argue that internationalization can

be a method for companies to stay competitive, attain revenue in the long-term,
accomplish competitive achievements and remain on the market. What separates
internationalization

from

other

strategy

or

growth

methods,

is

that

when

internationalizing, companies move their products/services/assets abroad and companies
have chosen what countries to enter and with which entry mode. Moreover, companies
need to choose a suitable entry mode for the chosen market. In other words, when
companies are internationalizing, they need to choose which markets to enter and how to
enter them. (Andersen 1997)
Companies

often start their internationalization process by becoming aware of

opportunities abroad, leading them to become interested in internationalizing, making
their first attempt at entering a foreign market, whereafter they evaluate how they have
succeeded with the process, and lastly, adapt their internationalization activities and use
these to enter new markets (Czinkota et al. 2011) Globalization and internationalization
are two similar terms, but usually the term globalization is more focused on the trend of
companies being active in multiple countries on different continents, while

7

internationalization refers to companies conducting business in several countries as well,
but in a specific area of the world, such as a continent (Hollensen 2007).

2.2 Internationalization theory

Johanson & Vahlne (1977), but the authors have since revisited the model several times
(2009, 2013, 2017). Johanson & Vahlne (1977) conducted empirical research regarding
the internationalization of businesses to understand how companies progress from
operating in one country to new markets. Based on their research, the two authors created
a model for the process of company internationalization. The model presents that
companies enter new markets gradually. Additionally, companies use and incorporate
information regarding foreign countries in the internationalization process and the
companies progressively expand their commitments abroad. (Johanson & Vahlne 1977)
According to the Uppsala model, companies generally internationalize incrementally,
instead of making great, one-time investments in foreign countries. Johanson & Vahlne
(1977) also found that firms usually start their internationalization process through an
agent and later they might find a subsidiary or manufacturing facilities in the foreign
market. Furthermore, the authors identified that companies usually enter markets, which
are close in psychic distance to the home market (HÃ¶rnell, Vahlne & Wiedersheim-Paul
1972, Johanson & Wiedersheim-Paul 1974; Johanson & Vahlne 1977). The term psychic
distance means perceived differences in regard to language, culture and political structure
according to Hollensen (2007). According to the Uppsala model (Johanson & Vahlne
1977), businesses are often more openminded towards opportunities in similar markets,
and they also believe the market uncertainty to be lower in them (Hollensen 2007).
According to the Uppsala model, companies are focusing on growth, i.e., the gain of
profits in the long run (Williamson 1966; Johanson & Vahlne 1977). Furthermore,
-making across all
levels of the business is believed to be portrayed by these two factors. (Johanson & Vahlne
1977)

8

decisions and the way current activities are performed. These in turn change knowledge
and commitment (cf Aharoni, 1966).

e 1977 p.27)

According to the Uppsala model, knowledge of a market is important since knowledge
various kinds of knowledge (e.g. regarding opportunities and risks in the market).
Knowledge that cannot be taught and is based on previous individual experiences, i.e.,
experiential knowledge (Penrose 1966; Johanson & Vahlne 1977) is most relevant in this
setting, according to the authors (Johanson & Vahlne 1977). Knowledge from previous
experiences is important especially in unstructured situations, in activities that are focused
on interpersonal relationships and in seeing and expressing new opportunities with regard
to noticing tangible opportunities and sensing how well suited they are for the company.
(Johanson & Vahlne 1977)
As mentioned, the Uppsala model has been revisited a few times by the authors, in order
changes to the Uppsala model were made in 2017, when the authors added a new factor to
the model; process ontology and related it to the development of multi-business enterprises
(MBE) (Vahlne & Johanson 2017). In the revisited Uppsala model, the focus is on MBEs
instead of MNEs (multinational enterprises), as presented by Pitelis and Teece (2011;
Vahlne & Johanson 2017),
processes compared to structures, consist of networks instead of single unit, conduct
business trade instead of manufacturing, have a proactive and entrepreneurial mindset
compared to being inactive and lastly, they are decentralized instead of hierarchic. The
term process ontology refers to open-endedness, since one can never be sure of what will
arise from a p
activities affected by constant change, since change is happening nonstop. For managers
to make realistic decisions, they need to be aware of the open-endedness. (Vahlne &
Johanson 2017)
Empirical studies that have been conducted after the study by Johanson & Vahlne (1977),
have suggested that internationalizing according to the Uppsala model affects performance

9

positively (Barkema, Bell & Pennings 1996, Delios & Beamish 2001, Li 1995, Luo &
Peng 1999; Johanson & Vahlne 2009).

2.3 Barriers to internationalization
Kotler et al. (2009) present a few risks that need to be taken into consideration when
deciding to internationalize. It might be difficult for companies to understand the market
they want to enter and offer a product or service that consumers find interesting and that
is competitive. The business culture can be different in another country, even in a
neighboring one. Companies might not be prepared for unexpected costs or undervalue
legislations and regulations in the country. The managers might lack experience of
working internationally, which can be problematic. Lastly the trade laws and political
climate might change in the foreign country and the currency might devalue, which can
be challenging to prepare for. (Kotler et al. 2009)
There are some other barriers that might hinder the initiation of internationalization and
these barriers are primarily internal; inadequate funds, lacking knowledge, insufficient
relations to the foreign market, inadequate commitment for exporting, insufficient funds
for market entry, lack of production capacity to commit to international markets,
insufficient international distribution networks, managerial focus on the development of
home markets and increased cost because of high export production, distribution and
expenses. Furthermore, general market risks (e.g. language/culture barriers, distance
between markets), commercial risks (e.g. unstable exchange rates, insufficient funding)
and political risks (e.g. governmental restrictions, high tax rates) might prevent companies
from beginning their internationalization process. (Hollensen 2007)
Johanson & Vahlne (1977) present a few problems regarding internationalization in
gradual steps. One problem is that the companies do not have practices for how to react to
difficulties and opportunities that present themselves within companies or their
environment. Companies usually resolve problems they meet as separate issues. (Cyert &
March 1963; Johanson & Vahlne 1977) Another problem affecting internationalization is
the lack of relevant market knowledge regarding foreign markets, and the lack of
knowledge lead to a feeling of uncertainty for entering new markets (HÃ¶rnell, Vahlne &
Wiedersheim-Paul 1972, Johanson 1970; Johanson & Vahlne 1977). If a business feels
10

try. In
decisionforeign markets also affects how willing they are to commit to that market (Johanson &
Vahlne 1977).

internationalization
Companies that originate from small open economies, so called SMOPEC-countries, are
often more interested in internationalization than companies that have a large home market
(Bellak & Cantwell 1998; Benito, Larimo, Narula & Pedersen 2014). Many SMOPECcountries have a small domestic market, leading them to investigate new markets. (Benito
et al. 2014) Benito et al. (2014) investigated whether Nordic SMOPEC-countries have
started focusing more on strategic internationalization, instead of operational
internationalization by examining the top ten largest firms of the Nordic countries and
their internationalization during the 19
on moving R&D, management tasks or company funds abroad. However, operational
internationalization includes internationalizing manufacturing or trading products/services
to other countries. The study found that numerous companies still focused mainly on
moving their operational affairs abroad (e.g. to reduce expenses and gain access to new
assets, that can only be found in other markets). (Benito et al. 2014)
Larimo & Huuhka (2007) have also studied how the largest retailers from Finland and
Sweden have internationalized to Russia and Baltic markets, with regard to five case
for internationalization and market entry strategies are investigated. The authors found
that Eastern European countries are becoming potential markets for international retailing
companies, due to governmental reforms and market growth in these markets. The five
companies started by expanding from their home markets to countries that were close,
both with regard to geography and culture. (Larimo & Huuhka 2007)
Retailers are often active in multiple markets. According to Deloitte (2006; Larimo &
Huuhka 2007), 60% o
11

the retailers that were only conducting business in their home markets, had a large home
market (e.g. the United States). Finland and Sweden are both small markets with high
living standards, meaning that these markets are limited in terms of growth possibilities
for large businesses. (Larimo & Huuhka 2007)
Regarding cultural and geographic proximity, similarities between the cultures in the
Baltic countries, Russia, Finland and Sweden exist and these countries are also
geographically close to one another. Another factor that is important in retailing, is the
size and growth of the market. (Larimo & Huuhka 2007) Russia is a vast market, where
the middle class is growing (Larimo & Huuhka 2007) and furthermore, the rate of
economic growth in the Baltics and Russia is higher than median growth in the EU (EBRD,
2005; Larimo & Huuhka 2007).
The five case companies analyzed in the article are the Finnish retailers Stockmann, Sgroup and K-group and the Swedish retailers ICA and IKEA. The companies were
interested in internationalizing to Eastern Europe both due to elements in their home
markets, which are small and limited, and due to Eastern Europe showing high market
potential, regarding growth in the markets and low market concentration. (Larimo &
Huuhka 2007) According to Larimo & Huuhka (2007), the analyzed companies followed
the incremental internationalization process presented in the Uppsala model by Johanson
& Vahlne (1977), beginning the internationalization with entering similar markets with
regard to culture and geographical closeness and later entering more divergent markets.
Furthermore, the businesses begun with non-intensive entry modes to progressively using
more intensive market entry modes. However, significant differences were found between
the firms regarding chosen market and operational strategies, when entering the Baltic
countries and Russia. (Larimo & Huuhka 2007)
The article by Larimo & Huuhka (2007) also found that the internationalization of the case
companies indicated that risk-taking and being prepared to encounter problems concerning
ambiguous legislation, taxation and applying for permits, is needed for companies to
succeed in Russia. Even though the Baltic markets and Russia are showing high potential,
the returns were slow, and companies should be prepared that it takes time for the business
to become profitable in these markets. An incremental internationalization process is
indicated to be the right option in Russia, even though the market is becoming more
12

concentrated, and the markets are changing in a quicker pace. (Larimo & Huuhka 2007)
The situation in Russia has changed noticeably in recent years and therefore the article by
Larimo & Huuhka (2007) is not an up-to-date source, concerning market potential and
Nordic countries entry into the market. Since 2007, the political and economic situation
between the EU and Russia have changed, due to several human rights issues in Russia
have been noted by the media (e.g. regarding LGBTQ rights and freedom of speech
(Amnesty International 2021), Russia invaded Krim, Ukraine in 2014 and the situation is
still fragile (BBC, 2021). Furthermore, the European Commission has identified 31 trade
barriers affecting the business between the EU and Russia (European Commission, 2020),
indicating that entering Russia might not be as simple as presented in literature.

3 Market potential assessment and market entry modes
In this chapter of the thesis the evaluation of market potential is presented, first by
explaining how the process is presented in some books and later diving into different
approaches presented in articles. Moreover, market entry modes are presented shortly.

3.1 Market potential assessment
Although the world is becoming flatter for globalized organisations, there is still some

products and services, and its attractiveness as a market, depend on its economic,
political, legal and cultural environments.
When choosing a new market to enter, there might be many markets to choose from and
complicated to define which have the most potential. Many businesses decide to
internationalize to countries that are close to the home market, since these markets can be
more familiar, and the expenses might be lower than when entering markets further away.
Nonetheless, companies might decide to enter markets that are close in psychic proximity.
This might though be risky, since businesses might miss out on more attractive markets
and they could potentially omit analyzing the market adequately and assume that the
business model used in the domestic market will work in the new market, which might not
be the case. (Kotler et al. 2009) Kotler et al. (2009) mention that it can be efficient for
companies to enter less countries and instead focus on markets with higher engagement,
which are easy to enter. Furthermore, businesses usually are interested in entering markets
that show high market potential, markets that show little market risk and markets where
companies might enjoy a competitive edge (Kotler et al. 2009).
In order for a market to be attractive for businesses there should be moderate competition
and few players, the market should have some potential to grow, and the consumers should
have an unfulfilled need for the product or service the business is providing; in other
words, market attractiveness should be considered with environmental conditions,
competitive circumstances and accessible resources in mind (Cooper 1993; Simkin &

14

Dibb 1998). McDonald and Dunbar (1995; Simkin & Dibb 1998) present three similar
factors for market attractiveness: rate of growth, the available market segment size and
potential for revenue.
According to Arefjevs, Volkova & Lindemane (2013), assessing market potential before
entering a foreign market and before making any strategic decisions linked to this is
important. The authors mention that there are many issues to be considered regarding
market potential, but market growth and market saturation of

industry are the

most important issues to focus on. When making a preliminary screening of target markets
that companies could enter, entry mode should not yet be considered according to Root
(1994; Arefjevs et al. 2013).

3.1.1 Phases of market potential assessment
When companies are interested in entering foreign markets, the process of finding suitable
markets to enter can be divided into four steps according to Johansson (2000). In the first
step all potential markets that can be entered should be acknowledged. Usually, companies
decide to focus on a specific part of the world. After choosing an interesting continent,
businesses usually conduct a deeper analysis of the countries in the area. In the first stage
companies usually focus on easily accessible data, like GNP, market growth and the
economic and political climate in the countries. Furthermore, the population of the
different countries can be valuable information. (Johansson 2000) Czinkota et al. (2011)
also mention that when starting the evaluation of markets, general country variables as
GDP, GDP growth and population statistics ought to be considered. These variables do
not show industry specific market potential, but can be used as indicators whether the
businesses goals and purposes can be fulfilled in the markets and help companies narrow
down the potential countries from a large number to a few countries that are easier to work
with. (Czinkota et al. 2011)
The next step for finding potential markets is a preliminary screening. In this stage
companies can focus on indicators such as financial development, physical distance, or
stability in the political climate. During this step it could be beneficial for companies to
figure out the costs for entering the different markets (e.g. trade fees, transportation fees
and distribution fees). After this, companies can start the in-depth screening. This is the
15

most crucial stage of defining market potential. Many different criteria can be used for the
step, but most commonly market size, market growth, the intensity of competition and
trade barriers are considered. When focusing on the size of the market, GNP, the growth
of GNP or the size of the population can be used for measurements. When investigating
market growth companies can investigate how the size of the market has developed during
the past years. The amount of competitors and the size of their market shares can be used
for measuring the intensity of competition. Markets where many companies have a small
share of the market, or where other competitors have been able to enter the market from
abroad can be good options, while it can be difficult to enter markets that have a strong
presence of local companies. Lastly, costs of transportation, duty fees and taxes can be
barriers for starting trade in the specific market. Companies should also learn what kind
of duties and tariffs are applied to the products they are offering in the foreign countries.
(Johansson 2000) Market potential regarding the certain products or services offered by
companies as well as how well the market suits

strengths should also be taken

into account in this step according to Czinkota et al. (2011).
In the last selection

profit and the different

costs between the countries are compared, in order to find markets that suit companies the
best. On one hand, countries that are alike

have lower

market entry costs, present a smaller risk, and might offer fast revenues. On the other hand,
countries that show higher potential over time could offer companies new possibilities.
The different markets can be compared by creating weighing factors based on significance
for the different market potential aspects, leading to a ranking of the different markets,
showing which countries have the highest potential. (Johansson 2000)

3.1.2 Earlier research regarding market potential assessment
Cavusgil (1985) has created a three-step model for finding foreign markets with high
potential. The model is based on personal interviews conducted with US company
executives. According to Cavusgil (1985), the starting point for beginning to compare and
analyze foreign markets can be vastly different from company to company; certain
businesses might know which markets they are interested in and want to learn more about,
while others have not made any specific decisions and want to investigate a large set of
markets. During market research, managers most commonly want to learn which markets
16

are showing potential with regard to company products and their sales potential, and
regarding distribution; how to choose and assess distributors and trade agents. Cavusgil
(1985) found that most companies conduct market research in an unstructured way. Since
there are many countries in the world and investigating all of these in depth is impossible,
Cavusgil (1985) recommends that market research should be done in steps.
The three-step model consist of a preliminary phase, where a few potential markets should
be identified and more thoroughly investigated later in the process. In this first step, the
demographic setting, political situation, economic and cultural environment of the
different countries are investigated and based on these, certain markets will be eliminated
from further research. The second step is assessing the

. In this

step, access to market, potential of product and manufacturing and distribution locally are
investigated. Furthermore, information from the primary step and data from the second
step can be combined, in order to achieve a full picture of the different markets
investigated. Other factors that are relevant for the company specific industry, should be
investigated in this step as well (e.g. consumer expenditure on company products and
attitude towards raw materials). The final step in the model, is the
potential, where the interesting markets that are left are investigated with regard to sales
prognosis, landed cost, distribution costs and further profitability elements. The final step
often necessitates the collection of primary data through field research (e.g. by visiting the
foreign market or by using an external market research firm). (Cavusgil 1985) Cavusgil
(1985) also identifies that much secondary data is available, so the absence of information
is usually not a problem for managers conducting market research, but how to find relevant
data for their company.
A paper by Cavusgil et al. (2004) focuses on complementing preliminary foreign market
evaluation by including two approaches: country clustering and country ranking. The
-making process, regarding choosing suitable new
markets. In international marketing, there are two commonly used approaches for
ustering and ranking. When using the clustering
approach, countries that share similarities (e.g. in terms of culture or political climate) are
put into groups. The ranking approach ranks countries in terms of market potential, based
on chosen, relevant factors. If both approaches are be used simultaneously, it could be
easier to find smaller groups of countries that are interesting for companies. According to
17

some researchers, these two methods should be used for assessing country attractiveness
as a first step in the process, while other researchers think that these methods should be
used when making the final decisions or in order to segment markets. Some criticism
towards country clustering is that the method should be more focused on product/service
variables, and that clustering is usually based on utilization of secondary data. However,
is easier to access. (Cavusgil et al. 2004) The main criticism towards country ranking is
also the absence of focus on product/service specific variables (Papadopoulos & Denis
1988; Cavusgil et al. 2004). On the other hand, when using country ranking, companies
can choose to use variables that are important to them or give different weights to the
variables used, based on importance for their company. The authors recommend using
country ranking only in the preliminary phases of foreign market assessment. (Cavusgil et
al. 2004)
The study by Cavusgil et al. (2004) found that using a combination of country clustering
and ranking, can help managers make decisions regarding foreign market potential. When
using indexing, managers can use weighing factors in order to mirror the importance of
these factors for the business. Country ranking is unhelpful in finding suitable market
strategies but using clustering as a simultaneous method can help fill in this gap. The goal
of the study was mainly to simplify the task of selecting suitable markets. (Cavusgil et al.
2004)
Sheng & Mullen (2010) have created a hybrid model for investigating foreign markets for
exporting, which is based on a mix of the OMOI - the Overall Market Opportunity Index
-based gravity model of
ng & Mullen p. 163) and it aims to focus on the potential of the
industry, instead of general market potential. The model is based on earlier theories from
based on multiple factors, but size of market, geographical distance, economic strength,
and trade agreements were identified as the most relevant market potential indicators in
their model. (Sheng & Mullen 2011)
Internationalization is seen as crucial for development and revenue by many business
managers (Ozturk et al. 2015). According to Ozturk et al. (2015), only a few market18

selection studies have focused on B2C products/services, while most of the previous
studies have focused on production and industrial marketing. Ozturk et al. (2015) have
developed a three-step tool for evaluating potential markets, to help managers find the
most suitable markets for their companies. The model is industry specific and focuses on
income elasticity of
consumer spending on a specific industry is examined. Depending on the income
elasticity, countries are rated as responsive or unresponsive to changes in expenditure in
the industry. The growth potential of income and consumer spending in a specific industry
in the chosen countries is reviewed in the second step. The last step is a mixture of markers
of responsiveness and growth potential with an overall extent (e.g. GDP rate of growth or
other parameters that are relevant and significant for a particular industry). Besides the
three-step tool, companies should contemplate on other aspects that impact the
practicalities and attractiveness of the markets; companies could consider entry barriers,
tariffs, taxes, or accessibility of fitting affiliates. (Ozturk et al. 2015) Many barriers are
linked to specific industries or companies, so considering assets and competences when
comparing different markets to enter is important (Ojala & TyrvÃ¤inen 2007; Ozturk et al.
2015).
In this chapter, several different models, and alternatives for assessing foreign markets and
their potential have been discussed and some similarities as well as differences can be
distinguished in the different frameworks by different authors. In the table below, the
chosen models by the writer are presented in a chart, in order to clearly present which
factors different researchers have identified to be relevant when choosing which foreign
market to enter.

3.2 Industry specific market potential factors
In this part of the thesis some market potential factors that are relevant for the specific
industry of packaged consumer goods will be presented, that have been identified during
the research process.

3.2.1 Market size and market growth
Market potential, in the case of market size and market growth, is according to Russow
and Okoroafo (1996; Arefjevs et al. 2013) a key incentive for market entry. Market growth
can be measured both in terms of industry level and country level (e.g. GDP growth or
other general measure), according to Arefjevs et al. (2013). An industry can be seen as
companies that provide products/

ecific needs.

When considering market growth, some industries might be growing, while others are
declining, even though a country's economy might be growing in general. This indicates
eral national market
growth and numbers, when assessing market attractiveness is relevant. (Arefjevs et al.
2013) Market size and/or growth has also been presented as a relevant indicator of market
potential in multiple other articles (cf. Johansson 2000, Sheng & Mullen 2011, Cavusgil
et al. 2004). Furthermore, Aaker (2011) presents that market growth can indicate bigger
sales and revenue and less pressure on pricing, if the demand is growing faster than supply,
while market shrinkage might again lead to smaller sales and more competition and price
pressure.

3.2.2 Level of competition
The intensity of competition in a market depends on multiple factors. One factor is the
ore

21

competition, while rivalry is minor in markets with an overwhelming leader. The market
growth rate also affects the competition level in a market, since slow growth often leads
to greater competition. The cost structure is another factor, because high fixed costs
stimulate cutting prices in order to fulfill capacity. The degree of differentiation affects
the rivalry as well, as commodity products incites more competition, while differentiated
products are often related to less competition. Lastly, exit barriers, that can be linked to
absence of opportunities in other markets or high expenses for leaving the market, increase
rivalry in markets. (Hollensen 2007) Other authors have also highlighted the importance
om market concentration in market potential assessment (cf. Johansson 2000, Cavusgil et
al. 2004).
Aaker (2011) presents a few factors that affect the competitive climate in markets. Firstly,
the number of competitors in the market affects competition, since more competitors
t share
also impacts competition. The second factor is the products on the market, are they similar
to each other or are they unique. High fixed costs in a market also affects competition,
since surplus of products or price pressures might be rough on companies in the market.
Lastly, exit barriers might increase competition, if companies are bound to the market by
lengthy contracts or market-specialized products. (Aaker 2011) Aaker et al. (2006)
mention that most companies foll

3.2.3 Brands compared with private labels
In this thesis brand refers to a product that is being sold by a manufacturer under their own
brand name (e.g. Cocamight be produced by another manufacturer (e.g. Pirkka, sold in K-Grou
Rainbow, sold in SIn the past, brands have had a strong hold in the retailing industry, but during the last years
become more popular among
customers and private labels are showing larger growth than brands according to Kotler &
22

Armstrong (2010). Retailers are offering private label brands and a wide product
assortment of high quality nowadays, instead of only providing a cheaper alternative to
brands. Retailers have plenty of power in the matter since they decide what brands and
products they sell in their stores. Furthermore, retailers are often able to offer their
products to a cheaper price compared to brands. In addition, private labels offer higher
profit margins to the retailers, even though they might be expensive to launch at first. In
focus greatly on research and development of their products, for example by presenting
new brands, enhanced products or higher-quality products. Brands can also improve their
co-operation with distributors and focus on advertising, to stay competitive. (Kotler &
Armstrong 2010)
According to a study by Martos-Partal (2012), private labels have become popular in
consumer-packaged goods and by innovation strategy, i.e. producing new innovative
products, brands could combat this trend. For products
but channel power is high, companies can preserve or grow their market share in these
markets by innovating. When innovating in this category, brands can provide consumers
new features that private labels are unable to offer
interest is high, but channel power is low, and for these products brands can innovate to
keep their existing market share. (Martos-Partal 2012)
The popularity of private labels changes depending on the economic situation. When the
economy is challenging, private labels grow in popularity, meaning that when the
economy is strong and stable, the private label market share usually decreases. Over half
of businesses that produce branded B2C goods also manufacture private-label products as
well, which means that businesses can fight private labels by competing with them and/or
supermarkets, meaning that retailers have a vast influence on producers. This is partly
because a few domestic chains control the grocery market in Western Europe. (Quelch &
Harding 1996)

23

3.2.4 Market segmentation
When thinking about a market, there are many potential customers, products and needs
that exist in it. When entering a market, companies need to decide which segment has the
highest potential. Companies can use market segmentation to break up customers into
smaller groups, in other words segments. The segments can for instance be based on
geographic factors, demographic factors, the customer's needs or shopping behavior, and
the different segments might need different kinds of products or different kinds of
marketing strategies. When companies have formed different types of market segments,
they can choose which segments to enter by assessing their potential. Some companies
decide to focus on only one specific segment, while other companies might want to focus
on many segments that are related to each other. Companies might also start by focusing
on one segment at first, while later adding more segments if companies are successful in
the market. For companies to be able to distinguish themselves from competitors in the
market, they can either try to create a specific position for their product, meaning why a
customer would want to buy specifically their product or companies can focus on
differentiating their product on the market, to give customers more value. (Kotler &
Armstrong 2010)
In order for market segments to be beneficial for a companies, Kotler & Armstrong (2010)
recommend that the different segments need to be measurable (market size, purchasing
power and different segment variables need to be measurable), accessible (market
segments should be accessible and servable), substantial (segments ought to be large
enough or lucrative enough), differentiable (segments should be identifiable and have
different needs) and actionable (to serve segments, product or marketing differentiation
can be planned to interest them).

3.3 Market entry modes
Madhok (1997) presents two important factors that impact decisions regarding foreign
market entry.

decision for foreign market entry is the first factor, i.e., the

motivation to enter a new market. Generally, when companies decide to enter a new
market, this is done either to profit from a benefit, reinforce their current advantage or to
cultivate a completely new advantage, which can be associated with existing benefits. The
24

process by which companies choose to enter specific market, simply put the chosen entry
mode, is the second factor impacting market entries. (Madhok 1997) Choosing what
market to enter and choosing a suitable market entry mode are closely linked, but these
are still two separate decisions (Papadopoulos & Jansen 1994; Arefjevs et al. 2013).
One definition for entry modes is that they are a structural arrangement permitting
companies to execute a market strategy in a new country, by simply conducting marketing
activities or manufacturing there (Sharma & Erramilli 2004; Ulrich et al. 2014). Entry
modes have also been characterized by Root (in Andersen 1997) as an institutional
structure for arranging and performing international business (e.g. transfer of contracts,
joint ventures). Andersen (1997) states that one key element of internationalization is entry
vital part of it. Another important part of international marketing is selecting a suitable
entry mode for a specific foreign country (Wind & Perlmutter 1977; Andersen 1997).
Erramilli & Rao (1990) mention a few ways how businesses can enter foreign markets;
exporting, contract agreements and foreign direct investment (FDI).

3.3.1 Different market entry modes
Kotler, Armstrong, Saunders & Wong (2005) present a few different market entry modes.
The first market entry strategy is exporting, which is the easiest option of market entry,
meaning that the firm manufactures the product/service in their domestic market and
exports them to another market. Exporting can be done by indirect exporting; co-operating
with an international agent or by direct exporting; the firm handling their export processes
themselves. (Kotler et al. 2005) Johansson (2000) also mentions direct marketing as an
exporting mode, (e.g. telemarketing or catalog shopping). According to Agarwal and
a great number of resources, and this can
mean a low risk, but also low returns.
Another mode for market entry is joint venturing, which means that companies co-operate
with foreign firms to enter the foreign market through manufacturing or marketing a
product/service. Joint venturing includes market entry modes such as licensing, contract
manufacturing and joint ownership. (Kotler et al. 2005) Licensing includes franchising,
where companies support the franchisees by capital, expertise and managerial support
25

among others (Johansson 2000). Agarwal and Ramaswami (1992) mention that this entry
mode requires low investment, which in turn means that risk, profit and control depend on
the amount of equity investments by the investing firm. When companies collaborate in
order to share or trade actions, this is called strategic alliances. Companies can collaborate
by sharing the same distribution network or by collaborating regarding production or
research and development. (Johansson 2000)
The last market entry mode is foreign direct investment (FDI), which means that the firm
creates an assembly or production facilities in the foreign market. This entry mode has
four great advantages that include reduced costs (affordable workforce, cheaper materials,
or reduced shipping costs), creating jobs in the foreign market (improving the opinions
regarding the firm), more customized products for the market (by a good relationship with
important stakeholders) and better supervision over the investment (possibility to develop
policies relevant to strategic, global goals). (Kotler et al. 2005) Johansson (2000) mentions
that a new assembly facility doesn't need to be established, companies can also acquire
plants that already exist. A manufacturing facility in new markets companies are entering,
can help ensure a stable flow of products for the new customers. Furthermore, it might
help create specific products that suit the needs and preferences of the customers.
Exporting is usually needed when companies conduct FDI, since parts or raw material
might be needed from the home market. (Johansson 2000) Kotler et al. (2009) mention
that companies might choose different market entry modes even in similar markets,
because of their available network relationships.

According to some theories, companies ought to base their decision for market entry
modes on which entry mode presents the highest return compared to the risk of the
investment (Agarwal & Ramaswami 1992). There are many frameworks that have been
1997). According to
Agarwal and Ramaswami (1992) countries that present low market potential, might be
unattractive for foreign firms looking to enter new markets. Nevertheless, large companies
that already have a strong position in a domestically or internationally can be interested in
these lower-potential markets to gain growth and return goals (Agarwal & Ramaswami
1992).
26

Agarwal and Ramaswami (1992) have conducted a study where they researched how
ownership benefits, market location benefits and benefits regarding
internationalization of transaction incorporation impacts the decision regarding market
entry modes. Ownership advantages presented by the authors are the size of company,
experience of international markets and capability of inventing and manufacturing
differentiated products. Advantages regarding location are the potential of the market and
the risk of investment. Lastly, the advantages regarding the internationalization process
are risks regarding contracts and legal issues. According to the findings of the study, many
companies would prefer to enter new markets through direct investment, but the
mode. Furthermore, the study shows that many companies use investment entry modes in
markets with high potential, but large MNCs might also use these modes in markets with
a lower potential, if entering these markets is needed for their strategic advances. Many
companies are still cautious about entering markets that are believed to be risky. (Agarwal
& Ramaswami 1992)
Johansson (2000) mentions that entry barriers might also affect companies market entry
mode (e.g. government regulations, transportation costs, tariffs, required licenses and
brand loyalty). The different market entry barriers might also lead to higher costs, which
in turn leads to higher product costs, also for the consumers. (Johansson 2000) In other
entry
modes.

3.4 Summary of the theoretical framework
To summarize the theoretical framework, i.e. chapters two and three, many companies are
interested in internationalization, due to numerous reasons. Some companies want to grow
and expand abroad due to their limited home markets, while others enter new markets in
order to stay competitive or to attain more profitability. The Uppsala model of
internationalization (Johanson & Vahlne 1977) presents that companies tend to enter
markets that feel similar to their home market, with regard to language, culture and often
also geographical location. Furthermore, some studies show that Nordic companies tend
to internationalize because of their small, contented home markets and that they tend to
27

internationalize progressively by first entering similar markets and later entering more
markets, similarly as presented in the Uppsala model. There are some risks with
internationalization, so understanding the markets, learning more about possible risks,
having sufficient production capacity and funds, and preparing for possible problematic
situations is important for companies before expanding.
Furthermore, different models for assessing market potential presented in literature and
articles were presented, including Cav
ranking and clustering by Cavusgil et al. (2004), a hybrid model by Sheng & Mullen
(2011), as well as an industry specific model by Ozturk et al. (2015). Market entry modes
were also presented shortly, including exporting, joint venturing, and foreign direct
investment.
There are a few factors that are included in multiple frameworks and can thus be seen as
especially relevant when assessing market potential. Market size, risk factors, access to
market and culture are some of the topics mentioned in multiple frameworks (cf. Sheng &
Mullen 2011, Cavusgil et al. 2004). Moreover, many articles mention the importance of
industry specific factors (cf. Sheng & Mullen 2011, Ozturk et al. 2015) and therefore,
some industry specific factors relevant for the case company have been identified,
including the differences in private labels and brands, level of competition and market size
and growth.

4 Methodology
In this part of the thesis, research methods in general will first be presented and then the
chosen methodology for the study will be presented more in depth. Additionally, the
advantages of the chosen method will be introduced, as well as some criticism towards the
research approach. Reliability, replication and validity will also be discussed.

4.1 Introduction
This thesis was conducted as part of a project within Company X, where European markets
were compared and analyzed, in order for the case company to find a market with the
highest potential. Furthermore, the writer created a market assessment framework, partly
based on the project and its objectives, and partly based on frameworks presented in the
theoretical part of the thesis.
The project group consisted of four participants: a Project Manager, an Insights Manager,

the progress of the project, as well as the market potential framework are part of the thesis
data collection, in the form of qualitative data. During the project the author participated
in a quantitative analysis of quantitative data, researched additional information regarding
markets in the form of quantitative data and qualitative data, and made field notes and
observations during the project, i.e., qualitative data. Because of the nature of the project
within Company X, a suitable research method for this thesis is mixed method research,
since quantitative data is used and qualitative data is needed to further understand the
markets, as well as for the author to be able to compare a real case of market potential
assessment by a company, with the frameworks presented in theory in order to be able to
create a market potential framework based on both theory and practice to be used in the
packaged consumer goods in the specialist retail industry.
During the project work, which continued from October 2020 t
part, the project group had meetings between once per week to once every three weeks,

29

schedule. Usually, the whole project group was gathered, but at times only certain
members of the group have met. The author has had some private meetings with the
Insights Manager, since they have also been instructing the author with this thesis.
Furthermore, the author worked on the quantitative analysis together with the Category
Manager, in order to decide which numbers and factors should be analyzed from
Euromonitor and how the risk factors could be included. The author has also met with the
Project Manager a few times, to receive some feedback to conducted research or
presentations, or in order to gain more information of next steps, as well as to discuss the
topics investigated in the market research project.

4.2 Research method: A mixed method approach
A suitable method is needed when conducting research, i.e. an approach for finding
answers and new knowledge within a certain field. In research, the method is used as a
tool or an instrument. How information is obtained, organized and interpreted is impacted
by the chosen method. (Larsen 2018) There are two main types of methods that can be
distinguished: qualitative and quantitative research. Before conducting research, deciding
what you want to achieve and choosing the method accordingly is important. The main
difference between a qualitative and a quantitative study is in the data collection; different
types of methods lead to a specific type of data. Quantitative data can usually be measured
in numbers, while qualitative data usually focuses more on attributes and are
immeasurable. (Larsen 2018)

Mixed method research can be defined as a study that utilizes both qualitative and
quantitative data during the data collection and/or data analysis and the data collection
might be done either simultaneously or successively, combining it in only one phase or
multiple phases of the research (Creswell 2003; Hurmerinta-PeltomÃ¤ki & Nummela 2006).
In the field of business and management research, combined research models, i.e., mixed
method or multi-strategy research models can be used (Bryman & Bell 2011). Within the
field, the usage of mixed method research has been seen as needed by researchers, but the
method is still used less than single-method approaches (e.g. Clark et al. 1999, Peterson
2004; Hurmerinta-PeltomÃ¤ki & Nummela 2006). In some cases mixed methods are not
seen as a separate approach, instead studies are classified as either quantitative or

30

qualitative studies, which implies that mixed method research still has a smaller position
(Andersen & Skaates 2004, Mendenhall et al. 1993, Werner 2002; Hurmerinta-PeltomÃ¤ki
& Nummela 2006).
Bryman and Bell (2011) have made a few observations regarding mixed method research.
They highlight that planning and conducting all types of research, including mixed method
research, in a professional manner is needed to ensure the results are trustworthy. The
research questions or research subject should also be suitable for a mixed method study,
since working with relevant data and preventing additional data collection in vain is
important. The authors also mention that presenting clearly why a mixed method research
approach has been chosen for the study is needed, in order for the correlation between the
chosen method and research questions to be clear and what the authors want to accomplish
with the chosen approach. Moreover, thinking of mixed method research as a whole,
instead of focusing on the qualitative and quantitative factors as separate sections is
recommended. Presenting necessary details about the methodology, for both the
qualitative and quantitative part of the research is also relevant. Sometimes, one of the
components is more thoroughly explained, but sampling, research design and the data
analysis of both datasets need to be presented evenly. (Bryman, Becker & Sempik 2008,

The research process of the thesis has been thoroughly planned, where the author has first
worked with the quantitative data, and later worked with qualitative data, in order to fill
thesis, the author has gathered observations throughout the whole market research process.
Including observations in the thesis was not part of the original plan, but fortunately field
notes from each meeting have been made, in order to be able to recollect what was
discussed. When the author joined the project and started to work on the thesis, they were
undecided on how to present the qualitative side of the project and thesis. Observations
were chosen as the method, so the author would be able to present what the research
process has looked like as a whole, as well as discussions in the project group and how
country specific market information has been researched and found.

4.2.1 Different approaches to mixed method research
There are several different approaches for how to conduct mixed method research and
Hurmerinta-PeltomÃ¤ki & Nummela (2006) have identified 13 different options on how to
combine qualitative and quantitative research. Some examples of the options are one type
of data with another type of analysis (e.g. qualitative data with quantitative analysis), two
types of data with one type of analysis (e.g. quantitative and qualitative data with
quantitative analysis of both datasets), one type of data with two types of analysis (e.g.
qualitative data with both qualitative and quantitative analysis), two types of data with two
types of analysis (e.g. quantitative data with quantitative analysis and qualitative data with
qualitative analysis) and so on. (Hurmerinta-PeltomÃ¤ki & Nummela 2013)
Earlier mixed methods were mainly used during data collection, but later this method was
introduced into other phases of the research process (Bryman 1992, Creswell 2003, Patton
1990, Scandura & Williams 2000, Sechrest & Sidani 1995; Hurmerinta-PeltomÃ¤ki &
Nummela 2013). According to Hurmerinta-PeltomÃ¤ki & Nummela (2013), four steps can
be defined methodically: initiation; before collecting data (e.g. when establishing the focus
of research), implementation; during the data collection (cf. Creswell et al. 2003;
Hurmerinta-PeltomÃ¤ki & Nummela 2013), integration; after the data analysis and
comparison (cf. Creswell et al. 2003; Hurmerinta-PeltomÃ¤ki & Nummela 2013) and
interpretation, after the conclusions have been made.
When working with mixed methods research Bryman & Bell (2011) also present different
approaches for using the method. One approach of this research method is triangulation,
which means that results from one research method are ensured or verified by using
another research method. Another approach for mixed method research is that qualitative
research facilitates quantitative research, where the qualitative research steers the
quantitative research. The following approach is quantitative research facilitating
qualitative research. When conducting research and neither a quantitative or qualitative
method can unaided provide reliable results, one method can support the other in order to
gain valuable outcomes and this approach is used to filling gaps. Quantitative studies
might offer a more static depiction of a situation, but also disclosing regularities, while
qualitative studies might show a more processual depiction of the situation. Therefore,

32

using a mixed method approach could help show both sides of the situation and this
approach is called static and processual features. (Bryman & Bell 2011)
Another approach is

, which can be applied

when researchers want to learn more about their participants by using qualitative data to
they are interested in. The next approach is the problem of generality, where a combination
of quantitative and qualitative methods are used in order to improve the generalization of
(e.g. by using a quantitative aspect when analyzing qualitative data).
Qualitative research facilitating the interpretation of the connection between variables is
an alternative approach, since one problem in quantitative research is explaining the
connection between different variables. (Bryman & Bell 2011) The following mixed
method approach is studying different aspects of a phenomenon and this approach
combines micro and macro levels, with phases of the research process, offering a more
general expression (Bryman 1988; Bryman & Bell 2011). The last approach is solving a
puzzle, where unexpected results from a study can be investigated by using another
research method than originally planned (Bryman & Bell 2011).
In this thesis, the quantitative data will be analyzed quantitatively and the qualitative data
qualitatively, so in this case there are both two sets of data, as well as two types of analysis.
market potential research was the quantitative
analysis of quantitative data, which then implied which markets should be investigated
further. Therefore, in the case of the market research project at Company X quantitative
data facilitates qualitative research. In this thesis, however, it can be seen as filling in the
gaps, where the observations of how market research was conducted at a company is
presented with the support of how the quantitative analysis of quantitative data was
conducted by the author and the project group during the market research project. When
working on this thesis, the author has worked with both quantitative and qualitative data
throughout the whole process.

4.2.2 Strengths and challenges of mixed method research
As presented, researchers might decide to use a combination of qualitative and quantitative
methods in the same research. Since all research methods have some weaknesses, using
33

(Larsen 2018). According to McGrath (1982; Hurmerinta-PeltomÃ¤ki & Nummela 2006)
no research method is complete or perfect, which means that diversity in methods is highly
recommended. Karl Weick (1979; Hurmerinta-PeltomÃ¤ki & Nummela 2006) has
presented that when working with a complicated situation, a limited research method
discloses only a small portion of the reality. Thus, a mixed method approach might offer
a wider presentation of a complex problem.
Doyle, Brady & Byrne (2019) mention that one of the key challenges regarding mixed
methods research is the problem of conflicting results and handling them. For most
researchers, consistency amid quantitative and qualitative findings is the objective, but
through conflicting findings researchers might discover new theories and understanding
(Creswell et al. 2008; Doyle et al. 2019) The discrepancies between the two kinds of
results are required to be recognized and the differences need to be tackled by researchers,
ffected if these contradictory results are
disregarded (Ivankova, 2014; Doyle et al. 2019).
There has also been some criticism towards the use of mixed methods, with two common
arguments. The first argument, the embedded methods argument, is that quantitative and
qualitative research methods have different kinds of epistemological and ontological
obligations, meaning that the research methods are not just an approach for data collection,
but have a certain commitment. (Bryman & Bell 2011) Some argue that the two different
research approaches encourage various procedures, and the epistemological significance
is different, meaning that the two approaches should not be seen as complementary (Smith
1983; Bryman & Bell 2011). The second argument is the paradigm argument, claiming
that qualitative and quantitative research are paradigms, where epistemological
expectations, values and methods are inseparable and are not compatible (Guba 1985;
Morgan 1998; Bryman & Bell 2011). Thus, this argument implies that when quantitative
and qualitative research are combined, this happens only on a shallow level in one
paradigm, since they are contrary. It has not been proven that the different research
methods would be paradigms, some commonalities and overlaps can be found between
quantitative and qualitative research. Furthermore, both research methodologies are
versatile and can be allocated for different tasks. (Bryman & Bell 2011)

34

When the author worked with the quantitative and qualitative data, there were not any
large discrepancies between the two datasets, though the author was prepared that this
might happen. Since the quantitative data, which has been the starting point of the
research, is based on secondary data the author worried that there might be some issues
with the data. The author was prepared to have to make some clarifying research and
double check some numbers and one project group member did double check some
numbers, but the numbers purchased by Company X were seen as reliable.

4.3 Data collection
The data for the thesis has been collected between October 2020 and June 2021. Since the
research includes both quantitative and qualitative data, some information regarding the
data collected, the data sources and whether the data is classified as quantitative or
qualitative is presented in the table below.

4.4 Data sources
In this chapter of the thesis, the data sources of both the quantitative as well as the
qualitative data will be presented.

4.4.1 Quantitative data sources
Euromonitor International is the world's leading independent provider of strategic
market research. We create data and analysis on thousands of products and services
around the world.
Euromonitor offers market research data and insights for both business and consumer
Euromonitor employs over 1000 analysts in over 100 countries. (Euromonitor
International, n.d.b) Euromonitor uses both primary data collected by them, (e.g. through
surveys, case studies and focus groups), as well as with secondary data (provided by e.g.
governments, trade associations or relevant companies within industries) (GoÃ±i, 2017).
industry and products, as well as the retailing industry in general were investigated.
Through Euromonitor, Company X had access to sales numbers from previous years,
predicted growth in the upcoming years, company market shares, trends, sales channels
European countries, therefore these countries were investigated.

36

One of the other factors that was chosen and identified for the quantitative analysis was
the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) by Yale University. The Environmental
Performance Index gives countries points based on multiple factors regarding
sustainability and the countries are ranked based on the points (the higher the points, the
better the result). The environmental factors considered in the EPI are 32 in total and these
factors are classified into 11 categories which are: air quality, sanitation & fresh water,
heavy metals, management of waste, biodiversity & environment, work for ecosystems,
fishing, climate change, emissions, water resources and farming. The diverse metrics
indicate how close the different countries are to recognized sustainability and
environmental objectives and a total of 180 countries are included in the evaluation. The
methodology and chosen metrics for the EPI are changing based on new findings regarding
sustainability. (Wendling, Emerson, de Sherbin & Esty et. al. 2020) Yale University has
also asked the Joint Research Centre of the EU to review the Environmental Performance
Index from 2020 to guarantee that the methodology of EPI is transparent and that the
findings are reliable. The Joint Research Center found that the EPI is trustworthy and can
be seen as a reliable barometer to compare environmental performance in different
countries. (Papadimitriu, Fragoso Neves & Saisana 2020) Sustainability is important for
Company X and is one of their core values. Therefore, it was relevant to consider
sustainability in the different countries in order to see which countries share the same

Another factor that was identified as important regarding market potential by the case
company was the economic environment, i.e., how risky the country is perceived to be.
Atradius is company specializing in trade credit insurance, guarantees and collecting debts
(Atradius n.d.a). Atradius offers a country risk map, which is based on a STAR-ranking
STAR-rating evaluates how risky a country is (Atradius n.d.b). Countries are given a rating
between 1-10, which signify low risk (1-2), moderate-low risk (3-4), moderate risk (5),
moderate-high risk (6-7), high risk (8-9) and very high risk (10). In a broad sense, country
risk refers to how stable the economic situation in a country is, which in turn affects
investments and revenues in the market. (Atradius n.d.b) With sovereign transfer, Atradius
due to economic factors. From this perspective, sovereign distress is believed to obstruct
the possibility to fulfill cross-border obligations by both public and private parties.
37

Arbitrary risk refers to unpredictable actions by the government, that might affect a
-border debts. In this
case, Atradius is assessing the risk of sovereigns making these decisions out of free will,
previous and present decision-making. (Atradius, n.d.c) According to Atradius (n.d.c), the
country risk map with STAR-ratings is more focused on the political climate in the
country, but since much focus is on countries being able to pay their foreign debts, it was
considered to represent the economic climate in the country as well by the project group.
Another factor when thinking of country risk is the political environment and how the
government works in different countries. Transparency International is multinational
organization that works against corruption around the world (Transparency International
n.d.a). They provide a Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), where they issue scores of 0100 to different countries in the world, in order to rank how corrupt these countries are.
The CPI is based on how corrupt specialists and businesspersons consider the public sector
to be in a certain country. For the CPI, 13 different sources are used and at least three
reliable sources are needed per country in order for them to be ranked by Transparency
International, which means that some countries are missing from the list due to insufficient
sources. When measuring corruption, CPI includes topics such as bribery,
misappropriation of public assets, usage of public office for private benefit without
repercussions and taking efficient action against corrupt officials. (Transparency
International, n.d.b) During the project, the market data from Euromonitor and the
additional factors regarding trade barriers were considered separately.
The last trade barrier examined for the quantitative analysis was EU Membership of the
13 countries investigated, since conducting trade with fellow EU members than with
European countries that are not part of the EU, when trade agreements would need to be
considered and investigated.

4.4.2 Qualitative data sources
While the author has been working with the quantitative data, they have also gathered
qualitative data in the form of observations throughout the project as mentioned
previously. Since the author has been part of the project group, they have been able to
38

follow a real example of how a company conducts market research to find one or more
interesting markets that could be suitable for the company to enter.
The author has made field notes of their observations during the project and a couple of
meetings on Microsoft Teams have also been recorded. When the author has been
observing the research process at the case company, they have also been investigating a
country Company X is interested in and tried to learn more about this market, both in terms
of finding out what is relevant to know about a market from a theory perspective, as well
as researching the country online, contacting relevant offices in order to learn more about
the market and so forth.

4.5 Data analysis
During the project work for Company X quantitative data has been analyzed mostly
quantitatively as well as in the thesis, but some of quantitative data has been considered
and further investigated in the deep dive of the project, i.e., the qualitative research part of
the project. The qualitative part of the project work has been analyzed qualitatively during
the project and in the thesis the observations are also analyzed qualitatively.

4.5.1 Quantitative analysis
Secondary analysis of data most often suggests the process, when data has been collected
by someone (e.g. researchers, companies, or governments) and is later considered and
analyzed by another researcher, who has not been part of the data collection. Though, in
various cases researchers might conduct primary research and make conclusions based on
this research and data, but later use the same data again for other purposes, which can also
be seen as secondary analysis. Furthermore, secondary analysis can be combined with
collection of new, primary data. (Bryman & Bell 2011)
Secondary analysis can refer to analyzing both quantitative (Dale, Arber & Procton 1988;
Bryman & Bell 2011) or qualitative data (Corti, Foster & Thompson 1995; Bryman & Bell
2011), but in this thesis the focus will be on secondary analysis of quantitative data.
Advantages of conducting secondary analysis are multiple. To mention a few, it might
save time and costs, since collecting primary data is often time-consuming and requires
39

resources. Furthermore, secondary data is often extensive, based on high-quality sources
and has been collected by skilled researchers. (Bryman & Bell 2011)
When analyzing quantitative data, numerous approaches for data analysis exist. One of
the simplest methods is univariate analysis, where the researcher focuses on the
distribution of values one variable at a time. Univariate analysis is usually presented in the
form of frequency tables, diagrams, or statistical measures. (Larsen 2018) Diagrams are
often used to demonstrate quantitative data, since diagrams are often clear and
understandable. Both bar charts and pie charts can be used, in order to present differences
in values of one variable. (Bryman & Bell 2011) Another approach for analyzing
quantitative data is bivariate analysis, where the researcher focuses on correlations
between two variables. The value of one variable is linked to the value of another variable
when investigating this type of correlation. Bivariate analysis can also be presented in
three different ways: cross tables, diagrams, or statistical measures. (Larsen 2018)
In this thesis, parts of the quantitative data will be analyzed through univariate analysis
and other parts of the data will be analyzed through bivariate analysis. Both the univariate
and bivariate analysis will be done in the form of different diagrams in Microsoft Excel.

4.5.2 Qualitative analysis
When making observations, researchers should make notes, in order to remember the
observations that they make (Bryman & Bell 2011). Observations can be used both in
quantitative and qualitative research, but they are more commonly used in the latter.
Observations are based on both what the researchers sees and hears, but also on their
interpretations of these. (Larsen 2018) Observations should include a few aspects
according to LÃ¶kken & SÃ¶bstad (2013; Larsen 2018); date, time and duration, place and
notion of persons present, description of the situation and participants behavior, as well as
an interpretation of what happened in relation to literature and earlier research.
Observations can be conducted as both as laboratory observations or field observations,
depending on the situation and environment of the observation. (Larsen 2018)
Observations can be conducted in multiple ways. In non-participatory observations, the
researcher only observes the situation without interacting with the persons who are being
40

observed. During participatory observations the researcher is included in the situation that
is being observed (e.g. by being a part of the organization observed). In passive
participatory observations, the researcher tries to not to affect the situation he or she is
participating in and only describe what is happening. When conducting active
participation observations, the researcher tries to create different reactions by having an
active role in the situation. In open observations the individuals being observed are aware
hidden observations the individuals
being observed are unaware that a researcher is present and observing the situation.
(Larsen 2018)
According to Marshall & Rossman (2006; Gibson & Brown 2009a), the focus of
qualitative data analysis is to examine general statements regarding relationships and core
themes, which means that when analyzing the relationship of the different elements of a
study, general themes can be utilized. According to this view on qualitative analysis,
identifying themes is central for the analysis (Gibson & Brown 2009b). When conducting
a thematic analysis, three general objectives exist for the researcher according to Gibson
& Brown (2009b): investigating commonalities, examining distinctions, and investigating
relationships. When observing commonalities, the researcher should try to find all
examples of the same factors in the data set, in order to analyze and split the commonalities
into a deeper level. The purpose of the examination of differences is finding and examining
distinctions and particularities in the data, in order to determine their relevance for the
researched topic. The final step of thematic analysis is to investigate the relationship of
the different factors included in the analysis, i.e., investigating how the different factors
are connected to one another. (Gibson & Brown 2009b)
The author has made field notes and some recordings throughout the whole research
process, following LÃ¶kken & SÃ¶bstad

(2013; Larsen 2018). The observations

have been conducted as participatory field observations, since the author has been part of
In the qualitative
analysis part of the thesis, the observations are compared and analyzed through different
themes that have been identified as relevant or that have been prominent during the
observations.

41

4.6 Reliability, replication & validity
When conducting research in the field of international business, Bryman & Bell (2011)
present three important criteria for evaluating research: reliability, replication and validity.
Reliability focuses on if the results of a study can be repeated, in other words if a measure
is consistent. In relation to quantitative analysis, reliability is especially at stake.
Replication addresses if a study can be replicated, i.e., if another researcher can replicate
a study

. In order for a study to be replicable, the researcher needs to explain the

research process extensively. Validity concentrates on the integrity of the findings taken
from a study. (Bryman & Bell 2011)
Furthermore, Bryman & Bell (2011) differentiate between a few different kinds of
validity. The first is measurement validity, which focuses on if a measure truly represents
the concept it stands for and it generally concerns quantitative research. Whether a
conclusion incorporating a causal connection between at least two variables are coherent,
is the focus of internal validity or causality.

generalizable

outside the particular research context is the focus of external validity. If a social science
i.e. extended outside the explicit research context, is the focus of ecological validity.
(Bryman & Bell 2011)
There have been some discussions regarding the quality of mixed methods research,
regarding if mixed method research should have its own tailored quality standards or if
the quality should be assessed separately for the quantitative and qualitative research
frameworks for mixed method research exist, but a few frameworks have been created
(Ivankova 2014; Doyle et al. 2019).
For the thesis, the numbers in the quantitative analysis have been checked multiple times
and the different functions and diagrams in Microsoft Excel have been tested to see that
they are accurate. With regard to the numbers from Euromonitor being accurate, the author
has trusted the accuracy of the data, since Company X has compared different companies
and their data before making the data purchase from Euromonitor. During the research

42

were identified, but the differences were believed to be based on variances in the sources
and forecast methods. When looking for a new, suitable market, only some specific topics
were analyzed by the project group for Company X. If the focus would be changed (e.g.
s other product group), the outcome and interesting markets could
differ. Regarding replication, the author has tried to present the research process, the
research topics and data sources as clearly as possible, so that the study could be replicated
by som
and relevant theory, but since only one market potential assessment has been done by one
company, the findings are more directional, and the subject could still be studied further.

4.7 Research ethics and confidentiality
Regarding ethics in business studies, four common concerns can be identified: harm to
participants, insufficient consent, privacy invasion, and deception and these are connected
(Diener & Crandall 1978; Bryman & Bell 2011). Regarding participant harm, the AoM
Code of Ethical Conduct presents that confidentiality and anonymity are issues that need
findings. It can be difficult to anonymize companies in some cases, even if the name is not
mentioned, since the company might still be identifiable (e.g. based on the industry or
numbers). In order for participants to be able to give sufficient consent, researchers should
give them all necessary information about the study, so they can make an informed
decision on their participation. Regarding invasion of privacy, it is important that
participants are well informed about what is studied and to let them withdraw their
consent, in case they feel like the topic is too sensitive for them. Deception happens when
a study is not presented honestly, i.e. the researcher is trying to hide what is actually
studied from the participants. (Bryman & Bell 2011) Furthermore, Bryman & Bell (2011)
emphasize that it is important to have an open communication about the research between
all concerned parties.
The case company wanted to stay anonymous in the thesis, due to confidentiality reasons.
It has been very important for the author to respect this wish by Company X and therefore

43

Manager, who has been helping the author during the project and writing, has also read
the thesis a couple of times, in order to ensure the anonymity of the case company. The
author has tried to present the research questions and data collection methods of the thesis
clearly to Company X, in order to have sufficient consent on what can be presented.
However, the case company and their reactions have not affected the results of the thesis,
only in terms of reactions being part of the observations. The author has also presented the
thesis and received comments from the case company.

4.8 Summary of methodology
In this chapter of the thesis, the chosen research method was presented. Mixed method is
a research method, where quantitative and qualitative data are both used and there are
many different options for how to combine these two datasets and their analysis methods.
In this thesis, quantitative data are analyzed quantitatively, and this is done first, while
qualitative data are analyzed qualitatively later in the research process. In this thesis, the
quantitative data are mainly analyzed and used in the first step of research, while the
qualitative data, observations, have been collected during the whole research process.
Mixed method research has some strengths, since using two different methods might be
researched. It is still very important to figure out and present why mixed method research

5 Analysis
In this chapter of the thesis, the quantitative data will be analyzed, the observations of how
market research was conducted by Company X will be compared with the theoretical
framework.

5.1 Quantitative market data
For the quantitative analysis of the thesis two major themes can be identified: one theme
is market size and market growth, while the other theme is trade barriers. The analysis was
conducted in these two steps as well; first the market size and predicted growth in the
coming five years of 13 European countries in C
Second, the market size and predicted fivecategories were analyzed. Later, these two factors were combined in order to rank the
countries and discover which countries seemed most promising and should be further
analyzed. After the ranking, the top 10 countries were investigated with regard to four
trade barriers: CPI (Corruption Perceptions Index), Atradius Country risk, EPI
(Environmental Performance Index) and EU membership. The different steps of the
quantitative analysis will be presented next.

industry. Two countries are also showing significant growth in the coming 5 years,
specifically Country 5 and Country 10; Country 5 seems to increase their sales with around
25%, while Country 10 seems to almost double their sales in a short time.
Multiple of the market potential assessment frameworks and models include market size
in their analysis (cf. Johansson 2000, Czinkota et al. 2011, Cavusgil 2004, Sheng & Mullen
2011) indicating that this is a relevant factor to analyze when doing preliminary foreign

47

market research. A few authors have also mentioned market growth as a relevant indicator
for market potential (cf. Arefjevs et al. 2013, McDonald & Dunbar 1995; Simkin & Dibb
1998, Cavusgil et al. 2004, Johansson 2000, Czinkota et al. 2011), indicating that market
growth can be seen as a relevant factor when examining market potential.

markets have an increased demand for their products, while demand is declining in

mentioned by some authors as a relevant market research topic (cf. Cavusgil 1985, Cooper

Thereafter the markets gained points based on their ranking, where the country with the
biggest market size was given 13 points and the smallest market 1 point, both for the
industry and product market size, as can be seen in the graph above. There were some
discussions within the project group about which factors to include in the ranking of the
markets, but the Project Manager decided that the forecasted market sizes were most
relevant for the project. The main goal with the ranking was to achieve a top 10 of
countries, to analyze further with regard to trade barriers and risk. Cavusgil et al. (2004)
use ranking as a method in their market assessment model and also mention that it is a
commonly used practice in International Business research.
As can be seen in the table, Country 11, Country 12 and Country 13 fell out of the top 10,
since they were small markets both in term of the industry and the product group. As a
side note, none of them showed strong growth in neither the industry nor for Company
sizes.

Figure 6 Country risk scorecard for top 10 markets

When the list of 13 countries had been narrowed down to 10, a Country risk scorecard was
created. In this part of the research, the Atradius Country Risk Map, the Corruption
Perceptions Index (CPI), the Environmental Performance Index and EU membership were
considered. For the score card all four trade barriers were transformed into an index of 0100, where 100 is the maximum score. The EPI and CPI were already based on this type
of index, but regarding EU membership member countries were given 100 points, while
non-EU members were given 50 points.
Atradius gives countries a rank of 1-10 and the Atradius Risk Map does not explicitly
present the specific rank of the countries, it only presents whether a country is classified
as a low risk, moderate-low risk, moderate risk, moderate-high risk, high risk or very highrisk country. In order to transform the Atradius Country Risk into the score card, the
maximum of points was divided by 6, where countries classified as low risk obtained 100
points, moderate-low risk countries 83,3 points, moderate risk countries 66,6 points,
moderate-high risk countries 50 points, high risk countries 33,3 points and very high-risk
countries 16,7 points. Based on this index-point scorecard, it was calculated how many %
out of the maximum points (400) the different countries obtained. This percentage was
turned into a 5-star system, by first converting the percentage into a 0-10 scale, by dividing
the percentage with 10, and then dividing the 0-10 scale by two and ending up with a 1-5

51

star system. In the figure above, the result of the country risk score card with 1-5 stars is
presented, but calculating how many points of the maximum 400 a country received or
how many % of the maximum points the different countries achieved, is already a simple
indicator of which countries are showing high potential with regard to market sizes and
growth, combined with the amount of risk.
As can be seen from the scorecard, nine countries obtained more than three stars and could
therefore be seen as fairly low risk countries, while Country 5 obtained only 2,7 stars,
which indicates that this country is riskier than the others. Due to the high risk of Country
5, it was no longer perceived as an attractive market for the case company.
Country 1, Country 7 and Country 8 scored the highest points, but these are also markets
that Company X is already active in. These three countries were only explored in this
quantitative analysis, in order to compare these markets and their numbers with new,
potential markets Company X could enter. This means that there are six markets left that
could be interesting: Country 2, Country 3, Country 4, Country 6, Country 9 and Country
10. When investigating foreign markets to enter, different kinds of trade barriers and risks
need to be investigated, but most of the factors examined here with relation to risk were
mentioned in multiple sources. Investigating market risk is mentioned (Hollensen 2007,
Kotler et al. 2009, Cavusgil et al. 2004), studying the political climate too (Hollensen
2007, Johansson 2000, Cavusgil et al. 2004, Cavusgil 1997; Ozturk et al. 2015, Cavusgil
1985), as well as examining the economic situation (Kotler et al. 2009, Johansson 2000,
Cavusgil 1985, Cavusgil 1997; Ozturk et al. 2015). This indicates that these types of risks
are relevant to include in foreign market assessment.
Cavusgil et al. (2004) present country clustering as an option for evaluating foreign
be clustered based on geographical closeness, in order to identify a cluster of markets that
could be interesting for Company X. If an interesting cluster exists, Company X could
start by entering one market and from there easily enter other high-potential markets close
as the other European markets still potentially interesting, so it was left out of the
clustering and ruled out as an interesting market. The countries still potentially interesting
for Company X were grouped into two clusters; Country 3, Country 4, Country 6 and
52

country 9 were grouped into one cluster, and the other cluster consisted of Country 3,
Country 9 and Country 10. What the market research process in whole has looked like and
how the research continued will be presented in the next part of the thesis.

5.2 Observations
In this chapter of the thesis the observations made by the author regarding the process of

explained, and observations made during the quantitative analysis are included.

5.2.1 Observations from project start
When the thesis worker first joined the project group, the process began with familiarizing
with the project and its planned steps of the market potential research, as well as the
Passport-tool by Euromonitor. After familiarizing with the project and data, the focus was
put on Euromonitor and what could be learned from the data available. When the project
work regarding market potential started more seriously, some separate factors were
investigated, including market sizes of the foreign markets in special retail, market sizes
where Company X is not offering products. The main goal of the first step of the project
work was to gain an overview of what the situation looks like in different markets and
investigate connections to see if any numbers stand out. In this preliminary step of
familiarizing and understanding the data, customer segments in special retail were also
investigated. In this case, customer segments the refer to distribution channels, i.e. where
customers purchase their special retail products.
Furthermore, trends in the different markets on a basic level were considered, in case some
interesting trends for Company X are growing in the markets, or the opposite; if it seems
During the familiarization phase
with the data, it was noticed that a great amount of data was available through
Euromonitor, and some datasets included extensive information, which will take a long
time to go through. Due to time limitations, some of the factors that were originally
planned to be included in the first stage of market research, were moved to the next stage,
53

to have a smaller dataset to work with. Company shares were available in many different
forms: with regard to only the main company or to the brand names in the different foreign
markets, for the whole special retail industry of Company X or for specific product
categories. Depending on how fragmented a market was, there could be only a few
competing brands on the market or there could be a long list of competitors in the market.
After considering the market sizes and trying to find some interesting trends and
noteworthy numbers, the next step was the analysis of the quantitative data. The process
began with an attempt at creating a score card, in order to rank the 13 markets that were
being investigated. When working on the score card, the market size and predicted growth

categories. All these elements were added as separate factors into the score card, meaning
that the score card included six different factors in the beginning. After choosing the
elements to be included on the score card, different weighing factors for the different
elements, based on importance for Company X were worked on. It was challenging for
the project group to figure out how to divide the weighing factors to the different elements.
The author and the Category Manager har multiple meetings where they worked together
on the data, both in order to understand it, as well as work on the quantitative analysis of
the data to be able to create the score card. They tried to figure out which factors on the
score card were the most important for the case company and some decisions were clear:
one of the product groups was identified as more important than the other, but how to
divide the weight coefficients between the whole industry and the secondary product
group was a bit more difficult. Furthermore, deciding how much influence should be given
to market growth, compared to market size was also difficult.
The original plan was also to include trade barriers in the score card, but deciding which
trade barriers were more important than others was also difficult since all are about risks
Company X might face when entering a foreign market. Therefore, the idea of a score card
was omitted during the project and the data to be compared and analyzed was further
narrowed down for the quantitative analysis. How the work continued after the scorecard
was already presented in the quantitative analysis part of the thesis (industry and product
specific market size and risks) and will not be discussed here further. Instead, the next

54

phase of the market research after the quantitative analysis of the foreign markets will be
presented next.
Once the topics for the quantitative analysis had been chosen and the analysis conducted,
the results of the first phase of the market potential research was presented to the Business
Director of the case company, in order to hear their feedback on the research that had been
conducted until this point. Moreover, the project group was eager to hear what they felt
about the planned next steps of the research and which countries they thought should be
were mainly positive and they were also eager to hear more about what the members of
the project group thought of the process. The Business Director had a few questions
regarding some of the decisions and some of the topics included in the research and they
also had a few of the notions if culture or languages would be a part of the market potential
research. The Business Director felt that the countries presented by the project group as
the ones with highest potential seemed interesting and that these could be further
investigated in the next step.

5.2.2 Observations from deep dive
In the next step of the research, the deep dive into interesting countries, a set of interesting
countries was chosen. However, even though a set of countries was chosen, a decision was
made by the Project Manager to start by focusing on only one specific market from the
cluster that seemed especially interesting and had shown high potential, Country 10. In
order to analyze this country more in depth and investigate whether it actually is a suitable
country for Company X to enter, a list of investigation topics was made and later turned
into a schedule. Some of the factors included on the list were competitors, channel
distribution, products; regarding raw materials, product size and current products on the
market, consumer attitudes, production locations and more in-depth trade or market-entry
barriers; with regard to legislation, costs for market entry and culture. In order to learn
more about the market, more data available through Euromonitor International was
examined, some research in the form of internet searches were made and the author
contacted some chambers of commerce. The project group also created a questionnaire to
send out to the major specialist retailer chains in the market, in order to learn more about
the chosen market and the consumers in the market. The questionnaire was not sent out
55

during the thesis process, but Company X might use it later when they want to learn more
about it.
The distribution channels of the chosen market were available through Euromonitor

to discover through only internet search, partly due to problems with the language. Instead
of trying to find the information online, the project group had a meeting with a contact
person in the particular country being investigated. During the meeting both findings made
by the project group were verified by the interview person, but the project group also asked
some questions to fill in the gaps in their market research on the foreign market being
investigated.
With the intention to
interesting markets, the author had a discussion with the Project Manager of the market
research project. During
regarding internationalization and assessing interesting markets were discussed, the
56

reasons for choosing certain European countries to be investigated further, the reasoning
for choosing certain topics to be explored and the process of market research was
discussed.
The project group also conducted three interviews with businesspeople with knowledge
and/or connections to Country 10, to learn more about the market. During the interviews
the group presented some of the findings from their market research, to verify and learn
more about Country 10. Furthermore, some questions had been planned regarding some
specific topics the project group wanted to know more about or had not been able to find
information about. The interviews were rewarding, and both verified some findings, but
also gave new, valuable insights the project group were unaware of.
One of the last discussions amidst the project group was what had been investigated during
the deep dive of Country 10 and which topics and information was still missing and needed
to be learned about the market. During the conversation, the Project Manager quite quickly
pointed out that they believe the desk research has gotten the project group to a certain
point and that more relevant information could not be found through Euromonitor, internet
searches or connections at this point and that the next step should be visiting the market
and learning more about it through primary research. Some of the members of the project
group have continued to research Country 10, but the author was only part of the
preliminary screening and deep dive of the markets, meaning that the author does not know
whether Company X decides to enter Country 10 or not, nor which market entry mode
would be chosen in that case.

5.2.3 Market size and growth
During the project, one of the first things that was considered from Euromonitor was the
categories; both for categories where Company X offers products and for categories where
company X is not offering products. Market size was in Company X original plan for the
market research, while market growth was added later as part of the research since
forecasts were available from Euromonitor. As mentioned in the previous chapter of the
thesis, both market size and market growth are identified by some authors as important
indicators of market potential. According to a study by Ojala and TyrvÃ¤inen (2008; Mullen
57

-making regarding foreign market

market was considered the best solitary indicator when businesses are making entry
decisions. This indicates that investigating the market size of

, but in the
end market growth also had an important role, since the chosen market for the deep dive
was not currently that large in size but was forecasted to grow greatly in the coming years.
During the market research process there have been several discussions about what
different numbers mean or what information certain numbers give for the research,
including what does it mean that the market is growing in a certain country. Does it mean
that lasting changes are happening in consumer purchasing behavior, are consumers more

On one hand, the market potential frameworks presented in the theoretical part of the
thesis, most of them include market size and market growth in their analysis, which is
eworks
(cf Johansson 2000, Sheng & Mullen 2011) see market size as GDP per capita or amount
of inhabitants, while the case company directly focused on their industry specific numbers,
while most frameworks included these numbers later in their research.

5.2.4 Risk factors
Something that was considered as a relevant factor when comparing markets and their
potential, both by the case company, as well as in literature are risk factors. During
olitical risk, EU
membership, sustainability, raw materials, consumer attitudes, legislation, requirements,
and costs for entering the market. Economic climate is mentioned in multiple articles
(Sheng & Mullen 2011, Cavusgil 1985, Cavusgil et al. 2004), differences in language or
culture is also included (Sheng & Mullen 2011, Cavusgil 1985), political climate, market
58

structure or trade agreements are stated too (Sheng & Mullen 2011, Cavusgil 1985,
Cavusgil et al. 2004) indicating that these are risk factors that should be addressed. The
country risk, sustainability, EU membership and political risk have already been explained
and analyzed with regard to the quantitative analysis and will not be thoroughly explained
again. Raw materials and consumer attitudes will be discussed under Industry specific
factors since they can be seen as a risk factor in connection with the industry. Legislation
and requirements and costs for entering the market will be shorty discussed in this chapter.
Earlier in the research process, with the purpose to eliminate non-suitable markets for
Company X, the economic risk and political risk were already examined, but factors
relating to legislation were not considered yet, since finding information regarding
an be a bit difficult to find and challenging to compare for a large
set of markets. When examining Country 10, the author contacted a few chambers of
commerce in order to learn a bit more about the market and perhaps discover directly if
there are some specific laws impacting foreign companies or that are industry specific.
None of the chambers of commerce had anything specific to tell about the legislation and
the author could not find anything special related to this.

5.2.5 Psychic distance
During Comp
the preliminary screenings of market potential; neither when ranking interesting markets,
nor when risk factors were considered. When the project group had the first presentation
for the Business Manager, the Business Manager mentioned culture and language and
whether these factors will be analyzed in further steps of the research. Due to this notion
by the Business Manager, the author included culture in the deep dive of the analysis. The
culture was investigated based on Hofstede Insights (2021), where the culture of the two
main markets of Company X were compared with the culture in Country 10. There were
some differences in the cultures of these three countries, so the main differences were
discussed in some of the interviews conducted by the project group. During the interviews,
the interviewees agreed to some of the cultural differences identified, but also mentioned
that Country 10 is going through many changes and the culture is shifting.

59

Other factors regarding psychic distance were included in the research process; economic
situation (Atradius) and political climate (Transparency International) were included in
the framework, in order to learn more about the countries. The au
the reasoning for researching these elements, were not to find similarities or differences
inSeveral of the market research frameworks include psychic distance in their research
elements (Sheng & Mullen 2011, Cavusgil 1985) highlighting the importance of
researching similarities and differences in culture, language, political climate or economic
situation. In the Uppsala model (Johanson & Vahlne 1977) extensive focus is put on
psychic distance as well, arguing that companies usually enter countries that are similar to
the home market, which is not done based on conscious decisions to enter similar markets,
but simply happens since these countries seem less risky, than countries which are
perceived to be distant.

5.2.6 Geographical distance

country clustering. The possibility of finding some interesting clusters of markets with
high market potential was investigated. Would it be a possibility to start by entering one
country in an interesting cluster and later enter the other interesting markets? During the
quantitative analysis, two potential clusters were found; the first cluster consisted of
Country 3, Country 4, Country 6, and Country 9, while the other cluster consisted of
Country 3, Country 9, and Country 10. The Project Manager made the decision that focus
should be put on cluster 2. Cluster 1 was forgotten, because Country 3 was not seen as
interesting to them, because of their national protective measures, Country 9 was not
showing growth and was included in the cluster mostly because of geographical closeness
and Country 4 and Country 6 were no longer seen as interesting, since they are
expensive, or then Company X would need to establish production sites in these countries,
which also is expensive. In cluster 2 there were two of the same countries as in cluster 1,
Country 3 and Country 9, which were not seen as interesting by the Project Manager, but
Country 10 was seen as interesting both due to the strong growth it was showing, as well
as due to it being situated geograph
60

theoretic framework of the thesis geographical distance or distribution is mentioned as a
market potential indicator (Sheng & Mullen 2011, Cavusgil 1985).

5.2.7 Industry specific factors
Several differe
differences exist between them and certain factors which are extremely relevant in one
industry, might be irrelevant in another. In the B2C packaged special retail industry, the
case company had identified a few relevant industry specific factors, which they included
in their research. One is the division between brands and private labels in a market. In the
ting
whether consumers in a market are more loyal to brands, or if they prefer to purchase the
often cheaper private labels is important. This needed to be researched, so that Company
X can decide whether to enter the market with their own label or if they should produce
the product and sell it under a private label. According to Quelch & Harding (1996)
producing private label products is an alternative for brands to compete with them, and
consumer goods companies tend to produce both brand & private label goods.
When Company X was researching the one specific market they were most interested in,
Euromonitor International did not present any private labels having a market share in their
product category. Euromonitor International presents market shares for all relevant players
information can also be missing if Euromonitor is unable to find reliable data and
information for specific brands, and in this case these brands are cla
well. The chosen market for in-depth research is showing strong growth, both in terms of
usually more popular when the economy is down (Quelch & Harding 1996), which might
explain why none appear in the dataset. In markets where private labels play a greater role,
companies need to keep innovating in order to stay competitive and have a competitive
edge (Martos-Partal 2012).
Another industry specific factor in the packaged consumer special retail industry, is the
competition. The specific market being analyzed on a deeper level, seemed fragmented
with regard to competition; the top three competitors in the product group had only around
61

a 35% market share combined, while undefined brands by Euromonitor stood for almost
60% of the market share. As mentioned, none of the identified brands were private labels.
This could indicate that there are many small brands and/or fragmented private labels in
the
to brands and private labels, than with regard to market concentration.
Another factor that was considered was raw materials, both with regard to legislation, as
well as consumer attitudes towards the use of certain raw materials. No information could
be found regarding consumer attitudes towards the specific raw materials that Company
X uses. However, the consumers in this country are interested in organic products and they
values. In some other European countries consumer attitudes towards a component in
could not be seen in Country 10.

5.2.8 Incremental market potential assessment
spectrum phase, deep dive phase and lastly a market case. The Project Manager had made
a structured plan of what they wanted to research during the project and when the different
factors would be analyzed. This plan was made before the secondary data was purchased,
which meant that some of the elements could be investigated, while others had to be
omitted, since the data was not available through Euromonitor and could not be found
through internet searches.
The order of the research elements changed during the project, due to time limitations,
both regarding the project itself and its schedule, as well as the project members limited
time to work on the project. Furthermore, the extensive amount of data available through
Euromonitor also affected what was researched during the first step of market potential
assessment. Since much data was available, it could be difficult to analyze all information
efficiently and in the decided time window.
Some of the literature presents how investigating foreign markets is usually done in
incremental steps (e.g. Johansson 2000, Czinkota et al. 2011, Cavusgil 1985), while others
62

present it as one process, where all variables are researched at the same time (Ozturk et al.
2015, Sheng & Mullen 2011). This indicates that both methods have been used for foreign
market research. The different frameworks present different factors to investigate and in
the models that use incremental steps there are some differences regarding which factors
should be included in which step. Cavusgil (1985) also pointed out that there is a lot of
useable secondary data, so you need to focus on data relevant for you and your company,
similarly as Company X needed to do with their purchased data.

5.2.9 Secondary data versus primary data

a specific
country, and the Insights Manager felt the same way about another country that was being
researched. The differences were found to be based on the data collection method and
sources used by Euromonitor. The data was decided to be reviewed as relevant and reliable
in this research, but later in a research process or in some other cases data from other
sources could be needed.
During the project, there were also discussion about where to find missing data or how to
learn more in-depth information of certain markets. Some of the data that was seen as
important by the Project Manager, (e.g. volume in terms of amount of sold products), was
not available through Euromonitor, nor by another market research company. Could this
data be found elsewhere or maybe calculated by the project group was considered. This
particular topic, volume, could not be found directly through internet searches, contacts or
market research companies and it could not be calculated either, due to the numbers and
information available, so the investigation of this topic was moved to the last step of the
research process.
When learning more about the most interesting market, through desk research, the author
contacted two chambers of commerce to see if they could help with finding more
information about Country 10. Both organizations were very helpful, offering relevant
websites, articles, links and PowerPoint-presentations. Furthermore, some relevant
magazines, ministries and trade organizations also offered relevant, easily accessible
63

also helpful, presenting upcoming trends in the market. Lots can be learned through
secondary data and desk research, you might find relevant material, but on the other hand
it can be time-consuming to find the data online, instead of purchasing it directly (e.g.
from a consultant). During desk research, the project group also could see that they had
reached the point where they could not find out more about the market, without either
buying more data or services from others or by collecting primary data on their own, by
visiting Country 10. As mentioned in Bryman & Bell (2011) using secondary data is cost
and time effective, but as Cavusgil (1985) presented, primary data is needed in the final

5.3 Summary of the analysis chapter
In this chapter, both the quantitative market data and the assessment of 13 different
countries market potential have been analyzed, as well as the observations made by the
industry and product, as well as risk factors were considered. Many themes were identified
for the analysis of the observations, including market size and growth, risks, psychic and
geographical distance, industry-specific factors, incremental assessment of market
potential and the use of secondary data.
The actual research process for the thesis also begun with the quantitative analysis of
market data and identified risks, whereafter the deep dive into Country 10 continued. The
author has made observations since the start of the project, so observations made during
the quantitative analysis were also analyzed. The analysis of the observations started with
some relevant subjects and discussions amid the project group.

64

6 Discussion & conclusions
In this chapter of the thesis, the findings will be discussed, conclusions presented, and the
theoretical and practical implications of the thesis are examined. Furthermore, the created
market potential framework will be presented and as well as limitations and suggestions
for future research.

6.1 Discussion
A topic that was discussed a few times during the project, was the different countries and
whether they should be included in the first, broad spectrum phase at all. The Insights
Manager was a bit skeptical towards Country 5, since they have earlier tried to enter this
market this market earlier with poor success and Country 13, since the country has had
some issues with human rights. The Category Manager was again doubting towards
Country 3, since they know that this country has some national protective measures, (e.g.
a foreign company must have offices in the country, as well as some native employees).
Lastly, the author was uncertain of Country 2, since they are not a part of the EU, which
could indicate that trading could be more difficult. The Project Manager still chose to
include all these four countries in the primary step of the analysis, to make sure that any
country was ignored due to personal or previous experiences and that the research process
would be as objective as possible. After investigating which markets were showing high
market potential, Country 13 was a small market and was not forecasted to grow much.
While considering risk factors, Country 5 showed high risk and was therefore not
interesting for Company X. Country 3 did score quite well both with regard to market
potential and risks, but was later on omitted due to the reasons mentioned by the Category
Manager. When the different countries were clustered, Country 2 was skipped, since it
was not geographically close to any of the other markets, indicating that market entry
could be costly. In other words, all countries that the project group was skeptical of in the
first step of the market research fell out during some point of the process, some more due
to information the project group had of the countries and others due to the country not
showing high potential or proving to be risky.

65

These conversations regarding omitting countries before giving them a chance and
analyzing them in-depth, but still deciding to investigate them and compare them with the
other potential markets, shows that Company X aimed to conduct an objective comparison
of the countries and internationalize to a country which is showing true potential. The
experiential knowledge of the project group members turned out to be correct in most
cases, and their experiences will clearly help Company X in the next steps of their market
potential assessment and possible market entry, as Johanson & Vahlne (1977) also have
pointed out.
There were some differences in what elements were integrated into market potential
could be that market potential frameworks focus on the whole world, i.e. for companies
looking to globalize, while in this case Company X was focusing on internationalization
and countries that are already somewhat familiar for the case company and its project
group members, since these markets are in Europe. When thinking of trade barriers, these
look different when investigating EU-countries conducting business with other EUcountries, compared to countries from Asia or the United States conducting business with
EU-countries. Therefore, when analyzing markets where there are already clear trade
agreements and the countries are already familiar to some extent, the market research
process and elements might look different.
Another topic that was discussed during the project, was the importance of including
culture in the preliminary steps of market potential assessment. Most of the frameworks
research plan the topic was not included. Culture was mentioned in a few of the project
felt that the topic should be investigated later
in the process. When the first step of the market potential assessment was presented to the
Business Manager, they asked if culture and language would be included in later steps of
the research, since Company X is a multinational company, and their current employees
and contacts could maybe be helpful during the internationalization process to some
markets. Culture was therefore included in the deep dive of Country 10. During a private
meeting between the Project Manager and the author, the topic of culture was discussed.
markets, but more of a factor to be aware of. The market potential assessment process at
66

Company X suggests that culture and language differences can be perceived in another
way than presented in literature. Culture and language knowledge can be perceived more
in the sense of strengths and topics to consider, rather than risks. Furthermore, another
factor that could explain why culture is highlighted in previous market potential
frameworks, might be because they are focused on globalization (where culture might shift
significantly between countries), while Company X is interested in internationalizing in
Europe, where they are already active in multiple markets and where cultural and language
differences might be smaller, compared to differences between countries such as the
United States and Turkey.
A factor that the author found out quite late in the research process was that Company X
did not decide which European countries they wanted to investigate, they purchased the
relevant data from Euromonitor and investigated the markets that were available through
their dataset. This could indicate that companies do
that are interesting for them to investigate, instead they might investigate markets that with
easily accessible information. Furthermore, Company X purchasing data before
comparing and investigating new markets, could also explain some of the differences
between earlier market potential frameworks and this case study. If you already have
relevant, industry data and information about sales in your specific product categories, you
can start investigating which markets could be profitable for your business directly and
learning more about the markets regarding culture, legislation, and political climate later.
If you start by researching which countries could be suitable for your company to enter
and purchasing data afterwards, researching general numbers and indicators for the

Cavusgil (1985) discusses how much you can learn from desk research about countries
and their market potential, and the same thing was noted during the case co
project. There was much data available through Euromonitor and the project group learned
more about the market through desk research (e.g. internet searches and information from
Chambers of Commerce), but some topics that were identified to be important for
Company X (e.g. regarding product specifications and retailers) could not be found
through secondary data and the Project Manager therefore decided to enter the next phase
of the project with collection of primary data. This indicates the same as
findings, you can only reach a certain point through desk research; then you need to decide
67

whether to buy consulting services or visit the country yourself to learn more about the
interesting market, or maybe even both.
What about the internationalization process of a company in the specialist retail industry;
does it happen like in the market potential assessment frameworks, where market potential
is investigated and a high-potential country or high-potential countries are entered, or does
the internationalization happen more as presented in the Uppsala model (Johanson &
Vahlne 1977), where one county is entered first, which is close in psychic distance? On
one hand, Company X conducted market potential assessment objectively, where all
markets were given a chance and investigated based on their market potential. On the other
hand, when Company X was choosing one specific market to analyze on a deeper level,
the country Company X had been most interested in was the market that was chosen.
Country 10 showed strong growth and fairly low risk, showing high market potential, but
so were other markets. The decision seems to have been made both due to the high market
actories,
compared to the other markets showing high potential, indicating that Country 10 is close
in internationalizing incrementally, as presented in the Uppsala model. Therefore, the
market potential assessment process and possible internationalization of Company X
seems to be a combination of both objective market research, as well as the Uppsala model.
Company X had first made a clear plan of how to conduct their market research and which
topics they wanted to include. During the project the plan was changed a few times, both
due to the data available through Euromonitor and due to the amount of data available.
Some of the factors included in the preliminary plan were not available through the
Passport tool, while some of the components included so much data that it was too
complicated to investigate and compare the data of 13 countries at the same time.
Therefore, the plan and the topics included in the market potential assessment process
needed to be reviewed a couple of times. The author was part of the project group until
the beginning of the market case and thus the topics investigated during this phase by
Company X may differ from what is presented here. Furthermore, the outcome of the
market research is unknown for the author and is not presented in this thesis. Below is a
demonstrate how a clear plan is needed, but changes also need to be made.

Figure 7 Comparison of Company X's plan and project

When companies are conducting foreign market research, there might be a clear plan for
how the research will be conducted, but as seen in the
might change, based on new ideas and based on what the managers learn early in the
process. The aspirations might change as well, first companies might be interested in
entering only one market but finds an interesting cluster of markets they want to enter
instead, or the other way around; companies might be interested in finding a suitable
cluster to enter, but instead only find one market that they want to focus on.

ing the period where they have
been able to help out the market research, i.e. during the secondary data analysis and when
the case company was learning more about the markets. This means that the author has
not been part of the last steps of the project, including the collection of primary data, the
final decision of whether to enter the market or not, the choosing of a suitable market entry
producer of a private label. This means that the author has only been able to study how a
company conducts market potential assessment and learn about this particular process, but
not what happens afterwards or what happens if a country with high potential, which has
been investigated is ruled as unfitting for the company.

6.2 Conclusions
In this chapter of the thesis the conclusions are presented, including a new market potential
framework based on both theory and practice. Furthermore, the author tries to answer the
research questions presented in the introduction of the thesis. Practical and theoretical
implications as well as suggestions for future research are also presented.
Theoretical question:
What conceptual approaches to the assessment of market potential exist in previous
research?
There are numerous different approaches presented in literature for finding interesting
markets with high potential. Some of them are incremental models, where companies start
with a large set of markets, that they narrow down to a smaller number, lastly ending up
with one or a few interesting markets. Other models are based on only one step, and this
might be a more suitable option when companies already have a smaller number of
markets, they are interested in. The approaches in literature include some similar factors,
for instance most of the models include market size or market growth as a factor, cultural
differences are often investigated, risks in the markets are often considered and some
include market concentration or the competitive climate in their models. Many articles
point out that most models do not take industry specific factors into consideration, so it is
vital for companies to figure out some factors that are relevant specifically in their
in
70

there
are multiple different models presented in literature.
Empirical questions:
In B2C businesses focusing on packaged, physical goods in specialist retail, (a) How is
the evaluation of market potential executed? (b): Which other factors are relevant to
market selection besides market potential?
In this thesis, the case company investigated countries and their market potential with a
small project group, where all group members had different backgrounds, strengths and
roles within the company. For the market research, the case company purchased industry
specific data in order to investigate the countries, indicating that collecting primary data
for multiple countries is too time consuming for companies, while relevant secondary data
is easier and cheaper to use. When starting market research, you can either investigate
general economic indicators and information about countries, as theory suggests, or
purchase relevant secondary data about interesting markets directly, as the case company
s project indicates that companies might start by investigating relevant
secondary data directly.
The results of the thesis indicate that companies conduct market research in incremental
steps, where you begin with a large set of markets, investigate a few interesting ones more
great focus was put on industry and company specific factors, in order for them to find a
market that is suitable for them. This indicates that industry and product specific factors
might have an even bigger role than presented in earlier market potential assessment
models.

factors indicating that a country is attractive, while there are several risk factors that might
negatively impact an interesting country. Furthermore, something that might not be
considered first as a factor impact market potential, might arise as a factor later. First
companies might be interested in entering any country, despite of geographical distance,
but later when you have a small set of interesting markets and one of them is close to your
71

current markets, you might become interested in this market, even though another country
is showing higher potential. Entering a neighboring country might be appealing, since it
is closer and market entry might be cheaper, you might not need to establish manufacturing
facilities, you might be able to use your current distributors and sell your products at the

Normative question:
What should managers, in B2C businesses focusing on physical goods, do to conduct
successful market evaluation processes?
The results of this thesis indicates that having a clear plan for the market research is
important, where you know what you want to learn and what is important for you and your
company, but you should still be prepared to change your plan. It might change due to the
data available, findings you make early in the process, your own goals and strategies might
change and so forth. Conducting the evaluation of market potential thoroughly is also
important, so that you can make informed decisions and make them based on facts. Market
research is also a long process that consumes a vast amount of time, so managers should
be prepared to put down both time and effort when researching interesting markets. If
managers are working with secondary data, it is also very important to understand the data
and what the numbers are based on or including. You might think that you know what the
data is based on, but later find out that you have missed something, i.e., it is important to
take time and familiarize with the data.
Managers might have a clear vision of which country they are most interested in, or they
might have a clear picture of which countries are not suitable for their business, conducting
research as objectively as possible and give all countries a chance is significant. It might
be, that the preconceptions turn out to be true, but it might also happen that the country a
company is interested has some factors that negatively affect the market potential or that
last 10 years.
Companies also need to make a budget before beginning a market potential assessment
process. It is important that companies have enough funds both to purchase relevant
72

secondary data, but funds are also needed later in the process, when you have come as far
as you can with the secondary data. More funds are often needed so that the company can
either purchase more relevant information about a specific market or markets (e.g. from
consultants) or when the company decides to visit the country to learn more about it. Apart
from budgeting funds, it is also important to budget the human resources for the project.
How many employees are needed for the project and how much of their working hours
should be focused on the market potential assessment process, instead of or on top of their
current job responsibilities are for instance factors that need to be considered, so that the

Created market potential framework
Figure 8 presents the created market potential assessment framework for the thesis, which
is based on the theoretical frameworks and earlier models presented earlier in the thesis,
major steps and a preliminary step that can be included, if necessary. The market potential
factors can be moved to different steps if needed as well, or switched to another industry
company.
In the preliminary step general, free and easily accessible secondary data can be used, in
order to scale down the number of countries to investigate later on. In this step, general
market information including economic climate, culture and demographics are included.
Furthermore, an industry or company relevant factors is included, so that companies can
directly eliminate countries which would not suit them before purchasing secondary data
or collecting their own primary data. If no general, preliminary step is needed, the topics
can be moved to another step, for instance the deep dive.
In the first two main steps relevant, purchased secondary data can be used. In the broad
spectrum phase, market size and growth can be investigated, alongside risks that need to
be considered, similarly as in Company
trade agreements, political and economic situation, but also company and industry specific
risks can be taken into consideration. In the deep dive competition, trends, consumer

73

attitudes and all necessary industry and company specific risks and topics can be
investigated further.
In the market case step, primary data can be collected, if suitable, for instance by visiting
the country that has shown the highest market potential. In this step existing and possible
business relations and contacts can be analyzed, prices can be investigated, costs for
entering the market as well as investigating suitable entry modes for the market can be
considered and legislation affecting the industry or company investigated. In this final
step, the company should find out whether they want to enter the market that has shown
high potential and has been analyzed on a deeper level, or if the country is not suitable
after all another country showing high potential could be investigated instead.
The topics presented in the framework are suggestions on factors that might be relevant
for companies in the B2C consumer goods industry and can be moved or omitted, based
on what is relevant for the industry and company. Moreover, necessary subjects should be
added and investigated in a suitable step. Through modifications the framework aims to
suit other businesses and industries, when including industry and company specific topics
important for them.

country ranking and indexing

was used in order to clearly see, based on numbers, which countries showed high potential.
Country clustering was also considered. In the created market potential framework,
ranking and country clustering can both be used in order to find either one or multiple
attractive markets. Country ranking is an easy way to compare a large set of markets.

6.3 Theoretical implications
Currently several different frameworks exist presenting how companies can investigate
foreign markets, in order to find one that suits them. As mentioned in many articles many
market research models are not industry specific (c.f. Ozturk et al. 2015, Sheng & Mullen
2011), indicating that industry specific frameworks could still be investigated further. In
this thesis a real-life example of market research is presented, showing how a company
conducts it and presents examples of what a business executive finds relevant in relation
to industry specific factors within specialist retail. The thesis aims to present a new
perspective on how market research is conducted by companies. Furthermore, many of the
market research frameworks include similar factors, while presenting different issues to
research and in this thesis four different frameworks have been considered in order to
create the market research framework.
Cavusgil (1985) researched what business executives find important when conducting
market research and this thesis is based on similar research, investigating how one
company conducts market research. The findings from the thesis indicate that business
project they concentrated on market specific number directly, instead of examining
general numbers and indicators. The results of the study also indicate culture is not seen
as a trade barrier, but more as a factor to consider when visiting the country and making
business relations.
D
investigation, where all countries were given a fair chance and all countries were
investigated in a similar matter. Still, the country which Company X was originally most
interested in, was the market that was chosen for the deep dive. The country did show
strong growth numbers and seemed to be a genuinely promising country, but it is also
hat
close in psychic distance. This indicates that the Uppsala model for internationalization
(Johanson & Vahlne 1977) is still relevant today and companies tend to choose countries
that feel close to the home market.

76

6.4 Practical implications
The results of the thesis proves that market research should be clearly structured and
planned, with regards to what you want to investigate and where you will learn the needed
information, but you still need to be able to remain flexible and adapt the order based on
information available, skip certain factors and add some factors that seem interesting. In
reflect over the research continuously. Moreover, preparing sufficient resources are
needed when assessing markets.
Companies might have a clear vision of what data they have and what they can discover
through the data, but that might not be the actual case. Furthermore, companies might have
an idea of what they can learn through desk research, but they might not be able to discover
everything due to data available online and from your contacts and language differences
can also make it more challenging to find relevant info and data.
This thesis presents an example for how market research can be conducted, and which
types of topics can be included when researching market potential, but finding important
topics that are relevant for your specific company or specific industry is significant.

6.5 Limitations and future research
The first selection of European markets had already been done by Company X and
quantitative data was available only for these chosen countries, meaning that only this set
of markets could be investigated in this thesis. Company X is also already active in some
European markets, further scaling down the number of interesting markets. Some of the
markets that Company X is already active in were included in the primary step of the
research, in order to compare these markets with markets that Company X is interested in
entering, which means that from the 13 countries investigated, only 10 were actually
countries that Company X could expand to. This implies that observations and
quantitative analysis might have looked a bit different with other European markets or
with a larger set of markets.

77

In this thesis, the internationalization and assessment of market potential has been
investigated by focusing on packaged consumer goods in specialist retail and by observing
one specific case company. As suggestion for future research, similar research conducted
with multiple companies could be interesting (e.g. by organizing interviews to learn how
companies have conducted market research). The developed market potential assessment
model in the thesis tries to be suitable for other industries as well, simply by exchanging
and choosing relevant factors for other industries to research instead. How the created
framework works for other industries could be studied as well. Another option for research
in this field could be through interviews, where important factors for company executives
in market potential assessment could be compared to what has been found noteworthy in
previous literature; are the same factors important according to research and according to
company executives?
Another option to investigate could be to follow up how well the created market potential
framework works for Company X in the future; will they use be using it and how will the
process continue in the case company, with regard to primary data collection and market
entry. Moreover, how well the created framework works according to other companies in
the same industry could be investigated. Another topic that could be studied further, is
how market research and market entry modes are connected, which factors found during
market potential assessment could also be studied further, for instance by analyzing how
other companies prioritize culture during their market research or by interviewing
company executives to learn more about their feelings and ideas of its importance.
Furthermore, future case-study research could be conducted to further establish the
relationship between market potential assessment and the success rate of the company
expansion into new countries.

7 Svensk sammanfattning
Internationalisering och utvÃ¤rdering av marknadspotential i konsumentvarubranschen
Fallstudie: FÃ¶retag inom fÃ¶rpackade konsumentprodukter

7.1 Inledning
I dagens globala vÃ¤rld, Ã¤r mÃ¥nga fÃ¶retag intresserade av internationalisering, m.a.o. att gÃ¥
in pÃ¥ utlÃ¤ndska marknader och erbjuda sina produkter eller tjÃ¤nster (Hollensen 2007). DÃ¥
organisationer bestÃ¤mmer sig fÃ¶r att sÃ¶ka sig utomlands, behÃ¶ver de Ã¤ven bestÃ¤mma vilka
utlÃ¤ndska marknader de vill ge sig in pÃ¥. Hur kan fÃ¶retag jÃ¤mfÃ¶ra marknader fÃ¶r att hitta
de lÃ¤nder som passar specifikt deras organisation? Mycket olika ramverk fÃ¶r jÃ¤mfÃ¶relse
av marknadspotential existerar och de olika ramverken lyfter fram olika faktorer och
teman. Detta innebÃ¤r att det finns Ã¤ven mÃ¥nga beslut en chef behÃ¶ver ta redan dÃ¥ man
undersÃ¶ker marknader, sÃ¥ hur ska chefer hitta teman och faktorer som Ã¤r relevanta fÃ¶r
deras fÃ¶retag?

7.2 Syfte och forskningsfrÃ¥gor
Magisteravhandlingens syfte Ã¤r att skapa ett ramverk fÃ¶r att hitta nya, passande marknader
med hÃ¶g marknadspotential fÃ¶r fÃ¶retag inom fÃ¶rpackade konsumentvaror i
specialvaruhandelsindustrin. Ramverket strÃ¤var till att Ã¤ven fungera fÃ¶r andra industrier,
med smÃ¥ fÃ¶rÃ¤ndringar.
Denna magisteravhandling skrivs fÃ¶r ett fallfÃ¶retag, och skribenten har varit del av en
projektgrupp hos fallfÃ¶retaget som har utrett marknadspotentialen hos ett antal europeiska
marknader. Ramverket bestÃ¥r av fyra steg: ett preliminÃ¤rt steg dÃ¤r generell
marknadsinformation undersÃ¶ks, en allmÃ¤n fas med analys av mÃ¥nga marknader, sedan en
fÃ¶rdjupningsfas, dÃ¤r de intressanta marknaderna frÃ¥n den allmÃ¤nna fasen analyseras
grundligare, samt avslutningsvis en utredning av marknaden som verkar mest lovande, dÃ¥
det slutgiltiga beslutet ifall fÃ¶retaget ska gÃ¥ in pÃ¥ denna marknad fattas.

79

FallfÃ¶retaget erbjuder fÃ¶rpackade varor inom specialvaruhandelsindustrin och Ã¤r aktivt i
mÃ¥nga lÃ¤nder fÃ¶r tillfÃ¤llet, bland annat Finland. FallfÃ¶retaget kommer av identifieringsskÃ¤l
att hÃ¤nvisas till som FÃ¶retag X i avhandlingen. Skribenten har gjort observationer fÃ¶r att
jÃ¤mfÃ¶ra hur ett fÃ¶retag utfÃ¶r marknadsundersÃ¶kningar med teoretiska ramverk, fÃ¶r att
sedan skapa ett ramverk som Ã¤r en kombination av teori och praktik.
Pro gradu-avhandlingen strÃ¤var efter att svara pÃ¥ de fÃ¶ljande fyra frÃ¥gorna:
Teoretisk frÃ¥ga:
Vilka konceptuella metoder fÃ¶r bedÃ¶mning av marknadspotential finns inom tidigare
forskning?

Normativ frÃ¥ga:
Vad borde chefer, i fÃ¶retag som fokuserar pÃ¥ konsumentvaror, gÃ¶ra fÃ¶r att jÃ¤mfÃ¶ra
marknader framgÃ¥ngsrikt?

7.3 Internationalisering
Det finns mÃ¥nga orsaker till att fÃ¶retag kan vara intresserade av att gÃ¥ in pÃ¥ nya marknader;
de vill mÃ¶jligen fÃ¶rbli konkurrenskraftiga, bli lÃ¶nsamma eller hÃ¥lla fast vid sin position pÃ¥
marknaden (Kub kov m.fl. 2009). FÃ¶retag kan dessutom internationalisera pÃ¥ flera olika
sÃ¤tt, exempelvis genom att sÃ¤lja sina produkter pÃ¥ en ny marknad, flytta produktionen eller
andra

fÃ¶retagsaktiviteter

utomlands

(Hollensen

2007).

Uppsalamodellen

fÃ¶r

internationalisering har skapats pÃ¥ 1970-talet, men har sedan dess uppdaterats i nÃ¥gra
etapper. Enligt Uppsalamodellen tenderar fÃ¶retag att internationalisera stegvis, genom att
fÃ¶rst gÃ¥ in pÃ¥ marknader som Ã¤r kulturellt och sprÃ¥kligt lika hemmamarknaden och
mÃ¶jligen Ã¤ven nÃ¤ra geografiskt sett, eftersom intrÃ¤det pÃ¥ dessa marknader inte kÃ¤nns sÃ¥
riskfyllt. (Johanson & Vahlne 1977)

80

Ett antal akademiska artiklar har undersÃ¶kt hur fÃ¶retag frÃ¥n de nordiska lÃ¤nderna
internationaliserat tidigare. Enligt dem Ã¤r fÃ¶retag frÃ¥n Norden intresserade av att
internationalisera, eftersom deras hemmamarknader Ã¤r smÃ¥ och begrÃ¤nsade (Benito m.fl.
2014). De baltiska lÃ¤nderna samt Ryssland intresserar dessa fÃ¶retag, eftersom de Ã¤r
geografiskt nÃ¤ra och Ã¤ven kulturellt sett ganska lika de nordiska lÃ¤nderna, dessutom vÃ¤xer
de baltiska lÃ¤ndernas ekonomi i snabb takt. De nordiska fÃ¶retagen fÃ¶ljde Uppsalamodellen
under sin internationaliseringsprocess. (Larimo & Huuhka 2007).

7.4 UtvÃ¤rdering av marknadspotential
NÃ¤r fÃ¶retag Ã¤r intresserade av att internationalisera, kan det finnas en stor mÃ¤ngd
marknader att vÃ¤lja emellan och det kan vara svÃ¥rt att definiera vilka marknader som har
hÃ¶g marknadspotential. MÃ¥nga olika teoretiska ramverk fÃ¶r utvÃ¤rdering av
marknadspotential har skapats och det finns en del likheter mellan dem. MÃ¥nga ramverk
lyfter fram marknadstillvÃ¤xt (t.ex. Ozturk m.fl. 2015, Cavusgil m.fl. 2004),
produktpotential (t.ex. Cavusgil 1985), och konkurrenssituation (t.ex. Hollensen 2007,
Johansson 2000, Cavusgil m.fl. 2004) som faktorer som pÃ¥verkar marknadspotential. En
del modeller Ã¤r uppbyggda i ett stort steg (t.ex. Sheng & Mullen 2011), medan andra Ã¤r
inkrementella, dÃ¤r en stor mÃ¤ngd marknader analyseras till en bÃ¶rjan, fÃ¶r att sedan sÃ¥lla
bort ointressanta marknader i nÃ¥gra steg och till sist hitta nÃ¥gon eller nÃ¥gra intressanta
marknader (t.ex. Cavusgil 1985).
MÃ¥nga fÃ¶rfattare nÃ¤mner att de flesta ramverk fÃ¶r marknadspotential, inte tar
industrispecifika faktorer i beaktande (t.ex. Ozturk m.fl. 2015, Sheng & Mullen 2011). En
del skribenter har fÃ¶rsÃ¶kt skapa industrispecifika ramverk (t.ex. Ozturk m.fl. 2015, Sheng
& Mullen 2011) och i dessa fall Ã¤r det viktigt att identifiera faktorer som Ã¤r relevanta fÃ¶r
industrin och fÃ¶retaget, samt inkludera dessa i evalueringen av marknadspotentialen.
FallfÃ¶retaget identifierade exempelvis marknadsstorlek- och tillvÃ¤xt, konkurrensnivÃ¥ och
marknadssegment som relevanta faktorer inom sin industri.

7.5 Metodik
Forskningsprocessen fÃ¶r bÃ¥de denna avhandling, samt fallfÃ¶retagets projekt har varit
uppbyggd i tvÃ¥ delar, dÃ¤r kvantitativa sekundÃ¤rdata frÃ¥n Euromonitor International
81

analyserats fÃ¶rst, och dÃ¤refter har kvantitativa data undersÃ¶kts. I denna pro graduavhandling anvÃ¤nds mixad metod, dÃ¤r kvantitativa sekundÃ¤rdata analyseras kvantitativt
genom univariat och bivariat analys och kvalitativa data i form av observationer analyseras
kvalitativt genom tematisk analys. Mixad metod anvÃ¤nds fortfarande i liten grad inom
fÃ¶retagsekonomi (t.ex. Clark et al. 1999, Peterson 2004; Hurmerinta-PeltomÃ¤ki &
Nummela 2006). Skribenten har gjort observationer under hela skrivprocessen och under
hela projektet fÃ¶r fallfÃ¶retaget, under tidsperioden oktober 2020-maj 2021, medan
skribenten arbetat med det kvantitativa data i oktober 2020-april 2021.

7.6 Analys
De kvantitativa data i arbetet kommer frÃ¥n Euromonitor International och det fanns
tillgÃ¥ng till industrispecifik information och siffror fÃ¶r 13 europeiska lÃ¤nder. LÃ¤ndernas
marknadsstorlekar och -tillvÃ¤xt inom fallfÃ¶retagets industri samt specifikt fÃ¶r en av
fallfÃ¶retagets produkter har analyserats. Dessutom har riskfaktorer fÃ¶r EU-medlemskap,
hÃ¥llbarhet, korruption och ekonomisk situation i de olika lÃ¤nderna studerats, eftersom
dessa faktorer pÃ¥verkar lÃ¤ndernas marknadspotential.
Genom den teoretiska referensramen har identifierats nÃ¥gra teman som analyserats,
marknadsstorlek och

tillvÃ¤xt, riskfaktorer, kulturella, sprÃ¥kliga och politiska likheter,

geografiskt avstÃ¥nd, inkrementell analys av marknadspotential samt anvÃ¤ndningen av
sekundÃ¤r- och/eller primÃ¤rdata.

7.7 Diskussion och sammanfattning
Resultaten frÃ¥n studien visar pÃ¥ att Uppsalamodellen fÃ¶r internationalisering fortfarande
Ã¤r relevant idag. FallfÃ¶retaget utfÃ¶rde en objektiv vÃ¤rdering och jÃ¤mfÃ¶relse av de olika
marknaderna, men dÃ¥ beslutet gjordes Ã¶ver vilken marknad med hÃ¶g marknadspotential
skulle undersÃ¶kas pÃ¥ djupet, sÃ¥ valde FÃ¶retag X en marknad som bÃ¥de visade hÃ¶g
potential, men var Ã¤ven nÃ¤ra fÃ¶retagets huvudmarknader med tanke pÃ¥ geografi och kultur.
I fallfÃ¶retagets utvÃ¤rderingsprocess lÃ¥g det vÃ¤ldigt lite fokus pÃ¥ kultur, medan de flesta
teoretiska ramverken nÃ¤mnde detta som en riskfaktor som bÃ¶r undersÃ¶kas. Detta indikerar
att kultur mÃ¶jligen spelar en mindre roll i praktiken Ã¤n i teorin och att fÃ¶retagsledare

82

eventuellt ser det mer som en faktor att vara medveten om, Ã¤n en risk. Det fanns Ã¤ven en
del andra skillnader mellan fallfÃ¶retagets process och de teoretiska ramverken (t.ex. med
tanke pÃ¥ handelsbarriÃ¤rer), vilket kan exempelvis bero pÃ¥ att de teoretiska ramverken
fokuserar pÃ¥ ett globalt perspektiv, medan FÃ¶retag X fokuserade pÃ¥ lÃ¤nder i Europa.
Cavusgil (1985) diskuterar hur lÃ¥ngt man kan nÃ¥ med endast skrivbordsundersÃ¶kning och
att man troligen i slutÃ¤ndan behÃ¶ver besÃ¶ka marknaden. Detsamma hÃ¤nde under
fallfÃ¶retagets process, man nÃ¥dde en viss punkt dÃ¥ man insÃ¥g att man inte kommer att
kunna lÃ¤ra sig mer genom sekundÃ¤rdata och intervjuer, utan mÃ¥ste antingen besÃ¶ka den
intressanta marknaden eller kÃ¶pa konsulttjÃ¤nster.
Vilka konceptuella metoder fÃ¶r bedÃ¶mning av marknadspotential finns inom tidigare
forskning? Det finns vÃ¤ldigt mÃ¥nga teoretiska ramverk, som innehÃ¥ller en hel del likheter,
men de flesta ramverk innehÃ¥ller Ã¤ven element som inte ingÃ¥r i andra ramverk. En del av
ramverken Ã¤r inkrementella, medan andra bestÃ¥r av endast ett steg. UtvÃ¤rderingen av
marknadspotential hos fallfÃ¶retaget utfÃ¶rdes inkrementellt och med hjÃ¤lp av sekundÃ¤rdata.

inom

specialvaruhandelsindustrin, a) Hur genomfÃ¶rs utvÃ¤rderingen av marknadspotential? b)
Vilka andra faktorer Ã¤r relevanta fÃ¶r valet av marknader fÃ¶rutom marknadspotential?
FallfÃ¶retaget utfÃ¶rde marknadsjÃ¤mfÃ¶relsen med en liten projektgrupp, dÃ¤r alla
medlemmar hade olika styrkor och roller inom fÃ¶retaget. Man kan utfÃ¶ra jÃ¤mfÃ¶relsen av
marknadspotential genom att samla in primÃ¤rdata, med hjÃ¤lp av generella tal, eller genom
att kÃ¶pa relevant sekundÃ¤rdata. FallfÃ¶retagets process indikerar att fÃ¶retag kÃ¶per data som
Ã¤r relevant fÃ¶r dem fÃ¶r marknadsanalys och utfÃ¶r analysen inkrementellt. Dessutom
indikerar resultaten att fÃ¶retag fokuserar mer pÃ¥ industrispecifika faktorer, Ã¤n de teoretiska
ramverken. Det finns mÃ¥nga faktorer som pÃ¥verkar marknaders potential, men faktorer
som inte varit viktiga innan kan spela en stor roll senare och tillgÃ¥ng till marknaden spelar
i slutÃ¤ndan en viktig roll.
Vad borde chefer, i fÃ¶retag som fokuserar pÃ¥ konsumentvaror, gÃ¶ra fÃ¶r att jÃ¤mfÃ¶ra
marknader framgÃ¥ngsrikt? Det Ã¤r viktigt att ha en tydlig plan, men det Ã¤r Ã¤ven viktigt att
Ã¤ndra planen vid behov. Man bÃ¶r Ã¤ven utfÃ¶ra jÃ¤mfÃ¶relsen av marknaders potential sÃ¥
noggrant och objektivt som mÃ¶jligt, sÃ¥ att man fÃ¶rstÃ¥r data man arbetar med och ger alla
83

lÃ¤nder en jÃ¤mlik chans. Det Ã¤r ocksÃ¥ viktigt att planera resurser noggrant, bÃ¥de med tanke
pÃ¥ pengar, tid och personal.
