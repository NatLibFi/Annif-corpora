Abstract
In this thesis, a novel ion-to-electron signal transduction method was applied for checking the
functionality of chloride and potassium solid-contact ISEs with physically damaged ionselective membranes (ISMs). The potentiometric response was compared with amperometric
and

coulometric

methods

before

and

after

damaging

the

ISMs.

Poly(3,4-

ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) were used as solid-contact doped with chloride anions
(Cl−), i.e., PEDOT(Cl) and PEDOT doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS), i.e.,
PEDOT(PSS). Sequential addition/dilution in concentration was recorded by using
potentiometric, amperometric and coulometric signal transduction methods.
Potentiometric measurements carried out before and after damaging the ISM demonstrated the
functionality of chloride ISEs, i.e., the potentiometric calibration curve showed acceptable
slopes before and after damaging of ISMs. The coulometric measurement results showed a very
similar response for every increase/decrease in concentration, showing stable accumulation of
charge but with steady perceptible drift in the response. This drift was also noticed in
potentiometry. The amperometric results depicted a significant increase in baseline noise, after
the ISM had been damaged, thereby clearly proving that chloride ISEs are not functioning
properly.
In the case of potassium SC-ISEs, all (potentiometric, coulometric and amperometric)
measurements with and without BGE after damaging the ISM demonstrated inadequate and not
comprehensible responses, proving that the ISEs were not functioning after damaging the ISM.
However, some response was still observed for every stepwise addition in concentration when
measured without any background electrolyte (BGE). The non-functionality was also proven
by potentiometric calibration curves clearly showing non-Nernstian responses after electrodes
had been damaged both with/without BGE. Based on the above results it can be concluded that
the amperometric method is a reliable and suitable method for examining the SC-ISEs for their
functionality.
The electrochemical impedance spectra for chloride and potassium SC-ISEs showed a highfrequency semicircle originating from the ISM. After damaging the ISM, the high-frequency
semicircle in both chloride and potassium SC-ISEs disappeared. Thus, impedance
measurements could also be used to prove that ISMs were damaged.
Keywords: Amperometry, coulometry, potentiometry, ion-to-electron signal transduction,
solid-contact ion-selective electrodes, ion-selective membrane, impedance spectra.

Introduction
The field of use of ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) is tremendously wide, especially in clinical
diagnostics, environmental monitoring, process control and many other branches. The use of
ISEs is highly beneficial in comparison with other conventional analytical techniques because
they can provide a relatively cheap, accurate, fast and selective determination of a wide range
of ionic species [1, 2].
For instance, the identification and quantification of physiologically important ions in the blood
(K+, Na+, Mg2+, Cl− and Ca2+) play an essential role in medicine. The goal of analytical chemists
is to meet the needs, develop and refine new low-cost, rapid and accurate ISEs [3]. Advantages
of the miniaturized, reliable, robust and maintenance-free sensors led to the manufacturing of
a solid-state ISE based on conducting polymer as the ion-to-electron transducer [4].
The key element in a potentiometric ion sensor or ISE is the ion-recognition element, i.e. the
ion-selective membrane (ISM). The main parameter determining the response of the ISE is the
interaction between the ion-recognition element and target ions. This response is converted into
a potential signal which is measured under zero current condition [5].
While conducting measurements with remotely controlled ISEs in real use, one might not be
aware that an electrode is damaged and demonstrates not precise or even ambiguous results.
The key point is to gather the information about the state of the electrode as much as possible,
so one could draw a more reliable and adequate conclusion from the analysis. Such information
can be very useful for evaluating the performance of sensors used in remotely controlled
measurements as any deterioration in the response of the sensors can be easily recognized and
fixed in time.
Chloride and potassium solid-contact ion-selective electrodes (SC-ISEs) were prepared using,
as solid contact, the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with
chloride (Cl−) and polystyrene sulfonate, respectively. The sensors were characterized and
mainly studied using potentiometric, chronocoulometric and chronoamperometric methods
before and after damaging the ion-selective membranes of the sensors. Results from the
potentiometric, amperometric and coulometric measurements before and after damaging of the
membrane are compared to see whether these analysis methods can be used to evaluate the
condition of the SC-ISE.

1.1

Theoretical background
Chemical sensors

A chemical sensor is a special tool that converts chemical information, i.e. total concentration
or defined analyte concentration in the sample into an electronic signal. The whole process
consists of two main steps: molecular recognition and signal transduction. The molecular
recognition part is the part where the chemical reaction takes place, producing a specific signal
such as a mass change, increase in temperature or color etc. The signal transduction element
converts the obtained information into a measurable signal. The latter corresponds to the
quantity present in the sample [6]. The signal transducers can be divided into four types (Figure
1): optical, electrochemical, mass, and thermal [7].

The molecular recognition part is in charge of being selective towards a certain analyte. In ideal
cases, one molecular recognition part is specific for only one molecular species. Unfortunately,
this is not the case in reality; rather, certain molecular recognition parts can be more selective
to a given molecular species in comparison to others. The latter ones are called interfering
molecular species [6].

1.2 Solid Contact Ion Selective electrodes
In the group of electrochemical sensors, there is an important subgroup called potentiometric
sensors or they can also be called ISEs [8]. The practical application of ISEs is broad for several
reasons such as low cost, low energy consumption, portability, and small size. The working
principle of an ISE is based on a polymeric membrane containing an ionophore, which is
selective to the defined inorganic or organic ions, and the ability to transduce the information
from the recognition process into an electrical signal [2].
Solid-contact ion-selective electrodes (SC-ISEs) have exceptionally huge advantages when
compared to conventional ion-selective electrodes where a liquid solution is used for ion-toelectron transduction. In SC-ISEs, a conducting polymer (CP) is often used as an ion-to-

2

electron transducer, which makes them maintenance-free, and easy to miniaturize [7], [9]. The
conventional ISE is schematically illustrated in Figure 2a, where poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC)based ion-selective membrane (ISM) is attached to the end of the electrode which is in its turn
filled with an internal filling solution. The solution should contain an ion that is going to be
measured and acts as a charge carrier between the membrane and the inner reference electrode.

Figure 2. Schematic illustration of a) conventional ion selective electrode (ISE); b) coated wire electrode
(CWE); c) Solid-contact ion selective electrode (SC-ISE)

A new generation of electrodes is the coated-wire electrode (CWE) invented by Catrall and
Freiser [10]. Since this invention, the development in the construction of all-solid-state ionselective electrodes is constantly evolving. The CWE is schematically demonstrated in Figure
2b, where the ISM is deposited on a solid conductor, such as glassy carbon, silver, copper, or

platinum wire, etc. However, along with advantages such as low cost, simplicity of the design,
flexibility and miniaturization, there were some prominent drawbacks related to this structure
such as poor adhesion of ISM onto the solid conductor and low potential stability of the
electrode. The use of CP (discussed more in detail in chapter 1.4) in the preparation of ISEs has
led to the creation of a maintenance-free all-solid-state ion-selective electrode. The conducting
polymer functions as an ion-to-electron transducer between the ion-selective membrane and
electronic conductor as shown in equation 1 below:
3

P+A− + e‒ ↔ P+A−

(1)

where: P+ and P are the conducting polymer’s oxidized and neutral forms, respectively and A‒
is an anion.
The conducting polymer can be deposited either physically or electrochemically onto a solid
electronic conductor. Then, an ISM is applied on top of the conducting polymer; the resulted
electrode is called solid-contact ion-selective electrode (SC-ISE) (Figure 2c). The whole
process of selectivity is due to the interaction between the analyte and the ISM (ion recognition
part). This type of electrode shows high potential stability in comparison with CWEs and
similar results in comparison with conventional electrodes. Different types of conducting
polymers can be used in the fabrication of SC-ISEs. Some of the most prominent
representatives are poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) [11], polypyrrole [12] and
polyaniline [13].
1.3

Polyvinyl chloride-based membrane and its components

PVC–based ISM is one of the most popular ISMs which has many advantageous physicochemical properties. PVC allows the integration of different types of ionophores [14, 15]. In
general, a PVC-based ISM mostly consists of four main components: plasticizer, PVC,
ionophore and/or a small amount of lipophilic salts. Everything is dissolved in an organic
solvent such as tetrahydrofuran [16].
PVC holds all components of the membrane together. Plasticizers increase the dielectric
constant as well as the membrane’s homogeneity, flexibility and mechanical properties.
Plasticizers likewise provide the ISM with liquid properties, thereby alleviating an ion
exchange through the membrane and decreasing the hydrophobic properties [6]. Broadly used
representatives among plasticizers are bis(2-ethylhexyl)sebacate (DOS) and 2-nitrophenyl
octyl ether (o-NPOE) [6], [17].
Lipophilic salts reduce the interference from counter ions in the sample. Additionally, they
reduce the electrical resistance, thereby increasing the sensitivity of ISEs with the ionophore
[18]. Widely used lipophilic salts for neutral ionophore-based cation-selective ISEs are:
potassium

tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)]borate

and

potassium

tetrakis(4-

chlorophenyl)borate [19, 20].
The ionophore plays a role as molecular recognition part in the membrane. Due to its
physicochemical properties and ability to interact with the target ion, such as ionic interaction
and size exclusion, the membrane-based ISE selectively binds a specific ion in the sample
solution. The ionophore can be charged or neutral. The neutral ionophores do not have any
4

charge and by creating ion-to-ionophore complexes they selectively bind to ions of interest
[16]. In this work, the neutral ionophore Valinomycin (Figure 3a) was used for preparing
potassium-ion selective electrodes [21]. In the composition of the chloride ion-selective
electrodes (Cl−-ISEs) studied in this thesis, the ion-exchanger – tri-dodecyl methylammonium
chloride (Figure 3b) is used instead of the ionophore [20], [22].

1.4 Electrically conducting polymers
1.4.1 General overview
The discovery of polyacetylene’s electrical conductivity properties is considered to be the
starting point of the development of semiconducting polymers. Some conducting polymers that
attracted high attention from the both scientific and practical point of view are polythiophene,
polypyrrole, poly(paraphenylene) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) are shown in Figure
4.

Conducting polymers exhibit excellent and tunable properties, making them a great alternative
as an ion-to-electron transducer in the sensor technology sector. The simplicity in fabrication
as well as being relatively low-cost material made conducting polymers suitable candidates to
be used for the mass production of disposable miniaturized electrodes [24]
.

1.4.2 Synthesis of conducting polymers
Polymerization of conducting polymers is divided into chemical and electrochemical
polymerization. Chemical polymerization is suitable for mass production and is much cheaper.
However, chemical polymerization is not the right choice to produce a thin film.
Electrochemical methods have many advantages due to the simplicity and reproducibility of
the process and therefore is the preferred method in various applications [25]. In
electrochemical polymerization two or three electrodes are used, auxiliary and working or
auxiliary, working and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrodes are mounted in an
electrochemical cell containing electrolyte and the monomer dissolved in a solvent. When the
polymerization starts, the conducting polymer film is deposited gradually on the surface of the
working electrode to produce a polymer layer with the proper thickness [26].

6

The polymerization reaction takes place at the working electrode surface and the thickness of
the film is controlled by the polymerization time. The electrochemical polymerization is
performed using three main modes: galvanostatic, potentiostatic and potentiodynamic
polymerization. The most common method is galvanostatic electrochemical polymerization
where a constant current is applied. In potentiostatic polymerization, a constant potential is
used. In potentiodynamic polymerization, the applied potential is varied, and, as a result of this,
a more stable and homogeneous polymer film is obtained [25], [27].
1.4.3 Doping of conducting polymers
The term band gap (energy gap) is the energy difference between the conduction and valence
bands. In conductors, the valence and conduction bands overlap, and that is why the
conductivity of these materials is so high and only a little energy is required to move the
electron between two bands. Semiconductors and insulators have an energy gap as
demonstrated in Figure 5 [28].
In conducting polymers, the valence band is filled but conduction bands are empty. The energy
gap is too high for the electron to be thermally excited from the valence band to the conduction
band and, as a consequence, the conductivity is low. Doping is the process to increase the
conductivity of the conjugated polymers by creating new energy levels to make the electron
transfer possible. It means that electrons should be either removed from or inserted in the
material; these processes are called p-doping or n-doping, respectively [29].

Figure 5. Overview of the bandgap (Eg) in a) metals; b) semiconductors; c) insulators

7

The range of conductivities of conjugated polymers is comparable with the range of
semiconductors locating between the insulators and metals, ranging from 10−10 to 106 Sm−1. The
range of conductivity depends on the doping level of conjugated polymers as well as the type
of polymer used. Both chemical and electrochemical doping methods are used. The level of
doping can be controlled in the electrochemical method by the voltage applied. By applying a
determined potential, the polymer is oxidized (p-doping, equation 2) or reduced (n-doping,
equation 3) accompanied by insertion of charge-compensating anions and cations, respectively:

P + A− → P+A− + e−

p-doping

(2)

P + e− + C+ → P−C+

n-doping

(3)

P is the neutral form of the polymer, P+ is the oxidized form and P− is the reduced form. A− and
C+ are the counter ions [30].
1.4.4 Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)
Many research works have been done on thiophene-based conducting polymers such as
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (Figure 4). PEDOT can be synthesized from the monomer
3,4-ethylendioxythiophene (EDOT) with the chemical and electrochemical polymerization
methods. The electrochemical method is more beneficial both in terms of time and the required
amount of monomer. PEDOT is synthesized electrochemically using electrolyte salts by
galvanostatic, potentiostatic and cyclic voltammetric methods.
Due to its fascinating properties, PEDOT (Figure 4) is considered one of the most important
polythiophene derivative. It has high conductivity (in the p-doped state), low oxidation
potential and energy gap, as well as good environmental stability. Above mentioned properties
of PEDOT make it attractive to use as semiconducting material in SC-ISEs.
However, PEDOT itself is insoluble in water and to make it soluble during polymerization
poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PSS) was utilized as a charge-balancing dopant. Eventually, dark
blue PEDOT(PSS) is obtained, which is soluble in water [31]. PEDOT(PSS) polymer, which
is also called Baytron P, has a wide range of manufacturing fields such as electrode material
for capacitors [32], rechargeable batteries [33], photovoltaic devices [32], and many other
applications.

1.5 Potentiometry
An ISE is an example of an electrochemical sensor using the principles of potentiometry. The
potential of an indicator electrode (ISE) cannot be measured directly by itself. It is measured
against the reference electrode at equilibrium conditions. The working principle of the ISE is
8

that when the membrane comes into contact with the analyte it converts the activity of the target
ion into an electrical potential. As stated by the Nernst equation this potential is linearly
dependent on the logarithm of the ionic activity [6], [34]. The set-up for a potentiometric
measurement using a conventional ISE is depicted in Figure 6.

Ag/AgCl
KCl

Figure 6. Schematic illustration of an electrochemical cell for potentiometric measurements.

A reference electrode such as Ag/AgCl electrode consists of the metal wire electrode sheeted
with the same salt of that metal submerged into the concentrated solution with the same anion
of this salt. This is kind of structure procures the potential stability of the reference electrode
[34].
The resulted cell potential (Eind) is governed by Nernst equation (5) [17], [34] shown below:
𝑅𝑇

𝐸 = 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡 + 𝑛 𝐹 𝑙𝑛𝑎𝑖 + 𝐸𝑗
𝑖

(5)

where:
-

const includes all potential contributions other than ISM, e.g., reference electrode
potential and standard potential of indicator electrode,

-

T is the temperature (K),

-

R and F are the universal gas constant and the Faraday constant, respectively,

-

ai is an activity of the target ion,

-

ni is the charge of the target ion,

-

Ej is the liquid junction potential.

9

The liquid junction potential is the potential that develops at the interface between two different
solutions and can be calculated with the Henderson formula if the solvent is the same. In most
cases, liquid junction potential at the reference electrode can be sufficiently eliminated if the
junction potential is kept constant during calibration and measurement [30, 31].
The slope of the calibration curve where potential is plotted versus the logarithm of the activity
of the ion for a single charged cation would be 59.2 mV or 59.2/𝑛𝑖 mV for others at 25 °C and
negative for anions. Another issue to be considered is the determination of the ion activity using
equation (6) below:
(6)

𝑎𝑖 = 𝛾𝑖 𝑐𝑖
where,
-

ci is the concentration of the target ion,

-

γi is the activity coefficient of the ion.

The activity coefficient, which strongly depends on the ionic strength of the solution, can be
calculated using the Debye–Hückel [35] equation at low ionic strength (J < 0.1 mol kg–1) (7):
𝐴𝑛𝑖2 √𝐽

(7)

𝑙𝑜𝑔𝛾𝑖 = 1+𝑎

𝐾𝑗𝑒𝑙 𝐵 √𝐽

where:
-

J is the ionic strength,

-

A and B are constants where in the case of aqueous solutions at 25 °C; A= 0.512 and
B= 0.328,

-

aKjel is the Kjelland parameter (hydrated ion radius),

-

ni is the charge of ion i.

The selectivity, or the response of an ISE to a certain ion (primary ion) in the presence of
interfering ions, can be determined using the Nikolsky-Eisenman equation (8) [36] shown
below:
𝑛𝑖/𝑛𝑗

𝑅𝑇

𝐸 = 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡 + 𝑛 𝐹 ln (𝑎𝑖 + ∑𝑗 𝐾𝑖,𝑗 𝑎𝑗

where:
-

Ki,j is the selectivity coefficient

-

(8)

-

j is the interfering ion

-

a is the activity of ion

-

ni & nj are the charge of the primary and interfering ion, respectively

-

E is the measured potential

-

const combines all other potentials in the cell.

1.6 Coulometric signal transduction method
As it was mentioned earlier, in classical potentiometry the equilibrium potential between an
indicator electrode (ISE) and a reference electrode is measured. In this case, the flowing current
is close to zero due to the high input impedance of the voltmeter used for measuring the
potential [34], [37].

Figure 7. Illustration of the novel ion-to-electron transduction principle in a three-electrode cell. Scheme
adapted from [37].

A novel ion-to-electron transduction method for SC-ISEs was introduced by J. Bobacka et al.
in 2015 which is based on constant potential coulometry [37]. As illustrated in Figure 7, in this
approach the potential between the SC-ISE and the reference electrode in a three-electrode cell
is kept constant by using a potentiostat. Since the potential of the SC-ISE is held constant, any
change in the concentration (activity) of the primary ion in the sample solution (Figure 7, 1)

11

will cause a potential difference at the membrane/solution interface (Figure 7, 2) and
subsequently a rise in the potential difference between reference and working electrodes.
Since the potential of SC-ISE is forced to remain constant, the potential change at the
membrane/solution interface will cause the flow of a transient current between the SC-ISE and
the counter electrode (CE) (Figure 7, 3). This current will cause the oxidation/reduction of the
conducting polymer PEDOT(PSS) until the potential change at the membrane/solution
interface is compensated by an equal but opposite change in the potential of the conducting
polymer (Figure 7, 4). When the equilibrium is reached, the current will stop flowing and the
resulting current vs. time profile can be integrated to obtain the total charge (Figure 7, 5) [37,
38].
Ionophore-based SC-ISEs require recalibration before they can be used. It is always better to
eliminate the recalibration procedure as long as the method allows it [39, 40]. Another
advantage of the novel method is that the amount of volume introduced can be neglected as the
novel method is more focused on counting the charge consumed within the solid-contact layer
of the SC-ISE. The current is obtained from integration that will flow until the new equilibrium
is reached with every change in the activity of ions [40].
Some new methods of application have been introduced in practical application such as
detection of small changes in pH in seawater as well as studies in the determination of activity
changes in potassium ion in serum [41]. Studies on how the electrode geometry influences
measurements proved that with an increase of the area of the SC-ISEs the response time
shortened [42].
The novel signal transduction method can be utilized to amplify the analytical signal by
increasing the film thickness (redox capacitance) of the solid contact while keeping the
Nernstian response (linear dependence of potential to the log of activity of ions) [38].

1.7 Other characterization techniques
1.7.1 Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is one of the most broadly used electrochemical techniques to
examine the oxidation and reduction processes of chemical species. CV is performed in a threeelectrode electrochemical cell where the potential between the reference and working
electrodes is controlled and current between the working and the counter electrode is measured.
A linear potential sweep vs. time is applied to the cell in the form of a triangle [43].

12

The obtained current is recorded and plotted vs. the applied potential to acquire the so-called
cyclic voltammogram. In other words, cyclic voltammetry is performed by sweeping the
potential of the working electrode and measuring the resulted current. The anodic and cathodic
current peaks found in a cyclic voltammogram indicate the existence of oxidation or a reduction
reaction of a redox couple [44].
When the scan rate increases, the current will also increase allowing more ions to be oxidized
or reduced (within a given time) leading to the increase in the anodic and cathodic currents.
The experiments are done in a non-stirred solution. CV is a popular technique for both the
synthesis and characterization of conducting polymers [45, 46].
1.7.2 Chronoamperometry and chronocoulometry
Amperometry measures a current that flows in the electrochemical system. The measured
current is proportional to the concentration of the analyte under diffusion-controlled conditions.
Hence, based on the obtained information, the concentration of the analyte can be determined.
Chronoamperometry is the amperometry measured versus time at a constant applied potential
in a three-electrode setup.
The Clark oxygen electrode can be one of the examples, where chronoamperometry is used.
Measurement of the oxygen concentration in biological samples is of help in the medical
diagnostics field [47]. A novel ion-to-electron transduction principle for SC-ISEs used in this
work is another example where chronoamperometry is used for characterisation of conducting
polymers in ISEs [38], [41].
Coulometry measures the amount of charge passed in the electrochemical system. There are
two coulometric methods – controlled potential coulometry and constant current coulometry.
The first one, also known as chronocoulometry, is applied in a three-electrode cell, where the
potential of the indicator electrode is kept stable. Thus, the current is decreased with the
concentration of analyte in the solution. Integration of the current over time gives the
information of the total charge consumed. In constant-current coulometry as the name states
for itself, the current is kept constant during a certain time that is beforehand known by the
length of reaction. The accumulated charge can be computed by multiplying current versus
time [41].
1.7.3 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) [48] is an electrochemical technique used to
measure the impedance of a system in dependence on the alternating current (AC) frequency.
EIS gives information about the kinetics and mechanisms of electrochemical processes. The
13

EIS is a non-destructive technique and can provide various information about complex samples
such as batteries, fuel cells and conducting polymers coated with a membrane [43], [49].
EIS is based on examining the response of an electrochemical system when the alternating
sinusoidal excitation signal is applied, and the obtained sinusoidal alternating current is
measured. The phase shift gives information about the behaviour of the electrochemical system.
So, that phase shift values of 0°, 45°, and 90° correspond to a resistor, Warburg impedance,
and a capacitor, respectively [34], [43], [48].
The impedance of a system Z is a vector quantity consisting of a real (Z’) and an
imaginary (−Z’’) part. |Z| is presented in the complex plane, −Z’’ and Z’ as the components of
a vector in the so-called “Nyquist plot”. To put it in another way, the Nyquist plot is the plot of
the imaginary impedance component versus the real impedance component [43], [49].
Sometimes it is difficult to understand what electrochemical processes occur on the electrode’s
surface. An equivalent circuit can help to grasp this information in a simplified way by breaking
it down into electrical compounds such as double-layer capacitance, solution resistance and the
charge-transfer resistance, etc. The EIS measurement data can help to reconstruct the model of
the equivalent circuit as well as, inversely, based on equivalent circuit summarize the
electrochemical process happening in the system [43], [49].

Potassium chloride (KCl, ≥ 99.5 %) was obtained from Merck. Distilled and deionized water
(ELGA Purelab Ultra; resistivity 18.2 MΩcm) was used in the preparation of all aqueous
solutions.
Glassy carbon (GC) disk electrodes (SIGRADUR® G, Germany) were used as working
(indicator) electrodes. Metrohm single-junction (6.0733.100) Ag/AgCl/3M KCl and Metrohm
double-junction (6.0726.100) Ag/AgCl/3M KCl/1M LiOAc were used as reference electrodes.
14

2.2 Preparation of the ISEs
2.2.1 Polishing and cleaning the electrodes
GC disk electrodes, with the area 0.07 cm2 (3 mm in diameter) and surrounded by PVC body,
were polished using sandpapers with various coarseness: 180, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1400, 2000
and the last one is 4000. The second step was polishing the electrodes using diamond paste
with different particle size. Polishing the electrodes with alumina slurry and clean cloth in water
was the final step in the polishing sequence. The sequence was from top to bottom and from
left to right for approximately 1 minute for each step. After the polishing procedure, all
electrodes were cleaned by sonication in ethanol, and then in deionized water each for 15
minutes. Every step included rinsing with deionized water and examining the quality of the
smooth polishing with the naked eye.
2.2.2 Cyclic voltammetry
The CV technique was used to check that the electrodes were properly cleaned as well as
checking the formation of the conducting polymer films deposited on the electrode surfaces by
the electrochemical polymerization. The measurements were carried out in 0.1 M KCl solution
in a three-electrode electrochemical cell connected to the Autolab General Purpose
Electrochemical System (AUT30.FRA2-Autolab Eco Chemie, B.V., The Netherlands). The
working electrode was either a polished GC electrode or a GC electrode with the conducting
polymer deposited on it. The auxiliary electrode was a GC rod and as a reference electrode, a
Metrohm single-junction Ag/AgCl/3M KCl electrode was used. The deaeration of the 0.1 KCl
solution with nitrogen gas was conducted for 15 minutes before measurement and the gas flow
was kept above the solution during the measurements to eliminate any chances for secondary
redox reactions such as the oxygen in the solution, which may cause interference in the
measurements. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded for two cycles in the potential range −0.5
V to 0.5 V with 0.2 V as the starting potential, and a scan rate of 0.1 V/s [50, 51].
2.2.3 Electrosynthesis of PEDOT(Cl) and PEDOT(PSS)
The galvanostatic polymerisation method was used for electrochemical deposition of the
conducting polymer PEDOT doped with chloride (Cl−), i.e., PEDOT(Cl), and PEDOT doped
with PSS, i.e., PEDOT(PSS), from a deaerated aqueous solution containing 0.1 M KCl with
0.01 M EDOT (the monomer) in the case of PEDOT(Cl) and 0.1 M NaPSS with 0.01 M EDOT
in the case of PEDOT(PSS). The prepared solutions were stirred overnight to ensure the
dissolution of the monomer. The electrochemical polymerization was carried out in a one15

compartment three-electrode (or two-electrodes in the case of PEDOT(PSS) electrochemical
cell connected to the Autolab general purpose electrochemical system (AUT30.FRA2-Autolab
Eco Chemie, B.V., The Netherlands). The polished GC electrodes were used as working
electrodes, a Metrohm single-junction Ag/AgCl/3M KCl was used as the reference electrode
and a GC rod was used as the counter electrode in the case of PEDOT(Cl). The reference
electrode was not used in the case of PEDOT(PSS) polymerization to avoid contamination. A
constant current of 0.0141 mA was applied for 142 seconds to obtain a polymerization charge
of 2 mC. When the polymerization was done, the resulting GC/PEDOT(Cl) and
GC/PEDOT(PSS) electrodes were rinsed thoroughly with distilled water and conditioned in
0.01 M KCl solution. After being conditioned for 24 hours, the recorded cyclic voltammograms
(2nd cycle) as proof of the formation of the conducting polymer films (PEDOT(Cl) and
PEDOT(PSS)) deposited on the electrode surfaces by the electrochemical polymerization, is
illustrated in Appendix A. As can be seen, the close to the rectangular capacitor-like shape of
the cyclic voltammograms proves that the formation of PEDOT(Cl) and PEDOT(PSS) films
were successful.
2.2.4 Preparation of the ion-selective membrane cocktails
All the components for preparing the cocktails were weighed and dissolved in THF. All cocktail
components for chloride or potassium ion-selective membrane were poured into a glass vial
(5 ml) and vortexed until the dissolution of most of the compounds and then kept overnight on
a slowly shaking rocker for a complete dissolution of the components. All membrane cocktails
had the final dry mass content of 15 %. The latter was defined as the proportion of the sum of
all membrane elements masses, excluding THF, to the sum of all membrane elements masses
including THF (Table 1).

2.2.5 Preparation of SC-ISEs
The preparation of the chloride and potassium solid contact ion-selective electrodes (Cl−-SCISEs, K+-SC-ISEs) was done by drop-casting 50 µl of the corresponding membrane cocktail on
top of each of the GC/PEDOT(Cl) ctrode was covered with a membrane cocktail. Before
applying the membrane cocktail, the electrodes were fixed face up on top of the plastic cell.
While applying the cocktail on top of the electrode one must make sure that there is no bubble
left on the surface (a needle was used for removing bubbles). After drop-casting the membrane,
the electrodes were left to dry for 24–48 hours under a glass cover to protect the membrane
from dust and other contaminations. Electrodes with dried membrane were immersed in 0.01
M KCl solution for at least 24 hours of conditioning before further measurements.

2.3 Potentiometric response of the prepared electrodes
The performance of the prepared electrodes was checked by carrying out conventional
potentiometric calibrations. Automatic calibration was performed using a 16-channel
millivoltmeter (Lawson Labs EMF16 Interface system) with a high input impedance of 1015 Ω
and L-EMF DAQ 3.0 software. The prepared chloride and potassium SC-ISEs were used as the
indicator electrodes and Metrohm double-junction Ag/AgCl/3M KCl/1M LiOAc was used as
a reference electrode. Additionally, a commercial solid-state chloride-ion-selective electrode
(Cl-ISE, Thermo Scientific Orion 9417BN) was used as the indicator electrode for comparative
purposes when calibrating the Cl−-SC-ISEs. Sequential automatic dilutions were performed
using two Metrohm Dosino 700 instruments equipped with burets of 50 mL capacity (Herisau,
Switzerland). The burets were first rinsed twice to eliminate any air bubbles. The pumps were
programmed to dilute the sample solution either with fresh deionized water or with 0.1 M NaCl
as background electrolyte (BGE) (only in the case of potassium SC-ISEs). The starting solution
was 50 ml of 0.1M KCl or 0.1 M KCl with 0.1 M NaCl as BGE (only in the case of potassium
SC-ISEs) that was pipetted into an electrochemical cell and corresponding ISE was immersed
into the solution. Six dilutions were conducted until the concentration reached 10−7 M KCl. The
time between each dilution step was 5 minutes for potential stabilization and at the end of each
step, the final potential value was noted. The average of the last 5 potential values (points) from
each dilution was used for plotting the calibration curves. Instead of concentration, the activity
values calculated using the Debye-Hückel equation (equation 7) was applied. The calculation
of the slopes was performed for the linear part of the calibration curves.

17

2.4 Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using the
Autolab Frequency Response Analyser System (AUT30.FRA2-Autolab Eco Chemie, B.V.,
The Netherlands). The measurements for all of the prepared electrodes were conducted at the
open circuit potential in deaerated 0.1 M KCl solution. Deaeration of the solution was made for
15 minutes with nitrogen gas before the experiments and then the gas inlet was kept above the
solution during the measurement. The prepared SC-ISE connected to a one-compartment threeelectrode electrochemical cell. The auxiliary electrode was a GC rod and the reference electrode
was Ag/AgCl/3M KCl. The frequency range under which spectra were recorded was 100 kHz
to 10 mHz and using an AC excitation amplitude of 10 mV.

2.5 Chronopotentiometry and chronoamperometry (chronocoulometry)
Chronopotentiometric and chronoamperometric measurements were performed using a
conventional three-electrode cell with GC rod as a counter electrode (for chronoamperometry),
chloride SC-ISEs as the working electrode and Metrohm Ag/AgCl/3M KCl/1M LiOAc as the
reference electrode connected to an Ivium CompactStat instrument (Ivium Technologies, The
Netherland). The starting solution was 50 ml of 0.1 KCl solution. In all measurements, the time
for one analysis was 10 min with a stepwise increase in the concentration for every 2 min,
starting from either 1 mM or 10 mM KCl electrolyte solution. The amount of stepwise increase
in the concentration was for 5 % and 10 % or stepwise decrease in the concentration in 100
mM KCl electrolyte for only 10 %. A 100 mM KCl solution was used to increase the
concentration and deionized water was used to decrease (dilution) the concentration. The
required volumes were calculated and are summarized in Tables 1a, 1b and 1c (Appendix B).
The same set-up was used in the case of potassium SC-ISEs. The volume of starting solution
was 50 ml of 1mM or 10 mM KCl (in deionized water or 100 mM NaCl as BGE). In all
measurements, the time for one analysis was 61 min with a stepwise 10 % increase in the
concentration of 1 mM or 10 mM KCl electrolyte (in deionized water or 100 mM NaCl as
BGE). The required volumes were calculated and are shown in Table 2 (Appendix B). The first
alteration in concentration was done after 1 min and the other every 10 min. These time ranges
were fixed for the electrodes before damaging the ISM. After damaging the ISM, the
amperometric response increased and in order to save time, it was decided to shorten the time
ranges down to 10 min (with a stepwise increase every 2 min) for both amperometric and
potentiometric measurements.

18

The electrodes were immersed in the solution, which was stirred using a magnetic stirrer, and
the chronoamperograms and chronopotentiograms were recorded. The potential was measured
and noted after waiting from 1 min to 2 min for signal stabilization in the chronopotentiometric
measurements. In chronoamperometry, the measured stable potential was applied.

2.6 Damaging the ISM in SC-ISEs
After completing all the tests such as checking the potentiometric response, carrying out
chronopotentiometric, chronoamperometric (coulometric) and EIS measurements, the ISM of
the chloride and potassium SC-ISEs were physically damaged using a blade. The commercial
Cl−-ISE was not damaged but measured with damaged Cl−-SC-ISEs for comparison reason.
The blade was applied 3-4 times from the top to the bottom of the surface of ISM to cause
damage to the membrane. The applied effort was subjectively equal to the whole electrodes.
The comparison of the ISMs of the chloride and potassium SC-ISEs before and after damaging
is illustrated in Appendix C. The photos are taken using a USB microscope: Veho discovery
VMS-004 Deluxe.

Results and discussion

Six Cl−-SC-ISE and six K+-SC-ISEs electrodes were prepared. ISM of three chloride SC-ISEs
and four potassium SC-ISEs were damaged. Results for only one representative for each type
of electrode before and after damaging are demonstrated, whereas the results for the rest of the
electrodes are shown in the Appendices.

3.1 Cl−-SC-ISE: characterisation and comparison of the obtained sensors before
and after physical damaging of the ISM
3.1.1 Potentiometric calibration
The calibration curves were obtained in the concentration range 10−1 to 10−7 M KCl solution
(Figure 8a before damaging the ISM). The slopes for these electrodes were approaching to
Nernstian and can be considered reasonable for further chronopotentiometric and
chronoamperometric measurements. The slopes were found in the linear range 10−1 M to
10−4 M KCl with the calibration values shown in Table 2. Based on the EIS spectra obtained
on the chloride SC-ISEs (Appendix D) the Replicates 2, 5 and 6 were chosen as the most
suitable (with the closest resistance) for onward damaging ISM and conducting the
measurements (Figure 8b calibration curve after damaging the ISM).

Figure 8. Potentiometric calibration curves of the commercial Cl −-ISE (Comm E.) and the
GC/PEDOT(Cl)/Cl-ISM electrodes before damaging the ISM (a) and after damaging the ISM (b).

As can be observed from Table 2, the slope of the commercial electrode is −56.3 mV and for
the rest of the electrodes, the slope was in the range of (‒54.9 ± 0.9) mV (mean ± sd, n=6). After
damaging the ISM of chosen electrodes the slope was calculated and found to be in the range
(−57.4 ± 4.6) mV (mean ± sd, n=3). Interestingly, replicate 2 after damaging the ISM showed a
distinct slope value in comparison with the rest electrodes. The reason for that is unknown. The
slope of the commercial electrode was also measured for comparison reason and showed a
similar slope value as shown in Table 2. The results show that the electrodes even after
damaging the ISM were approaching the Nernstian slopes. The linearity range including that
of the commercial electrode was found to be 10‒1 M to 10‒4 M, further dilution led to gradual
levelling-off of the potential changes both before and after damaging of ISM.

3.1.2 Chronopotentiometric and chronoamperometric (chronocoulometric)
measurements
Before conducting the addition/dilution chronopotentiometric measurements, approximately
1 min to 2 min was given for potential stabilization. In Figure 9 the addition of 5 % and 10 %

20

in a 10−2 M KCl starting solution before damaging the ISM (a) and after damaging the ISM (b)
of chloride SC-ISE (Replicate 2) is demonstrated. As can be observed from both graphs, e.g.,
for 5 % or 10 % increase (addition) in the concentration of Cl− anions led to an approximately
proportional decrease in potentials (−2.5 mV for 10 % and −1.3 mV for 5 % additions)
throughout the measurement either conducted with damaged or undamaged membrane.
However, after damaging the ISM a potential drift was noted, where between the additions
more time was required for the stabilization of the reading. The addition for the rest of the
replicates and dilution with deionized water before and after damaging the ISM is depicted in
Appendix E where a similar trend is also observed.

Similar to potentiometry, chronocoulometric responses (integration of the current peaks)
demonstrated stable accumulation of charge (Q) transferred in the process during the addition.
The coulometric response of chloride SC-ISE (Replicate 2) during the stepwise addition in
concentration is presented in Figure 10a before damaging and in Figure 10b after damaging the
ISM, where 10−2 M KCl was used as starting solution (see also Appendix F for other replicates).

M KCl during stepwise 5 % and 10 % addition in concentration before damaging the ISM (a) and after
damaging the ISM (b) See also Appendix F

In Figure 10a in both 5 % and 10 % stepwise additions the higher the concentration of KCl
added the more charge was accumulated or in other words, the larger changes in the activity of
the primary ion in the solution the larger charges were measured. However, in Figure 10b a
drift in the response was observed for both 5 % and 10 % stepwise additions. This can be related
to the potential instability (Figure 9b) and/or damages on the membrane surface which could
also influence the overall accumulation of charge throughout the time measured. The
cumulative charge appeared to be slightly increased (5 % addition) from 200 nC to 250 nC
before and after damaging the ISM, respectively. In this case, the accumulated charge for 10 %
stepwise additions was approximately twice that of 5 % additions in both before and after
damaging the ISM.
In chronoamperometric measurements before and after damaging the ISM (Figure 11a and
Figure 11b), the responses showed dissimilar results. Before damaging the membrane (Figure
11a) every increase in concentration both for 5 % and 10 % gave a reproducible current peak

with little noise, whereas damaging the membrane surface of ISE led to a significant increase
in baseline noise. The noise levels increased by more than ca 20 times after damaging the ISM.
Nevertheless, after damaging the ISM, the current peaks were still visible. One can claim that
this tremendous baseline noise effect is due to damage of the ISM and that the SC-ISE is not
properly functioning. Interestingly, the high noise level in the amperometric response (Figure
11b) was not visible in the coulometric response (Figure 10b) that was obtained by the
integration of the amperometric signal. See Appendix G for other replicates in addition/dilution
of concentration.

3.1.3 Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy
The electrochemical characteristics of the prepared SC-ISEs were studied by EIS to gain more
information about the electrochemical processes that take place at the interface of the chloride
SC-ISE and bulk solution (0.1 M KCl). The impedance spectra of SC-ISE, before damaging
the ISM (a) and after damaging the ISM (b), are demonstrated in Figure 12 (Appendix H for
other replicates). Before membrane damaging the impedance spectra of the Cl−-SC-ISE
(Replicate 2) showed a high-frequency semicircle (indicating the formation of the ISM)
originating from the bulk resistance and of the membrane together with its geometric
capacitance. The bulk resistance which is equal to the diameter of the semicircle was equal to
100 kΩ. The low-frequency tail was an almost ideal capacitor showing an angle of ca 90°,
which can be related to the bulk redox capacitance of the solid contact PEDOT(Cl). The lowfrequency capacitance (CL) was estimated from the imaginary impedance value (-Z’’ = 410 kΩ)
at f = 0.01 Hz, as follows: CL = (2π × 0.01 Hz × 410000 Ω) −1 F = 39 µF.

Figure 12. EIS recorded for Cl−-SC-ISE (Replicate 2) before (a) and after damaging the ISM (b). The
direct current potential is open circuit potential (0.13 V). The frequency range is 100 kHz to 10 mHz.
The electrolyte is 0.1M KCl. See also Appendix H.

However, the impedance spectrum of the damaged electrode showed an approximately 45°
Warburg diffusion line at high frequencies, that was gradually approaching towards 70° line at
low frequencies. Furthermore, the high-frequency semicircle was absent, and the overall
impedance was much lower for the damaged electrode. This behaviour can be explained when
considering that damaging of the ISM exposes part of the PEDOT(Cl) film to the electrolyte
solution. This facilitates the reversible oxidation of PEDOT. Estimating the low-frequency
capacitance (CL) from the imaginary impedance value (-Z’’ = 8.2 kΩ) at f = 0.01 Hz, resulted
in CL = 1.9 mF, which is higher than expected for a 2 mC film of PEDOT(Cl).

3.2 K+-SC-ISE: characterisation and comparison of the obtained sensors before
and after physical damaging of the ISM
3.2.1 Potentiometric calibration
The calibration curves without BGE were obtained in the concentration range 10−1 M to 10−7
M KCl solution (Figure 13a before damaging the ISM). The slopes were determined from the
linear range 10−1 M to 10−5 M KCl, resulting in the calibration values shown in Table 3a. The
slopes for these electrodes can be considered as near-Nernstian and may be deemed reasonable
for further chronopotentiometric and chronoamperometric measurements.
Based on the impedance spectra (Appendix H, in more detail, will be discussed section 3.2.3)
obtained on the K+-SC-ISEs the replicates with the two smallest (Replicates 1 and 2) and with
two highest resistance (Replicates 5 and 6) were chosen for onward damaging electrodes’ ISMs
and conducting the measurements. Calibration curves for the chosen electrodes without BGE
after damaging the ISM are demonstrated in Figure 13b.

The calibration curves with 0.1 M NaCl as BGE were obtained in the concentration
range 10−1 M to 10−7 M KCl solution (Figure 14a before damaging the ISM). The slopes
determined in the linear range 10−1 to 10−5 M KCl were (49.5 ± 0.7) mV (mean ± sd, n=6) as
shown in Table 3b. The slopes for this electrode had some interference from BGE but can be
considered as approaching to near-Nernstian and may be deemed reasonable for further
chronopotentiometric and chronoamperometric measurements. After damaging the ISM of
chosen electrodes the slopes were calculated and found to be as previously non-Nernstian,
having extremely low slope values in the range (4.4 ± 0.9) mV (mean ± sd, n=4) (Table 3b). As

was foreseeable, the calibration curves for the chosen electrodes with 0.1 M NaCl as BGE after
damaging the ISM demonstrated inadequate potential response which is shown in Figure 14b.

3.2.2 Chronopotentiometric and chronoamperometric (chronocoulometric)
measurements
Conducting chronopotentiometric measurements for potassium SC-ISEs took a long time for
potential stabilization and it varied from 5 min to 10 min, but for some electrodes, it took even
longer. In Figure 15 stepwise increase for 10 % in a 10−2 M KCl starting solution before
damaging the ISM (a) and after damaging the ISM (b) of K+-SC-ISE (Replicate 1) is illustrated.
As can be seen from Figure 15a, a steady stepwise potential increase of 2 mV was observed for
every step concentration addition. However, a significant potential drift was noted towards a
steep decrease in Figure 15b after ISM had been damaged. Nevertheless, despite the damage in
the ISM for every stepwise addition, the potential growth was estimated at ~0.3 mV. The rest

26

of the replicates before and after damaging the ISM are depicted in Appendix I, where a similar

In Figure 16 stepwise increase for 10 % in a 10−2 M KCl starting solution with BGE before

shown. As one can notice from Figure 16a, in the presence of BGE a steady stepwise potential
increase of 2 mV was also observed for every step of 10 % concentration addition but
superimposed on a potential drift. This can be due to interference from BGE.

0.1 M NaCl as BGE (a) before damaging the ISM and (b) after damaging the ISM. See also Appendix I.

The damaged SC-ISE measured in presence of interfering ions from BGE demonstrated
inadequate response in the potential (Figure 16b). This was also proved by the potential
calibration curve illustrated in Figure 14b. Overall, the interference from the BGE was
27

significant as one can compare Figure 15b without BGE and Figure 16b with BGE. Although
significant potential drift exists in both cases, without BGE there was some increase in potential
response for every 10 % increase in concentration, which cannot be seen with BGE. The rest
of the replicates before and after damaging the ISM with interfering ions are also displayed in
Appendix I.
Both with and without 0.1 M NaCl as BGE before damaging the ISM (Figure 17a and Figure
18a) the K+-SC-ISE showed almost identical responses in terms of the accumulated charge

(−0.2 µC) for every stepwise increase in concentration.
After damaging the ISM without BGE a significant decrease of the coulometric response of
K+-SC-ISE was seen. It can be due to damage to the membrane surface and potential instability
(Figure 17b).

Despite the damage in ISM about ~0.02 µC accumulation of charge for every stepwise addition
is noticeable. The corresponding measurements with interfering ions from BGE (Figure 18b)
showed an almost straight line that was opposite in the direction to the response measured
before damaging the ISM (Figure 18a). Overall, the interference from BGE was significant as
one can compare Figure 17b and Figure 18b.
In general, Figure 17b and Figure 18b confirm the non-functionality of K+-SC-ISE after its ISM
is damaged. It is also illustrated by calibration curves (Figure 13b and Figure 14b) and nonNernstian slope values (Tables 3a and 3b). The rest of the replicates are displayed in Appendix
J where a similar trend is also observed.

Similar to the potentiometric and coulometric responses, the chronoamperometric
measurements before damaging of the ISM either with or without BGE exhibited similar
current responses for every stepwise 10 % addition in concentration. However, the baseline
noise effect in both concentrations was more pronounced in solutions measured without BGE.
The rational explanation for this phenomenon is unclear.
Damaging the membrane surface of the ISE led to a significant increase in baseline noise. One
can argue that this tremendous baseline noise effect is due to the compromised integrity of the
ISM. The noise level indeed increased more than 80 times after damaging the ISM in the case
of 0.01 M KCl without BGE (Figure 19a and Figure 19b), and more than 200 times in presence
of the BGE (Figure 20a and Figure 20b). Nevertheless, after damaging the ISM, a barely seen
current response still exists in the case of measurement without BGE (as it was shown in
previous measurements above).
However, interference from the BGE has a tremendous impact on the current response of the
damaged K+-SC-ISE (Figure 20b) where zero signal is found throughout the stepwise increase
in concentration (See Appendix K for other replicates). Not surprisingly, the calibration curves
(Figure 13b and Figure 14b), as well as slope values (Tables 3a and 3b), clearly confirm the
non-functionality of the K+-SC-ISE after damaging the ISM. Comparison among
potentiometric, coulometric and amperometric responses after damaging the ISM in both
chloride and potassium SC-ISEs give clear comprehension that electrodes do not give a proper
response for every stepwise addition in concentrations.

One might have a misleading ambiguous feeling that chronopotentiometric measurements after
damaging the electrode’s membrane are still functioning and give adequate response for
addition in concentration as it is illustrated for the chloride ISE, where PEDOT(Cl) itself can
give a response for Cl−, as a consequence functioning even after damaging the ISM (Figure 9b).
This is not valid for the K+-SC-ISEs (Figure 15b and Figure 16b). However, it is visible from
the chronoamperometric responses in all above-mentioned cases, that after damaging the ISM
of the SC-ISE, it is no longer functioning properly (Figure 11b, Figure 19b and Figure 20b).

3.2.3 Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy
The impedance spectra of K+-SC-ISEs are demonstrated in Figure 21. Before membrane
damaging the impedance spectrum of the K+-SC-ISE (Replicate 1) is very similar to the
spectrum of Cl−-SC-ISE. Both demonstrated a high-frequency semicircle (indicating the
formation of the ISM) originating from the bulk resistance and of the membrane together with
its geometric capacitance.
The bulk resistance which was equal to the diameter of the semicircle was 500 kΩ, which is 5
times larger than it was in Cl−-SC-ISE, considering that Replicate 1 was with the smallest
resistance value (Figure 21 and Appendix D). The low-frequency tail showed a 40° angle, which
is very close to the 45° Warburg impedance. This is because potassium ions diffuse to and from
the solid-contact ISE. The low-frequency capacitance (CL) was estimated from the imaginary
impedance value (-Z’’ = 50 kΩ) at f = 0.01 Hz, as follows: CL = (2π × 0.01Hz × 50000 Ω)-1 F
= 318 µF.
However, the impedance spectrum of the damaged electrode shows the beginning of a
semicircle that gradually tends towards a capacitive line. This behaviour can be explained when
considering that damaging of the ISM exposes part of the PEDOT(PSS) film to the electrolyte
solution. This facilitates the reversible oxidation of PEDOT. Estimating the low-frequency
capacitance (CL) from the imaginary impedance value (-Z’’ = 3.5 kΩ) at f = 0.01 Hz, resulted
in CL = 4.5 mF, which is higher than expected for a 2 mC film of PEDOT(PSS).

Summary
In this thesis, the functionality of solid-contact ISEs with physically damaged ISMs was studied
applying a novel ion-to-electron signal transduction method and a comparison between
potentiometric, coulometric and amperometric methods was made. Two types of solid-contact
ion-selective electrodes (SC-ISEs) were prepared: PEDOT doped with chloride anions (Cl−),
i.e., PEDOT(Cl) and PEDOT doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS), i.e. PEDOT(PSS) were
used as solid-contact in the fabrication of Cl−-SC-ISEs and K+-SC-ISEs. Chronoamperometry,
chronocoulometry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic
measurements were carried out on the prepared electrodes. Then deliberate damage on the ionselective membrane (ISM) of the electrode was done and the above-mentioned measurements
were conducted again. The idea behind this was to compare the potentiometric, coulometric
and amperometric response of the electrodes before and after damaging the ISM, to find out
which of the methods was most sensitive to electrode damage.
The linearity ranges from potentiometric calibration curves before and after damaging the ISM
was found to be 10−1 M to 10−4 M in the case of Cl−-SC-ISEs and 10−1 M to 10−5 M in the case
of K+-SC-ISEs with and without BGE. The linear slopes for chloride and potassium SC-ISEs
demonstrated close to Nernstian values, with lower (close to near-Nernstian) values measured
with BGE in the case of potassium SC-ISEs before damaging the ISM. However, chloride SCISEs demonstrated near-Nernstian behaviour (−57.4 ± 4.6 mV (mean ± sd, n=3)) even after
damaging the ISM, stating that electrodes were still functioning, which was not the case for
damaged potassium SC-ISEs.
Potentiometric measurements carried out before and after damaging the ISM demonstrated very
similar responses for chloride ISEs, only a slight potential drift was noticed, and more time was
required for potential stabilization. Similarly, coulometric results demonstrated stable
accumulation of charge but a steady perceptible drift in response was also observed due to
potential instability and/or damages of the ISM. However, the amperometric results revealed
differences – after damaging the membrane the current response showed a significant increase
in baseline noise (more than 20 times) that was not observed before damages on the ISM. This
tremendous baseline noise in amperometric measurements proved that the chloride SC-ISE was
not functioning properly. Hence, amperometry could be used to detect physical damage to an
SC-ISE.
In the case of chloride SC-ISEs, the potentiometric and coulometric measurement results were
reasonable even after damaging the ISM, which could falsely indicate that the electrode

32

functioned properly. The potentiometric calibration curves, after damaging the ISM, still
showed adequate, near-Nernstian slope value. It can be because the exposed PEDOT(Cl) film
can also give a response to Cl−, and therefore the chloride SC-ISEs was functioning even after
damaging the ISM. Nevertheless, chronoamperometric measurement results showed that the
Cl−-SC-ISEs was not functioning properly due to the baseline noise effect, because of damages
on the ISM.
Potentiometric measurements without BGE carried out before and after damaging the ISM
demonstrated very dissimilar responses for potassium SC-ISEs. After damaging the ISM, a
significant potential drift was noted and the response to K+ has deteriorated. Similarly,
coulometric measuring results demonstrated the same significant drift and only a minor
accumulation of charge for about ~0.02 µC for every step of addition in concentration. The
amperometric responses showed similar results as for chloride SC-ISEs – after damaging the
membrane the current response showed a significant increase in baseline noise (around 80
times). All measurements taken for K+-SC-ISEs with BGE showed inadequate responses. This
can be related to interference from BGE due to the non-functionality of the electrode’s ISM.
The non-functionality of the damaged K+-SC-ISEs was also clearly proven by the
potentiometric calibration curve, showing non-Nernstian behaviour both with and without
BGE. A significant potential drift existed in both cases (with and without BGE). However,
without BGE there was still some attempt in responses for every 10 % increase in concentration
that was not seen with BGE. Overall, the fact that K+-SC-ISEs were non-functioning after
damages on the surface of ISM was proven by all measurement methods used.
To sum up, which method would be more precise, accurate and suitable to examine the
electrode functionality depends on the type of electrode used and the background electrolyte
present. For instance, chloride SC-ISEs demonstrated near-Nernstian potentiometric response
even after damaging the ISM. Most probably that PEDOT(Cl) itself responded to Cl−, as stated
above. However, the malfunctioning of the damaged potassium selective SC-ISEs was visible
in all measurements. Nevertheless, it was clearly illustrated that the chronoamperometric
method was more reliable and suitable for testing the functionality of SC-ISEs, where nonfunctionality after damaging the ISM was demonstrated in both types of electrodes.
Results from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic measurements for chloride and
potassium SC-ISEs demonstrated that, before membrane damage, the impedance spectra
showed a high-frequency semicircle (indicating the formation of the ISM) coming from the
bulk resistance of the ion-selective membrane. However, for chloride SC-ISEs, the lowfrequency tail was estimated as an almost ideal capacitor with a phase angle close to 90°. In the
33

case of potassium SC-ISEs, the low-frequency tail showed 40° angle, which was very close to
45° Warburg impedance. This was related to the diffusion of potassium ions to and from the
solid-contact ISE. However, the impedance spectra of the damaged electrodes showed a
dramatic decrease in the overall impedance and the absence of a clear high-frequency
semicircle for both chloride and potassium SC-ISEs. This behaviour can be explained when
considering that damaging of the ISM exposes part of the PEDOT film to the electrolyte
solution. This facilitates the reversible oxidation of PEDOT.
