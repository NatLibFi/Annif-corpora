Abstract
Several studies confirm that there is a gender gap, i.e., an unequal proportion of men and women,
within different populist radical right (PRR) parties, both in the parties’ electorate and among the
parties’ members. The first aim of this thesis is to provide a research overview on gender and the
populist radical right and identify research gaps. The second aim is to contribute to the identified
least studied area within this field, i.e., to examine the gender-representation gap in the PRR parties
in the Nordic countries that are often considered global frontrunners regarding gender equality.
This empirical study answers three main research questions. The first question is whether the PRR
parties are Männerparteien (“men’s parties”), with respect to their gender-representation gaps. The
second question is whether the gender-representation gap in PRR parties is larger compared to in
non-PRR parties and in mainstream conservative parties. The third question examines the contagion
thesis and asks whether PRR parties, over time, strategically adapt their level of female
representation to the level of other mainstream parties.
The empirical study was conducted by calculating the gender-representation gap, based on the
percentage of women, among the Nordic PRR and non-PRR parties’ party council members, party
leaders, and listed candidates and elected representatives in national and local elections. The
contagion thesis was investigated by identifying changes in the PRR parties’ gender gaps over time.
The results demonstrated that a gender-representation gap exists in the Nordic PRR parties, with the
male to female ratio often being around 70:30. The Norwegian, Finnish, and Swedish PRR parties
had notably larger gender-representation gaps compared to the non-PRR parties, even when
compared to the mainstream conservative parties. The Danish PRR party’s gender gaps were, in
contrast, only marginally larger than the Danish non-PRR parties’. The gender-representation gap
was on average considerably larger in Danish parties than in the other Nordic countries’ parties.
Lastly, the gender-representation gap generally did not change over time and decreased
significantly only among the Sweden Democrats.
The overall conclusion was that the Nordic PRR parties can be considered Männerparteien, as their
gender-representation gaps were considerably larger than in the non-PRR parties. This
overrepresentation of men was also consistent over time.
Key words: Gender, populist radical right, Nordic countries, Nordic parties,

I. Introduction
1. Gender and the populist radical right
On August 14, 2021, the Finnish populist radical right party, the Finns Party, elected their
first female party leader, Riikka Purra. Purra received 774 votes, or 59 percent of the votes, at
the Finns Party’s party congress in Seinäjoki. She thus comfortably beat Sakari Puisto, who
ended up in second place with 252 votes (Yle, 2021). Both before and after Purra’s election,
opinion pieces in the Finnish media contemplated what the effect of a female party leader of
the Finns Party would be. Eeva Lehtimäki (2021), head of the political news section at the
Finnish TV channel MTV, wrote an online column stating that with Purra as leader, the Finns
Party has a chance of obtaining more votes from women; votes that are needed if the party
wants to increase its electoral popularity. Ann-Cathrine Jungar (2021), a political scientist
with the populist radical right party family as her specialty, additionally brought up the
paradoxical nature of being a female leader in a political party that adheres to stereotypical
views of masculinity and femininity. Jungar also stated that the politics of the Finns Party
most likely will not change under Purra’s leadership.
Purra is not the only new female leader in the populist radical right family in the Nordic
region. On May 8, 2021, Sylvi Listhaug became the second woman to lead the Norwegian
populist radical right party, the Progress Party (Helljesen, Krekling, & Tollersrud, 2021).
Listhaug replaced Siv Jensen, who led the party from 2006 until 2021. The topic of gender
balance also surfaced prior to the Progress Party’s party congress in May, as the congress’
participants were to vote in new members to the party council. The nomination committee’s
candidate proposal caused discussions, both internally in the party and externally in the
Norwegian media, as the committee proposed 14 men and only one woman, Listhaug, as
candidates (Dorholt & Gilbrant, 2021). Two of the nominated men consequently withdrew
their candidacy to give space for more women. Three women were ultimately voted into the
party council, in addition to Listhaug being elected leader.
With Listhaugh and Purra as party leaders, two of the four Nordic populist radical right (PRR)
parties are today led by women. Additionally, the Danish People’s Party had a female cofounder, Pia Kjærsgaard, who led the party from 1995 to 2012. The Sweden Democrats, the
youngest Nordic PRR party, is the only one that has not had a female leader. Parties
belonging to the PRR party family have nonetheless historically been associated with

11

Anna Lillkung
charismatic male leaders like Jean-Marie Le Pen (RN, France), Jörg Haider (FPÖ, Austria)
and Carl I. Hagen (FrP, Norway). Previous research has shown how the party’s ideology
(family) influences women’s representation, with parties varying significantly regarding the
proportion of women that represent them in parliaments (e.g., Högström, 2019; Sundström &
Stockemer, 2021). Moreover, previous research has evidenced a general overrepresentation of
men among the PRR parties’ members of parliament, members, and voters (e.g., Mudde,
2007; Rashkova & Zankina, 2017). This overrepresentation of men, both in the parties
themselves and in the PRR electorate, has led to the parties being called Männerparteien –
men’s parties (Mudde, 2007). Left parties are in contrast more likely to nominate and elect
women for parliamentary positions (e.g., Högström, 2019; Matland & Studlar, 1996;
Sundström & Stockemer, 2015).
Scholarship on gender in relation to the populist radical right has increased in the last decade,
but several studies continue to suggest that a research gap exists, not least concerning the
level of female contra male representation in the PRR parties. While the PRR parties are
perceived as being dominated by men to a larger extent than other parties, few empirical
studies confirm such conclusions (Mudde, 2007). The prevalence of female leadership in the
Nordic PRR parties therefore raises questions regarding gender in the populist radical right. In
the populist radical right parties, is there generally a significantly larger percentage of men
than women? How does this proportion present itself in Nordic countries which are
considered global frontrunners in gender equality? And are the PRR parties becoming more
women friendly as they evolve and become more mainstream?
The concept of women’s politics is often divided into three dimensions: the descriptive, the
substantive, and the symbolic representation (see Pitkin, 1967). Descriptive representation
concerns the numerical part of women’s representation. As women comprise around 50
percent of the world’s population, they should arguably also be represented in different
political organs in the same proportions as men. Substantive representation concerns “the
policy and procedural differences women may bring to the electoral arena,” while symbolic
representation concerns “the attitudinal and behavioral effects that women’s presence in
positions of political power might confer to women citizens” (Lawless, 2004, p. 81). Previous
scholarly work in this area has thus both investigated the numerical underrepresentation of
women in parliaments, as well as examined how the presence of female politicians affects
decision-making (Celis & Erzeel, 2015). Numerous studies have also concluded that feminist
and leftist parties have been leading advocates of women’s interests in parliament, with
12

Anna Lillkung
female members of parliament being more likely than their male colleagues to promote
women’s issues and further the agenda of women’s movements (Celis & Erzeel, 2015). Such
conclusions exhibit the importance of investigating women’s representation in political
parties, also in the populist radical right parties, which have gained influence in several
European countries in the last decades.
When only examining the PRR parties’ leaders today, the label Männerparteien can be
questioned. The Nordic countries are also not the only PRR parties experiencing female
leaders at the top, with Marine Le Pen leading the National Rally (known as National Front
until June 2018) in France and Pauline Hanson heading Australia’s One Nation. However,
while scholarly work has established that female party leadership has a positive effect on
women’s representation in politics (Sundström & Stockemer, 2021), it is less clear whether
the PRR parties have experienced a similar decrease in their overrepresentation of men in
other areas apart from party leadership.

2. Aims and approach
Considering these introductory remarks, the aim of this thesis is twofold. First, the thesis aims
to provide an in-depth research overview regarding gender and the populist radical right and
identify existing research gaps. This research overview describes and discusses three
prominent strands of research within the greater subject area of gender and the populist
radical right: (1) the demand-side with focus on gender gaps in the PRR electorate, (2) the
supply-side with focus on the gender ideology of the PRR parties, and (3) the supply-side
with focus on the gender-representation in the PRR parties. While several studies have
concentrated on the gender dimension of the populist radical right, most of these studies have
investigated the gender gap in the PRR electorate, i.e., among the voters of the PRR parties
(e.g., Coffé, 2018; Givens, 2004; Harteveld et al., 2015; Mayer, 2013; Norris, 2005; Spierings
& Zaslove, 2017). Several studies have additionally examined the gender ideology in the PRR
parties, i.e., on how PRR parties view gender equality and how they promote (or do not
promote) policies and laws that support gender equality and women (e.g., Akkerman, 2015;
Askola, 2019; Meret & Siim, 2013). Studies focusing on the gender-representation gap, i.e.,
on the level of female representation among the PRR parties’ members, listed candidates,
elected representatives, and party leaders, remain few and often not comparative. The
literature review thus shows that the research gap is the greatest regarding the gender-

13

Anna Lillkung
representation gap, i.e., the level of female representation in the PRR parties, and that few
comparative studies exist within this strand of research.
The second aim of the thesis is therefore to contribute to the least studied strand of research
within the populist radical right and gender by empirically observing the genderrepresentation gap in the Nordic PRR parties. The empirical study of this thesis thus examines
the gender gap among these parties’ listed candidates, elected representatives, members of
party councils, and party leaders. These gender-representation gaps are observed in different
political arenas (see Sjöblom, 1968), on both the national and subnational (local) level. The
gender gaps are also observed over time to examine if the PRR parties have adapted their
level of female representation to the level in other Nordic parties, which would entail that a
contagion effect has occurred (see Högström, 2019). Additionally, the gender-representation
gaps in the PRR parties are compared to the gender gaps in non-PRR parties in the Nordic
countries. The research questions that the empirical study addresses will be specified later, in
light of the research overview, in chapter IV.
The empirical part of the thesis approaches gender-representation gaps in PRR parties in a
Nordic comparative context. There are several reasons for this. First, the PRR party family
has evolved in four of the five Nordic countries in the last decades, with the founding of the
following PRR parties: the Danish People’s party (Dansk Folkeparti – DF) in Denmark, the
Progress Party (Fremskrittspartiet, FrP) in Norway, the Finns Party (Perussuomalaiset – PS)
in Finland, and the Sweden Democrats (Sverigedemokraterna – SD) in Sweden (Jungar &
Jupskås, 2014). Iceland is the only Nordic country that has not experienced a populist radical
right-wing party like those in the other Nordic countries (Herkman & Jungar, 2021). These
four PRR parties are moreover represented in their respective national parliaments, today,
which enables comparisons of the gender gaps in several political arenas. Second, the Nordic
countries have also generally experienced and seen the emergence of parties belonging to the
same party families (Jungar & Jupskås, 2014; Nedergaard & Wivel, 2017). The Nordic
countries used to have a five party-model consisting of a leftist/communist party, a social
democratic party, an agrarian party, a liberal party, and a conservative party. In addition to the
emergence of PRR parties, most Nordic countries have also experienced the rise of Christian
democratic and green party families. It is consequently possible to compare the gender gap in
the PRR parties to the gender gap in non-PRR parties that are akin to one another across the
Nordic region.

Third, the Nordic countries are appropriate to study as they have come far in the strive for
gender equality, especially compared to other countries. The Nordic countries were among the
first ones to provide women with complete voting rights and the gender employment gaps in
these countries are among the smallest amongst the members of the Organization for
Economic Co-Operation and Development, the OECD (OECD, 2018). The Nordic countries
have historically supported gender equality “at home, at work, and in public life, and have
often moved earlier and faster than most countries in taking action to promote this goal”
(OECD, 2018, p. 1). While this has been achieved through a multifaceted approach, the
Nordic states notably promote a dual earner/dual caretaker model, that encourages both men
and women to work outside the home and take care of children by a combination of
progressive income taxation and legislative action (Tanhua, 2020). The Nordic countries
support this balance of domestic and personal lives by offering subsidized and inexpensive
public daycare and free education. Additionally, family planning is integrated to support both
father and mother, offering paid paternal and maternal leave. Although each country has
specific parental leave and family policies, fathers’ quotas have been particularly successful in
Sweden, Norway, and Iceland. Such pursuits towards equality extend beyond legislature and
into national paradigms as Nordic countries promote gender mainstreaming and incorporate
gender equality as a vital aspect of their societies (Tanhua, 2020).
Fourth, the Nordic states have had a relatively high level of female representation in
parliamentary politics. A study that compared gender equality on several levels in the Nordic
countries concluded that “based on the assumption that a proportion of 40–60 percent of each
sex constitutes an equal or balanced representation, the goal of gender balance has been met
in Finland, Iceland, and Sweden” (Niskanen, 2011, p. 18). As of September 1, 2021, these
findings remain valid within Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian national parliaments, where
the percentage of women were 46 percent, 47 percent, and 44.4 percent respectively (IPU
Parline, 2021). In Denmark, the percentage of women was 39.7 percent in 2021, just below
the 40–60 percent balance of each sex (IPU Parline, 2021). Nevertheless, differences in
gender equality between the Nordic countries exist and the development cannot be considered
as linearly progressive. Each country continues battling their own series of vertical and
horizontal gender segregation challenges (Niskanen, 2011). However, within the global
setting and even the western world, the Nordic countries can generally be considered
comparable in the context of their shared concerns of and efforts towards gender equality and
balance. Arguably, the Nordic countries thus constitute a critical case to investigate the PRR
15

Anna Lillkung
gender-representation gap in (see Flyvjberg, 2006). If a comparatively large genderrepresentation gap is found in PRR parties in the Nordic countries that generally have a high
level of female representation, there is reason to believe that so is the case in PRR parties in
other, less gender equal countries.
Fifth, in addition to being similar regarding gender equality, the Nordic countries are also
generally considered akin and comparable. They all adhere to the ‘Nordic Model’, i.e., the
social and economic policies associated with the welfare Nordic states and offer their
residents and citizens a similar quality of living (Simon, 2017). The Nordic countries have
similar political systems and structures. They are established parliamentary democracies with
a long tradition of having stable political systems and well-functioning checks and balances.
The Nordics tend to have high voter turnout in elections and low levels of corruption (Nordic
Co-Operation, 2020).

3. Methodology
In the first part of the thesis, the research overview, a variety of sources on the topic of gender
and the populist radical right were included, mainly books, chapters in books, and scholarly
articles. The sources were written in a varied time span, but the study focused particularly on
sources written in the last two decades, as several PRR parties have evolved and grown in this
period, thus enabling empirical observation. Included sources focused on various aspects of
gender and the populist radical right, with studies divided into three strands: those concerning
the gender-electorate gap, those exploring the gendered aspects of PRR ideology, discourses,
and policies, and lastly, studies investigating the female representation in the PRR parties.
The empirical study investigated the descriptive representation of women among the Nordic
PRR parties’ listed candidates (electoral arena), elected representatives (parliamentary arena),
and members of party councils and party leaders (internal arena). Data was collected from the
last ten years (internal arena) and from the last three municipal and general elections
(electoral and parliamentary arenas). Additional data surrounding other main parties in the
Nordic countries was gathered in order to compare the gender-representation gap in the PRR
parties with the gender gap in the non-PRR parties, with particular focus on how the PRR
gender-representation gap compared to the same gender gap in the conservative and social
democratic parties. Högström’s (2019) reformulated contagion theory was moreover tested by
observing how the gender-representation gap has changed in the PRR parties over time, and
whether this gap has approached the gender gap in the main non-PRR parties.

4. Outline
The thesis is divided into five comprehensive chapters that in turn consist of several
subchapters. Chapter II discusses different conceptual approaches to populism and the
populist radical right, as well as outlines the definitions and categorizations of the populist
radical right party family that this thesis uses. This chapter also describes the history,
categorization, and ideology of the Nordic PRR parties specifically. Chapter III constitutes the
first part of the thesis, i.e., the detailed literature overview on gender and the populist radical
right. This chapter is further divided into three subchapters that focus on the three different
strands of research conducted on gender and the populist radical right. This chapter also
identifies research gaps in this scholarly area.
Chapter IV constitutes the second part of this thesis, i.e., the empirical study on the genderrepresentation gap in the Nordic PRR parties. The fourth chapter states the research questions
considering the literature review and presents the elected research design and methodology
used. This chapter also includes the presentation of the results of the empirical study. Chapter
V constitutes the concluding discussion of the thesis, where the results, primarily from the
empirical study, are interpreted and discussed.

II. The populist radical right party family in the
Nordic region
To investigate gender in relation to the populist radical right, it is necessary to establish a
clear conceptualization and definition of both populism and the populist radical right. Mudde
and Rovira Kaltwasser (2017) assert that the concept of populism is an essentially contested
one; discussions evade consensus, not only of its precise nature, but, in some cases, question
its very existence. Said lack of fundamental concordance of definition and categorization has
routinely impaired surrounding research, as several scholars specializing in the populist
radical right have argued (Anastasakis, 2000; Merkl, 2003). However, outside its recognized
nuances, Mudde (2007) states that populism has been defined as a type of political discourse,
ideology, leadership, movement, phenomenon, strategy, style, and syndrome. Building upon
this skeletal foundation, the following chapter clarifies the conceptualization of populism and
the populist radical right used in this thesis, in addition to explaining how the populist radical
right parties are categorized, both generally and more specifically in the Nordic countries.

1. Conceptualization of populism and the populist radical right
Three main approaches to the concept of populism have taken precedence in the scholarly
debate in political science today: the ideational approach, the political-strategic approach, and
the socio-cultural approach (Rovira Kaltwasser et al., 2017). This thesis adheres to Mudde’s
ideational approach to populism. Mudde (2017) considers populism to essentially be a set of
ideas. Populism is here defined as a “thin-centered ideology that considers society to be
ultimately separated into two homogeneous and antagonistic camps, “the pure people” versus
“the corrupt elite,” and which argues that politics should be an expression of the Volonté
Générale (general will) of the people” (Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser, 2017, p. 5). The thincentered nature of populism entails that it must be attached to other ideologies to undertake
political projects, appeal to a larger public, and answer to complex political questions (Mudde
& Rovira Kaltwasser, 2017). Populism is thus not a “coherent ideological tradition” but rather
a “set of ideas that, in the real world, appears in combination with quite different, and
sometimes contradictory, ideologies” (Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser, 2017, p. 6). Mudde’s
definition of populism is the one most frequently referenced in the literature on gender and
the populist radical right in Europe (e.g., Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser, 2015; Rashkova &

18

Anna Lillkung
Zankina, 2017; Spierings & Zaslove, 2017). Given its dialectical definition and widespread
utilization within the European context, this conceptualization is consequently the most
applicable one for this thesis.
Regarding the definition of the populist radical right specifically, Mudde (2007) states that an
ample number of terms have been used to describe this family of parties, e.g., extreme right,
far right, radical right, right-wing populism, neo-populism, populist nationalism, and
nativism. This thesis uses Mudde’s (2007) definition of the populist radical right. This
definition, in addition to being easily applicable to the cases in Europe, is the one most
frequently used in scholarly work on gender and the populist radical right. It thus enables
comparisons between the empirical results of this study to the results in previous studies.
The maximum definition of the populist radical right is, according to Mudde (2007), a
combination of three core ideological features: nativism, authoritarianism, and populism.
Nativism is the key ideological link between the parties in question and maintains that “states
should be inhabited exclusively by members of the native group (“the nation”) and that
nonnative elements (persons and ideas) are fundamentally threatening to the homogenous
nation-state” (Mudde, 2007, p. 19). Nationalism and xenophobia are integral elements to the
nativist dimension of Mudde’s populist radical right. The second feature, authoritarianism, is
defined as “the belief in a strictly ordered society, in which infringements of authority are to
be punished severely. In this interpretation, authoritarianism includes law and order and
“punitive conventional moralism” (Smith 1967: vi)” (Mudde, 2007, p. 23). This definition
does not necessarily entail an antidemocratic attitude, but also does not exclude one,
especially considering its prioritization of vertically ascribed moralistic law over individual
liberty. The third and final core feature is populism, which is defined as a thin-centered
ideology that considers society to be separated into two homogeneous and antagonistic
groups, “the pure people” versus “the corrupt elite” (Mudde, 2007). Populism further argues
that politics should be an expression of the general will of the people. Mudde deems the best
term for this party family to be either “radical right populism” or “populist radical right.”
“Radical,” in this context, is defined as the opposition to some key features of liberal
democracy, primarily political pluralism, and the constitutional protection of minorities
(Mudde, 2007). Mudde (2007) uses Norberto Bobbio’s (1994) distinction between left and
right based on the key feature of egalitarianism. The “right” is thus defined as the belief in a
natural order with inequalities.

2. The populist radical right-wing party family
The populist radical right emerged as a new party family in Western Europe in the 1980s,
with the surfacing of parties like the French Front National (today known as Rassemblement
National – RN) and the Austrian Freitheichtliche Partei Österreichs (FPÖ). Today, many
scholars agree upon the basic features of this party family, i.e., that they hold an authoritarian
position on sociocultural issues and believe in a strictly ordered society (Mudde, 2007;
Rydgren, 2005), that they adhere to an exclusionist and ethnically based form of nationalism
or nativism that finds non-native elements and people threatening to the homogenous nationstate (Jungar & Jupskås, 2014; Mudde, 2007), and that they include a populist ideology that
considers society to be separated into two antagonistic groups, the “pure people” and the
“corrupt elite” (Mudde, 2007, p. 23). The “right” in the populist radical right is the belief in a
natural order with inequalities, in accordance with Mudde’s (2007) conceptualization. While
there is strong emphasis on social and political elements in its definition, this does not
necessarily mean that PRR parties adhere to a typical right-wing economic policy. In fact,
there is no clear consensus on whether the populist radical right has a consistent and welldefined economic policy (Jungar & Jupskås, 2014). In recent years, many PRR parties have
shifted leftwards, and studies have claimed that the new “winning formula” is a combination
of authoritarian and a centrist position on economic policy (Jungar & Jupskås, 2014, p. 219).
Having a relatively clear conceptualization and ideology of the party family in focus, party
categorization also needs to be addressed. Mudde (2007, p. 40) suggests that “only parties
with a populist radical right core ideology and without any significant alternative faction(s)
are classified as members of the populist radical right party family.” Mudde thereby excludes
two categories of populist parties from the PRR party family: social populists and neoliberal
populists, in addition to excluding the non-populist right, primarily the undemocratic and
often elitist extreme right-wing parties. Social populism entails a combination of socialism
and populism and is considered left-wing rather than right-wing populism (Mudde, 2007).
Neoliberal populism is closely related to the populist radical right but is a combination of
primarily economic liberalism and populism, rather than having nativism a core feature
(Mudde, 2007). The non-populist extreme and undemocratic parties include parties that are
neo-fascist or that include neo-Nazism.
This study generally uses Mudde’s categorization of PRR parties in Europe and thereby
excludes social populists and neoliberal populists, in addition to excluding undemocratic and

20

Anna Lillkung
elitist extreme right parties. However, regarding the categorization of the PRR parties in the
Nordic countries, this study draws upon another article focused on PRR categorization by
Jungar and Jupskås (2014). Jungar and Jupskås’ work is firstly more recent than Mudde’s,
which is important since the populist radical right has evolved and grown since Mudde’s
Populist radical right parties in Europe was published in 2007. The emergence of the Finns
Party (PS) as a populist radical right party in Finland is one critical example.
In addition to its more recent date, Jungar and Jupskås have increased focus on the populist
radical right parties within the Nordic countries compared to Mudde’s more generalized
European study. Given their varied areas of scope, results and categorization differ between
the two sources; Mudde did not include the Finns Party as a PRR party and categorized
Norway’s Progress Party as a neoliberal populist party rather than a PRR party. Jungar and
Jupskås, on the other hand, included the Finns Party and the Progress Party as a PRR party
and this thesis therefore subscribes to this categorization.

3. The Nordic populist radical right-wing parties: History and
categorization
In recent decades, populist radical right-wing parties have emerged in the Nordic countries
(Jungar & Jupskås, 2014). Three distinct waves of Nordic populist movements can be
identified (Herkman & Jungar, 2021). The first, the “agrarian populist” movement, started in
Finland in the 1950s with the establishment of the Finnish Rural Party. The second wave
surfaced in the 1970s, when anti-taxation protest parties found electoral success in Norway
and Denmark. The third and final wave started in the 1980s when the nationalist party, the
Sweden Democrats, was established, while the populist parties in Finland, Norway and
Denmark concurrently adopted policies more critical towards immigration (Herkman &
Jungar, 2021). The Nordic PRR parties thereby have different historical points of departure.
The Finns Party (PS) was established in 1995 as a successor to the Finnish Rural Party, which
combined anti-establishment sentiments with a leftist socioeconomic policy and conservative
values. The Danish People’s Party (DF), established in 1995 by former members of the
Danish Progress Party, and the Progress Party (FrP) stem from the economically liberal antitax movements in the 1970s (Heinze, 2018). The Sweden Democrats (SD), on the other hand,
has its roots in neo-Nazi movements (Herkman & Jungar, 2021). The SD has recently, from
1995 onwards, begun to rebuild its image and distance itself from its extremist past (Herkman

21

Anna Lillkung
& Jungar, 2021). The fact that the SD struggled to present a more respectable image for many
years can also account for the party’s minimal electoral success until 2010 (Elgenius &
Rydgren, 2019).
The Nordic PRR parties have gathered and gained electoral support in diverging ways and to
varying degrees throughout the last decades. The DF (then the Danish Progress Party) was
highly successful already in the 1970s and became the second largest party in its first election
(Heinze, 2018). The DF has remained a party of significance since then, securing between 12
and 14 percent of the electoral support in the elections throughout the 2000s and becoming
the second largest party in the 2015 parliamentary elections (Herkman & Jungar, 2021),
though the party’s support dropped in the most recent general election in 2019. The DF has
also supported minority governments and influenced immigration policies (Heinze, 2018).
The FrP in Norway has a similarly long history of political success stemming from its
electoral breakthrough in 1989 when it became the third largest party in parliament (Heinze,
2018). The FrP has since retained its relevancy in Norway, becoming the second largest party
in the 1997 general election and supporting a minority government from 2001 to 2005,
thereby also influencing immigration policy (Heinze, 2018). The FrP joined a minority
government in 2013 but left the coalition in 2020 due to internal conflict. The party is
nevertheless the most long-lived successful populist party in the Nordic region and one of
only two that have been part of a ruling government (Herkman & Jungar, 2021).
While the PS’s and the SD’s electoral successes do not date back as far as the DF’s and the
FrP’s, the PS and the SD have rapidly increased their support in the recent decade. Long
considered an exceptional case in Europe, Sweden’s PRR party did not receive any
parliamentary seats until 2010 when the SD reached 5.7 percent of the total vote in the
Swedish general election, trespassing the 4 percent electoral threshold (Herkman & Jungar,
2021). In 2014, the party’s support increased, gaining 12.9 percent of the votes (Elgenius &
Rydberg, 2019). Growing nearly exponentially, the party secured 17.5 percent of the total
votes in 2018 and became the third largest party (Herkman & Jungar, 2021). Though other
mainstream parties historically built up a strong cordon sanitaire of the SD, thus hindering
the SD’s inclusion in government coalitions or as a supporting party to minority governments,
inter-party cooperation has, in recent years, been looked upon more favorably by center-right
politicians (Heinze, 2018).

22

Anna Lillkung
The rise of the PS’s electoral power grew in the 2000s, as its leader, Timo Soini, sought
opportunities to expand its base and welcomed nationalist agitators to the party (Herkman &
Jungar, 2021). The party’s electoral breakthrough came in 2011, when it received 19.1 percent
of the vote, yet remained in the opposition (Herkman & Jungar, 2021). After securing 17.5
percent of the votes in 2015, the PS joined the conservative right-wing government (Herkman
& Jungar, 2021). However, following the election of the more radical Jussi Halla-Aho as the
Finns Party’s chair in 2017, a faction of the Finns Party, consisting of 19 of the party’s 38
elected members of parliament, decided to break off and launch their own party, the Blue
Reform, (SPT/Sundberg, 2018). The more moderately conservative Blue Reform stayed in the
governing coalition while the PS became part of the opposition, as the other two governing
parties deemed it impossible to collaborate with the latter under its new leadership, mainly
due to harboring different values (Johnson, 2017). The Blue Reform secured no parliamentary
seats in the 2019 general election, while the PS retained its electoral support and became the
second largest party (Bäck, 2019). The PS, with its more nativist façade, has therefore
continued to attain electoral support.
The Nordic PRR parties have also converged ideologically across national borders (Jungar &
Jupskås, 2014), particularly in terms of their nativist approaches. The FrP and the
predecessors to the DF and the PS began to adopt anti-immigration policies as an important
part of their agenda during the third wave of Nordic populist movements in the late 1980s,
contemporaneously as the SD was established (Herkman & Jungar, 2021). Jungar (2017) calls
this wave “new populism.” The FrP’s popularity increased as they started promoting antiimmigration approaches in the 1980s, as did the DF after it was established as an antiimmigration and Eurosceptic party in 1995 (Jungar, 2017). Regarding the SD, nationalism has
been its main ideological pillar from the beginning, with anti-immigration being the party’s
most salient issue, even though social conservatism was added as a second ideological pillar
in the party program of 2011 (Herkman & Jungar, 2021). The PS, on the contrary, was more
of an agrarian anti-elitist party throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, but the anti-immigration
issue became salient for the party after a vocal anti-immigration wing joined the party in 2007
(Askola, 2019). Not until then, and operating under that agenda, did the party begin gaining
electoral popularity (Herkman & Jungar, 2021). Halla-Aho, whose rise as the leader of the PS
in 2017 directly resulted in the party’s splitting, is considered more radical along nativist
ideology and a far greater opponent to immigration than his predecessor Soini (Stenberg,
2019).
23

Anna Lillkung
The FrP, the DF, the SD, and the PS can be categorized as belonging to the same party family.
In their party family conceptualization, Jungar and Jupskås (2014) have not only examined
ideology, but also transnational linkages and party names. They conclude that these parties
adhere to a distinct set of political ideologies that are typical of the populist radical right,
including nationalism, conservatism, and authoritarianism, with “immigration and law-andorder issues” being the “primary focus of all four parties” (Jungar & Jupskås, 2014, p. 222).
These arguments agree with Mudde’s triadic conceptualization of the populist radical right.
The FrP, which considers itself economically liberal, nonetheless diverges from the other
three parties, which support “shared public commitments to welfare” (Jungar & Jupskås,
2014, p. 221–222). Considering the parties’ placement in the two-dimensional space, between
the socioeconomic left and right and the authoritarians and liberals, Jungar and Jupskås (2014,
p. 224) state that “three of the four parties combine a centrist position on the socioeconomic
dimension with an authoritarian position on the liberal-authoritarian continuum. However, the
FrP is economically more liberal and slightly less authoritarian.” For the FrP, economic issues
also substantially outweigh social and moral policies (Jungar & Jupskås, 2014).
These three parties are also “part of the broader PRR party family in Western Europe” (Jungar
and Jupskås, 2014, p. 216). The DF, the PS and the SD have thus in particular “converged
ideologically, adopted similar names, and are on the verge of becoming a more formalized
transnational actor” (Jungar & Jupskås, 2014, p. 216). However, the FrP does not fit in as well
in the PRR party family, as it is less authoritarian and more economically right-wing
compared to the other Nordic PRR parties, though equally anti-establishment and antiimmigration (Jungar & Jupskås, 2014). Contrary to Mudde (2007), Jungar and Jupskås (2014,
p. 232–233) do not consider the FrP to be a neoliberal populist party, especially since the
party “does share several policy traits with the other PRR parties – most notably its strong
anti-immigration and populist profile.” Jungar and Jupskås (2014, p.232–233) rather consider
the FrP a “hybrid between a populist radical right party and a more traditional conservative
party,” but one that “might be included as the Norwegian ‘functional equivalent’ of PRR
parties elsewhere.” Since the FrP has been categorized as PRR party in several other studies
(e.g., Heinze, 2019; Herkman & Jungar, 2021), it is categorized as a PRR party in this thesis
as well.
Jungar and Jupskås’ article was published in 2014, prior to the splitting of the PS in 2017. The
categorization of the PS in their study can therefore be questioned, as it is not based on an

24

Anna Lillkung
analysis of the current ideology and status of the party. This thesis nevertheless categorizes
the PS as a PRR party. This categorization is based on the conclusions in a recent master’s
thesis by Carpelan (2020), which argues that the PS, under party leader Halla-Aho, belongs to
the PRR party family. The Blue Reform party, however, is excluded from this thesis as its
categorization is more uncertain, in addition to the party not having been electorally
significant since its establishment as it secured no parliamentary seats in the 2019 election.
Having a clear conceptualization and categorization of the populist radical right, attention is
now turned to the first aim of this thesis, i.e., the research overview regarding gender and the
populist radical right.

III. Research overview: Gender and the populist
radical right
While the populist radical right has been the subject of a significant amount of research in the
past decades, its gender dimension has not been the subject of similar scholarly interest
(Doná, 2020; Mudde, 2007). Scholarship on Western Europe’s populist radical right identified
a gender gap early on (Allen & Goodman, 2020). However, the gender in populism and the
populist radical right has only recently been properly highlighted, with two publications: a
special issue of Patterns of Prejudice (edited by Spierings, Zaslove, Mügge, & de Lange,
2015) and the Symposium of West European Politics (Erzeel & Rashkova, 2017) titled
‘Gender and the Radical Right in Comparative Perspective’, as well as the book Gender and
Far Right Politics in Europe (edited by Köttig, Bitzan, & Petö, 2017), examining the gender
dimension specifically. These publications, in addition to individual studies, have started to
fill the research gap, but many scholars studying gender and the PRR parties continue to
demonstrate the need for more research in this field.
This chapter details what previous scholarly work has concluded regarding gender and the
populist radical right. Previous literature tends to examine three main strands of research.
Several scholars focus on the demand-side, i.e., on the gender gap among the electorate of the
populist radical right (e.g., Coffé, 2018; Harteveld et al., 2015; Spierings & Zaslove, 2017).
These studies have attempted to find explanations for the existing gender gap in voting, i.e.,
for why more men than women vote for the populist radical right. Other scholars have instead
focused on the supply-side, i.e., on the gender gap in the PRR parties themselves. These
studies can be further separated into two groups: studies on the supply-side focusing on the
gendered nature of the ideology, discourses, and policies of the PRR parties, and studies on
the supply-side concentrating on gender-representation in these parties, i.e., on how many
men versus women that are members, elected representatives, and/or leaders of the PRR
parties, and whether activities, actions, and positions within the party are different for male
and female members. Whereas the gendered nature of the ideology, discourses, and policies
of the populist parties has been the subject of many studies (e.g., de Lange & Mügge, 2015;
Ralph-Maddow, 2020; Rashkova & Zankina, 2017), studies focusing on gender representation
in the populist radical right-wing parties appear to be fewer, albeit existing (e.g., Högström,
2019; Luhtakallio & Ylä-Anttila, 2017; Mudde, 2007; Mulinari & Neergaard, 2017). This

26

chapter discusses these three strands of research in greater detail and ends with a discussion
on the limitations of the previous studies and with suggestions for future research.

1. The demand-side: The gender-electorate gap
Several studies have concluded that a gender gap exists in the electorate of the PRR parties.
Women vote for these parties to a significantly lesser extent than men (e.g., Coffé, 2018;
Harteveld et al. 2015; Immerzeel, Coffé, & van der Lippe, 2015; Mudde, 2007). Harteveld et
al. (2015) have shown that the average percentage of male PRR voters was 9 percent while it
was 6 percent among female voters. Another study found the gap to be a total of 4.3 percent,
with 11.1 percent of men and 6.8 percent of women voting for PRR parties (Immerzeel,
Coffé, & van der Lippe, 2015). This kind of difference in electorate support from men and
women has led to the populist radical right parties being called Männerparteien (“men’s
parties”) (Mudde, 2007).
However, there appears to be considerable variation in the gender-electorate gap when
comparing countries. The Norwegian Progress Party’s gender-electorate gap was concluded to
be 13.3 percentage points (27.9 % of male vs 14.6 % of female voters voting for FrP), while
the neighboring Danish People’s Party’s gap was only 2.9 points (10.4 % of male vs 7.5 % of
female voters voting for the DF) (Immerzeel, Coffé, & van der Lippe, 2015). According to
Spierings and Zaslove (2015), the gender gap in the PRR electorate may also be decreasing,
or even disappearing, as these parties become more entrenched in the existing party systems
and gain more support among women. They add that although a gender gap exists as more
men than women vote for the PRR parties, also in relative terms when compared to the
electorate of other parties, the difference is not great enough to warrant the label
Männerparteien.
Whereas scholars agree that the gender gap among the PRR electorate exists, there has been
less consensus as to why it exists. Studies investigating this aspect of the demand-side have
been unable to answer this question compellingly or similarly, but rather only concluded
which factors do not explain this gender gap (e.g., Harteveld et al., 2015; Mudde, 2007;
Spierings & Zaslove, 2015) The view that women support these parties less than men due to
fewer women than men holding populist radical right views was the conventional view within
feminist circles until well into the 1990s. This view asserted that women had a certain
resistance towards radical right ideology (Mudde, 2007). However, empirical studies have
disproved this view by showing that women and men are equally likely to hold PRR attitudes
27

Anna Lillkung
(Mudde, 2007). Spierings and Zaslove (2017) state that there have been two main
explanations as to why women are not attracted to the populist radical right as much as men:
(1) due to socio-economic position, i.e., that women are more likely to be employed in the
public sector instead of in labor-intensive jobs and thus less likely to be threatened by
deindustrialization, and (2) due to different attitudes, most notably anti-immigration and law
and order-attitudes. However, these approaches cannot fully account for the gender gap
(Spierings & Zaslove, 2017). Immerzeel, Coffé, and van der Lippe (2015) similarly conclude
that even though men are generally more nativist and more politically interested and active
than women, political attitudes (in this case, nativist and authoritarian attitudes, political
interest, and action) cannot explain the gender gap. Previous studies have suggested two other
explanations: (1) that women’s greater involvement in church makes them less likely to vote
for the PRR, and (2) that women are deterred by the antifeminist ideology of these parties
(Coffé, 2018). However, these explanations have been unable to account for the gender gap
(Coffé, 2018). The paradox thus seems to be that even when women are as nativist,
authoritarian, and populist as men, they vote for the PRR parties to a lesser extent.
Mudde (2007) argues that the significantly lower level of political efficacy among women can
account for much of the disproportionate representation of women and men in PRR parties
and their electorate. As there (assumingly) is a lower level of political interest or belief in the
ability to affect politics among women, women vote for more established parties rather than
for new ones (Mudde, 2007). Mudde adds that the extremist image of PRR parties, rather than
their conservative stances on gender issues, might keep women from voting for them. Mudde
(2007, p. 16) claims that:
“This interpretation is consistent with both the low-efficacy argumentation of the
delayed effect theory and empirical attitudinal research, which shows that men
and women hold fairly similar views on all aspects of the populist radical right
except extremism and violence, which are rejected far more by women than by
men...”
Immerzeel, Coffé, and van der Lippe (2015) found no support for the political efficacy theory,
as the gender gap in voting was not affected by the PRR parties’ status as outsiders or by their
populist discourse style. The gender gap also remained in countries where PRR parties had
become more mainstream. However, other studies have reached a similar conclusion as
Mudde, i.e., that other factors than ideological ones appear to affect why fewer women than
men vote for PRR parties. Harteveld et al. (2015, p. 122–123) suggest that women and men to
28

Anna Lillkung
a great extent have the same attitudes and ideology regarding nativism, authoritarianism, and
populism, but that the gender gap in PRR voting originates “partially in sex differences in the
perceived distance between their own ideological position and that of PRR parties.”
Regardless of their ideology, PRR parties appear to be especially remote to female voters and
women tend to find the issues related to the PRR ideology less salient than men (Harteveld et
al., 2015). The same study concludes that women employ different considerations when
deciding on their party preferences. Ideological indicators are therefore better predictors
concerning men’s propensity to vote for PRR parties than they are for women.
Spierings and Zaslove (2015) similarly conclude that men and women vote for the PRR
parties for the same (ideological) reason, i.e., because of their opposition to immigration.
They found no consistent cross-country patterns regarding sex, i.e., differences between men
and women, similarly to the study by Immerzeel, Coffé, and van der Lippe (2015) which
concluded that considerable cross-country variations exist concerning the gender gap in
voting. The latter study also deduced that socio-economic characteristics, political interest,
nativism, and authoritarianism were not sufficient for understanding the gender-electorate
gap, albeit stating that structural characteristics, namely employment status, occupational
type, and education, partly explain the gap. Spierings and Zaslove (2015) confirm this
analysis regarding nativism and authoritarianism, but add that other ideological differences,
e.g., attitudes towards gender equality, cannot explain the gender gap.
The main consensus among scholars focusing on the demand-side is therefore that the gender
gap in voting cannot be compellingly explained by differences in socioeconomic positions or
in political attitudes between men and women. Women do not vote for the PRR parties even
when they share the same attitudes as men who vote for these parties (e.g., Harteveld et al.,
2015; Spierings & Zaslove, 2015; Mudde, 2007). The reasons for this remain unclear.
Whereas Harteveld et al. (2015) found that gender differences in occupational position
explain part of the gender gap, i.e., that the large share of public sector workers among
women explain why some of them are less likely to vote for PRR parties, the greater
conclusion was that neither values nor level of discontent predict women’s propensity to vote
as they do for men. While men and women similarly agree with PRR parties on their
programmatic core, women are less likely to attach high salience to these topics. Additionally,
Harteveld et al. (2015, p. 129) suggest that women are more strongly deterred than men by
other characteristics shared by PRR parties, e.g., their “political style, occasional association
with historic violence, stigmatization by parts of the elite and the general public, or
29

Anna Lillkung
ideological issues not studied here.” Mudde in turn argues that the gender gap can be
explained by differences in political efficacy between women and men, while Spierings and
Zaslove’s study (2015) offers less of an explanation to the gender gap and rather conclude that
the masculinity of the populist radical right may be exaggerated.
More research therefore needs to be conducted to pinpoint the actual reasons for women’s
lower support for the PRR parties. Such research may fare better if it focuses on the issues
that women generally do find salient and that are predictors of which parties they vote for,
rather than concentrating on why women do not vote for PRR parties. Future research could
also examine the political efficacy theory, specifically investigating why women are more
likely than men to only vote for established parties and investigate how and at what point a
party becomes “established” or “mainstream”. Lastly, future research could investigate
whether the PRR parties seem more alienated to women due to the overrepresentation of men
in the parties themselves.

2. The supply-side: The gendered nature of PRR ideology,
discourses, and policies
Several studies have examined the supply-side of the PRR parties by focusing on the role
gender plays in the ideologies, discourses, and agendas of these parties (e.g., Akkerman,
2015; De Lange & Mügge, 2015). This strand of research investigates the role of family
policies and approaches to women’s and sexual minorities’ rights in the PRR parties’ politics.
According to Doná (2020), this strand has gained salience in recent years as several PRR
parties in European countries have attained positions of power, thereby being able to
influence policymaking. Scholars have in turn been able to empirically research the gender
aspect of the parties’ ideologies. Some studies within this strand also investigate the ways in
which the PRR parties use the notion of gender equality in an instrumental way. Doná (2020,
p. 288) states that the PRR parties adapt their position on gender equality “according to the
national context and to the construct of ‘others’ based on the ‘us versus them’ dichotomy
typical of populism.” These parties can therefore display contradictory positions on gender
equality. Whereas they can be conservative with respect to family policies and the rights of
women (e.g., be against gender quotas), they can be supportive of gender equality and argue
that gender equality is essential when attempting to contest for example Muslim immigration
(e.g., by claiming that Muslims are essentially anti-feminist and against gender equality).

30

Anna Lillkung
Mudde (2007, p. 91) argues that a lot of the research conducted on the role of women in the
populist radical right is flawed due to what he calls a “feminist bias.” He claims that the main
assertions in this subject are based on two faulty assumptions: “(1) gender equality is the
normal situation in party politics; and (2) all women hold modern (or even feminist) views on
gender roles…” (Mudde, 2007, p. 91). Authors have consequently not provided empirical
evidence of the populist radical right’s sexism (Mudde, 2007). Mudde adds that the
stereotypical view on gender relations within this party family is not supported by (the few)
content analyses of the ideologies of PRR parties. These rather show that no consistent view
on family and gender within this party family exists, as the PRR parties have diverging views
on issues such as gender quotas, abortion, and divorce. Mudde’s main argument is therefore
that gender relations are secondary to the populist radical right and thus instrumentalized in
conflicting ways in the nativist struggle, which, in contrast, is central to these parties.
Mudde (2007, p. 92) nonetheless presents some consistencies in the PRR gender ideology,
namely that (1) women politics is equated with family politics, (2) there is a strong defense of
the “natural differences” between the sexes, and (3) since women are the only sex that can
give birth and because offspring is vital to the nation, women must be “protected”. Mudde
(2007, p. 93) also presents two different views on women in the populist radical right: the
“traditional” view, in which women are seen exclusively as mothers, and a “modern
traditional” view, in which it is accepted that women have a career, even though they are
preferred as housewives. He states that most PRR parties have a modern traditional view. De
Lange and Mügge (2015, p. 71) present three different views: a “modern” view, a “moderntraditional” view and a “neo-traditional” view. They thereby add the “modern” view, stating
that some PRR parties do not fit Mudde’s distinction as they “support equal pay and the
labour market participation of women without espousing neo-traditional views on the family
or gender issues.” De Lange and Mügge (2015) also argue that the scholarship on gender and
PRR parties underestimates the variation in gender ideologies across parties, thus echoing
Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser’s (2015) argument that the relationship between populism and
gender politics is highly dependent of cultural context and on other ideological elements to
which populism is attached.
The few studies that have focused on gender ideology and the PRR parties have nevertheless
characterized these parties as conservative with respect to family values and traditional gender
roles, according to Akkerman (2015). These parties generally promote the family as a core
institution of society, supports the traditional role of women within the family, and oppose
31

Anna Lillkung
same-sex marriage and abortion, though differences between the parties exist (Akkerman,
2015). When comparing the views and positions of the six most successful PRR parties in
Europe with respect to gender issues, Akkerman (2015) concludes that in the domain of
family relations, the PRR parties tend to have a conservative or a more flexible modern
conservative position. This conservatism on family-related issues sets the PRR parties apart
from the mainstream right-wing parties. However, gender issues in the traditional policy
domain have become less salient to the PRR parties over time (Akkerman, 2015).
Additionally, while gender issues have gained importance to these parties in the domain of
immigration policies, making the radical-right appear more liberal due to its positive
commitment to gender equality or gay rights, this is only highly instrumental to their antiIslam agenda, as opposed to the parties becoming more liberal at their core.
Additionally, Erzeel and Rashkova (2017, p. 815) argue that the PRR parties have changed
their appeal in relation to gender issues since their origin in the 1980s, following a
“standardization” strategy. While still focusing on issues traditional for their party family, the
radical right parties’ electoral success and participation in government have sometimes made
the parties gear more towards the center and more towards the adoption of or compromise on
certain issues, such as the gender equality discourse (Erzeel & Rashkova, 2017). Erzeel and
Rashkova (2017, p. 815) state:
“Considering that radical right parties have to compete within the institutional and
social framework of the country, just like any other party, it is likely to expect that
after their initial entry into the political market, they ‘soften’ their radical rhetoric
and try to appear as a more standard competitor in the party system.”
Pettersson (2017) also states that the Swedish and Finnish female PRR politicians’ discourse
regarding gender is highly ambivalent. The discursive tension lies between viewing gender
equality as a national trait in Finland and Sweden, and the patriarchal politics in the PRR
parties. Moreover, Pettersson (2017) argues that the national context affects how the female
PRR politicians talk about gender equality. In Sweden, where the SD women had to negotiate
their views against a strong feminist movement, the women seemed to develop more nuanced
stances on gender equality, feminism, and sexual minority rights. In Finland, a country that
lacks a similarly strong feminist movement, the women in the PS were more blatant and
straightforward in their opposition to feminism (Pettersson, 2017).

32

Anna Lillkung
In addition to the cross-national and comparative scholarship focusing on the gendered nature
of the ideology, discourses, and policies of the populist radical right, a few studies are singlecountry case studies (e.g., Bitzan, 2017; Norocel, 2013; Ralph-Maddow, 2020; Rashkova &
Zankina, 2017). Most scholarly work concentrating on the Nordic countries is found in this
group of articles. These studies have different aims and scopes. Norocel (2013) and Mulinari
and Neergaard (2017) examine the discourses and identities that are central to the Sweden
Democrats, albeit in different ways. Norocel (2013, p. 4) investigates the discursive
redefinitions of the folkhem conceptual metaphor by the SD, which in turn “accommodates
centrally located heteronormative masculinities at the intersection of gender, class, and race.”
Mulinari and Neergaard (2017) have in turn interviewed women and analyzed the SD’s key
policy documents to reveal the centrality of antiracist and postcolonial feminist scholarship
for understanding the populist radical right, in addition to exploring how women active in the
SD name and act upon their identities as members of a (by many regarded) racist party.
Luhtakallio and Ylä-Anttila (2017) similarly scrutinize the gender aspect in the ideology,
discourse, and policies of the Finns Party. Other articles have investigated the role of antiegalitarianism in the populist radical right (Klammer & Goetz, 2017), the role of masculinity
in German PRR parties (Bitzan, 2017) and British PRR parties (Ralph-Maddow, 2020), and
possible changes in gender ideology in the National Rally in France (Scrinzi, 2017).
Lastly, whereas most of the articles mentioned above support the view that European PRR
parties are conservative regarding gender issues, Rashkova and Zankina (2017) state that in
Bulgaria, the radical right members of parliament have been the most active on women’s
issues, both compared to female members of parliament from other parties and to male
members of parliament from inside and outside the radical right. However, the authors explain
this by pointing to the unique ideology of East European radical right parties which
emphasizes welfare chauvinism and socialist nostalgia, which in turn makes the parties more
concerned with social policy and therefore also women’s issues.
A significant amount of literature has focused on the gendered nature of the populist radical
right with respect to ideology, discourses, and policies, especially in recent years. While the
PRR parties approach gender ideology in somewhat similar ways, mainly by holding
conservative views on family politics and gender issues, these parties nevertheless handle
issues related to gender equality differently. Another trend in several European countries is
the tendency of PRR parties to instrumentalize gender equality in ways they see fit, e.g.,
utilizing the principle of gender equality when arguing against immigration, particularly
33

Anna Lillkung
Muslim immigration. Lastly, while this strand of research has received notable scholarly
attention, most of it has been single-country case studies rather than comparative studies.
Future research in this area could benefit from being more comparative and thus investigating
the gendered nature of the populist radical right as a party family. More scholarship
examining the role of masculinity could also bring insights into this area of research.

3. The supply-side: The gender-representation gap in the PRR
parties
The third strand of research within the scholarship on gender and the populist radical right
focuses on the supply of female representation in the PRR parties themselves. This strand
examines gender in relation to the members, elected representatives, listed candidates, and
leaders of the PRR parties. Mudde (2007, p. 97) states that: “One of the least studied subfields
of the populist radical right is party membership in general, and the role of women therein in
particular.” A few studies have nevertheless expored the gender-representation gap. Some
studies have specifically observed the descriptive representation of women in the PRR parties
(e.g., Erzeel & Rashkova, 2017; Högström, 2019; Luhtakallio & Ylä-Anttila, 2017; Mudde,
2007). Others, albeit not many, have investigated the role of female PRR leaders, e.g., Marine
Le Pen and Pia Kjærsgaard (e.g., Dubslaff, 2017; Meret, 2015). To this author’s knowledge,
only a handful of studies have investigated the reasons for the gender-representation gap in
the PRR parties (e.g., Blee, 2017; Mulinari & Neergaard, 2017).
Mudde (2007) argues that while the underrepresentation of women among the PRR parties’
members of parliament is large compared to the percentage of women in the population, this
underrepresentation is not significantly greater than in other parties, especially compared to
conservative right-wing parties. Mudde (2007) also states that while only a few women have
been the leaders of PRR parties, this number is not notably lower compared to other party
families. Regarding membership in the PRR parties, Mudde points to a lack of reliable data,
but nevertheless concludes that based on the existing data, women constitute only a small
minority of the membership of these parties. Mudde (2007) adds that one striking
phenomenon of the PRR party family is the large number of female leaders and elected
representatives that are related to or relatives of male leaders and male members of the party.
However, no recent research appears to have examined this claim.
A few other studies have observed the gender-representation gap in the PRR parties and
shown that such a gap exists, for example in Bulgaria (Rashkova & Zankina, 2017), Finland
34

Anna Lillkung
(Luhtakallio & Ylä-Anttila, 2017), and Sweden (Högström, 2019; Mulinari & Neergaard,
2017). Additional studies have observed women’s descriptive representation more generally
in European politics and included variables to analyze how this representation varies across
parties (e.g., Sundström & Stockemer, 2015 and 2021). Some of these studies have found that
left parties are more likely to send women to parliament and nominate and elect women for
parliamentary positions (e.g., Caul, 1999; Matland & Studlar, 1996; Sundström & Stockemer,
2015). Moreover, Sundström and Stockemer (2021, p. 11) conclude that considerable
differences in women’s representation are “most visible between leftist, green and liberal
parties, on the one hand, and rightist, conservative, and populist rightist parties on the other.”
This confirms “the notion that a traditional conservative ideology still limits women’s access
to the public sphere” (Sundström & Stockemer, 2021, p. 11). The PRR parties have thus been
shown to have a lower descriptive representation of women.
Since Mudde’s book was published in 2007, several PRR parties have gained power in
Europe, with some parties also becoming part of government coalitions. Högström (2019)
therefore investigated whether a so-called contagion effect could be observed regarding the
gender-representation gap in PRR parties, focusing on the case of Sweden and the Sweden
Democrats. Matland and Studlar (1996) describe the contagion effect as a process where the
decisions and actions of one party leads to other parties adopting similar strategies or policies.
Thus, if one party starts to nominate and elect more women, other parties feel pressured to do
the same to not lose electoral support. Högström (2019) outlines the theoretical grounds of a
reformulated contagion theory, i.e., that newer parties, like radical right parties, with a lower
level of female representation, experience a contagion effect from established parties that
already have a high level of female representation. As radical right parties like the SD are vote
seekers, seeking to maximize their electoral support, they recruit female candidates to attract a
broader range of voters. Parties need to do so to better compete with other parties that have a
high level of female representation. Högström (2019) tested the reformulated contagion
theory in Sweden, which generally has a small gender-representation gap, with women
holding 46.3 percent of the parliamentary seats and 52.2 percent of the cabinet seats.
Högström’s (2019) results supported the contagion thesis, as the SD’s gender-representation
gap significantly decreased over time on the local level. The SD nevertheless still had a large
gender-representation gap compared to other Swedish parties. However, the results indicated
that PRR parties like the SD adapt to the other parties’ level of female representation, to
maximize votes.
35

Anna Lillkung
Some studies have additionally investigated why a gender-representation gap exists, or at least
touched upon this question (e.g., Blee, 2017; Luhtakallio & Ylä-Anttila, 2017; Mulinari &
Neergaard, 2017). Mulinari and Neergaard (2017, p. 22) argue that while marginalization is
an important concept for understanding women’s participation in the SD, it is insufficient to
explain the participation of women in racist parties, adding that “women’s investment in racist
selves is located within an historical continuity of European colonialism in general, and the
Swedish racialization regime in particular.” Luhtakallio and Ylä-Anttila (2017) did not
investigate the women’s reasons for joining the Finns Party in the same direct way as
Mulinari and Neergaard. However, they examined whether male and female members of the
PS have similar opinions on politics, revealing that the PS women had more left-wing views
than the PS men. Their study provided no explanations regarding motivations for joining a
PRR party but gave more insight into the gendered nature of PRR representation. Lastly, Blee
(2017) has investigated the similarities and differences between gender and the far-right in
Europe and the USA, focusing on the supply-side/representation.
Besides observing the pure numerical part of the gender-representation gap, i.e., the
proportion of male versus female members, representatives, and leaders, as well as
investigating the reasons for this gender gap, some studies have concentrated on the role of
female leaders in the populist radical right. These studies have focused on the effect Marine
Le Pen has had on mobilizing female voters (Dubslaff, 2017) and on the role gender plays in
relation to style, discourse, and rhetoric in the case of Pia Kjærsgaard, founder of the Danish
People’s Party (Meret, 2015). However, Meret (2015) states that only a small number of
studies have explored the issue of charismatic PRR leadership from a gender perspective.
In summary, studies focusing on the supply-side of gender in the PRR parties usually examine
the proportion of male versus female members and elected representatives in PRR parties.
While several studies have examined this gender-representation gap, few of them observe and
compare gender-representation gaps cross-nationally or longitudinally. Apart from Mulinari
and Neergaard (2017), no recent study has investigated why women join PRR parties.
Moreover, Mudde (2007) has stated that a striking number of female PRR politicians are
related to or in a relationship with male members of the party, but no recent study appears to
have investigated this aspect or its accuracy. Additionally, while male populist leaders have
been the subject of a lot of research, female populist leaders have not (except for Marine Le
Pen). Lastly, to this author’s knowledge, only Högström (2019) has examined the contagion

36

Anna Lillkung
effect on the gender-representation gap of the PRR parties. Future research could thus
investigate the contagion theory with respect to this party family.

4. Summary and discussion
The first aim of this thesis was to provide a detailed research overview on gender and the
populist radical right. This overview has shown that despite a growing amount of academic
literature focusing on this subject area, many questions remain unanswered. While several
studies have attempted to explain the gender-electorate gap by showing that both political
efficacy and differences between the political issues that men and women find salient affect
PRR voting, how these factors account for the gender gap remains unclear. Additionally,
while many scholars have examined the gendered nature of the PRR parties’ ideology and
policies, they have done so in diverging ways. Most studies constitute single-country case
studies rather than comparative studies. Whereas many of these studies examine policies
related family politics and women politics, only a few of them explore the role of masculinity
and discourse in the PRR parties.
The least studied area concerning gender and the populist radical right is the genderrepresentation gap. The few studies found in this subarea have also focused on different
aspects, ranging from investigating gender and the charismatic leader to observing how many
members of the PRR parties that are male versus female. These studies have also not observed
changes in the gender-representation gap over time, and few of them are cross-national. Only
a handful of articles have investigated why men and women join the PRR parties as members
and candidates, and how these reasons might diverge depending on gender. There is generally
little insight in how female members or elected representatives in the populist radical right
view their own activism and political role within the party, or on an even more basic level
than that, who these women are and why they have become active members of the populist
radical right.
In sum, several research gaps regarding gender and the PRR party family still exist.
Concerning the demand-side and the gender-electorate gap, future research could investigate
the political efficacy theory, as laid out by Mudde (2007), to examine if the theory is
applicable today when several European PRR parties have gained popularity and support.
Such scholarly work could thereby establish if more women vote for these parties as they
become more mainstream. Research focusing on this strand could potentially benefit from
specifically investigating what makes women vote for a certain party, including for PRR
37

Anna Lillkung
parties, rather than concentrating on why women do not vote for the populist radical right,
which previous scholarly work has done. Such research could elucidate the ideologies and
issues that women find salient, as well as the political styles and rhetoric that attract female
voters.
Concerning the supply side and the gendered nature of the PRR ideology, discourses and
policies, future research could investigate the gendered nature of the populist radical right as a
party family. Research in this area could benefit from being more comparative, nationally and
cross-nationally, to better exhibit to what extent the PRR parties’ gender ideology varies
across nations and regions and to identify similarities in gender ideology within this party
family. Research within this area should also continue examining how PRR parties
instrumentalize gender. More scholarship examining the role of masculinity could
additionally add other layers of insight to this body of research.
The least studied area is the gender-representation gap in the PRR parties. More research
investigating the proportion of male versus female members, listed candidates, elected
members of parliament, and members of the highest party organs in the PRR parties should
thus be conducted. Future research in this area could be more quantitative and examine
general patterns in gender representation of the populist radical right. Such studies should be
comparative, both nationally and cross-nationally, to establish how the gender representation
in PRR parties compares to other parties in the same country as well as to PRR parties in
other countries. Research in this area should also investigate changes over time to investigate
the contagion thesis (see Högström, 2019), especially as PRR parties are becoming more
mainstream in Europe. More qualitative research examining the gender-representation gap is
also needed, i.e., studies that investigate what attracts women and men respectively to join
PRR parties as members and candidates, and how PRR parties recruit men and women. The
next chapter therefore contributes to filling the research gap regarding research on genderrepresentation gaps in PRR parties.

IV. The gender-representation gap in the Nordic
PRR parties: An empirical study
The research overview showed that PRR parties have an overrepresentation of men (e.g.,
Högström, 2017; Mudde, 2007; Sundström & Stockemer, 2015). Generally, more men than
women are active as members or elected representatives in these parties. This is nevertheless
an understudied area, as shown in the previous chapter. Moreover, most studies investigating
the PRR parties’ gender-representation gap have only investigated it in a single country and
not compared the gender gap in parties across countries or observed changes over time.
Mudde (2007) has claimed that the gender-representation gap in the PRR parties is larger than
in left-wing parties, but not significantly larger than in other conservative right-wing parties.
He has also stated that there is a lack of reliable data regarding female membership and the
importance of women internally in PRR parties. The question therefore remains: How big is
the gender-representation gap in the populist radical right, if one exists compared to other
parties and cross-nationally? And has the gender-representation gap in the PRR parties closed
over time as the parties have become mainstream and increased their electoral support, as
suggested by Högström’s (2019) study on the SD? The second part of the thesis, the empirical
study, aims to contribute to the scholarship in this area by empirically investigating the
gender-representation gap in the Nordic PRR parties and how this gap has changed over time.
The empirical study firstly examines whether an overrepresentation of men in the Nordic PRR
parties exists, and if so, how this overrepresentation compares to the gender balance in other
main parties, primarily compared to the conservative parties and social democratic parties.
Sundström and Stockemer (2015) found that when PRR parties had electoral success in
municipal elections, the overall level of female representation in local councils decreased.
This study thus also examines how the gender gaps in the PRR parties affect the national
gender gap averages in the Nordic countries. Additionally, Högström (2019) has shown that
the gender-representation gap in the SD decreased as the party became more established and
mainstream. He thus argues that a contagion effect has occurred, with the SD strategically
increasing its level of female representation to approach the higher level of female
representation in more established parties, with the purpose of increasing electorate support.
This study therefore investigates if a contagion effect has occurred in the Nordic PRR parties.

This chapter is divided into a number of subchapters that present the research questions,
research design, methodology, and results.

1. Research questions
The Nordic countries have a high level of female representation in parliamentary politics and
are considered to have come far in the strive for gender equality (e.g., Niskanen, 2009;
OECD, 2018). The Nordic countries are therefore appropriate to study the PRR genderrepresentation gap in and arguably constitute a so-called critical case, as women generally
have a high level of representation in Nordic politics. Considering the overall high level of
gender equality in this region, as well as the reported lower level of female representation in
the populist radical right, the first research question (RQ1) investigated in this thesis is to
what extent a gender-representation gap exists in the Nordic PRR parties in the Nordic
countries and to what extent this gender gap is alike in these nations. The research overview
showed that few studies have observed the gender-representation gap in the PRR party family
from a comparative perspective. The thesis thus contributes to the scholarship by comparing
the female representation in the PRR parties in several countries. To this author’s knowledge,
no study has compared the gender gap in the Nordic PRR parties. This study thus contributes
by investigating the Nordic region specifically.
The expected result regarding the first research question is that, in accordance with
conclusions in previous studies (e.g., Högström, 2019; Mudde, 2007; Mulinari & Neergaard,
2017), the Nordic PRR parties on average have a gender gap that is larger than 10 percentage
points in most of the political arenas examined (i.e., internal, electoral, and parliamentary
arenas). Thus, if the gender balance is considered equal when the female percentage is
between 40–60 percent in the different political arenas (see Dahlerup, 1988; Niskanen, 2009),
the PRR parties are not gender equal. They are expected to have a significant genderrepresentation gap, i.e., that men on average constitute more than 60 percent of these parties’
party council members, listed candidates, and elected representatives. The PRR gender gaps
are also expected to be larger than the gender gaps on average in the Nordic countries, in
accordance with Stockemer and Sundström’s (2021) conclusion that PRR parties have the
lowest level of female representation in the European parliament when compared with other
party families. These patterns are expected to generally be the same in all Nordic countries.
The second research question (RQ2) is whether the gender gap in the PRR parties is larger
than in the non-PRR parties in the Nordic countries. Mudde (2007) has claimed that while the
40

Anna Lillkung
gender-representation gaps in the PRR parties are larger compared to in left parties, they are
not significantly greater than in the mainstream conservative parties. The second research
question thus examines if Mudde’s theory is applicable in the case of the Nordic states. This
research question is answered by comparing the gender-representation gap in the PRR parties
with the gap in other electorally significant non-PRR parties in the Nordic countries, and by
paying special attention to differences in gender gaps between the PRR parties and
conservative parties, on the one hand, and between PRR parties and social democratic parties,
on the other hand.
Additionally, Högström (2019) and Sundström and Stockemer (2015) have shown that as
PRR parties become more electorally successful on the local level, the overrepresentation of
men in these parties affect the overall level of female representation negatively. The PRR
parties’ low level of female representation may therefore lead to a decrease in the descriptive
representation of women in general. Related to the second research question, the Nordic
countries’ national gender gap averages (including the PRR parties) are thus compared with
the non-PRR party national gender gap average (excluding the PRR parties). Such a
comparison demonstrates how the PRR parties’ gender-representation gaps have influenced
the national gender gap averages.
The second research question is important to investigate as the PRR party family has grown
and evolved since 2007, especially in the Nordic region where both the PS and the SD have
entered parliament. Mudde’s (2007) research is consequently not up to date. Second, by
comparing the gender gap in the PRR parties with what the gender gap in non-PRR parties in
each country, one can investigate to what extent the PRR parties’ gender gaps diverge from
the gender gaps in other parties. By also comparing the PRR gender gaps with the gender gaps
in the Nordic conservative and social democratic parties, one can furthermore deduce how the
PRR parties’ gender gaps compare to parties that are both at the right end and the left end of
the left-right political spectrum.
Three main expectations are evaluated with respect to the second research question. The first
expectation is that one can find a consistent and, relatively speaking, larger genderrepresentation gap (= more men than women) in the PRR parties than in the non-PRR
political parties in the Nordic countries. Second, the PRR parties are consequently expected to
have an increasing effect on the national gender gap average. Third, the gender-representation
gap is expected to be greater in the PRR parties than in the parties located further to the left on
the left-right spectrum (i.e., compared to the social democratic parties), but not necessarily
41

Anna Lillkung
significantly larger than in the parties belonging to the conservative right-wing party family,
in accordance with Mudde’s argument.
The third research question (RQ3) concerns how women’s descriptive representation in the
PRR parties has evolved over time and whether a contagion effect has occurred. The
contagion effect would entail that the Nordic PRR parties have strategically adapted their
level of female representation to the (higher) level of female representation in other parties, to
maximize their electoral support, in accordance with Högström’s conclusions (2019). This
research question is relevant to investigate as the PRR parties have been electorally relevant
(i.e., have had seats in the national parliament) for at least a decade in all Nordic countries
apart from Iceland. I should consequently be possible to empirically observe a contagion
effect, if one has occurred, in the Nordic PRR parties.
The expected results concerning the contagion thesis is that the PRR parties have increased
the percentage of women in their internal party organs as well as on their candidate lists in
municipal and general elections, as they have become more mainstream in their respective
Nordic country, to maximize electoral support. The concept of “becoming more mainstream”
is mainly operationalized by determining if the parties have increased their electoral support
or already have a large support base. The Norwegian and the Danish PRR parties, which are
the oldest Nordic PRR parties, can in this context be considered more mainstream generally,
even if their electoral support has not increased recently.

2. Research design, composition, and methods
The empirical study used a small-N study design, comparing data from a relatively small
number of cases, i.e., the established PRR parties in the Nordic countries. The study was
descriptive in nature; the goal was to investigate and establish the size of the genderrepresentation gap in the PRR parties compared to in other parties in the Nordic countries, and
to examine how this gap has changed longitudinally. The aim was therefore not to establish
cause-and-effect or identify specific causal factors for this gender gap. The chosen research
design, a comparative, cross-national study, was chosen as it can demonstrate to what extent
the gender-representation gap consistently exists within the PRR party family. Limiting the
study to the Nordic region was a tactical decision taken partly to limit the thesis’ scope, partly
because it is beneficial to compare PRR parties of countries and societies that are alike, and
partly because of the comparatively high level of gender equality in the Nordic countries.
PRR parties adapt their position on gender equality “according to the national context and to
42

Anna Lillkung
the construct of ‘others’ based on the ‘us versus them’ dichotomy typical of populism” (Doná,
2020, p. 288). It can thus be difficult to compare the gendered aspects of these parties in
between countries that have largely diverging views on gender and on the importance of
gender equality. The Nordic countries were therefore elected as they are relatively similar
enabling cross-national comparisons of the gender-representation gap.
The Nordic PRR parties were categorized in accordance with the conclusions in chapter II.
The four populist radical right parties in the Nordic countries were consequently:
•

the Danish People’s Party (Dansk Folkeparti – DF),

•

the Norwegian Progress Party (Fremskrittspartiet – FrP),

•

the Finns Party (Perussuomalaiset – PS), and

•

the Sweden Democrats (Sverigedemokraterna – SD).

The research design only included PRR parties that had had elected members in their
countries’ national parliaments. Parties that fit the PRR profile in terms of ideology, but that
were only active in local governments or had never secured seats in national parliaments were
consequently excluded. Moreover, the study only included PRR parties that had had elected
members of parliament for at least two of the last three mandate periods, to be able to observe
changes in the gender-representation gap over time and to assure that the parties included had
coherently and consistently demonstrated a PRR ideology, also as elected members of
parliament. The consequence of this latter decision was that some fringe parties exhibiting
PRR features were excluded. One such example was the New Right in Denmark (Nye
Borgerlige), which has exhibited PRR tendencies, mainly a harsh anti-immigration and antiIslam rhetoric, but has only secured seats in the national parliament in one election (Nissen &
Siim, 2021). Another example was the Blue Reform (Sininen Tulevaisuus), which has secured
no seats in the Finnish parliament.

2.1 Three arenas of political representation
The thesis investigated the gender-representation gap in three different arenas (see Sjöblom,
1968). The first one was the internal arena, which concerns gender representation in the
internal party structure, e.g., among members in a party, members in the party congress and
members in the party council, and in party leadership. The second one was the electoral
arena, which concerns the gender representation among the party’s political candidates in
different elections (municipal/regional/national elections). The third one was the
parliamentary

arena,

which

concerns

gender
43

representation

among

the

elected

Anna Lillkung
representatives in the national parliament and regional and municipal councils. The first and
the second research question investigated the gender-representation gap in all three arenas, at
both the local and national level, in the Nordic PRR parties. The third research question only
concerned gender gaps in the internal and electoral arenas.

2.2 RQ1: The gender-representation gap in the Nordic PRR parties
The gender-representation gap in the internal arena was investigated by observing the gender
gap in the parties’ party councils (party boards) and in the party leadership. The gender
composition among the members of the PRR parties or in the parties’ party congress was not
examined, partly to limit the scope of the study, partly because information on members of
political parties is more difficult to attain. The political parties usually have to provide data on
membership themselves and the reliability of such data can be questioned.
The gender gap in the electoral arena was investigated by observing the percentage of women
and the gender gap among the PRR parties’ listed candidates in parliamentary (national) and
municipality council (local) elections. The parliamentary arena was examined by observing
the percentage of women among elected representatives in the parliamentary and municipal
elections. The electoral and the parliamentary arenas might seem similar but are not. A party’s
political candidates are largely determined by the party itself and its members. The party’s
elected representatives, on the other hand, can to a larger extent be determined by the voters,
depending on the electoral system (closed vs. open party lists, etc.) and how many votes and
secured seats the party receives in total in an election. If the number of elected representatives
of a party is low, the gender gap among these representatives could fail to provide an accurate
picture. For example, if a party only has one elected representative, a female, the results
indicate an underrepresentation of men in the party. However, this female representative
could in fact be the only female listed candidate among 20 listed candidates in total. The
gender gap among listed candidates therefore assists in providing a more complete picture of
the overall percentage of women in various political parties, as the number of listed
candidates tends to be larger than the number of elected representatives.
Data on both the national and the local level was included to attain a more comprehensive
view of the gender-representation gap, and how it manifests itself locally as well as
nationally. However, data concerning elections to regional councils were excluded, mainly
because Finland had not had regional elections. Throughout the study, the other electorally
relevant parties in the Nordic countries served as points of comparison, i.e., the gender44

Anna Lillkung
representation gap in the PRR parties in the above-mentioned arenas was compared with the
same data for the Nordic main non-PRR parties and compared with averages for the non-PRR
parties combined. The study also examined how the gender gaps in the internal and electoral
arenas in the PRR parties had evolved over time.
As this study mostly relied on data provided by other agents, primarily by national statistics
agencies (e.g., data on the sex of listed candidates and elected representatives in previous
elections), no specific definition of “women” and “men” (or “males” and “females”) were
proposed. The operationalization of terms like “gender”, “sex”, “men”, and “women” in each
separate primary source was thus not questioned.

2.3 RQ2: PRR versus non-PRR parties’ gender-representation gaps
To answer the second research question, i.e., how the gender-representation gap in the PRR
parties compared to the gender gap in non-PRR parties, data on the gender gap in every party
that had been electorally relevant on the national level in the Nordic countries was compiled.
All parties that had secured seats in the national parliament in any one of the last three general
elections were included. However, when presenting the combined results for the internal
arena, parties that had not elected members of parliament for at least two consecutive mandate
periods were excluded. By doing so, the risk of smaller fringe parties, parties that were only
relevant locally, and/or “one hit wonder”-parties skewing the results was minimized. When
calculating gender gap averages in the internal arena, all parties’ gender gaps in party councils
and party leadership were given equal weight since it was not possible to weigh the
percentages in accordance with a party’s relevance. In the electoral and parliamentary arena,
in contrast, the national gender gap averages were based on the actual numbers of women and
men. In the latter arenas, the gender gap of a smaller party with fewer listed candidates and
elected representatives would have less weight on the total percentage than bigger and more
popular parties, compared to in the internal arena. In the final discussion of the thesis, the
analysis also concentrated on parties that had secured seats in at least two of the last three
elections, thus excluding New Right (Nye Borgerlige) in Denmark, Red (Rødt) in Norway,
and Movement Now (Liike Nyt) in Finland.

2.3.1 Categorization of non-PRR political parties
Secondary sources were used to determine which Nordic parties to include and how to
categorize these parties into different party families. These sources were mainly The
Routledge Handbook of Scandinavian Politics (Nedergaard & Wivel, 2017) and Scandinavian
45

Anna Lillkung
Politics Today (2nd edition) (Arter, 2008). The Nordic parties were thus placed into party
families in the following manner:
•

Far-left */Leftist socialists: The Red–Green Alliance (Enhedslisten – Rød-Grønne,
Denmark), Socialist Peoples’ Party (Socialistisk Folkeparti, Denmark), Left-Wing
Alliance (Vasemmistoliitto, Finland), Socialist Left Party (Sosialistisk Venstre,
Norway), and Left-Party (Vänsterpartiet, Sverige)

•

Social democratic: Danish Social Democratic Party (Socialdemokratiet, Denmark),
Finnish Social Democratic Party (Sosialidemokraattinen puolue, Finland), Social
Democrats (Socialdemokraterna, Sweden), Labour Party (Arbeiderpartiet, Norway)

•

Green: Green League (Vihreät, Finland), Green Party (Miljöpartiet, Sweden), The
Alternative (Alternativet **, Denmark), Green Party (Miljöpartiet De Grønne, Norway)

•

Agrarian/Centre: Denmark’s Liberal Party (Venstre ***, Denmark), Finnish Centre
Party, Centre Party (Senterpartiet, Norway), Centre Party (Centerpartiet, Sweden)

•

Liberal: Danish Social-Liberal Party (Radikale Venstre, Denmark), Liberal Alliance
(Liberal Alliance, Denmark), Liberals (Liberalerna, Sweden), Swedish People’s Party
(Svenska Folkpartiet, Finland), Liberal Party (Venstre, Norway)

•

Christian democrats: Christian Democrats (Kristillisdemokraatit, Finland), Christian
Democratic

Party

(Kristelig

folkeparti,

Norway),

Christian

Democrats

(Kristdemokraterna, Sverige)
•

Conservative: Conservative Party (Det Konservative Folkeparti, Denmark), National
Coalition (Kokoomus, Finland), Conservative Party (Høyre, Norway), Conservatives
(Moderaterna, Sweden).

•

Populist radical right: Progressive Party (Fremskrittspartiet, Norway), Danish
People’s Party (Dansk Folkeparti, Denmark), Finns Party (Perussuomalaiset,
Finland), Sweden Democrats (Sverigedemokraterna, Sweden).

The far-left and leftist socialists are considered separate party families in The Routledge Handbook of
Scandinavian Politics, but since the only far-left party in the Nordic countries is The Red–Green Alliance
(Denmark), they were placed in a combined group in this thesis.
**
The Danish party The Alternative was created in 2015 and in Hoff’s (2017) chapter in The Routledge
Handbook of Scandinavian Politics, he states that it can be argued that this party belongs to the green party
family. The Alternative self-identifies as “the green party of Denmark” (alternativet.dk) and is described by
several sources as a green party (e.g., Maier, 2021; Eriksen, 2015). It is thus classified here as belonging to the
green party family, even though it does not seem to fit the green party family profile as much as its counterparts
in the Nordic countries, as it is both critical of the political system and of economic growth (Maier, 2021).
***
Hansen and Kosiara-Pedersen (2017) state that Denmark’s agrarian party, the Liberal Party (Venstre), has
transformed itself into the country’s main bourgeois party, adding that it is questionable if Venstre still should be
grouped with the agrarian parties. However, Venstre is categorized as an agrarian party in this thesis.
*

46

Anna Lillkung
The parties and their politics were also placed and ordered in relation to one another, to enable
comparisons. The parties were ordered according to the traditional left-right dimension, i.e.,
“the ideological continuum of economic redistribution” where the left focuses on a strong
state providing equal opportunities for everyone through a welfare state, and the right focuses
on individual responsibility, a small state, and low taxes (Hansen & Kosiara-Pedersen, 2017,
p. 121). The left-right dimension acts as a “strong compass for Nordic voters when navigating
the Nordic party space” (Hansen & Kosiara-Pedersen, 2017, p. 121), making it suitable for
application here. For this categorization on the left-right spectrum, secondary sources were
used, mainly The Routledge Handbook of Scandinavian Politics (Nedergaard & Wivel, 2017),
in which the chapters by Hansen and Kosiara-Pedersen (2017) and Önnudóttir and Hardarson
(2017) classify the Nordic parties based on the preferences of the parties’ voters.
Considering the initial “five party model” of the Nordic countries and putting them on the
left-right spectrum, the far-left and leftist socialist parties are furthest to the left, followed by
the social democratic parties. Then there are the non-socialist parties, with the agrarian
(centre) parties, the liberal parties, and the conservative parties being placed in that order from
left to right, with the conservative parties being furthest to the right (Önnudóttir & Hardarson,
2017). The Danish agrarian party, the Liberal Party (Venstre), is the main exception as it is
placed to the right of both the Social Liberal Party (Radikale Venstre) and the Christian
Democratic party (Kristelig Folkeparti), and thus comes right before the DF and Denmark’s
Conservative Party (Det Konservative Folkeparti, DKF). The leftist socialist, the social
democratic, and the conservative parties in the Nordic countries are placed relatively similarly
on the left-right spectrum, indicating similar ideological positions (Hansen & KosiaraPedersen, 2017). The other parties display greater cross-national variation regarding their leftright spectrum placement, especially the green, the Christian democratic, and the PRR parties.
Whereas the FrP, for example, is positioned as right of center with libertarian ideals, the DF is
closer to the social democratic party regarding economy (Hansen & Kosiara-Pedersen, 2017).
The green and the Christian democratic parties generally fall somewhere in the middle of the
left-right spectrum in the Nordic countries, but display cross-national differences, with some
green parties being further to the left and others being further to the right.
Only parties belonging to the explicit Nordic conservative party family were operationalized
as “conservative parties”. Parties belonging to the Christian democratic party family, the
liberal, and the agrarian party family were consequently not considered “conservative”, even
though they are placed to the right on the political ideological spectrum. Thus, whereas all
47

Anna Lillkung
parties were used as points of comparison to the PRR parties, it was only the parties belonging
to the conservative party family that were used to answer whether the gender-representation
gap in the PRR parties was greater than in conservative parties. The Nordic conservative
parties were the following: the Danish Conservative Party (Det Konservative Folkeparti –
DKF, Denmark), National Coalition (Kokoomus – Kok, Finland), the Norwegian Conservative
Party (Høyre – H, Norway), and Conservatives (Moderaterna – M, Sweden). The genderrepresentation gap in the PRR parties were also compared with the gender gap in the Nordic
social democratic parties, to establish if the PRR parties’ gender gaps were larger than the
gender gap in parties located further to the left. The social democratic parties were the Danish
Social Democratic Party (Socialdemokratiet – A, Denmark), the Finnish Social Democratic
Party

(Sosialidemokraattinen

puolue

–

SDP,

Finland),

the

Social

Democrats

(Socialdemokraterna – S, Sweden), and the Labour Party (Arbeiderpartiet – Ap, Norway).
Since data on the gender gap was gathered for all parties, all non-PRR parties served as points
of comparison when relevant.
The gender-representation gap was thus observed in the Nordic PRR parties and compared
with the gender-representation gap in other electorally relevant non-PRR parties in the Nordic
countries (i.e., the parties listed above). The gender-representation gap was examined in all
three political arenas in these parties. Special attention was paid to parties belonging to the
conservative party family and the social democratic party family, to investigate Mudde’s
(2007) claim that the gender-representation gap is not significantly larger in the PRR parties
than in conservative parties, but more likely to exceed the gender gaps in leftist parties, e.g.,
social democratic parties.

2.4 RQ3: The contagion theory and changes in the genderrepresentation gap over time
Lastly, this study aimed to answer the third research question: Has the gender-representation
gap decreased over time as the populist radical right parties have become more mainstream
and wanted to maximize their electoral support in accordance with Högström’s (2019)
reformulated contagion theory? To examine how the gender-representation gap has changed
in the PRR parties, data on the gender gap in the internal and electoral arenas, from the last
three national and local (municipal) elections, was gathered. The parliamentary arena was
excluded since the PRR parties strategically increase the level of female representation mainly
in the electoral arena, i.e., on the candidate lists. The internal arena was also included as an
48

Anna Lillkung
increase of women in the top positions in a party could increase the symbolic representation
of women, which in turn may attract more female electoral support. Changes in the gender
composition in the party leadership and party councils, as well as among the listed candidates
of the PRR parties in the last three local and general elections, were thus observed to
determine if the PRR parties’ gender gaps have approached the gender gaps in the non-PRR
parties. The data displaying changes in the PRR parties’ gender-representation gaps over time
were compared with the same data for the Nordic non-PRR parties to examine whether the
PRR parties’ changes in level of female representation resembled changes in non-PRR parties.

2.5 Variables
The research design primarily compared gender-representational gaps for different measures
(e.g., nations and party families). The gender gap itself was calculated based on the
percentages of women versus men in the three arenas. The gender gap was calculated by
subtracting the actual percentage of women in each arena (party council, candidate lists in
municipal election, etc.) with 50 percent, as 50 percent would be the percentage of women
present if there was no gender gap. To exemplify: If the percentage of women among the
listed candidates of a party in a general election is 30 percent, 30 percent is subtracted from
50 percent. The difference constitutes the gender gap, measured in percentage points. In this
hypothetical case, the gender gap is 20 percentage points. The closer the points are to zero, the
smaller the gender gap. A gender gap of 20 percentage points indicates an overrepresentation
of men and a gender gap of –20 points indicates an overrepresentation of women.
The variable in focus regarding the first research question was the gender-representation gap
in the four Nordic PRR parties, encompassing the three political arenas. The gender gap in the
internal arena was investigated by observing the gender gap in the parties’ party councils and
party leadership in 2011–2021. The electoral arena was examined by observing the percentage
of women and the gender gap among listed candidates in the last three parliamentary and
municipal elections. The parliamentary arena was investigated by observing the percentage of
women and the gender gap among elected representatives in the last three parliamentary and
municipal elections. The PRR parties’ gender-representation gaps were thus established, and
cross-national gender gap patterns identified, in each arena in the Nordic countries. The data
was collected from the last three national and local elections to control for inconsistencies
over time by assuring that gender gap sizes and patterns were persistent.

49

Anna Lillkung
To simplify the presentation of the results, mean gender gaps were calculated for each party
and each arena, based on observations of the parties’ gender gaps in the last three municipal
and parliamentary elections, as well as of the parties’ gender gaps in the party councils and in
party leadership in the period 2011–2021. For example, if the DF had the following
empirically observed gender gaps among the party’s listed candidates in the past three
municipal elections: 20, 30, and 25 percentage points, the mean gender gap would be the sum
of the three gender gaps divided by three. The DF’s mean gender gap among listed candidates
in the municipality elections would consequently be 25 percentage points. The gender gaps in
the PRR parties were also compared with the national gender gap averages, based on the
mean gender gaps in all main parties in the Nordic countries, to establish if the PRR parties’
gender gaps were divergent.
The variable in focus concerning the second research question was also the genderrepresentation gap in political parties. Data was gathered on the gender gap in the party
councils/party leadership and among listed candidates and elected representatives for the
Nordic PRR and non-PRR parties. The aim was to conclude if and to what extent the PRR
parties had diverging gender gaps compared with the gender gaps in parties belonging to other
party families in the Nordic countries, with special focus on how the PRR gender gaps
compared to gender gaps in the conservative and the social democratic parties.
The empirical study thirdly examined the contagion thesis by observing to what extent the
PRR parties’ gender-representation gap have decreased or adapted to the gender gap in other
main non-PRR parties, as the former have become more mainstream and secured more seats
in elections. The contagion thesis entails that when PRR parties secure more seats, the total
level of female representation initially decreases, as the PRR parties have an
overrepresentation of men compared to women. However, Högström (2019) argues that the
percentage of female representation should not decrease over time, as the PRR parties will
mimic the mainstream parties by recruiting more women as listed candidates and, in turn, as
elected representatives. The variable in focus was therefore the changes in gender gaps in the
PRR parties, compared to in the non-PRR parties, in the electoral and internal arenas. Data on
the PRR parties’ share of secured seats in the last three national elections was also gathered,
simply to establish the PRR parties’ overall level of support. Electoral support on the national
level was deemed enough to draw conclusions on the parties’ general popularity. Data
showing changes in the gender-representation gap in other main political parties in the Nordic
countries (in the internal and electoral arenas) also served as a point of comparison, making it

possible to put each respective PRR party’s development in a national perspective and
comparative framework.
In the full presentation of the results in appendices A–I, the percentage of women in the
different parties as well as the actual numbers that the percentages corresponded to were
included. The numbers were included as some gender proportions may be based on small
numbers of observations. Minor changes in such gender proportions may consequently look
more dramatic than they are when only regarding percentages. For example, if a certain party
only has one or two elected representatives in parliament, the weight of the sex of each person
is heavier than in parties that have 20-30 elected representatives.
Since the study was mainly descriptive in nature and employed no multivariate models
exploring effects of different factors on gender-representation gaps (see Högström, 2019),
data on more variables were not collected. Other variables were nevertheless included as
contextual and explanatory factors in the discussion part of the thesis (chapter V). For
example, the electoral system used in each Nordic country might affect the genderrepresentation gap. Percentage thresholds that parties need to surpass to become part of the
national parliament, like Sweden, Norway, and Denmark employ, may affect the strategic
decision-making of the parties (Norris, 2005). Additionally, while every Nordic country uses
party-list proportional representation as the method through which they allocate seats in
elections, they use different proportional representation methods to allocate the seats and have
their specific regulations (e.g., open vs. closed party lists). This might affect both voter
behavior and the strategic behavior of the politicians (e.g., Kjær & Krook, 2019; Menocal,
2011). Voluntary gender quotas that political parties can employ constitute another variable
that can affect the gender-representation gap (Rosen, 2017). These are consequently variables
of interest when interpreting the results of the study.

3. Data collection and methodology
The data collected to answer the thesis’ research questions, in accordance with the research
design, was data on the gender-representation-gap in each of the three political arenas
(internal, electoral, and parliamentary) in the main parties in each Nordic country. The data
covered the last three national and municipal elections that had taken place prior to January 1,
2021.

3.1 Electoral and parliamentary arena: Official election statistics
The Nordic countries have official, national statistical agencies that collect and present
statistics for, amongst other things, political elections. Datasets on elections that these
agencies provide were used as primary sources to investigate the gender gap in the electoral
and parliamentary arenas in the PRR parties and in the other main parties in the Nordic
countries. Datasets presenting the percentage of men versus women among each Nordic
country’s main parties’ listed candidates in the last three municipal and parliamentary
elections, and the gender composition among the parties’ elected representatives in municipal
councils and national parliaments in the last three mandate periods, were subsequently used.
As mentioned in chapter IV:2, data was only gathered for parties that had had members in the
national parliament.
Datasets were retrieved from the following websites, hosted by the national statistics
agencies:
•

Denmark’s Statistics (Danmarks Statistik, www.dst.dk): A governmental agency
which is part of the Ministry of the Interior (Indenrigs- och Boligsministeriet),

•

Statistics Finland (Tilastokeskus, www.stat.fi ): A statistical service that is part of the
Finnish National Statistical Service,

•

The National Election Authority (Valmyndigheten, data.val.se ): The authority
responsible for political elections, the same data can also be found on Statistics
Sweden (scb.se),

•

Statistics Norway (Statistisk sentralbyrå, www.ssb.no ): The national statistical
institute of Norway.

Data was moreover collected for the following elections in the Nordic countries:
Parliamentary (general) elections:
•

Denmark: Parliamentary elections in 2011, 2015, and 2019,

•

Norway: Parliamentary elections in 2009, 2013, and 2017,

•

Sweden: Parliamentary elections in 2010, 2014, and 2018,

•

Finland: Parliamentary elections in 2011, 2015, and 2019.

Municipal elections:
•

Denmark: Municipal elections in 2009, 2013, and 2017,
52

Anna Lillkung
•

Norway: Municipal elections in 2011, 2015, and 2019,

•

Sweden: Municipal elections in 2010, 2014, and 2018,

•

Finland: Municipal elections in 2008, 2012, and 2017.

Some of the above-mentioned sources presented the number of male and female listed
candidates and elected representatives, as well as the percentages. Some of them, however,
only presented the numbers. The percentage was therefore calculated manually. The collected
data was put in tables in country-specific appendices (Appendices B–I). The mean
percentages, gender gaps, and mean gender gaps were also calculated manually. Data on the
general performance of the PRR parties in each Nordic country (i.e., the percentage of secured
seats in the last general elections) was additionally compiled, as part of the data collected to
answer the third research question.

3.2 The internal arena: A mix of sources
The gender gap in the internal arena was investigated by examining the gender composition in
the PRR parties’ party councils (party boards), i.e., the parties’ executive committees, in
addition to researching the sex of the parties’ leaders. This data was more difficult to collect
compared to the data for the electoral and parliamentary arenas. Whereas municipal and
general elections are held every fourth year, Nordic political parties elect their party council
members and leaders annually or biannually. Therefore, a significant amount of data had to be
compiled to investigate this arena. Data was collected from the last 10 years, i.e., the gender
gap in the parties’ party councils and in party leadership was tracked from 2011 to 2021. Data
regarding the non-PRR parties’ gender gap in party leadership was collected for the same time
span, 2011–2021. Data regarding the non-PRR parties’ gender gap in party councils was also
gathered, but only for 2020–2021, to limit the scope of the study.
Most political parties provide easily attainable information on sitting party council members
and leaders on their websites, but not on the members of previous party councils. The original
plan was thus to collect data regarding the gender gap in party councils by asking the Nordic
PRR parties to provide this information. However, other data collection methods were added
as the only party that provided a complete list of members of previous party councils was the
DF. The FrP, in contrast, replied that they did not keep such records. Consequently, this data
was compiled by using a mix of news articles, online encyclopedias, parties’ websites, and
parties’ annual reports found online, i.e., any source that contained information on the
members in the party councils (see Appendices B–E). The number and percentage of women
53

Anna Lillkung
in the PRR parties’ party councils 2011–2021 were thus assembled, and the gender gap
calculated. A council member or party leader was considered “male” or “female” according to
his or her name, i.e., by determining if the name was traditionally used for women or men,
and by searching for and observing pictures of the members and leaders in question.
This method of data collection had some limitations. The reliability of the sources and the
accuracy of the information they provided was at times difficult to deduce. In many cases,
only one news article describing newly elected party council members was found, with no
source to cross-check the information with. However, when it was possible to verify facts
provided in one source with information provided in another source, the sources’ information
matched. The data was thus generally considered accurate.
Compiling data on the gender gap in party councils was more time-consuming than
establishing the gender gap in party leadership. The FrP constituted the most difficult case.
The FrP elects party council members and party leadership for two years, but the party leader
and three members of the party council are elected in between election years, while the first
vice leader, the second vice leader, and the three remaining party council members are elected
in election years (Fremskrittspartiet, 2021). The FrP’s party council thus changes every year,
but only half of it. A mix of online news articles, annual reports, and official documents sent
out in preparation of the party’s annual congress (landsmøtet), in addition to web pages on
individual politicians in the online encyclopedia, Store Norske Leksikon, were therefore used
to deduce each year’s party council composition (see Appendix C). Data on the members was
found in all but one case, as the FrP’s parliamentary group leader in 2012–2013 was not
identified.
Data on the gender composition in the PS’s and the SD’s party councils was easier to obtain,
but a variety of sources still had to be used to assemble the data. News articles, party annual
reports and financial statements, party press releases, and web pages containing information
on the various politicians were used to collect data on the gender composition in the party
councils 2011–2021 (see Appendices D–E). The data collection for the DF was more
straightforward, as a student helper employed by the DF provided a complete list of names of
the party council members in the last ten years (see Appendix B).
Regarding gender balance in party leadership, the sex of the party leaders of all relevant
Nordic parties in the period 2011–2021 was identified. News articles and online
encyclopedias (e.g., Den Store Danske, Store Norske Leksikon, Sveriges Riksdag) were used
54

Anna Lillkung
to gather the data. To calculate the gender gap in party leadership, dummy variables were
used. A female leader got the value of 1, while a male leader got the value of 0. This
translated into 100 percent for a female leader and 0 percent for a male leader. The average
percentage of female leaders for each party and the gender gap based on that average
percentage were then calculated. To give an example, if a party had a female leader in 2011–
2015, and a male leader from 2015 and onwards, the mean percentage of female leadership
would be 40 percent, and the gender gap 10 percentage points.
Data on the gender balance in party councils was compiled for both PRR and non-PRR
parties. Information concerning party council members in non-PRR parties was mostly found
on these parties’ websites. However, regarding the non-PRR parties, data was only collected
for the party councils in 2020–2021. Changes in the non-PRR parties’ party council gender
balance were consequently not observed over time, as it would have been vastly more timeconsuming to assemble the data needed to do so. Since this study aimed to investigate the
possible contagion effect in the PRR parties specifically, collecting this data for the non-PRR
parties was deemed unnecessary. Additionally, any changes in the gender composition in the
party councils that occurred outside the time of the parties’ internal elections (e.g., situations
where a female replaced a male member due to the male member being suspended) were not
included in the presentation of the results.

4. Results
This subchapter reports the results of the empirical study and is divided into three sections,
with each section focusing on one of the three research questions. The first section (4.1)
presents the gender-representation gap in the Nordic PRR parties. The second section (4.2)
compares the PRR parties’ gender gaps to the gender gaps in the main non-PRR parties in the
Nordic countries. The third section (4.3) displays how the gender gap in the Nordic PRR
parties has evolved over time. Appendices A–I contain all the data collected. The results,
tables, and figures displayed in this chapter thus correspond to data found in the appendices,
which are the following:
•

Appendix A: Comparison of the gender-representation gap in the Nordic PRR parties

•

Appendix B: Gender composition in Danish parties’ party councils and leadership

•

Appendix C: Gender composition in Norwegian parties’ party councils and leadership

•

Appendix D: Gender composition in Finnish parties’ party councils and leadership

•

Appendix E: Gender composition in Swedish parties’ party councils and leadership

•

Appendix F: Data regarding the gender-representation gap in Danish parties

•

Appendix G: Data regarding the gender-representation gap in Norwegian parties

•

Appendix H: Data regarding the gender-representation gap in Finnish parties

•

Appendix I: Data regarding the gender-representation gap in Swedish parties

4.1 RQ1: The gender-representation gap in the Nordic PRR parties
The first research question was to what extent a gender-representation gap exists in the Nordic
PRR parties, and whether the gender gap is similar in these parties across the Nordic
countries. A party that has a gender gap between –10 and 10 percentage points can be
considered gender equal (i.e., having a male to female ratio of 60:40 at most). In the
presentation of the results below, the mean gender gaps of each PRR party are compared. The
mean gender gaps are based on observations of the parties’ gender gaps in the last three
municipal and parliamentary elections, as well as on observations of the parties’ gender gaps
in party councils and in party leadership in 2011–2021. The PRR parties’ mean gender gaps
are lastly compared with the national gender gap averages (i.e., the gender gap average based
on all main parties’ mean gender gaps in each country).

4.1.1 RQ1: The PRR gender gaps in the internal arena
When examining the last ten years’ party councils (Figure 1), the DF had the largest mean
gender gap (27.3 percentage points), closely followed by the FrP (27 percentage points). The
PS had the smallest mean gender gap (17 percentage points), while the SD’s mean gender gap
was 19.3 percentage points.

Figure 1. Mean gender gap in PRR party councils, 2011–2021, (percentage points)
When observing the gender gaps in the individual party councils in 2011–2021 (Table 1), the
gender gap evidently ranged moderately and, in some cases, significantly, e.g., in the DF
(range: 22.7–40.9 percentage points) and in the PS (range: 8.3–34.6 percentage points).
However, since there generally were not that many members in the party councils (between
10 to 20 members in the Nordic PRR party councils), an ostensibly significant jump in gender
gap often meant the addition of only one woman instead of one man. As shown in Table 1, the
gender gaps remained the same size for several years in the PRR party councils. The gender
gaps were therefore relatively stable in each party, despite displaying greater ranges at times.
The PS was also the only PRR party that had a gender gap of less than 10 percentage points in
any of its party councils (8.3 points in 2016–2017 and in 2018–2019). The gender gaps were
therefore relatively large in the Nordic PRR parties throughout the last ten years.

The mean gender gap in party leadership in the PRR parties generated a more scattered
picture (Figure 2). Neither the PS nor the SD had a female leader in the period 2011–2021.
They thus had mean gender gaps of 50 percentage points each. The FrP, however, had a
female leader, Siv Jensen, throughout the last ten years, and the FrP thus had a gender gap of
–50 percentage points. The DF had a female party leader, Pia Kjærsgaard, until 2012, when
Kristian Thulesen Dahl, a man, became the party’s leader. The DF therefore had a gender gap
of 40 percentage points.

Figure 2. Mean gender gap in PRR party leadership, 2011–2021, (percentage points)
The Nordic PRR parties’ gender gaps thus generally exceeded 10 percentage points in the
internal arena. The parties’ respective mean gender gaps in party councils all surpassed 10
percentage points and were often closer to 20 and even 30 percentage points. In party
leadership, the FrP was the only PRR party that had a mean gender gap inferior to 10
percentage points.

4.1.2 RQ1: The PRR gender gaps in the electoral arena
The Nordic PRR parties’ mean gender gaps among listed candidates all surpassed 10
percentage points, based on the gender gaps in the last three parliamentary and municipal
elections (Figure 3 and 4). The mean gender gaps among the PRR parties’ listed candidates
based on the last three parliamentary elections were 17.5 percentage points (DF), 14.4 points
(FrP), 16.7 points (PS), and 21.3 points (SD) (Figure 3). The mean gender gap among listed
candidates was generally larger in the municipal elections than in the parliamentary elections,
with the mean gender gaps based on the last three municipal elections being 20.9 (DF), 22.1
(FrP), 25.3 (PS), and 25.4 percentage points (SD) (Figure 4).

The parties’ gender gaps in the electoral arena ranged somewhat from election to election
(Table 2). The DF and the SD had the greatest gender gap ranges in the parliamentary
elections. The DF’s gender gap increased from 14.1 to 19.6 percentage points from election 1
to election 2. The SD’s gender gap decreased from 24.2 to 19.8 percentage points from
election 1 to election 2. In the municipal elections, the gender gap generally only ranged a few
percentage points, apart from in the SD (SD range: 21.9–29.8 percentage points) (Table A6,
Appendix A).

The Nordic PRR parties thereby displayed comparable mean gender gaps among their listed
candidates in the parliamentary elections, ranging from 14.4 to 21.3 percentage points. The
mean gender gap among listed candidates in the municipal elections ranged from 20.9 to 25.4
percentage points, which was a relatively small range, thus indicating cross-national
similarities. The SD had the largest mean gender gap among listed candidates, both in the
general and in the municipal elections.

4.1.3 RQ1: The PRR gender gaps in the parliamentary arena
The mean gender gaps among elected representatives of the four PRR parties were on average
also larger than 10 percentage points, both in the local and the general elections. The mean
gender gaps among the elected representatives, based the last three parliamentary elections,
nevertheless showed variation between the four parties (Figure 5). The DF had a relatively
small mean gender gap of 13.4 percentage points among the party’s elected members of
parliament, while the mean gender gaps in the FrP and the SD were 26.3 and 27.9 percentage
points respectively. The PS had a mean gender gap of 19.8 percentage points. The gender gap
range was significant in the DF (9.5–18.2 percentage points) and in the SD (21–35 percentage
points), and notable also in the FrP (24–29.3 percentage points) (Table 3).
Among the elected representatives in the municipal elections, there was less variation between
the Nordic PRR parties, as the mean gender gaps ranged from 20.8 percentage points (DF) to
28.1 (PS) (Figure 6). The FrP and the SD had mean gender gaps of 23.4 and 26.5 percentage
points respectively. The gender gap only ranged a few percentage points in the DF, the FrP,
and the PS, while the SD’s gender gap ranged from 21.8 percentage points (election 3) to 31.2
percentage points (election 1) (Table A8, Appendix A).

In the parliamentary arena, the DF thus had the smallest mean gender gap, both in the
parliamentary and the municipal elections. The other three PRR parties had mean gender gaps
that were of similar size. Most importantly, all PRR parties had mean gender gaps that
exceeded at least 10, but often 20 percentage points. Their level of female representation was
therefore not within the gender equal balance of 40–60 percent.

4.1.4 RQ1: PRR parties’ mean gender gaps versus national gender gap averages
The PRR gender gaps were also large compared to the gender gaps on average in each
country. The national gender gap average was calculated for each country based on the mean
gender gaps of all main parties. To exemplify, if there were four electorally relevant parties in
Norway and they each had mean gender gaps of 10, 15, 20, and 25 percentage points among
listed candidates in municipal elections, the national gender gap average would be the sum of
the four parties’ mean gender gaps divided by four. In the example, the average gender gap

61

Anna Lillkung
among listed candidates in the municipal elections in Norwegian parties would be 17.5
percentage points.
Internal arena: PRR gender gaps versus national gender gap averages
In the internal arena, the PRR parties’ gender gaps in party councils (2020–2021) and mean
gender gaps in party leadership (2011–2021) were compared with the national gender gap
averages. The results in Figure 7 show that the PRR parties' party council gender gaps in
2020–2021 were larger than the national gender gap averages in each state. The DF’s party
council gender gap was 40.9 percentage points while the Danish national gender gap average
in party councils was 21.4 percentage points. In Norway, Finland, and Sweden, the national
gender gap averages ranged from –1.9 to 0.9 percentage points. The Norwegian, Finnish, and
Swedish PRR parties’ range was in contrast 22.7–34.6 percentage points. The gender gaps
were therefore substantially larger in the PRR party councils compared to on average in the
Nordic parties’ party councils.

When comparing the numbers cross-nationally, the party council gender gaps were on average
almost non-existent in Norway, Finland, and Sweden. The gender gaps were, in contrast, large
in the Norwegian, Finnish, and Swedish PRR party councils. Denmark stands out, as seen in
Figure 7, as the Danish parties’ party council gender gaps on average were notably greater
(22.1 percentage points) than in the other Nordic countries (0.9 in Norway, 0.7 in Finland, and
–1.9 percentage points in Sweden). However, there was still a marked difference between the
(larger) DF party council gender gap and the Danish national gender gap average.
62

Anna Lillkung
The mean gender gaps in party leadership showed more variation between the Nordic
countries, and less of a pattern (Figure 8). The Danish, Finnish, and Swedish PRR parties had
significantly larger mean gender gaps in party leadership than the parties had on average in
their respective countries. The FrP’s gender gap in party leadership was in contrast smaller
than the national average, an effect of the FrP having a female leader in 2011–2021.

Electoral arena: PRR gender gaps versus national gender gap averages
In the electoral arena, the gender gap among the PRR parties’ listed candidates in municipal
and parliamentary elections was compared to the gender gap on average in each country,
based on the mean gender gaps of all main parties.
The results in Figure 9 show that the mean gender gaps among listed candidates in the PRR
parties, when including data from the last three parliamentary elections, were larger than the
gender gaps were on average among the Nordic parties’ listed candidates. In Sweden,
Norway, and Finland, the differences between the PRR parties’ mean gender gaps and the
gender gaps on average were significant. Sweden had a gender gap average of 5.7 percentage
points among listed candidates, while the SD’s mean gender gap was 21.3 percentage points,
constituting a difference of 15.6 percentage points. In Denmark, in contrast, the difference
between the DF and the national average was only 2.1 percentage points. While the
Norwegian, Finnish, and Swedish PRR parties had a considerable overrepresentation of men
among their listed candidates in the parliamentary elections, also compared to the national
gender gap averages, the same pattern was not identified in Denmark. The DF still had a large
63

Anna Lillkung
gender gap (17.5 percentage points) among its listed candidates, which was also on par with
the gender gap in the other Nordic PRR parties. However, as the Danish national gender gap
average was relatively large (15.4 percentage points), the difference between this gender gap
average and the DF’s mean gender gap was not as notable as in the other Nordic countries.

average, (percentage points)
The gender gap was in general larger on the local level than on the national level, i.e., there
was a greater overrepresentation of men among the listed candidates in the municipal
elections compared to in the parliamentary elections, in all Nordic countries (Figure 10). The
results concerning the gender gap among listed candidates in the municipal elections were
nevertheless akin to the results on the national level. There was a considerable difference
between the mean gender gaps among the PRR parties’ listed candidates and the national
gender gap averages regarding listed candidates in Norway, Finland, and Sweden (Figure 10).
The national gender gap average was 10 percentage points or less in these three countries. The
mean gender gaps in the Norwegian, Finnish, and Swedish PRR parties were in contrast 22
percentage points or more. The DF had the smallest mean gender gap of all PRR parties.
While the DF’s mean gender gap (20.9 percentage points) was larger than the Danish national
average (18.5 percentage points), the difference was not of considerable size. The Danish
national gender gap average concerning listed candidates in the municipal elections was also
greater than the other Nordic countries’ national gender gap averages.

Parliamentary arena: PRR gender gaps versus national gender gap averages
Concerning the mean gender gaps among elected representatives, based on the last three
parliamentary elections, the PRR parties in Norway, Finland, and Sweden had significantly
larger gender gaps compared to the national gender gap average in each respective country
(Figure 11). The national gender gap averages were 10 percentage points in Norway, 6.2
percentage points in Finland, and 5.1 percentage points in Sweden. The mean gender gaps in
the Norwegian, Finnish, and Swedish PRR parties were, in contrast, 26.3, 19.8, and 27.9
percentage points respectively. The DF had the smallest mean gender gap among elected
representatives (13.4 percentage points) of the Nordic PRR parties. This gender gap was also
not much larger than the gender gap on average in Danish parties (11.7 percentage points).

The PRR parties’ mean gender gaps among elected representatives, based on the last three
municipal elections, were also large (> 20 percentage points) (Figure 12). However, the PRR
parties’ gender gaps were only significantly larger than the national gender gap averages in
Norway, Finland, and Sweden. The national gender gap averages were 10.4 percentage points
in Norway, 12.4 percentage points in Finland, and 6.7 percentage points in Sweden. The mean
gender gaps in the FrP, the PS, and the SD were in comparison 23.4, 28.1, and 26.5
percentage points. The DF’s mean gender gap (20.8 points) was not much larger than the
Danish parties’ gender gap on average (18.3 percentage points). Denmark’s national average
was also considerably larger than the average in the other Nordic countries.

4.1.5 RQ1: Summary of results
The Nordic PRR parties’ mean gender gaps exceeded 10 percentage points in practically all
arenas studied. There was an overrepresentation of men both among the parties’ listed
candidates and elected representatives, and in the parties’ party councils in the last ten years.
The gender gap was on average also larger than 10 percentage points in the parties’ party
leadership, apart from in the FrP. A considerable gender-representation gap thus existed in the
Nordic PRR parties. Moreover, the PRR parties’ mean gender gaps were of relatively similar
size when comparing cross-nationally. The mean gender gaps were often larger than 20
percentage points. When adding the PRR parties’ mean gender gaps in the electoral and
parliamentary arena, and in the party councils, the PRR parties’ combined mean gender gap
was 22 percentage points and the median 21.7 percentage points (range: 13.4–28.1 percentage
points). The SD generally had the largest gender gap while the DF tended to have the smallest
gender gap, apart from in party councils where the DF had the largest gender gap.
Additionally, in Norway, Finland, and Sweden, the PRR parties’ mean gender gaps were
significantly larger (> 10 percentage point difference) than the national gender gap averages.
However, this was not the case in Denmark, as the DF’s mean gender gaps usually exceeded
the national gender gap averages, but only by a few percentage points. The Nordic PRR
parties thus had a notable overrepresentation of men in the three political arenas. In Norway,
Finland, and Sweden, this overrepresentation was notably greater compared to the
representation of men in other parties, whereas the DF’s representation of men did not diverge
considerably from the representation of men in other Danish parties.

4.2 RQ2: PRR versus non-PRR parties’ gender-representation gaps
The second research question concerned how the gender-representation gaps in the PRR
parties compared with the gender gaps in the non-PRR parties, especially with the gender
gaps in the conservative and the social democratic parties. To answer this question, data
showing the gender gaps and mean gender gaps in the three political arenas for the other
electorally relevant Nordic parties was collected. The gender gap average for the non-PRR
parties combined was also calculated, based on the mean gender gaps of the individual nonPRR parties in each country.

4.2.1 RQ2: PRR versus non-PRR parties’ gender-representation gaps in the
internal arena
In the internal arena, the gender gap in the PRR parties’ party council in 2020–2021 and the
mean gender gap in the party leadership 2011–2021 were compared to the gender gaps in the
non-PRR parties.
Party councils: PRR versus non-PRR parties’ gender gaps
The results show that the gender gap in the PRR party councils were significantly larger than
in the non-PRR parties’ party councils (Figure 13). The DF’s party council gender gap was
40.9 percentage points, compared to the non-PRR party average of 19 percentage points. The
FrP’s gender gap was 22.7 percentage points, compared to the Norwegian non-PRR party
average of –2.2 points. The PS’s party council gender gap was 34.6 points, compared to the
Finnish non-PRR party average of –5.7. The SD’s gender gap was 23.7 percentage points in
the party council, compared to the Swedish non-PRR average of –5.5.
The PRR parties’ gender gaps were also generally larger than the gender gaps in the
conservative and social democratic parties’ party councils (Figure 13). This difference tended
to be the greatest between the PRR parties and the social democratic parties, as the Nordic
social democratic parties’ party council gender gaps were smaller than both the conservative
and the PRR parties’ gender gaps. However, the gender gap was also considerably smaller in
the conservative parties’ party councils than in the PRR party councils. The smallest
difference was between the FrP’s and the Norwegian Conservative party’s (Høyre) gender
gaps, as the former had a gender gap of 22.7 percentage points and the latter of 13.6. Out of
the four Nordic countries, the Danish parties’ party councils had the largest gender gaps, both
when observing the PRR, the conservative and the social democratic parties’ party councils,
and regarding the average for all main non-PRR parties.

Party leadership: PRR versus non-PRR parties’ gender gaps
The mean gender gaps in party leadership displayed variation between the Nordic countries
(Figure 14). The PRR parties in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden had notably larger mean
gender gaps in party leadership than the non-PRR parties had on average, while the FrP’s
gender gap was smaller than the non-PRR average.
When comparing these gender gaps with the conservative and social democratic parties, the
results varied in each country. In Finland, the mean gender gap was larger in the PRR and
conservative parties’ leadership than in the Finnish Social Democratic party’s leadership. In
Norway, the opposite relationship was true. In Denmark, the Conservative Party had a larger
mean gender gap in party leadership than both the DF, the Social Democratic Party, and the
average for all non-PRR parties. The SD’s gender gap was larger than the Conservatives’
gender gap, but the same size as the Swedish Social Democrats’.

Two main conclusions can therefore be drawn regarding the internal arena. First, as concerns
party councils, the Nordic PRR parties had larger gender gaps compared to the averages for
the non-PRR parties and compared to in the Nordic social democratic and conservative
parties. Second, the mean gender gaps in party leadership provided a more ambigous picture.
The PRR parties tended to have larger mean gender gaps compared with the non-PRR parties’
gender gap averages, apart from the FrP. When comparing with the gender gaps in the Nordic
conservative and the social democratic parties, the difference in gender gaps varied greatly
cross-nationally.

4.2.2 RQ2: PRR versus non-PRR parties’ gender-representation gaps in the
electoral arena
Next, the gender gaps among the PRR parties’ listed candidates in parliamentary and
municipal elections were compared to the gender gaps in the non-PRR parties.
Listed candidates in parliamentary elections: PRR versus non-PRR parties’ gender gaps
The PRR parties’ mean gender gaps among listed candidates, based on the last three
parliamentary elections, were larger than the gender gaps were on average among the Nordic
non-PRR parties’ listed candidates (Figure 15). In Norway, Finland, and Sweden, the
difference between the PRR parties’ gender gaps and the non-PRR parties’ gender gaps was
of significant size. The Swedish non-PRR parties combined had a gender gap average of 5.3
percentage points among their listed candidates. The SD’s mean gender gap among listed
70

Anna Lillkung
candidates was in contrast 21.3 percentage points, constituting a difference of 16 percentage
points. In Norway and Finland, the difference between the PRR parties’ mean gender gaps
and the non-PRR parties’ gender gap average was 13.7 and 13.9 percentage points
respectively. In Denmark, the DF’s mean gender gap was larger than the non-PRR parties’
gender gap on average, but the difference (2.4 percentage points) was small.

When observing the data for the conservative and the social democratic parties in each
country, Norway, Sweden, and Finland evidently followed a similar pattern, while Denmark
did not (Figure 15). In the three former countries, the difference between the mean gender gap
in the PRR parties and the gender gap in both the conservative and the social democratic
parties was significant (i.e., the gender gaps in the PRR parties were larger). The conservative
parties in Norway, Finland, and Sweden had modestly larger mean gender gaps among their
listed candidates than the social democratic parties. However, the gender gaps in the
conservative parties were closer to the gender gaps in the social democratic parties than to the
PRR parties’ gender gaps. In Denmark, however, the DF had a smaller mean gender gap (17.5
percentage points) than the Danish Social Democratic party (20.1 percentage points) and a
marginally bigger gender gap than the Conservative party (15.1 percentage points). There
were only two parties in Denmark that had mean gender gaps of less than 10 percentage
points: the Social Liberals (Radikale Venstre) (7 percentage points), and the Socialist People’s
Party (Sosialistisk Folkeparti) (8 percentage points) (Table F4, Appendix F).
71

Anna Lillkung
Listed candidates in municipal elections: PRR versus non-PRR parties’ gender gaps
Concerning the gender gap among listed candidates in the municipal elections, the results
were akin to the results for the parliamentary elections (Figure 16). In Norway, Finland, and
Sweden, there was a substantial difference between the mean gender gaps among the PRR
parties’ listed candidates and the non-PRR parties’ gender gap averages. In these three
countries, the non-PRR parties’ gender gap average ranged from 5.8 percentage points
(Norway) to 8.3 percentage points (Finland). In the Norwegian, Finnish, and Swedish PRR
parties, the mean gender gaps ranged, in contrast, from 22.1 percentage points to 25.4
percentage points. The DF had the smallest mean gender gap of the PRR parties. While the
DF’s mean gender gap (20.9 percentage points) was larger than the national non-PRR average
(18.3 percentage points), the difference was not of the same notable size as in Norway,
Finland, and Sweden. The gender gap average among the Danish non-PRR parties’ listed
candidates was also larger than in the other Nordic countries’ non-PRR parties.

In Norway, Finland, and Sweden, the mean gender gaps were also considerably larger in the
PRR parties than in the conservative and social democratic parties (Figure 16). In Sweden and
Finland, the conservative and the social democratic parties’ respective mean gender gaps were
closer in size to each other than they were to the mean gender gaps in the PS and the SD. For
example, the Swedish Conservatives’ mean gender gap was 12.7 percentage points, based the
last three municipal elections, while the Social Democrats’ mean gender gap was 3.2 points.
72

Anna Lillkung
The SD’s mean gender gap was, in contrast, 25.4 percentage points. The Conservatives’
gender gap was therefore closer in size to the Social Democrats’ gender gap than to the SD’s.
The conservative parties in Norway, Finland, and Sweden had larger mean gender gaps
among their listed candidates than the social democratic parties had, but they were by far
smaller compared to the PRR parties’. Denmark was again the exception to the general Nordic
pattern: the DF’s mean gender gap was only marginally larger than the Social Democratic
Party’s, and somewhat smaller than the Conservative Party’s. The mean gender gaps in these
three Danish parties were thus of similar size, and the differences between them cannot be
considered relevant.
In sum, when examining the mean gender gaps in the electoral arena, there were considerable
differences between the PRR parties’ mean gender gaps and the gender gap averages in the
main non-PRR parties in Norway, Finland, and Sweden. In these states, the mean gender gaps
in the PRR parties were significantly larger than both the non-PRR party national averages
and the mean gender gaps in the conservative and social democratic parties. Denmark stands
out as the Danish non-PRR parties’ gender gap average was larger compared to the other
Nordic countries’ non-PRR parties’ gender gap. Moreover, the DF neither displayed a much
larger gender gap than the Danish Conservative and Social Democratic Parties nor compared
to the non-PRR party average.

4.2.3 RQ2: PRR versus non-PRR parties’ gender-representation gaps in the
parliamentary arena
The gender gap in the parliamentary arena was investigated by examining the gender gaps
among elected representatives of the PRR and non-PRR parties in the last three parliamentary
and municipal elections in each Nordic country.
Elected representatives in parliamentary elections: PRR vs. non-PRR parties’ gender gaps
The mean gender gaps among the elected representatives of the PRR parties were firstly
compared with the gender gap on average for the main non-PRR parties, based on data from
the last three parliamentary elections. As Figure 17 shows, the PRR parties in Norway,
Finland, and Sweden had substantially larger mean gender gaps among their elected
representatives compared to the non-PRR parties’ gender gap averages. The non-PRR parties’
gender gap averages were 6.1 percentage points in Norway, 2.9 points in Finland, and 2.1
points in Sweden. The mean gender gaps in the Norwegian, Finnish, and Swedish PRR parties
were, in contrast, 26.3, 19.8, and 27.9 percentage points respectively. The mean gender gap
73

Anna Lillkung
among the elected representatives of the DF (13.4 percentage points) was not much larger
than the gender gap on average in the Danish non-PRR parties (11.8 percentage points).

Figure 17. Mean gender gap, elected representatives, parliamentary elections, comparison of
several parties, (percentage points)
When including the Nordic conservative and social democratic parties, the results display a
similar pattern as in the electoral arena. In Norway, Finland, and Sweden, the mean gender
gaps among elected representatives in the conservative and social democratic parties were
significantly smaller than in the PRR parties (Figure 17). The Norwegian, Finnish, and
Swedish conservative parties’ mean gender gaps were 12, 10.2, and –1.5 percentage points
respectively. The social democratic parties’ mean gender gaps were 0, –11.2, and 2.3
percentage points respectively. The mean gender gaps in the Norwegian, Finnish, and
Swedish PRR parties were considerably greater, ranging from 19.8 to 27.9 percentage points.
The DF’s mean gender gap (13.4 percentage points), however, was only marginally larger the
Danish Conservative Party’s mean gender gap (9.7 percentage points) and smaller than the
Social Democratic Party’s mean gender gap (16.8 percentage points). The DF’s mean gender
gap was also smaller than the mean gender gap in the largest Danish bourgeois party, the
Liberal Party (Venstre), which was 17.5 percentage points. The only Danish parties that had
notably smaller mean gender gaps than the DF were the Social Liberals (Radikale Venstre)
and the Socialist People’s Party (Sosialistisk Folkeparti), with mean gender gaps at –7.2 and –
9.25 percentage points respectively (see Appendix F).

74

Anna Lillkung
Elected representatives in municipal elections: PRR vs. non-PRR parties’ gender gaps
The mean gender gaps among elected representatives, based on the last three municipal
elections, were relatively large (> 20 percentage points) in all PRR parties (Figure 18). In
Norway, Finland, and Sweden, the PRR parties’ gender gaps were also significantly larger
than the gender gaps on average in the non-PRR parties. The Norwegian, Finnish, and
Swedish non-PRR parties’ gender gap averages among elected representatives were 9, 11, and
4.6 percentage points respectively. The mean gender gaps in the FrP, the PS, and the SD were
in comparison 23.4, 28.1, and 26.5 percentage points. The DF had a gender gap of 20.8
points, which was relatively close to the Danish non-PRR parties’ gender gap average of 18.1
percentage points.

Figure 18. Mean gender gap, elected representatives, municipal elections, comparison of
several parties, (percentage points)
Next, the same data was included for the conservative and social democratic parties (Figure
18). The results show that while the mean gender gaps in the conservative parties in Norway,
Finland, and Sweden were marginally larger than the non-PRR party averages, they were
notably smaller than in the PRR parties. The social democratic parties in these three countries
had smaller mean gender gaps than the gender gap on average in the non-PRR parties.
Denmark diverges again as the DF and the Danish Conservative Party had mean gender gaps
of similar size, 20.8 and 21.8 percentage points respectively, which in turn were only
modestly larger than the gender gap on average among the non-PRR parties’ elected
representatives in the Danish municipal elections (18.1 percentage points). The Danish Social

75

Anna Lillkung
Democratic Party had a smaller mean gender gap (16.9 percentage points) compared to both
the non-PRR party average and the PRR and Conservative parties, but this difference was
modest. The Danish parties thus had gender gaps of similar size. Only one party, the Socialist
People’s Party, had a mean gender gap below 10 percentage points (8.3 points) among locally
elected representatives (Table F6, Appendix 6). The Danish parties’ gender gaps were on
average also larger than in the Norwegian, Finnish, and Swedish parties.
To conclude, the gender gap in the PRR and non-PRR parties in the parliamentary arena
displayed a distinct pattern in Norway, Finland, and Sweden. Here, the gender gap among the
PRR parties’ elected representatives was remarkably larger compared to both the non-PRR
party average and compared to the mean gender gaps in the conservative and social
democratic parties. The gender gap was generally larger in the conservative parties than in the
social democratic parties in these countries. However, there was still a considerable difference
between the smaller gender gap in the conservative parties and the larger gap in the PRR
parties. The results for Denmark diverge from this pattern, partly because the gender gap on
average was larger among the Danish non-PRR parties’ elected representatives than in the
other three countries, partly because the DF tended to have a smaller mean gender gap
compared with the other Nordic PRR parties.

4.2.4 RQ2: The PRR party effect on the national gender gap averages
To examine whether the gender gaps in the PRR parties have influenced the national gender
gap averages in the Nordic countries, the national gender gap averages (including the PRR
parties) were compared with the gender gap averages for the non-PRR parties only (excluding
the PRR parties).
Internal arena: PRR party effect on the national gender gap averages
In the internal arena, the national gender gap averages, based on all parties’ gender gaps in
party councils, were larger than the non-PRR parties’ gender gap averages (Figure 19). The
difference between the national gender gap average and the non-PRR party gender gap
average ranged from 3.1 percentage points (Denmark and Norway) to 3.6 points (Sweden)
and 5 percentage points (Finland). The larger gender gaps in the PRR party councils had thus
led to an increase in the national gender gap averages. The national gender gap average in
party leadership was also larger than the non-PRR gender gap average in Denmark, Finland,
and Sweden (Figure 20). However, the FrP’s smaller gender gap led to a decrease in the

76

Anna Lillkung
national gender gap average in party leadership, as the national gender gap average was 3.75
percentage points while the non-PRR gender gap average was 11.4 percentage points.

Electoral arena: PRR party effect on the national gender gap averages
In the electoral arena, the gender gap was on average smaller when excluding the PRR parties
(Figure 21). In Norway and Finland, this difference was larger than 1.5 percentage points,
both in the municipal and the parliamentary elections (Figure 21 and Figure 22). The PRR
parties’ large gender gaps had thus led to an increase in the national gender gap average in
Finland and Norway, or, in other words, to a decrease in the nationwide percentage of women
among listed candidates. In Sweden, the difference between the national gender gap average
and the non-PRR party gender gap average was small, 0.4 percentage points, based on the last
three parliamentary elections (difference range: 0.2–0.7 percentage points), and 0.9
percentage points based on the last three municipal elections (difference range: 0.7–1.2
percentage points). In Denmark, the difference was not significant (0.3 percentage points on
the national level and 0.2 percentage points on the local level).

Parliamentary arena: PRR party effect on the national gender gap averages
The difference between the national gender gap average and the non-PRR gender gap average
was similarly significant in Norway, Finland, and Sweden in the parliamentary arena (Figure
23 and Figure 24). Concerning the parliamentary elections, the gender gap difference was 3.9
percentage points in Norway, 3.3 percentage points in Finland, and 3 percentage points in
Sweden, with the national gender gap averages being larger than the non-PRR parties’ gender
gap averages (Figure 23). In Denmark, in contrast, the non-PRR parties had a larger mean
gender gap (11.8 percentage points) compared to the national average when including the DF
(11.7 percentage points). However, this difference was only 0.1 percentage points.

Regarding the municipal elections, the mean gender gap was 18.1 percentage points when
excluding the DF, and 18.3 percentage points when including the DF (Figure 24). In Norway
and in Finland, the difference between the national gender gap average and the non-PRR
parties’ gender gap average was 1.4 percentage points. In Sweden, the difference was 2.1
percentage points.

Figure 24. Gender gap average, elected representatives, municipal elections, all parties vs.
non-PRR parties, (percentage points)
To summarize, the overrepresentation of men in the Nordic PRR parties generally led to a
decrease in the overall percentage of women in the internal, electoral, and parliamentary
arenas in the Nordic countries. In Finland and Sweden, this was the case in all arenas. In
Norway, it was the case in all arenas but not in party leadership. In Denmark, the DF’s large
gender gap in the internal arena increased the national gender gap average. However, the DF’s
gender gap had no marked increasing effect on the national gender gap average in the
electoral or parliamentary arenas.

4.2.5 RQ2: Summary of results
The results show that the gender gaps in the PRR parties generally differed from the gender
gaps in the non-PRR parties, both in the internal, electoral, and parliamentary arenas.
Regarding the gender gap in party councils, all PRR parties had considerably larger gender
gaps both compared to the non-PRR party gender gap averages and compared to the gender
gaps in the conservative and social democratic parties. Additionally, the gender gap in party
councils was on average larger in the Danish non-PRR parties than in the other Nordic

79

Anna Lillkung
countries’ non-PRR parties, but the DF also had a larger gender gap in their party council than
the other Nordic PRR parties had. Concerning party leadership, the DF, the PS, and the SD
had large gender gaps, but several non-PRR parties also had similarly large gender gaps. The
FrP’s negative gender gap in party leadership, however, was smaller compared to many of the
other Norwegian parties’ gender gaps.
In the electoral and parliamentary arenas, the mean gender gaps in the Norwegian, Finnish,
and Swedish PRR parties were greater than the gender gaps on average in the non-PRR
parties. The gender gaps in the PRR parties were also larger compared to the gender gaps in
the conservative and social democratic parties. This was the case both in the parliamentary
and municipal elections. Denmark diverged from this pattern as the mean gender gaps in the
electoral and parliamentary arenas on average were larger in the Danish non-PRR parties
compared to in the other Nordic countries’ non-PRR parties. The gender gaps in the DF were
consequently similar in size to the other Danish parties’ gender gaps.
To obtain a more comprehensive view of the cross-national differences specifically, data from
the parliamentary and electoral arenas was combined and mean gender gaps that encompassed
listed candidates and elected representatives, in the last three municipal and parliamentary
elections, were calculated, for both the PRR parties, all parties on average, and the non-PRR
parties on average. The results in Figure 25 show that the gender gap on average in Danish
parties, when combining the electoral and parliamentary arenas and the local and national
level, was 16 percentage points. The corresponding percentage points in the other three
Nordic countries were 7.5 (Norway), 8.3 (Finland), and 6.3 (Sweden). In the Danish non-PRR
parties only, the mean gender gap was 15.8 percentage points. In the non-PRR parties in the
other three Nordic countries, the mean gender gap was 5.4 percentage points (Norway), 6.25
points (Finland), 4.7 percentage points (Sweden). Denmark thus had larger national gender
gap averages than the other Nordic states. However, out of the Nordic PRR parties, the DF
had the smallest gender gap when combining the electoral and parliamentary arenas. The
DF’s mean gender gap was 18.2 percentage points, compared with 21.6 points in the FrP, 22.5
points in the PS, and 25.3 points in the SD.

The same combined mean gender gap, encompassing both the electoral and parliamentary
arenas, was calculated for the conservative and social democratic parties (Figure 26). The
results show that the Danish Social Democratic Party and the Conservative Party had
considerably larger mean gender gaps than their party family counterparts in Norway,
Finland, and Sweden. The Danish Social Democratic party’s mean gender gap (18.4
percentage points) also diverged from the other Nordic Social Democratic parties, as these
parties had small gender gaps (ranging from 1.7 to 2.3 percentage points).

4.3 RQ3: The contagion theory
The third research question concerned how the gender-representation gap in the PRR parties
have changed over time and if the gender gaps have decreased as these parties have become
more mainstream and wanted to maximize their electoral support by gaining more female
supporters. The contagion thesis was examined by observing how the PRR parties’ gender
gaps among listed candidates and in the party councils and party leadership have changed and
by assessing if the PRR parties’ gender gaps have approached the assumedly smaller gender
gaps in the non-PRR parties. The electoral and internal arenas were examined, but not the
parliamentary arena, as the contagion effect mainly concerns parties strategically increasing
the percentage of women on their candidate lists to better compete with other parties (i.e.,
parties that already have a higher level of female representation). The internal arena was
included as an increase in women in a party’s executive branches can be a strategic decision
taken to increase the symbolic representation of women in the parties, which by extension
may attract more female electoral support. Chapter 4.3.1 demonstrates how the PRR parties’
gender gaps in the electoral and internal arenas have changed over time, without comparing
them to the gender gaps or gender gap changes in non-PRR parties. Chapter 4.3.2 shows how
the PRR parties’ gender gap changes compared to the gender gaps in the non-PRR parties.
The Nordic PRR parties have diverging histories, which is important to note. The DF and the
FrP, and to a lesser extent the PS, have a longer history of political relevance and electoral
success in their respective countries compared to the SD. Concerning “election 1” in Table 4
(i.e., the third latest municipal or general election), the DF, the FrP, and the PS also secured a
larger share of seats (12.6, 24.2, and 19.1 % respectively) compared with the SD (5.7 %). In
“election 3” (i.e., the latest election), the FrP, the PS, and the SD secured a similar share of
seats (range: 16.1–17.5 %), while the DF secured 9.1 percent. The different starting points for
the PRR parties, and how this might affect the contagion effect, are addressed in the final
discussion of the thesis.

4.3.1 RQ3: Changes in the PRR gender-representation gap over time
Internal arena: Changes in the PRR gender-representation gap
Changes in the gender-representation gap in the PRR parties’ internal arena was investigated
by observing changes in the gender gap in the individual PRR party councils and changes in
gender gap in the party leadership, in the period 2011–2021. The gender gap in the PRR
parties’ party councils fluctuated throughout this period; the gender gap was larger in some
party councils and smaller in others (Figure 27). The PRR parties nonetheless consistently had
significant gender gaps, with an overrepresentation of men in their party councils. In the DF,
the PS, and the SD, the gender gap increased in the last couple of party councils, while it
remained on the same level (22.7 percentage points) in the last three FrP party councils. When
only comparing how the gender gap changed from the party council in 2011–2012 to the party
council in 2020–2021, the gender gap increased markedly in the DF (from 22.7 to 40.9
percentage points) and in the PS (11.5 to 34.6 percentage points) (Figure 27). The gender gap
was the same (22.7 percentage points) in the FrP and decreased by 1.3 percentage points in
the SD. The gender gap thus did not become smaller in the PRR party councils.

There were also not any significant changes in the gender gap in the PRR party leadership
(Figure 28). The FrP, the PS, and the SD had the same party leader from 2011 to 2021. There
was consequently no change in these parties’ gender gaps. The DF went from having a female
to having a male party leader in 2012. The gender gap thus increased by 100 percentage

points. The party had the same male leader 2012–2021. To conclude, there were no significant
patterns of decreases or increases in the gender gap in the internal arena for the Nordic PRR
parties in the time span examined.

The electoral arena: Changes in the PRR gender-representation gap
Changes in the gender gap among listed candidates of the PRR parties demonstrated diverging
patterns in the Nordic countries (Figure 29). The SD was the only PRR party that had a net
decrease (–4,3 percentage points) in the gender gap among listed candidates in the
parliamentary elections, from the third latest election (“election 1”) to the latest election
(“election 3”). In the DF and the FrP, the gender gap increased from election 1 to election 2
but decreased modestly again in election 3. The DF’s gender gap was 14.1 percentage points
in 2011, 19.6 percentage points in 2015, and 18.8 percentage points in 2019. The FrP’s gender
gap was 12.5 percentage points in 2009, 15.9 points in 2013, and 14.8 points in 2017. In the
PS, the gender gap decreased between the 2011 and 2015 Finnish general election, from 16.8
to 14.7 percentage points, but increased to 18.5 percentage points in 2019.

points in the 2010 election to 21.9 percentage points in 2018, the other PRR parties
experienced net increases in their gender gaps, albeit marginal ones. For example, the DF had
a gender gap of 20.5 percentage points in 2009, 21.5 percentage points in 2013, and 20.6
points in 2017. The net increase was thus only 0.1 percentage points.

To conclude, there were in general no significant decreases in the Nordic PRR parties’ gender
gaps in the time span studied. Regarding the internal arena, no clear patterns of gender gap
changes were identified. The PRR parties’ party council gender gaps fluctuated throughout
the ten years, but most recently increased, while there were no significant changes in party
leadership. In the electoral arena, the SD was the only party that consistently decreased its
gender gap, both on the local and national level. In the DF, the FrP, and the PS, the gender
gaps remained relatively stable, especially on the local level. The gender gaps both increased
and decreased in these parties, but generally only changed marginally.

4.3.2 RQ3: Changes in PRR versus in non-PRR parties’ gender gaps
How do the PRR parties’ gender gap changes compare to the changes in the Nordic non-PRR
parties? And have the PRR parties’ gender gaps approached the non-PRR parties’ gender gaps
over time? To answer this, the PRR parties’ gender gap changes in the internal and electoral
arena were compared with the gender gap and gender gap changes in the non-PRR parties.
The internal arena: Changes in PRR versus in non-PRR gender gaps
The results in Table 5 show that the gender gaps in the PRR parties’ party councils generally
neither decreased nor approached the non-PRR parties’ (smaller) gender gaps. In the DF and
the PS, the gender gap increased from 2011 to 2021. In the PS and the SD, the gender gaps
were nevertheless smaller for shorter periods of time (see Table 1). In the PS, the gender gap
varied between 8.3 and 11.5 percentage points in 2016–2019. In the SD, the range throughout
the ten years was 14.7–23.7 percentage points. However, neither party came particularly close
to the gender gap average for the non-PRR parties in 2020–2021, which was –5.7 percentage
points in Finland and –5.5 percentage points in Sweden.

The PRR parties’ gender gaps in party leadership did not change in 2011–2021, apart from in
the DF (Table 6–9). However, this was also the case in many of the Nordic conservative and
social democratic parties. The non-PRR parties’ gender gaps in party leadership decreased
when only comparing 2011 with 2021, but notable gender gap decreases mostly occurred in
86

Anna Lillkung
recent years (Table 6, 8, and 9). The contagion thesis was thus not supported by the results.
However, as many of the Nordic conservative and social democratic parties also had large
gender gaps in party leadership, there was generally no considerably smaller gender gaps that
the PRR parties would necessarily feel pressured to adapt to.

Electoral arena: Changes in PRR versus in non-PRR gender gaps, parliamentary elections
Concerning listed candidates in the parliamentary elections, the gender gap average in the
non-PRR parties decreased from election 1 to election 3 in Denmark, Norway, and Finland,
while it increased in these countries’ PRR parties (Figure 31–33). The SD’s gender gap, in
contrast, decreased from election 1 to 3, while the Swedish non-PRR parties gender gap
average increased by 0.2 percentage points (Figure 34).
The net increase in the DF’s gender gap was 4.7 percentage points from the 2011 to the 2019
parliamentary election. However, the gender gap also increased in the Danish Conservative
Party (+2.9 percentage points) and Social Democratic Party (+5.6 percentage points), while
the non-PRR parties’ gender gap average decreased from 15.5 to 12.6 percentage points
(Figure 31). Moreover, while the DF’s gender gap did not decrease, it remained on par with
the other Danish parties’ gender gaps: the DF’s gender gap was 18.8 percentage points in
2019, compared to 15.7, 22.3, and 12.6 percentage points in the Conservative Party, Social
Democratic Party, and the non-PRR parties combined respectively. A contagion effect was
thus difficult to prove; there was no substantially smaller gender gap that the DF could mimic.
In Norway, the gender gap decreased in the Conservative Party (–4.6 percentage points) and
in the Labour Party (–0.5 percentage points), as well as on average in the non-PRR parties (–
1.7 percentage points) (Figure 32). In the FrP, however, the gender gap increased by 2.3
percentage points from 2009 to 2017. The FrP’s gender gap thus did not approach the nonPRR parties’ gender gap average, as it remained considerably larger (14.8 percentage points
in 2017) compared to the non-PRR parties’ gender gap average (–0.6 percentage points in
2017) and increased rather than decreased.
In Finland, the gender gap decreased by 6.2 percentage points in the non-PRR parties
combined and by 0.7 and 6.2 percentage points in the Finnish conservative and social
democratic parties respectively, while the PS’s gender gap increased by 1.7 percentage points.
(Figure 33). The gender gap in the PS (18.5 percentage points in 2019) consequently did not
approach the gender gap in the non-PRR parties (–0.8 percentage points in 2019).
In Sweden, there was a gender gap net increase in the Conservatives (+1.8 percentage points)
and in the Swedish non-PRR parties in general (+0.2 percentage points). The gender gap
decreased from election 1 to election 3 in the Social Democrats (–0.4 percentage points) and
in the SD (–4.3 percentage points). The SD’s gender gap thus gives indications of a contagion
effect, as it decreased significantly between election 1 and 2. However, the SD’s gender gap
88

Anna Lillkung
remained notably larger than the gender gap in the other Swedish parties. The SD’s gender
gap was 19.9 percentage points in 2018 compared to the non-PRR parties’ average of 5.8
percentage points. The SD gender gap additionally increased by 0.1 percentage points from
the 2014 to the 2018 general election.

Electoral arena: Changes in PRR versus in non-PRR gender gaps, municipal elections
Regarding listed candidates in the municipal elections, the changes between election 1 and 3
were generally small. There was a net increase of 0.1 percentage points in the DF while the
gender gap on average in the Danish non-PRR parties decreased by 0.8 percentage points
89

Anna Lillkung
(Figure 35). The DF’s gender gap among listed candidates (20.6 percentage points) was also
on par with the Conservative and Social Democratic Parties’ gender gaps (22.5 and 18.9
percentage points respectively) and not notably larger than the non-PRR parties’ gender gap
average (17.7 percentage points), in 2017.
In Finland and Norway, the gender gap among the PRR parties’ listed candidates on the local
level demonstrated marginal change (Figure 36 and Figure 37). The FrP’s gender gap was
22.3 percentage points in the 2019 municipal election and had thus increased by 1.1
percentage points since the 2011 election. The gender gap average in the non-PRR parties, in
contrast, decreased by 1.4 percentage points and was 5 percentage points in 2019. The PS’s
gender gap increased marginally (+0.5 percentage points) and was 24.8 percentage points at
the time of election 3. There was also a small net increase in the Finnish conservative party’s
gender gap (+1.3 percentage points), while there were small gender gap net decreases in the
Social Democratic Party and on average in the Finnish non-PRR parties (–0.1 and –0.6
percentage points respectively). The PS’s gender gap (24.8 percentage points) thus remained
significantly larger than the non-PRR parties’ gender gap (7.8 percentage points) in 2017.
The SD’s gender gap decreased notably by 7.9 percentage points from the 2010 to the 2018
election, while the gender gap decreased marginally in the Swedish non-PRR parties
combined (–0.8 percentage points) (Figure 38). The SD’s increase in percentage of women on
the candidate lists was therefore significant compared to the other Swedish parties. The SD’s
gender gap nonetheless remained considerably larger (21.9 percentage points) compared to
the non-PRR gender gap average (6.7 percentage points) in 2018.

4.3.3 RQ3: Summary of results
The results generally did not support the contagion thesis. The only PRR party that
consistently and significantly decreased its gender gap, and thus got closer to the gender gap
in the non-PRR parties in its country, was the SD. The SD’s gender gap decrease was notably
larger compared to any decreases in the Swedish non-PRR parties. However, the SD
continued to have a markedly larger gender gap than the Swedish non-PRR parties had at the
time of the latest election. In the electoral arena, the PRR gender gaps generally increased
(apart from SD’s), while the gender gap on average decreased in the non-PRR parties, albeit
only modestly. Moreover, while the DF’s gender gap did not decrease in the time span
examined, it remained similar in size to the gender gap in the Danish non-PRR parties.
In the internal arena, a contagion effect could generally not be identified. The PRR parties
neither increased the share of women in their party councils nor in their party leadership.
However, regarding the party leadership, the non-PRR parties were like the PRR parties as
several non-PRR parties had male leaders only in the time span studied.

V. Concluding discussion
The first aim of this thesis was to provide a research overview about gender and the populist
radical right. This research overview revealed that the gender-representation gap in the PRR
parties was the least studied area. The second aim of the thesis was therefore to contribute to
this understudied body of research by empirically observing the gender-representation gap in
the Nordic PRR parties. With respect to the results reported in chapter IV:4, and what
previous research has concluded, the question remains to what extent PRR parties can be
called Männerparteien with reference to the parties’ gender-representation gaps? Moreover,
how can existing differences in gender gaps between the Nordic PRR parties be explained?
In this chapter, the results of the empirical study are discussed and interpreted in greater
detail. The literature review is not subject to scrutiny in this chapter, as an analysis focusing
specifically on the research overview was provided in chapter III. This chapter therefore
concentrates on the results and conclusions of the empirical study with respect to the research
questions posed in chapter IV. Subchapter 1 summarizes the main findings in relation to the
first two research questions with focus on whether the PRR parties can be considered
Männerparteien. The contagion theory is discussed in the second subchapter and Denmark’s
position as an outlier in the results is analyzed in the third subchapter. The fourth and fifth
subchapters detail the limitations of the empirical study and provide suggestions for future
research and conclusive remarks.

1. Are the Nordic PRR parties Männerparteien?
1.1 The gender-representation gap in the Nordic PRR parties
Previous research has demonstrated that a gender-representation gap exists in the populist
radical right parties (e.g., Högström, 2019; Mudde, 2007; Mulinari & Neergaard, 2017). The
expected result regarding this study’s first research question was therefore that the Nordic
PRR parties display a gender-representation exceeding 10 percentage points in most of the
political arenas examined. The results of the empirical study also validated the expected
results, as substantial gender gaps in the PRR parties were identified. The men to women ratio
was generally around 70:30 rather than 60:40 in the Nordic PRR parties, in all political arenas
examined. The mean gender gaps in the internal, electoral, and parliamentary arenas also
exceeded 10 percentage points in all but one case: in the FrP’s party leadership. The gender
gaps did not fluctuate significantly in the time span studied. Moreover, there were only a few
92

Anna Lillkung
cases where the PRR gender gaps were less than 10 percentage points: the PS had a gender
gap of 8.3 percentage points in two of its ten party councils and the DF’s gender gap among
its elected representatives in the 2015 parliamentary election was 9.5 percentage points. There
was thus a clear and persistent overrepresentation of men in the Nordic PRR parties, also over
time.
Additionally, the overrepresentation of women in party leadership in the FrP does not alter the
general conclusion that the Nordic PRR parties, including the FrP, had a significant
overrepresentation of men. Only a small number of people were party leaders in the time span
studied. A lack of change in leadership during the last ten years thus leads to the gender gap
being at extreme ends, for example –50 or 50 percentage points. Additionally, a change from
a male to a female leader could affect the percentage significantly. The gender gap in party
leadership thereby does not necessarily reveal much about the female representation in a party
in general. As party leadership was the only area in which the FrP had a negative gender gap,
and since this was due to the FrP having the same female leader during the entire time span,
the results still evidenced that the Nordic PRR parties had a low level of female
representation.
In general, the gender gaps in the Nordic PRR parties were of similar size in all political
arenas, i.e., the gender gap remained at the same level, independently if it concerned listed
candidates, elected representatives, or members in the party councils. This indicates
robustness in the results. Party leadership was the only area where the gender gaps were at
more extreme ends. The gender gap also tended to be modestly larger among listed candidates
and elected representatives in the municipal elections compared to in the parliamentary
elections. This was the case both on average in the Nordic parties and in the PRR parties
specifically. Regarding how women do in municipal versus in general elections, previous
research has concluded that while women in some countries do better in local elections, the
opposite is true in other countries (Tolley, 2011). Kjær (2010) has moreover concluded that
women did better on the national level than on the local level in Sweden, Finland, and
Denmark. This study’s results thus agreed with Kjær’s conclusions, as the women fared better
on the national than the local level, not least in the PRR parties. Dahl and Nyrup (2021, p.
221) also offer an explanation to the gender gap difference in general and municipal elections:
“Since a much larger pool of candidates is needed at the local level compared to
the national level, we would expect the under-supply of women to be more
evident at local elections. This is especially so because local elections receive less
93

Anna Lillkung
attention and are less transparent and harder for outsiders to observe compared to
the national elections where the public pays more attention to the gender balance
(Kjær & Kosiara-Pedersen 2018).”
The results also displayed that the same pattern of male dominance exists cross-nationally in
the PRR party family in the Nordic region, though to varying degrees and manifestations of
gender gaps. The DF tended to have the smallest gender-representation gap while the SD
tended to have the largest gender-representation gap. The between-country differences were
in some cases major, e.g., regarding the gender gap among elected representatives in the
parliamentary elections, where the range was 13.4 percentage points (Denmark) to 27.9
percentage points (Sweden). However, the range was for the most part around 5–7 percentage
points when comparing the Nordic PRR parties’ mean gender gaps. The results were also
strikingly similar in Norway, Finland, and Sweden; the gender gaps in the FrP, the PS, and the
SD diverged parallel ways from the other parties in these countries, with a significantly larger
overrepresentation of men.
When only considering the gender balance in the PRR parties, the label Männerparteien
certainly seems warranted, as none of the parties were within or generally even close to the
gender equal ratio. In addition, the large gender gaps in the PRR parties proved to have had a
dampening effect on the total level of female representation in Norway, Finland, and Sweden.
The overall level of female representation in these countries would thus have been higher if it
were not for the PRR parties. This corroborates the results in a previous study by Sundström
and Stockemer (2015), which found that when PRR parties had a larger vote share, women’s
representation in local councils was negatively affected. However, Denmark did not
experience the same notable negative effect on female representation. While the DF had mean
gender gaps that were of similar size as in the other Nordic PRR parties, the DF’s gender gaps
were typically only marginally larger than the national gender gap averages in Denmark.
While the PRR parties in Norway, Finland, and Sweden thus can be regarded as
Männerparteien, with respect to their overrepresentation of men in all arenas studied, the DF
constitutes a more puzzling case, which will be discussed in subchapter 3.
The second research question concerned the applicability of Mudde’s (2007) claim that the
gender-representation gap is not necessarily much greater in the populist radical right than in
conservative right-wing parties in the case of the Nordic states. Another part of this question
was how the PRR gender gaps compares to the gender gaps in non-PRR parties, as well as in
the social democratic parties, which are placed further to the left on the left-right spectrum
94

Anna Lillkung
and typically have smaller gender gaps (see e.g., Högström, 2019; Mudde, 2007; Sundström
& Stockemer, 2021). The first expectation regarding this question was that one can find a
consistent and, relatively speaking, larger gender-representation gap (= more men than
women) in the PRR parties than in the non-PRR political parties in the Nordic countries. The
second expectation was that the gender-representation gap is greater in the PRR parties
compared to in the parties located further to the left on the left-right spectrum (i.e., compared
to the social democratic parties), but not necessarily substantially greater than in the parties
belonging to the conservative party family, in accordance with Mudde’s (2007) line of
thought.
The results in this study both bolstered and at times challenged Mudde’s (2007) findings. The
Nordic PRR parties’ gender gaps were on average significantly larger than the gender gaps on
average in the non-PRR parties and in the social democratic parties in Norway, Finland, and
Sweden. The gender gap differences were typically larger between the PRR and the social
democratic parties than between the PRR and the conservative parties, which agrees with
previous research that has shown that PRR gender-representation gaps generally are larger
than the gender gaps in parties located further to the left on the left-right spectrum (Mudde,
2007). However, the results also showed that the Nordic PRR parties’ gender gaps in these
countries notably exceeded the gender gaps in the conservative parties. The PRR parties had a
markedly larger overrepresentation of men compared to the conservative parties, which, in
contrast, often were often within the gender equal balance of 60–40 percent. The results thus
disagreed with Mudde’s claim that the gender gaps in the PRR parties are not significantly
larger compared to the ones in conservative parties.
However, Denmark was an outlier in the results regarding the second research question. The
DF tended to have a gender gap of similar size as, or only marginally larger than, the Danish
non-PRR parties. The gender gap was on average also greater in the Danish non-PRR parties
compared to in the other Nordic countries’ non-PRR parties. Additionally, the Danish Social
Democratic Party, a party situated to the left on the left-right spectrum, often had slightly
larger gender gaps than the DF, thus diverging from the other Nordic countries where the
social democratic parties’ gender gaps were smaller than the PRR parties’. The Social
Democratic Party also had considerably larger gender gaps compared to the other Nordic
social democratic parties. Denmark therefore constitutes an intriguing case as the DF had the
smallest gender gap on average of the Nordic PRR parties, while the Danish parties had the

95

Anna Lillkung
largest gender gaps of the Nordic parties. The results regarding Denmark were thus more in
line with Mudde’s (2007) findings, which will be discussed in greater detail in subchapter 3.

1.2 Why is there an overrepresentation of men in the populist radical
right?
The results agreed with previous research that has described an overrepresentation of men on
the supply side in the PRR parties (e.g., Högström, 2019; Mudde, 2007). The results also
proved that this gender-representation gap exists in the relatively gender equal Nordic
countries and that it manifests itself in similar ways cross-nationally in parties belonging to
the PRR party family. While the focus of this thesis was not to determine causality, exploring
potential explanatory factors for the comparatively larger gender-representation gaps in the
PRR parties and for the cross-national differences in the PRR party gender gaps is necessary.

1.2.1 Are gender-electorate gap explanations applicable for the genderrepresentation gap?
As the literature review in chapter III showed, previous research has concluded that a gender
gap exists in the PRR electorate (i.e., in PRR voting) (e.g., Harteveld et al., 2015; Spierings &
Zaslove, 2017). The reasons for women not joining the PRR parties as political candidates or
members may coincide with explanations for the lack of women in the PRR electorate. The
common denominator is that the PRR parties appear to be less appealing to women compared
to men. As concluded in the research overview, scholarly work on the gender-electorate gap
has generated ambiguous results and conclusions and has been unable to comprehensively
account for the gender gap in voting. Studies have shown that neither ideological reasons
alone nor factors like occupation or religion can fully elucidate the gender-electorate gap.
A few studies have nonetheless argued for the political efficacy theory, which suggests that
women become more likely to vote for PRR parties as these parties become more mainstream
or start having a less extremist image (e.g., Meyer, 2002; Mudde, 2007). This line of
argument is somewhat strengthened by Mulinari and Neergaard’s interviews with SD women
(2017) which describe how the women tended to have similar histories of both realizing that
the SD was not the evil part, as portrayed by media, but the morally superior one. Mulinari
and Neergaard noted a sense of progressive integration and loyalty to the SD, culminating in
the time the women could finally “come out” as SD supporters. If the political efficacy theory
was applicable to the supply-side, i.e., that the gender-representation gap decreases as the
PRR parties become more mainstream and established, it could theoretically explain why the
96

Anna Lillkung
gender gap in this study’s results was the largest in the SD, the Nordic PRR party with the
shortest history of national relevance and thus the least mainstream party, while the gender
gap on average was the smallest in the DF, a Nordic PRR party that has been a relevant
political actor in national politics for decades. However, this theory would fail to explain why
the FrP, which is the oldest of the Nordic PRR parties, still has a large gender-representation
gap.
Other studies reviewed in the literature overview have examined socioeconomic factors in
explaining the gender gap in PRR voting. While a study by Spierings and Zaslove (2017)
found no support for socioeconomic differences between men and women explaining the
gender-electorate gap, Immerzeel, Coffé, and van der Lippe (2015) state that structural
characteristics, namely employment status, occupational type, and education, partly explain
the gender-electorate gap. Such factors could also influence the gender-representation gap in
the Nordic countries. For example, it has been shown that a lower level of education is a
strong indicator for PRR voting (Immerzeel, Coffé, & van der Lippe, 2015). More women
than men are additionally likely to graduate from tertiary education in the Nordic countries
(Nordic Co-operation, 2021). This could in turn explain why women are less represented in
the Nordic PRR parties. Most of the SD women interviewed by Mulinari and Neergaard
(2017) were also employed irregularly or part-time, unemployed, on sick leave, or dependent
on welfare due to irregular employment patterns. One can of course not draw any strong
conclusions based on interviews with women in the SD only, but Mulinari’s and Neergaard’s
study nevertheless point to socioeconomic factors playing a part in women joining (and not
joining) PRR parties.
Whilst the studies on the gender gap among the PRR parties’ electorate have been numerous,
they have reached no clear consensus as to why more men than women vote for the PRR
parties. Therefore, even though there might be similar reasons to both the demand-side and
supply-side gender gap in the PRR parties, e.g., socioeconomic and political efficacy
differences between men and women, it remains unclear exactly which of these reasons are
applicable. This could be an area for future research to investigate.

1.2.2 The PRR gender ideology
Ideological positions and political attitudes alone have been unable to explain genderelectorate gaps in the populist radical right (Immerzeel, Coffé, & van der Lippe, 2015).
Women and men vote for these parties for the same ideological reasons, mainly opposition to
97

Anna Lillkung
immigration (Spierings & Zaslove, 2017). However, differing ideological positions between
men and women, or different views on the salience of ideological positions, might
nevertheless explain the gender-representation gap. Regarding the gender gap in voting, a
study by Harteveld et al. (2015) has suggested that women find issues related to PRR
ideology less important than men. It could thus be a factor that also influences the genderrepresentation gap. More importantly, the gender ideology of the PRR parties might affect the
gender-representation gap as this gender ideology might be less appealing to women than to
men. This could in turn explain why fewer women than men are interested in becoming active
members and representatives of the PRR parties.
Mudde (2007) suggests that PRR parties simply are not as interested in gender equality as part
of their politics compared to other parties, particularly compared to parties on the left.
However, previous research has also confirmed that PRR parties typically have traditional
conservative views on family relations (e.g., Akkerman, 2015) and they tend to support
traditional gender roles, emphasize biological differences between the sexes, and be antiabortion (Akkerman, 2015; Mulinari & Neergaard, 2017). Additionally, the PRR parties are
considerably more conservative compared to mainstream conservative parties (Akkerman,
2015). Previous scholarly work has also deduced that the Nordic PRR parties adhere to
similar modern traditional or modern conservative views (e.g., Askola, 2019; Meret & Siim,
2013). They do not necessarily question the Nordic dual-breadwinner model or the womanfriendly welfare state, but they advocate for traditional family values and principles, defend
and accentuate sex-specific differences, and oppose action that would advance gender
equality, e.g., quotas (Askola, 2019; Meret & Siim, 2013; Mulinari & Neergaard, 2017).
Feminism and gender equality has additionally been met with suspicion in the SD and the PS
(Pettersson, 2017), and the PS gender politics have been described as “conservative, if not
outright anti-feminist” (Luhtakallio & Ylä-Anttila, 2017, p. 44).
Moreover, many of the Nordic PRR parties have discussed gender equality as something
already achieved, and thus not in need of more attention, in the Nordic countries (e.g., Askola,
2019; Meret & Siim, 2013). They have consequently opposed all forms of preferential
treatment or policy action privileging gender (Askola, 2019; Meret & Siim, 2013). The DF
and the FrP have had strongly liberal individualist approaches to gender equality, claiming
that gender equality must be achieved without state intervention and only regulated by market
forces, and that politics that would promote women’s careers would be discriminatory (Meret
& Siim, 2013). Moreover, gender ideology has been given no specific place in the SD’s key
98

Anna Lillkung
policy documents and gender equality policies have been staunchly questioned (Mulinari &
Neergaard, 2017).
The Nordic PRR parties’ conservative and arguably anti-feminist approaches to gender
ideology may potentially make the parties less appealing to women compared to men. Men
tend to be more optimistic regarding the future of gender equality than women (Horowitz &
Fetterwolf, 2020) and less supportive of gender quotas (Luhtakallio & Ylä-Anttila, 2017)
compared to women. While ideology might not be particularly salient for the PRR parties in
general or for the PRR parties’ potential male members, it could be a critical issue to potential
female members.
Gender discourses have moreover been argued to influence women joining the SD. Mulinari
and Neergaard’s (2014, p. 46) interviews with SD women revealed that these women were
“bearers of a particular form of femininity.” This form of femininity was in turn difficult to
reconcile with the Swedish discourse on gender equality
“…rooted as it is in women’s equal participation in the labour market…on the one
hand, and double-income households on the other – a discourse that is central for
women politicians in all Swedish parties from the Left to Right” (Mulinari &
Neergaard, 2014, p. 46).
The Swedish hegemonic discourse on gender, and the SD women’s marginalization due to not
fitting in with this discourse, thus seemed to affect women’s decisions to join the SD. Gender
ideology could thereby to some extent explain women’s (un)willingness to join the populist
radical right and why the same large gender gaps are not found in non-PRR parties. Since
gender equality has come far in the Nordic countries in quantitative terms, arguably because
of sociopolitical debate and collective movements for social development (Niskanen, 2011),
gender ideology is possibly more decisive to women in these countries than in other countries,
making Nordic women less reluctant to join the PRR parties. This could in turn explain why
there were great differences in gender gaps between the PRR parties and the conservative
parties in Norway, Finland, and Sweden, differences that Mudde (2007) did not empirically
observe in other Western European countries.
Several studies have lastly pointed out that the Nordic PRR parties have started to use gender
as an instrument to embrace anti-immigration policies (Askola, 2019; Meret, 2015; Mulinari
& Neergaard, 2017). The parties do so by considering gender equality as a “national trait” in
the Nordic or Western region that immigrants, mostly Muslim immigrants, do not understand
99

Anna Lillkung
or act in accordance with. By emphasizing that forced marriages, genital mutilation, and the
use of headscarves for women are migrant-imposed dangers to the gender equality achieved in
the Nordic countries, as well as to the migrant women, the PRR parties have come to
incorporate gender equality more in their politics (Akkerman & Hagelund, 2007; Siim &
Meret, 2013). They have even become defendants of immigrant women’s rights, while still
having a pronounced anti-Islamic position (Akkerman & Hagelund, 2007). This switch in
attitude to the gender equality debate could in theory also attract more women to the PRR
parties. However, as the results in this study identified no significant gender gap changes over
time, apart from in the SD, this instrumentalizing of gender in the PRR parties does not seem
to have led to an increase in women, at least not in the time span covered in this study.

1.2.3 Voluntary gender quotas
Party elites and executive branches can have a direct effect on the gender-representation gap
by, among other things, employing voluntary gender quotas or by considering gender equality
when recruiting candidates for elections. Voluntary gender quotas in political parties have
been proven to have a positive effect on the percentage of women in parliament (e.g., Rosen,
2017). Dahlerup (2011) states that while no official (legally mandated) gender quotas
concerning listed candidates, elected representatives, or members of internal party organs are
employed in the Nordic countries, many Nordic parties employ voluntary gender quotas
internally in their party organs or, at minimum, consider gender balance when choosing listed
candidates and when putting candidates in a certain order on the party lists in elections.
Dahlerup (2011, p. 71) adds that not least “in Norway and Sweden the voluntary quota rules
of the political parties have had considerable influence on the proportions of nominated and
elected women (Freidenvall et al, 2006, table 3.2, pp 71–72).” The Nordic PRR parties,
however, have not employed voluntary gender quotas (Alnevall, 2009; Hart, Kovalainen, &
Holli, 2009; Langvasbråten, 2009; Niskanen 2011). This could in turn explain the differences
in gender gaps between the PRR and non-PRR parties.
As mentioned earlier, the Nordic PRR parties have often argued against intervention and
affirmative action in the shape of for example quotas, in addition to pointing out that gender
equality is something already achieved. The PRR parties might consequently want to attract
women as active members and candidates to increase their electoral support among women.
However, they are generally opposed to implementing tools to achieve greater gender balance
in their parties and among their politicians. The differences between the PRR parties’ low
level of female representation and the higher level in the non-PRR parties can therefore be a
100

Anna Lillkung
result of differences in employing voluntary quotas or considering gender balance. This
argument is particularly compelling since all Danish parties have abolished gender quotas
(Niskanen, 2011), and that could in turn explain why the same large gender gap differences
between the DF and the other Danish parties could not be observed.
However, the results also showed that the Norwegian, Finnish, and Swedish conservative
parties had significantly smaller gender gaps than the PRR parties, despite not employing
voluntary gender quotas (Niskanen, 2011). Voluntary gender quotas alone can therefore not
explain the differences in gender gaps. Instead, gender quotas should be seen as part of the
greater ideological approach to gender that political parties have. While a party might not
employ voluntary quotas, it can still strive for gender balance generally. The Swedish
conservative party, for example, does not employ gender quotas, but the large share of women
in the party, both as listed candidates, elected representatives, and internally in the party
organs, suggest that female representation is important to and prioritized by the party. In
Finland, the norm in most mainstream parties has similarly been to nominate at least 40
percent women for different elections (Hart, Kovalainen, & Holli, 2009). Voluntary gender
quotas, in addition to the party’s general approach to gender balance, can therefore be useful
to consider when investigating the gender-representation gap.
The SD also stands out from the other Nordic PRR parties in this respect, as it has taken some
formal measures to increase its share of women, albeit not voluntary quotas. In 2014, the SD
included “a more pronounced and developed political programme on gender issues, advocated
by a new gender-equality representative of the party, who, following accusations of
antifeminism, defined herself as “essentialist feminist”” (Mulinari & Neergaard, 2017, p. 16).
To secure stronger support from women, the party announced new policies, e.g., “the right to
full-time employment for women, who are often forced directly or indirectly to take part-time
jobs, and parliamentary lists containing more women candidates (15 % to 22 %)” (Mulinari &
Neergaard, 2017, p. 16). When comparing the SD’s and the PS’s female politicians’ views on
gender, Pettersson (2017, p. 19) showed that the SD women were more ambivalent and not as
“unanimously anti-feminist” as the PS women. Pettersson argued that this was a result of the
SD having to negotiate their views against a strong feminist movement, whereas a similarly
strong movement did not exist in Finland. The SD still has a large gender gap compared to the
other PRR parties, but the party’s actions to increase its share of women may have led to the
gender gap decreasing in the last elections.

1.2.4 Electoral system effect on the gender-representation gap
Another potential structural factor that could affect the gender-representation gap is the type
of electoral system. The Nordic countries all employ proportional representation (PR) systems
through which parties and candidates are elected. However, they employ different types of PR
systems. In Finland, voters can only cast personal votes (Hopmann & Karlsen, 2021).
Denmark, Norway, and Sweden employ different open or semi-open party list systems, which
means that voters can vote for a party, and consequently on the party’s preferred order of
candidates to be elected, but they can also give a preference vote to the candidate on the party
list that they prefer (Hopmann & Karlsen, 2021). The practical effect of the preferential
voting on candidates differs in each country. Denmark utilizes an open list-system where
personal votes cast usually matter (Hansen & Kosiara-Pedersen, 2017). Here, the parties can
choose whether they employ fully open lists or semi-closed lists. Sweden has semi-open lists
where the preferential votes rarely affect the order of elected candidates, while preferential
votes in Norway in practice have no consequence at all, as half of a party’s voters must want
to change the political party’s candidate list in order for the preference votes to alter the list
(Hopmann & Karlsen, 2011). The gender gap among elected representatives is consequently
fully a result of the voters’ decisions in Finland and partly a result of the voters’ decisions in
Denmark, while it is mainly a result of decisions by the party elite in Sweden and especially
in Norway. In this study, however, the electoral system did not seem to notably affect the
results as there were no significant differences between the gender gap among listed
candidates and the gender gap among elected representatives.
While a study by Golder et al. (2017) concluded that more open systems (i.e., open lists with
preference voting and panachage elections, with the possibility of casting preference votes
across different parties) were associated with more votes for women, the results here did not
reflect the same tendency of voter demand for female candidates outpacing elite demand. The
PS, for example, generally had a larger gender gap among its elected representatives than
among its listed candidates, on both the national and local level. This demonstrates that the
Finnish voters prioritized women less than the PS party elite did. In the SD, on the other hand,
the gender gap among elected representatives decreased while the gender gap among listed
candidates remained the same, indicating that the SD party elite prioritized women and placed
them higher up on their party lists in later elections. Kjær and Krook (2019, p. 449) have
argued that in the case of Denmark:

102

Anna Lillkung
“…voters – especially on the right – do compensate for negative bias on the part
of elites. In the case of the Danish People’s Party, preference voting reduced the
overall gap to −1.5, suggesting that voters sought to correct the strong bias in
favor of men”.
This can arguably be seen in this study’s results regarding national elections where the DF’s
gender gap among elected representatives was smaller (13.4 percentage points) than among
the listed candidates (17.5 points). However, on the local level, the gender gap difference was
only 0.1 percentage points between DF’s listed candidates and elected representatives. Thus,
both PRR voters and PRR party elites seem to prefer male representatives.
It could theoretically also be argued that the smaller gender gap in the DF, compared with the
gender gaps in the other PRR parties, is an effect of the Danish voters being able to cast
personal votes and thus voting more women in, which the study by Golder et al. (2017)
suggests. However, as the gender gap in the PS in Finland, the Nordic country that provides
its citizens with the most potential to vote women in, was not smaller compared to the other
PRR parties’ gender gaps, this would be a premature conclusion. This study also did not
include data on whether the DF employed open or semi-closed lists in the past elections,
which would have to be researched to shine further light on the effect of the electoral system
on the gender gap in the PRR parties.
Lastly, the Nordic countries employ varying legal electoral thresholds for election to the
national parliaments (Hansen & Kosiara-Pedersen, 2018). Electoral thresholds mean that a
party must receive a certain percentage of the total vote to obtain a seat in the parliament. The
Nordic countries have the following electoral thresholds: 4 percent (Norway and Sweden), 2
percent (Denmark), and no electoral threshold (Finland) (Hansen & Kosiara-Pedersen, 2017).
Norris (2005) has concluded that lower electoral thresholds facilitate the share of seats won
by populist radical right parties. This could also affect the gender-representation gap in the
parliamentary arena. If a PRR party can secure a greater share of seats, it could have a
positive effect on the percentage of women obtaining seats if these women were on the
candidate lists, but not at the top of them. However, in the results of the empirical study, there
were no clear differences between the PRR gender gaps in the Nordic countries with higher
and with lower electoral thresholds.

1.3 Summary: Are the PRR parties Männerparteien?
The results indicate that an overrepresentation of men exists in all Nordic PRR parties. In
Norway, Finland, and Sweden, this overrepresentation was also significantly larger than in the
non-PRR parties. The label Männerparteien thus seems relevant for the PRR parties, at least
in Norway, Finland, and Sweden, based on the level of female representation in the last three
parliamentary and municipal elections as well as in the party councils and party leadership.
No other explanations were additionally identified (effect of electoral systems, quotas, etc.)
that could explain the notably larger gender gaps in the PRR parties compared to in the nonPRR parties. The DF cannot as easily be considered a “men’s party,” as the DF’s gender gaps
were not markedly larger compared to the Danish parties’ gender gaps on average. The DF
nevertheless had significant gender gaps that were often on par with the gender gaps in the
other Nordic PRR parties and could thus arguably still be considered a Männerpartei.

2. The Contagion theory: Have the PRR parties’ gender gaps
decreased over time?
The third research question focused on how women’s political representation in the PRR
parties has evolved over time, and whether a contagion effect can be observed. This contagion
effect would entail that the populist radical right parties have strategically adapted their level
of female representation to the (higher) level of other parties to maximize their electoral
support. Högström (2019) theorizes that as a PRR party quickly increases its support, there
might be an initial negative effect on the percentage of female representatives in politics as
the gender-representation gap in the PRR parties is larger than in other main parties.
Högström then suggests that a contagion effect occurs where the PRR parties increase their
percentage of women as they become more mainstream, which means that the percentage of
women increases over time.
The expectation concerning the contagion theory was that as the PRR parties have become
more mainstream in their respective Nordic country, they have increased the percentage of
women primarily among the parties’ listed candidates, but also in the party councils and party
leadership, to approach the percentage of women in other main parties and thereby maximize
their electoral support. It was consequently hypothesized that as the PRR parties have become
more established or secured more seats in parliament, their gender gap has decreased to come
closer to the gender gap sizes in the other main parties. An important aspect here was that the
PRR parties in Norway and Denmark have a longer history of electoral success and
104

Anna Lillkung
popularity. It can therefore be argued that the DF and the FrP as more mainstream in their
respective countries, to begin with, compared with the SD and the PS.
Considering the gender gap changes in each Nordic PRR party, the results generally did not
support the contagion theory. A clear and consistent gender gap decrease was nevertheless
observed in the SD, especially among the party’s listed candidates throughout the last three
local and general elections. Since the other main Swedish parties had notably smaller gender
gaps on average that the SD could adapt to, the results arguably reflect a contagion effect in
Sweden, where the SD has adapted the party’s percentage of women so that it has approached
the level of female representation in the other Swedish main parties. The decreases in the
SD’s gender gaps were also significantly larger than the gender gap changes in other Swedish
non-PRR parties. They moreover occurred as the SD gained more electoral support and
secured more seats in the national parliament, which supports the contagion thesis.
The gender gaps in the DF, the FrP, and the PS, however, only changed marginally in the
period studied. In fact, the gender gaps tended to slightly increase rather than decrease in
these parties. In Norway and Finland, the gender gaps in the FrP and the PS remained notably
larger than the gender gaps in the main non-PRR parties. In Denmark, the starting point was
different as the main non-PRR parties in Denmark had gender gaps of similar size as the DF.
The gender gaps also did not change notably, neither in the DF nor in the other main Danish
parties. It was therefore not possible to prove a contagion effect in Denmark based on the data
collected, as there was no higher level of female representation in the other parties that the DF
could adapt to. However, that does not necessarily mean that a contagion effect has not taken
place earlier in Denmark.
The results regarding the contagion theory can be viewed from another perspective. The FrP
and the DF, and to some extent the PS, can be considered more mainstream and more
established than the SD to begin with. The three former PRR parties have existed for a longer
period of time than the SD and have secured more seats on average in the last three general
elections. These three parties also had a greater share of secured seats at the time of “election
1” compared to the SD. A contagion effect can possibly have taken place earlier in these more
established and mainstream PRR parties. This could in turn explain why the SD had the
largest gender gap of the PRR parties. As the SD is the youngest, electorally relevant, party of
the four Nordic PRR parties, it could be theorized that the party is only now in the process of
adapting its gender equality ratio to the one in other main Swedish parties.

105

Anna Lillkung
This line of thought certainly could explain the gender gap patterns seen in Denmark and
Sweden: The DF would then have stabilized its gender gap at a smaller size that is
comparable to the gender gap average in Danish parties, while the SD is still in the process of
doing so. The percentage of women among listed candidates in the DF did indeed increase
from 22 percent to 29 percent in the 2001 to 2007 (Fiig, 2009). This percentage has also
remained above 30 percent in the last three elections. This could hint at a possible contagion
effect having taken place earlier, when the DF was a newer, less established party, with the
share of women stabilizing at the current level.
However, this explanation is not as convincing when attempting to explain the gender gap
patterns observed in the Norwegian and Finnish PRR parties. The Norwegian FrP is older
than the DF and has secured a large proportion of seats in the last three national and local
elections in Norway. The gender gap in the FrP has despite this remained ostensibly larger
than in the other Norwegian parties and showed no tendency of approaching these parties’
gender gaps in the results of this thesis. The gender gap in the PS has similarly displayed no
indications of decreasing over time or mimicking the level of female representation in other
Finnish main parties. As this study did not include data going further back in time for the FrP
and the PS, it is not possible to say that an adaptation of the level of female representation has
not occurred earlier in the Norwegian and Finnish PRR parties. However, the gender gaps in
the FrP and the PS evidently continue to be significantly larger than in the other main
Norwegian and Finnish parties.
Additionally, it remains to be seen if the SD will continue to decrease its gender gap in the
next few elections. If the gender gap stabilizes at the current level in the SD, it is possible that
the Nordic PRR parties do adapt to the gender balance of other main parties, but only to a
certain, arguably quite small, degree. This occurrence could be seen in light of the saturation
theory, which holds that female representation in general stagnates at a point where both
women and men, both in the party organizations that nominate candidates and among the
voters, are satisfied with the present level of female representation (Kjær 2001). This theory
has been criticized for not being empirically tested enough and because the level of female
representation seems to stagnate at different levels in different contexts (Niskanen, 2011).
However, it could be a helpful framework through which one can view and investigate the
contagion effect in the PRR parties. Potentially, these parties adapt their level of female
representation to that of other parties, as seen in the case of the SD, but are arguably satisfied
at a considerably lower level than most non-PRR parties. This is an area that future research
106

Anna Lillkung
could investigate by examining how the gender balance in the Nordic PRR parties has
evolved during a longer period of time than this study did.
There might also be other explanations as to why the gender gap has decreased in the SD but
not in the other Nordic PRR parties. This could be a result of (1) gender equality having a
different status in Sweden compared to in the other Nordic countries and thus creating
stronger incentives to increase the percentage of women, and (2) the SD’s actions and
decisions to promote women’s role internally. The results show that the percentage of women
in the electoral and parliamentary arenas generally was on a similar level in Norwegian,
Finnish, and Swedish parties, but Sweden was nevertheless the only country where the
average percentage of women consistently was above 40 percent in the last three local and
general elections. Additionally, Borchorst (2008, p. 38) emphasizes the differences between
Sweden, on the one hand, and Norway and Denmark, on the other: “Gender equality as a
political project has been more consistent in Sweden than in the two other countries…” From
that perspective, Sweden has arguably come the furthest concerning implementing gender
equality as a political project, which in turn could explain why the SD is more pressured to
increase its share of women compared with the PRR parties in the other Nordic countries.
This perspective is strengthened by Pettersson’s (2017) comparative study of women in the
PS and the SD, which demonstrated that the SD women tended to be more ambiguous and
less overtly anti-feminist compared to the PS women, as a result of having to negotiate their
views with a strong feminist movement that did not exist in Finland.
Secondly, the SD has also promoted gender equality internally and in their politics since 2014
(Mulinari & Neergaard, 2017), which in turn may have attracted more women to become
active in the party, but also led to the party prioritizing women when putting candidates on
their party lists in elections. In Denmark, in contrast, gender balance is far from being
achieved in all Danish parties. The debate on gender equality is also largely absent in
Denmark, especially compared to in other Nordic countries (Niskanen, 2011), which will be
discussed more in the next part of this chapter.
To conclude, the Nordic PRR parties generally seem to have reached a plateau regarding
female representation. Besides in the SD, the gender gap in the Nordic PRR parties did not
change considerably in the last three local and general elections. A contagion effect could
consequently not be proved, but future research could benefit from investigating the
percentage of women in the PRR parties further back in time. Within the scope of this study,
measures that the PRR parties may have taken to attract female members and candidates were
107

Anna Lillkung
not analyzed. Future research could thus also investigate the recruitment practices of the PRR
parties. Examining the recruitment practices overall is important as it is generally the political
parties that have “monopoly on nominating the candidates to be presented to the voters”
(Dahlerup, 2011, p. 69). Another aspect that could be studied is to what extent the women in
the PRR parties are related (siblings, spouses, children etc.) to male PRR politicians, since
Mudde (2007) has claimed that this is a common, and particular, phenomenon in PRR parties.

3. The Danish exception
Denmark frequently diverged from the other Nordic countries in the results. The Danish
results were also paradoxical: the gender gap in the DF was generally the smallest of the
Nordic PRR parties, while the gender gaps in the Danish parties on average were significantly
larger than in the other Nordic countries’ parties. There are a few potential explanations for
this.
First, conclusions in previous research about gender in Danish politics need to be addressed.
The fact that the gender balance in Danish parties is more skewed, with men significantly
outnumbering the women, compared to in the other Nordic countries has been discussed by
both Dahlerup (2011) and Melby et al. (2008). Melby et al. (2008) argue that while official
gender-equality policies have been developed in Sweden and Norway (Finland was not
included in the study), the same has not occurred in Denmark. Similarly, Christensen (2008,
p. 187) has pointed out that “several studies have shown that, since the mid-1980s, gender
policies have been more anonymous and more antagonistic in the Danish public sphere than
in the Norwegian and the Swedish (Bergqvist et al, 1999; Fiig, 2003).” Christensen (2008, p.
187) adds that the label “feminism” is more negatively loaded in Denmark compared to in
Sweden and Norway: “In Sweden the predominant attitude is that equality is far from
achieved, and most political parties promote themselves as feminist. In Denmark the debate is
much more ambiguous and ambivalent, and the Danish parties focus very little on equality
and do not see themselves as feminist.” The lack of debate about the low percentage of
women in politics has moreover been argued to be an important factor explaining the
stagnation of female representation (Dahlerup, 2011). Therefore, several factors have been
identified as making the hegemonic discourse on gender equality in Sweden, Norway, and
Finland different from the one in Denmark. The saturation theory, which was mentioned
earlier, has also mainly been applied in Denmark to explain the stagnating level of female

108

Anna Lillkung
representation, as the level of female representation has not stagnated at similarly low levels
in the other Nordic countries.
The smaller share of women in Danish parties and politics overall explains why the DF’s
gender gap is on par with the Danish parties’ gender gap averages. However, this does not
explain why the DF generally had smaller gender gaps when compared with the other PRR
parties. It is important to mention that the DF’s gender gaps were not significantly smaller
than the other PRR parties’ gender gaps, but it was nonetheless a recurring pattern that the
DF’s gender gap was the smallest. It also seems paradoxical that the PRR party in the country
with the largest gender gaps on average would have the smallest gender gap of all the Nordic
PRR parties. However, this same pattern has been documented regarding the genderelectorate gap, i.e., the gender gap among the PRR electorate. Givens (2004) found that being
a woman did not have a significant effect on populist radical right voting in Denmark.
Immerzeel, Coffé, and van der Lippe (2015) also found that there was only a minor gender
gap among PRR voters in Denmark, while the gender gap was significant in Norway.
The small gender gaps in the DF might therefore potentially be related to the debate on gender
equality largely being missing in Denmark. Since the Danish political parties in general do not
emphasize or praise gender equality, the DF’s stances on the subject could in this context be
considered less ‘extreme’ and controversial, especially compared to the FrP, the SD, and the
PS. The latter three PRR parties have diverged more considerably and noticeably from the
ideological positions with respect to gender that the main parties in their respective countries
have adopted (Melby et al., 2008; Pettersson, 2017). Consequently, the FrP, the SD, and the
PS might seem more ‘anti-women’, compared to the DF, even if no actual significant
differences between how these four parties view and relate to the gender equality discourse
exist. This could, in turn, explain why women in Norway, Finland, and Sweden are less
inclined to join the PRR parties than women are in Denmark. The DF might simply be
regarded as a better option for women in Denmark due to the other Danish parties being
equally bad as regards gender equality, or, in some cases, even worse.
Another factor that could explain the DF’s comparatively smaller gender gaps is the influence
of the former party leader and party co-founder Pia Kjærsgaard. Having a female leader has in
the case of France and the National Rally opened the party especially to women (Dubslaff,
2017). Ladam et al. (2018) have moreover argued that prominent women in politics serve as
role models for other women who are interested in political careers, inspiring them to run for
office, and Sundström and Stockemer (2021) have found that parties with a female leader
109

Anna Lillkung
have a significantly larger share of female MEPs than parties with male leaders. It could thus
be argued that Kjærsgaard, who led the DF from the party’s inception in 1995 until 2012, has
inspired more women to join the DF compared with the PRR parties in the other Nordic
countries. Kjærsgaard’s time as party leader exceeds the Norwegian FrP’s Siv Jensen’s time
as leader by several years, which could explain why a similarly strong effect has not been
observed in Norway.
While Meret (2015) has analyzed the role of Kjærsgaard in detail, no study has examined the
effect Kjærsgaard has had on Danish women specifically. Meret (2015, p. 96) nevertheless
concludes that:
“Pia Kjærsgaard also offers an alternative to the Scandinavian model of
womanhood and motherhood associated with gender equality and ‘overall’ liberal
feminist approaches to questions of gender. She is portrayed as the responsible
and caring mother, who stayed at home to take care of her children until they grew
up, before becoming the mother of a whole party that she ‘gave birth to’ and cared
for until it was well rooted in Danish politics.”
While Michel et al. (2020) have shown that voters’ evaluation of PRR leaders are
significantly associated with voting for PRR parties, more so than for other parties’ voters,
Meret’s (2015) study claims that Kjærsgaard has not influenced the voting for the DF at all,
and that one should thus not overstate the role of her leadership in gaining support.
Considering the large gender gap in the DF’s party councils over the past ten years, one
cannot see a clear effect of having had a female leader on the gender gap in that internal
structure. Kjærsgaard might nevertheless have inspired women to join the DF as members and
listed candidates or encouraged the party to have other recruitment practices concerning
women compared to the other Nordic PRR parties.
To conclude, there are several potential explanations that can explicate why the gender gap
differences between the Danish PRR party and the other Danish main parties, are not as
remarkable as in the other Nordic countries. This chapter has offered a few suggestions, but
additional research must be conducted to provide more elaborate explanations. Another
interesting aspect of the Danish position as an outlier is that Denmark fits Mudde’s
descriptions of the PRR party gender gaps better than the other Nordic PRR parties do.
Mudde’s (2007) argument that the gender gap in the PRR parties is not significantly larger
than in other parties, particularly compared to conservative right-wing parties, fits the Danish
110

Anna Lillkung
situation, as the DF’s gender gaps on average were not far removed from the gender gaps in
other parties. This could indicate that Denmark, in this respect, is more closely related to
countries in central Europe than to the Nordic countries. Considering that Denmark also
reflects the EU average of representation of women at the local level (Dahl & Nyrup, 2021)
and that the level of female representation has stagnated at a similar level in the Netherlands
(Dahlerup, 2011), the gendered aspects of Danish politics possibly resemble the continental
European countries more than the other Nordic countries.

4. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research
4.1 Limitations of the study
A few limitations of the study need to be addressed. First, some of the decisions taken to limit
the scope of the study also limited the analysis of the data. The gender gaps in party councils,
to give an example, were not observed over time for the Nordic non-PRR parties. It was
consequently not possible to compare changes in the PRR parties’ party council gender gaps
over time with the gender gaps in the non-PRR parties. The PRR parties’ party council gender
gaps were compared with the gender gaps in the non-PRR parties’ party councils in 2020–
2021. However, it was not possible to apprehend how representative the gender composition
in the most current party council was for how this gender composition had been in the nonPRR parties in the last ten years.
Another limitation of the study was that it did not cover a longer time span. This mostly
affected the possibility to assess the contagion effect more thoroughly. By only focusing on
the last three parliamentary and municipal elections, and the internal arena in the last ten
years, it was merely possible to examine the contagion thesis in recent time. As the DF and
the FrP have been electorally relevant and had influence on national politics for several
decades, while the SD and the PS have shorter histories of electoral success, it thus remained
hypothetically possible that a contagion effect has occurred at an earlier point in time in the
older PRR parties. Moreover, the results showed that most parties, including the PRR parties,
change party leaders infrequently. Covering party leadership in a time span larger than the last
ten years may have presented a more comprehensive overview of the gender gap in party
leadership.
Third, while data was collected on the gender gap in all the main parties in the Nordic
countries, the comparative analysis was limited to the PRR parties, the conservative parties,
the social democratic parties, and to the non-PRR parties combined. A limitation of the study
111

Anna Lillkung
was consequently that it did not provide a more inclusive comparison between all nationally
electorally relevant parties, which potentially could have revealed new and different insights
than the ones achieved here. Moreover, the decision to categorize the DKF (Det Konservative
Folkeparti) as the main Danish conservative party instead of the largest Danish bourgeois
party, Venstre, can be questioned. In terms of ideological position, this decision was not of
major importance as both the DKF and Venstre have conservative right-wing positions.
However, as the DKF is a smaller party, the gender gaps observed in the party were based on
smaller sample sizes than would have been the case with Venstre. Hence, the DKF was
statistically more sensitive to small changes in the gender composition among listed
candidates and elected representatives than Venstre. The DKF was also smaller compared to
the other Nordic conservative parties used in the study.

4.2 Suggestions for future research
What should future research focus on in relation to the gender-representation gap in the PRR
parties? First, and in reference to the limitations of the study established above, future
quantitative research should investigate the contagion theory by examining changes in the
PRR parties’ gender gaps over a longer period of time. Such a study could also elaborate on
the internal arena by firstly collecting data on the changes in the non-PRR parties’ party
councils and secondly investigating the gender gap in party membership.
Another possibility is to do a large-N comparative study that not only compares the genderrepresentation gap in the Nordic countries, but in all Western and Northern European
countries. Such a study could illustrate how the gender-representation gap in the Nordic PRR
parties compares to the gender gaps in the PRR parties in continental Europe. Such research
could also reveal if the gender-representation gap in the Danish PRR party resembles the
gender gaps in the PRR parties in Central or Western Europe more than the gender gaps in the
other Nordic PRR parties.
Additionally, more studies of qualitative nature, investigating why there is a larger genderrepresentation gap in the PRR parties compared to in the other non-PRR parties, are
necessary. Thus far, few studies have explored why less women than men are active members
and politicians, both in the PRR parties generally, and in the Nordic PRR parties specifically.
Future research could thus include interviews with women in the Nordic PRR parties to
establish what has motivated them to join PRR parties. Such interviews could also test
Mudde’s (2007) thesis that a relatively large share of women who are active in the PRR
112

Anna Lillkung
parties are somehow related to men who are members and politicians in these parties.
Additionally, interviews could be conducted with the party elites in the PRR parties, to
observe their attitudes to and opinions on gender equality in the parties’ internal, electoral,
and parliamentary arenas, as well as to examine their recruitment practices.

5. Conclusive remarks
To conclude, this thesis firstly provided a research overview of the scholarly work conducted
on gender and the populist radical right. The overview identified that the research gap in this
research area was the greatest when it came to the supply-side and the gender-representation
gap. An empirical study was secondly conducted to contribute to this understudied body of
research by investigating the gender-representation gap in the Nordic PRR parties and how
this gap has changed over time. The results showed that the Nordic PRR parties generally had
large gender-representation gaps. In Norway, Finland, and Sweden, the gender gaps were also
considerably greater in the PRR parties than in the non-PRR parties on average, as well as
compared to the gender gaps in the social democratic and conservative parties. The DF was an
outlier in the results as its gender-representation gap, despite being of similar size as the other
Nordic PRR parties’ gender gaps, also was on par with the gender-representation gaps in the
other main Danish parties. Lastly, the results did not support the contagion thesis as the PRR
parties’ gender-representation gaps did not decrease, apart from in the Sweden Democrats.

Avhandlingens titel på svenska:
Manspartier i jämställda oaser – skillnader i manlig och kvinnlig representation i de nordiska
populistiska radikalhögerpartierna

1. Introduktion
Sedan augusti 2021 leds två av de fyra nordiska populistiska radikalhögerpartierna –
Fremskrittspartiet

och

Sannfinländarna

–

av

kvinnor.

Det

är

därmed

endast

Sverigedemokraterna som inte haft en kvinnlig partiledare, eftersom Dansk Folkeparti under
många år leddes av Pia Kjærsgaard. Ändå kopplas denna partifamilj primärt ihop med
karismatiska manliga ledare så som Jean Marie Le Pen (Nationell samling, Frankrike), Jörg
Haider (Frihetspartiet, Österrike) och Carl I Hagen (Fremskrittspartiet, Norge). Forskning har
också visat att partifamilj har en inverkan på andelen kvinnor som partierna representeras av i
riksdagen (Sundström & Stockemer, 2021). Populistiska radikalhögerpartier (PRH-partier)
har bevisats ha en större överrepresentation av män i jämförelse med vänsterpartier (t.ex.
Mudde, 2007; Rashkova & Zankina, 2017). Denna överrepresentation av män, både bland de
som röstar på PRH-partierna och bland de som är aktiva som medlemmar och ledamöter i
dessa partier, har lett till att partierna kallas för Männerparteien – manspartier (Mudde, 2007).
Forskning om genus och den populistiska radikalhögern har blivit vanligare under det senaste
årtiondet, men forskare har samtidigt påpekat att det finns forskningsluckor, i synnerhet
gällande forskning kring hur könsrepresentationen ser ut i PRH-partierna. Även om många
har en bild av att denna partifamilj domineras av män, är detta något som inte granskats i så
många empiriska studier (Mudde, 2007). Det är också därför som de kvinnliga partiledarna i
Norden intresserar. Kan det vara så att PRH-partierna inkluderar fler kvinnor desto mer
väletablerade och framgångsrika de är? Och finns det könsskillnader i den deskriptiva
representationen i populisthögerpartierna i Norden?
Studier som berör kvinnornas representation i politiken behandlar ofta tre olika former av
representation:

deskriptiv

representation,

substantiell

representation

och

symbolisk

representation (se Pitkin 1967). Deskriptiv representation berör andelen kvinnor som
representeras i olika politiska organ och utgår generellt från premissen att eftersom kvinnor
utgör drygt 50 procent av befolkningen så ska kvinnor finnas representerade i olika
beslutsfattande organ i ungefär samma utsträckning som män. Den substantiella
114

Anna Lillkung
representationen handlar om vilka konsekvenser som en ökad närvaro av kvinnor i politiken
faktiskt får, det vill säga bland annat vilka förändringar som kvinnliga politiker för med sig
(Lawless, 2004). Den symboliska representationen handlar om de attityd- och
beteendeeffekter som kvinnors närvaro i politiska maktpositioner överför på kvinnliga
medborgare (Lawless, 2004). Studier har också visat att feministiska och vänsterorienterade
partier har varit ledande förespråkare för kvinnors intressen i parlamentet, med kvinnliga
representanter som är mer sannolika än deras manliga kollegor att föra fram kvinnors problem
och förespråka kvinnorörelsens agenda (Celis & Erzeel, 2015). Detta påpekar vikten av att
undersöka kvinnors representation i olika partier, inte minst i de populistiska
radikalhögerpartierna.
När man enbart studerar partiledarna för PRH-partierna i dag kan man ifrågasätta begreppet
Männerparteien. Andra PRH-partier, exempelvis Nationell samling i Frankrike och
Australiens One Nation, leds också av kvinnor. Men medan kvinnligt ledarskap bevisats ha en
positiv effekt på andelen kvinnor bland partiers riksdagsledamöter (Sundström & Stockemer,
2021), är det oklart om överrepresentationen av män i PRH-partierna, till exempel bland dessa
partiers riksdagsledamöter, kommunfullmäktigeledamöter och i partiernas styrande organ,
också minskat.
1.2 Syften och tillvägagångssätt
Denna pro gradu-avhandling har två olika syften. Det första syftet är att ge en fördjupad
litteraturöversikt över området genus och populistiska radikalhögern och utröna vilka
kunskapsluckor som finns. I litteraturöversikten beskrivs och behandlas tre olika delar av
forskningen kring genus och den populistiska radikalhögern. Det andra syftet är att bidra till
att krympa den största forskningsluckan inom området genom att empiriskt studera
könsrepresentationsklyftan (”gender-representation gap”) i de nordiska populistiska
radikalhögerpartierna. Den empiriska studien undersöker därför könsklyftan (”gender gap”)
bland dessa partiers kandidater, ledamöter, partistyrelsemedlemmar och partiledare. Dessa
skillnader i könsrepresentation undersöks på olika politiska arenor (se Sjöblom, 1968), på
både nationell och lokal nivå. Könsklyftorna undersöks också över en längre period för att ta
reda på om PRH-partierna har anpassat sin nivå av kvinnorepresentation till nivån i de övriga
nordiska partierna, vilket skulle innebära att en så kallad ”smittoeffekt” (”contagion effect”)
har ägt rum (Högström, 2019). Skillnaderna i männens och kvinnornas representation i PRHpartierna jämförs med motsvarande skillnader i övriga icke-PRH-partier i de nordiska
länderna.
115

Anna Lillkung
Den empiriska delen av avhandlingen har fokus på könsrepresentationsklyftorna i de
populistiska högerpartierna i specifikt Norden av flera anledningar. De nordiska länderna har
först och främst sett framväxten av populistiska högerpartier – Dansk Folkeparti (DF),
Fremskrittspartiet (FP), Sannfinländarna (SAF) och Sverigedemokraterna (SD) – under de
senaste 40–50 åren, med Island som enda undantag (Herkman & Jungar, 2021; Jungar &
Jupskås, 2014). Dessa fyra partier har under de senaste årtiondena alla fått invalda ledamöter i
sina respektive nationella parlament, vilket gör att de kan studeras ur ett komparativt
perspektiv. De nordiska länderna har också generellt upplevt framväxten av partier som tillhör
samma partifamiljer (Jungar & Jupskås, 2014; Nedergaard & Wivel, 2017). De nordiska
länderna har haft en partimodell bestående av fem partier: ett vänster-/kommunistparti, ett
socialdemokratiskt parti, ett agrarparti, ett liberalt parti och ett konservativt parti. I dag har de
flesta nordiska länderna sett en ökning av partier som hör till de kristdemokratiska och gröna
partifamiljerna, utöver partier som hör till den populistiska radikalhögern. Denna snarlika
partipolitiska utveckling möjliggör jämförande av könsrepresentationen i PRH-partier med
könsrepresentationen i icke-PRH-partier som liknar varandra i Norden. De nordiska länderna
liknar också varandra på andra sätt, till exempel genom att alla har den ”Nordiska modellen”,
vilket innebär de sociala och ekonomiska policyer som associeras med den nordiska
välfärdsstaten och att erbjuda sina medborgare en liknande livskvalitet (Simon, 2017). De
nordiska länderna har även liknande politiska system och strukturer.
De nordiska länderna utgör också lämpliga länder att undersöka könsrepresentation i eftersom
dessa länder generellt ses som de främsta i världen när det gäller jämställdhet. De har
historiskt sett legat i framkant gällande jämställdhet mellan könen genom att bland annat ha
en dubbelförsörjarmodell (”dual breadwinner model”) som innebär att både män och kvinnor
jobbar (Tanhua, 2020). De nordiska länderna har även en hög andel kvinnor i sina olika
politiska organ. Per 1 september 2021 låg kvinnoandelen i riksdagen på 46 procent i Finland,
47 procent i Sverige och 44,4 procent i Norge (IPU Parline, 2021). Danmark var det enda
landet som låg under 40 procent, med en kvinnoandel på 39,7 procent (IPU Parline, 2021).
Avhandlingen består därmed både av en fördjupad litteraturöversikt och av den empiriska
studien som undersöker klyftor i könsrepresentationen i de nordiska PRH-partierna.
1.3 Sammanfattningens struktur
Denna svenska sammanfattning av pro gradu-avhandlingen är uppdelad i fyra olika kapitel.
Det andra kapitlet innehåller den fördjupade litteraturöversikten och utgör en sammanslagning
av kapitel 2 och 3 i den fullständiga avhandlingen på engelska. I kapitel 3 summeras den
116

Anna Lillkung
empiriska delen av avhandlingen. I detta kapitel presenteras forskningsfrågorna mer
detaljerat, samt forskningsdesignen och metodiken. I kapitlet redogörs även för resultatet av
den empiriska studien. Kapitel 4 innehåller den avslutande diskussionen och studiens
slutsatser.

2. Litteraturöversikt
Den populistiska radikalhögern började växa fram på 1980-talet med frammarschen av partier
som Nationella fronten (Frankrike) och Frihetspartiet (Österrike). Denna grupp av partier har
haft många olika etiketter, exempelvis extremhöger, radikalhöger, högerpopulism och
populistisk nationalism (Mudde, 2007). Denna avhandling använder Muddes (2007) definition
av ”populist radikalhöger”, som menar att denna partifamilj innefattar tre ideologiska särdrag:
nativism, auktoritarism och populism. I min kategorisering av de nordiska partier som tillhör
den populistiska radikalhögerfamiljen har jag använt mig av en studie av Jungar och Jupskås
(2014) där de argumenterar för att i synnerhet Dansk Folkeparti, Sannfinländarna och
Sverigedemokraterna har gått samman ideologiskt och tydligt hör till samma partifamilj, men
att också Fremskrittspartiet kan räknas till denna partifamilj även om FrP har vissa särdrag,
främst sin mera liberala ekonomiska position och att ekonomiska frågor anses vara viktigare
för FrP än till exempel sociala och moraliska frågor.
Medan PRH-partier har varit föremål för mycket forskning under de senaste årtiondena har
genusdimensionen av dessa partier inte rönt samma frekventa intresse (Doná, 2020; Mudde,
2007). Forskning om Västeuropas populistiska radikalhöger identifierade en könsklyfta tidigt
(Allen & Goodman, 2020). Det är dock först på senare tid som mer forskning bedrivits kring
kön och den populistiska radikalhögern. Forskning inom detta ämnesområde kan ytterligare
delas in i tre olika grenar: forskning kring könsklyftor bland de som röstar på denna
partigrupp (t.ex. Coffé, 2018; Harteveld et al., 2015; Spierings & Zaslove, 2017), forskning
kring genusaspekter i partiernas ideologi, diskurs och agenda (t.ex. de Lange & Mügge, 2015;
Ralph-Maddow,

2020;

Rashkova

&

Zankina,

2017),

samt

forskning

kring

könsrepresentationen i dessa partier (t.ex. Högström, 2019; Luhtakallio & Ylä-Anttila, 2017;
Mudde, 2007; Mulinari & Neergaard, 2017).
2.1 Könsspecifika skillnader i röstandet på PRH-partier
Flera studier har konkluderat att det finns en skillnad mellan män och kvinnor vad gäller
röstandet på PRH-partier. Kvinnor röstar på dessa partier i betydligt mindre utsträckning än
män (t.ex. Coffé, 2018; Harteveld et al., 2015; Immerzeel, Coffé & van der Lippe, 2015;
117

Anna Lillkung
Mudde, 2007). Det verkar dock finnas stor variation mellan länder gällande hur stor denna
könsskillnad är (Immerzeel, Coffé & van der Lippe, 2015). Det finns också indikationer på att
denna skillnad mellan könen gällande röstande blir mindre, och kanske till och med håller på
att försvinna, i takt med att dessa partier blir mer etablerade (Spierings & Zaslove, 2015).
Medan forskare varit överens om att fler män än kvinnor som röstar på PRH-partier har det
funnits färre entydiga svar kring varför män och kvinnor röstar på dessa partier i olika
utsträckning. Studier som undersökt denna aspekt har snarare enbart kunnat förklara vilka
faktorer som inte kan förklara denna skillnad mellan könen (t.ex. Harteveld et al., 2015;
Mudde, 2007; Spierings & Zaslove, 2015). Ända in på 1990-talet var den primära
uppfattningen i framför allt feministiska cirklar att kvinnornas lägre understöd för
populistradikalhögern berodde på att färre kvinnor än män innehade populistiska
radikalhöger-åsikter (Mudde, 2007). Empiriska studier har dock visat att denna uppfattning
inte stämmer – kvinnor är lika benägna som män att inneha sådana åsikter och attityder
(Mudde, 2007). Spierings och Zaslove (2017) har påpekat att varken socioekonomisk position
eller olika attityder helt kan förklara könsskillnaderna i röstandet för de PRH-partierna. Två
andra förklaringar som förts fram i litteraturen är (1) att kvinnors större engagemang i kyrkan
gör dem mindre benägna att rösta för populistradikalhögern, och (2) att kvinnor att avskräckta
av dessa partiers antifeministiska ideologi (Coffé, 2018). Dessa förklaringar har dock inte
heller kunnat redogöra för könsskillnaderna (Coffé, 2018). Paradoxen är därmed att trots att
kvinnor är lika nativistiska, auktoritära och populistiska som män så röstar de i mindre
utsträckning på PRH-partier.
Mudde (2007) argumenterar för att en lägre nivå av politiskt självförtroende (”political
efficacy”) bland kvinnor kan förklara en stor del av den oproportionella könsrepresentationen
i PRH-partierna och bland deras röstare. Eftersom kvinnor har en lägre nivå av politiskt
intresse eller en lägre tro på förmågan att påverka politik (”efficacy”) leder det till att kvinnor
röstar på mer etablerade partier i stället för på nya partier (Mudde, 2007). En studie av
Immerzeel, Coffé och van der Lippe (2015) hittade inte stöd för Muddes teori, men Harteveld
och kollegor (2015, s. 122–123) skriver i liknande anda att kvinnor och män till stor del har
samma PRH-attityder, men att könsskillnaden i röstandet partiellt härstammar från
könsspecifika skillnader i hur man ser på avståndet mellan sin egen och PRH-partiernas
ideologiska position. Oberoende av ideologi framstår dessa partier som längre ifrån kvinnliga
än manliga röstare. Kvinnor tänker också på andra faktorer när de bestämmer vilket parti de
ska rösta på, vilket gör att ideologiska indikatorer är bättre på att förutspå om män än kvinnor
118

Anna Lillkung
kommer rösta på populistiska radikalhögern. Immerzeel, Coffé och van der Lippe (2015) har i
sin tur visat att vissa strukturella faktorer, så som anställningsstatus, yrkestyp och utbildning
till viss del kan förklara skillnader i röstandet mellan män och kvinnor.
2.2 Genusaspekter av populistiska radikalhögerns ideologi, diskurs och agenda
Andra studier har undersökt vilken roll som genus spelar i PRH-partiernas ideologier,
diskurser och agendor (t.ex. Akkerman, 2015; De Lange & Mügge, 2015). Denna
forskningsgren undersöker bland annat vilken roll familjepolicyer och synen på kvinnors och
sexuella minoriteters rättigheter har i dessa partiers politik och har karaktäriserat PRHpartierna som konservativa i förhållande till familjevärderingar och traditionella könsroller
(t.ex. Akkerman, 2015). Denna konservatism skiljer dessa partier åt från övriga konservativa
högerpartier (Akkerman, 2015), även om en del forskning tyder på att PRH-partierna har
ändrat sitt förhållningssätt till genusfrågor där denna problematik blivit mindre viktig för
partierna (Akkerman, 2015; Erzeel och Rashkova, 2017). Ett antal studier inom denna gren
har också undersökt hur PRH-partier använder jämställdhet mellan könen som ett instrument i
den nationella kontexten (Doná, 2020). Dessa partier kan ha en motsägelsefull position i
förhållande till jämställdhet där de är konservativa i frågor som berör familjen och kvinnors
rättigheter (t.ex. emot könskvotering), men understöder jämställdhet mellan könen när det
tjänar olika andra syften, till exempel för att påpeka att muslimska immigranter är emot
jämställdhet och därmed inte passar i västerländska samhällen.
Mudde (2007) har sagt att forskningen om genus i populistradikalhögern är bristfällig som
följd av ”feministisk partiskhet”. Detta har lett till att skribenter inte ger empiriska bevis för
denna partigrupps påstådda sexism (Mudde, 2007). Mudde tillägger att de få innehållsanalyser
av partiernas ideologi som gjorts inte understöder den stereotypiska bilden av relationen till
genus utan snarare visar att det inte finns en konsekvent syn på familj och genus inom
partifamiljen. Genus är därmed inte av primär vikt för populistradikalhögern utan används på
olika sätt i syfte att gynna andra frågor som är mer centrala för dessa partier. Mudde (2007)
beskriver dock några överensstämmelser inom partifamiljens genusideologi, nämligen att
kvinnopolitik jämställs med familjepolitik, att det finns ett starkt försvar av naturliga
skillnader mellan könen och att eftersom kvinnor är det enda kön som kan föda barn och
eftersom barn är väsentliga för nationen måste kvinnor skyddas. Mudde (2007) beskriver även
två olika synsätt på kvinnor inom partifamiljen: den traditionella och den moderna
traditionella synen. Han påstår att de flesta PRH-partier har en modern-traditionell syn. De
Lange och Mügge (2015) beskriver i sin tur att det finns tre olika synsätt: en modern, en
119

Anna Lillkung
modern-traditionell och en neotraditionell syn. De tillägger därmed den moderna synen med
argumentet att vissa partier inte passar in i Muddes uppdelning eftersom de understöder
jämlik lönesättning och kvinnors delaktighet på arbetsmarknaden utan att ha en neotraditionell
syn på familj eller genus och kön. De Lange och Mügge (2015) anser också att många
forskare underskattar variationen i genusideologi mellan PRH-partierna.
2.3 Könsrepresentation i populistiska radikalhögerpartierna
Den tredje och sista forskningsgrenen inom området genus och den populistiska radikalhögern
handlar om representationen av kvinnor i dessa partier, till exempel bland dessa partiers
medlemmar, ledamöter, kandidater och ledare. Enligt Mudde (2007) är partimedlemskap och
kvinnornas roll i partimedlemskapet delområden som det forskats minst om. Det finns ändå
ett antal studier som har undersökt den deskriptiva representationen av kvinnor specifikt i
PRH-partierna (t.ex. Erzeel & Rashkova, 2017; Högström, 2019; Luhtakallio & Ylä-Anttila,
2017; Mudde, 2007). Dessa studier har i regel funnit att männen är överrepresenterade bland
dessa partiers ledamöter och kandidater. Ett fåtal studier har också fokuserat på rollen av
kvinnliga partiledare, så som Marine Le Pen och Pia Kjærsgaard (t.ex. Dubslaff, 2017; Meret,
2015). Ett antal studier har ytterligare undersökt varför fler män än kvinnor finns
representerade i dessa partier (t.ex. Blee, 2017; Mulinari & Neergaard, 2017).
Mudde (2007) har påpekat att medan enbart ett fåtal kvinnor varit ledare för PRH-partierna så
är denna siffra inte markant lägre i jämförelse med andra partifamiljer. Mudde (2007) påpekar
också att medan kvinnor är underrepresenterade bland PRH-partiernas parlamentsledamöter
om man utgår från hur stor andel kvinnor utgör bland befolkningen i stort, är denna
underrepresentation inte särskilt utmärkande om man jämför med hur det ser ut i andra
politiska partier, i synnerhet inte i jämförelse med andra högerpartier. Samtidigt har en stor
andel av kvinnorna i PRH-partierna varit släkt eller på annat sätt involverade med manliga
medlemmar i partierna (Mudde, 2007). Det finns också studier som har undersökt kvinnors
deskriptiva representation mer generellt i europeiska partier och som har inkluderat variabler
för att se hur denna representation skiljer sig åt i olika partier (t.ex. Sundström & Stockemer,
2021 och 2015). Några av dessa studier har påpekat att vänsterpartier är mer benägna att
skicka kvinnor till riksdagen och att nominera och välja kvinnor till riksdagspositioner (t.ex.
Caul, 1999; Matland & Studlar, 1996; Sundström & Stockemer, 2015). Sundström och
Stockemer (2021) sammanfattar att det finns tydliga skillnader i kvinnors representation
mellan vänster-, gröna och liberala partier å ena sidan, och höger-, konservativa och
populistiska högerpartier å andra sidan. Detta visar att en traditionell konservativ ideologi
120

Anna Lillkung
fortfarande begränsar kvinnors tillgång till de offentliga rummen. PRH-partierna har därmed
bevisats ha en lägre kvinnlig än manlig representation.
Högström

(2019)

har

undersökt

ifall

en

”smittoeffekt”

kan

påvisas

gällande

könsrepresentationen i Sverigedemokraterna. Matland och Studlar (1996) beskriver
smittoeffekten som en process i vilken beslut och handlingar av ett parti leder till att andra
partier antar liknande strategier eller policyer. Om ett parti exempelvis börjar nominera eller
välja fler kvinnor leder det till att andra partier känner sig pressade att göra samma sak för att
inte förlora röster. Högström (2019) beskriver i sin tur en omformulerad smittoeffekt som
handlar om att nya partier, till exempel PRH-partier som har en lägre nivå av kvinnlig
representation, upplever en smittoeffekt från mer etablerade partier som har en högre nivå av
kvinnlig representation. Eftersom de nyare partierna, till exempel SD, eftersträvar fler röster
för att maximera sitt väljarunderstöd, kommer de att rekrytera kvinnliga kandidater för att
attrahera en bredare väljarbas. Detta görs för att kunna tävla med andra partier som har en
högre nivå av kvinnlig representation. Högströms (2019) studie påvisade att en smittoeffekt
hade ägt rum i Sverige där SD ökade sin kvinnliga representation parallellt med att partiet
blev mer etablerat, och närmade sig de övriga svenska partiernas nivå av kvinnlig
representation. SD hade dock fortfarande en högre andel män än kvinnor i jämförelse med
övriga svenska partier.
Litteraturöversikten visar därmed att även om ett ökat antal studier gjorts kring genus och
populistiska radikalhögerpartiers finns det forskningsluckor kvar. Denna forskningslucka är
störst vad gäller könsrepresentation i populisthögerpartierna själva.

3. Könsrepresentation i de nordiska populistiska radikalhögerpartierna –
en empirisk studie
Majoriteten av studier som undersökt könsrepresentationen i PRH-partier har endast
undersökt den i fallstudier om ett land, i stället för att jämföra könsrepresentationen i flera
partier och i flera länder samt se hur denna representation ändrat under en längre tid. Mudde
(2007) har påstått att överrepresentationen av män i PRH-partierna är större än i de partier
som ligger längre vänsterut på vänster-högerskalan, men inte nödvändigtvis betydligt större
än i andra konservativa högerpartier. Frågan som kvarstår är därmed: Hur stor är skillnaden
mellan männens och kvinnornas representation i PRH-partierna, om en skillnad ens existerar
när man jämför med andra partier och med partier i andra länder. Och har skillnaden mellan
männens och kvinnornas representation blivit mindre över tid när PRH-partierna blivit mer
121

Anna Lillkung
etablerade och ökat sitt väljarstöd, vilket Högströms (2019) studie om Sverigedemokraterna
föreslår? Den empiriska delen av pro gradu-avhandlingen adresserar dessa frågor.
De nordiska länderna har en hög andel av kvinnor representerade i sina nationella parlament
och anses ha kommit långt i strävan efter jämställdhet mellan könen (t.ex. Niskanen, 2011;
OECD, 2018). De nordiska länderna är därför lämpliga fall att studera könsrepresentationen i
PRH-partierna i. Med tanke på den generellt sett höga nivån av kvinnlig representation i den
nordiska regionen och med tanke på den låga nivå av kvinnlig representation i PRH-partierna
är den första forskningsfrågan (RQ1) till vilken grad en skillnad i representation mellan män
och kvinnor finns i de nordiska PRH-partierna och i vilken utsträckning denna skillnad mellan
män och kvinnor ser lika ut i de olika nordiska länderna. Det förväntade resultatet i
förhållande

till

den

första

forskningsfrågan

är

att

de

nordiska

populistiska

radikalhögerpartierna i medel har en könsskillnad som är större än 10 procentenheter på en
majoritet av de politiska arenor som undersöks (dvs interna, väljar- och parlamentariska
arenorna), vilket stämmer överens med vad tidigare studier har visat (t.ex. Högström, 2019;
Mudde, 2007; Mulinari & Neergaard, 2017). Om man anser att könsbalansen är jämställd om
den ligger runt 40–60 procent åt endera håll (se Dahlerup, 1988; Niskanen, 2011) kan PRHpartierna inte ses som jämställda. De kommer att ha en könsskillnad som är större än 10
procentenheter vilket innebär att män utgör mer än 60 procent av dessa partiers
partistyrelsemedlemmar, valkandidater och valda ledamöter. Jag förväntar mig också att dessa
könsskillnader är större i PRH-partierna än i genomsnitt hos de övriga partierna, vilket
stämmer överens med Sundströms och Stockemers (2021) slutsats att PRH-partier uppvisar
större könsskillnader i jämförelse med övriga partifamiljer.
Den andra forskningsfrågan (RQ2) är ifall PRH-partierna har större skillnader i
könsrepresentation än icke-PRH-partierna i de nordiska länderna. Mudde (2007) har påstått
att medan skillnaderna mellan könen i dessa partier är större i jämförelse med vänsterpartier
är skillnaden inte lika stor mellan PRH-partierna och de konventionella konservativa
högerpartierna. Den andra forskningsfrågan undersöker därmed om denna teori får stöd i de
nordiska länderna genom att jämföra könsrepresentationen i PRH-partierna med
könsrepresentationen i andra nordiska partier. Jag fokuserar i synnerhet på hur
könsskillnaderna i populistradikalhögern jämför sig med konservativa högerpartier å ena
sidan och med socialdemokratiska partier å andra sidan. Högström (2019) samt Sundström
och Stockemer (2015) har ytterligare påtalat att när ett PRH-parti når större framgång i ett val
har överrepresentationen av män i dessa partier påverkat den allmänna nivån av kvinnors
122

Anna Lillkung
representation negativt. Jag jämför därför också hur stor skillnaden i könsklyftorna är mellan
alla partier i medeltal och mellan enbart icke-PRH partiers medeltal. Detta görs för att se hur
PRH-partierna har påverkat de nationella könsrepresentationstalen i medeltal. Jag förväntar
mig att PRH-partierna har en större överrepresentation av män jämfört med icke-PRHpartierna i medeltal samt i jämförelse med de socialdemokratiska partierna. Däremot förväntar
jag mig att denna överrepresentation inte är markant större än i högerpartierna, i
överensstämmelse med Muddes (2007) tes.
Den tredje forskningsfrågan (RQ3) är hur kvinnornas representation i PRH-partierna har
utvecklats över tid och om man kan se en så kallad smittoeffekt där dessa partiers
kvinnorepresentation har närmat sig den högre nivån av kvinnorepresentation i andra redan
etablerade partier (Högström, 2019). Jag förväntar mig att PRH-partierna har ökat sin
kvinnorepresentation i samband med att de blivit mer etablerade och mer framgångsrika i val
och därmed närmat sig nivån av kvinnorepresentation i andra huvudpartier i sina respektive
länder.
3.1 Studiedesign och metod
Den empiriska studien använde sig av en studiedesign med få fall och fokuserade på och
jämförde data från ett relativt litet antal fall – de etablerade nordiska populistiska
radikalhögerpartierna DF, FrP, SAF och SD. Studien var deskriptiv till sin natur: målet var att
undersöka hur stor skillnaden mellan mäns och kvinnors representation är i denna partifamilj i
jämförelse med i de övriga partierna i Norden, samt att identifiera hur skillnaden i
könsrepresentation har förändrats över tid. Studien syftade därmed inte till att förklara varför
könsrepresentationen eventuellt ser annorlunda ut inom den populistiska radikalhögern. Den
valda studiedesignen – en länderjämförande studie – valdes för att få större insikt i hur
könsrepresentationen tar sig uttryck i den populistiska radikalhögern och om det finns
transnationella mönster inom denna partifamilj.
Jag valde att undersöka könsrepresentationen på tre olika politiska arenor (se Sjöblom, 1968):
den interna arenan, som här behandlar könsrepresentationen i ett partis interna strukturer (t.ex.
i

partistyrelser, bland medlemmar,

partiledare etc), väljararenan,

som behandlar

könsrepresentationen bland ett partis kandidater i val, samt parlamentariska arenan, som
behandlar könsrepresentationen bland ett partis invalda ledamöter i nationella parlament eller
lokala parlament (kommunfullmäktige). De två första forskningsfrågorna innefattade alla tre
politiska arenor, medan den tredje forskningsfrågan endast gällde den interna arenan och
123

Anna Lillkung
väljararenan. Jag undersökte den interna arenan genom att observera könsrepresentationen i
partistyrelser och bland partiledarna. Väljararenan undersöktes genom att observera
könsrepresentationen bland partiernas kandidater i parlament- och kommunalval. Den
parlamentariska arenan undersöktes genom att observera könsrepresentation bland partiernas
invalda ledamöter i parlament- och kommunalval. Jag samlade in data från både den
nationella och lokala nivån för att få en mer gedigen helhetsbild av hur könsrepresentationen
tar sig uttryck i populistiska högerpartierna.
För att svara på den andra forskningsfrågan samlade jag in samma data för övriga nordiska
partier. Jag jämförde också PRH-partiernas könsrepresentation med de socialdemokratiska
partiernas och de konservativa partiernas. Partierna Det Konservative Folkeparti (Danmark),
Høyre (Norge), Kokoomus (Finland) och Moderaterna (Sverige) kategoriserades som
konservativa partier (Hansen & Kosiara-Pedersen, 2017). Partierna Socialdemokratiet
(Danmark),

Arbeiderpartiet

(Norge),

Sosialidemokraattinen

puolue

(Finland)

och

Socialdemokraterna (Sverige) kategoriserades som socialdemokratiska partier (Hansen &
Kosiara-Pedersen, 2017).
Den tredje forskningsfrågan undersöktes genom att observera hur könsrepresentationen
förändrats under de senaste tre valen (väljararenan) och under de senaste tio åren (den interna
arenan). Jag valde att inte inkludera den parlamentariska arenan eftersom smittoeffekten
främst handlar om att partier tar strategiska beslut om att öka andelen kvinnor för att locka
fler röstare, och det kan partierna främst göra genom att öka andelen kvinnor på sina
kandidatlistor och genom att öka andelen kvinnor som är med i partiernas högsta beslutande
organ. Jag jämförde också könsrepresentationen i populistiska högerpartierna med
könsrepresentationen i övriga partier för att se om populistiska högerpartierna närmat sig
övriga partier.
Könsskillnaden (”gender gap”) i representation var den primära variabeln som undersöktes.
Denna könsskillnad uträknades genom att subtrahera kvinnornas procentandel på de olika
arenorna med 50 procent, eftersom 50 procent är den andel av kvinnor som de skulle vara om
det inte fanns någon könsskillnad. Om procenten kvinnor bland ett partis kandidatlistor var 30
procent så subtraherade jag 30 procent från 50 procent. Könsskillnaden skulle då vara 20
procentenheter. Ju närmare noll könsskillnaden var desto mindre fanns det en klyfta mellan
männens och kvinnornas representationsandel. Jag räknade också ut vad könsskillnaden var i
medeltal för de olika partierna, baserat på de enskilda könsskillnaderna i de tre senaste valen
eller i de tio senaste partistyrelserna.

3.2 Insamling av data och metodik
Jag samlade in data om könsrepresentationen på de tre olika politiska arenorna för samtliga
nordiska partier som varit relevanta på nationell nivå (dvs haft invalda ledamöter i riksdagen)
under ett av de senaste tre riksdagsvalen. Data samlades in från de tre senaste riksdags- och
kommunalvalen som ägt innan 1 januari 2021. Data som berörde väljararenan och den
parlamentariska arenan samlades primärt in från nationella statistikbyråer (Danmarks
Statistik, Tilastokeskus, Valmyndigheten och Statistisk sentralbyrå). På dessa byråers
webbsidor hittade jag all data kring könsrepresentationen bland valkandidater och invalda
ledamöter. Data gällande könsrepresentation i den interna arenan och framför allt i
partistyrelser var svårare att få tag på eftersom de flesta partier bara har information om
sittande medlemmar i partiernas partistyrelser och inte om tidigare medlemmar på sina
webbsidor. Jag använde därför en mängd olika källor, primärt webbaserade encyklopedier och
nyhetsartiklar, för att hitta information om medlemmar i PRH-partiernas partistyrelser. Jag
valde därför att endast inhämta data gällande könsrepresentationen i partistyrelser under de
senaste tio åren för PRH-partierna. För övriga partier nöjde jag mig med att endast hämta in
data om nuvarande partistyrelsesammansättning.
3.3 Resultat
3.3.1 RQ1: Skillnader i könsrepresentation i de populistiska radikalhögerpartierna
Samtliga nordiska PRH-partier hade en överrepresentation av män i sina partistyrelser, bland
sina valkandidater och bland sina invalda ledamöter, både på nationell och på lokal nivå.
Könsskillnaden (”gender gap”) i PRH-partierna var i regel större än 10 procentenheter och
ofta större än 20 procentenheter när jag räknade ut medeltalen baserat på de senaste tio åren
samt senaste tre riksdags- och kommunalval i respektive land. Männen utgjorde därmed en
andel som var större än 60 procent och ofta närmare 70 procent och PRH-partiernas
könsbalans låg således inte inom den jämställda balansen på 60–40 procent. Medeltalet för
könsskillnaden i PRH-partierna, när jag räknade ihop de enskilda partiernas könsskillnader i
partistyrelser och bland ledamöter och kandidater, var 22 procentenheter och medianen 21,7
procentenheter. Denna överrepresentation av män visade i regel heller inga större variationer
utan var beständig. DF, SAF och SD hade också en tydlig dominans av män bland sina
partiledare under den senaste tio åren, medan FrP hade en kvinnlig partiledare under denna
period och därmed en könsskillnad som låg på –50 procentenheter i partiledarskap.

125

Anna Lillkung
När jag jämförde skillnaderna i könens representation i PRH-partierna med medelskillnaden i
könens representation i de nordiska länderna framträdde också ett klart mönster. PRHpartierna i Norge, Finland och Sverige uppvisade alla betydligt större skillnader mellan
männens och kvinnornas representation i jämförelse med vad som var normen i övriga partier
i dessa länder. I Norge låg exempelvis medelkönsskillnaden bland partiernas kandidater i
riksdagsvalet på 2,2 procentenheter medan motsvarande könsskillnad var 14,4 procentenheter
i FrP. I Danmark, å andra sidan, var skillnaderna inte lika stora mellan DF:s könsskillnad och
medelkönsskillnaden i övriga danska partier. Medan DF:s könsrepresentation ofta var i
samma storleksklass som de övriga nordiska PRH-partier stack Danmarks statistik ut eftersom
danska partier överlag hade betydligt större könsskillnader än de övriga nordiska länderna. DF
hade en könsskillnad på 17,5 procentenheter medan de danska partierna i medel hade en
könsskillnad på 15,4 procentenheter bland kandidater i riksdagsvalet. Detta mönster återkom
på samtliga politiska arenor.
3.3.2. RQ2: Könsskillnader i de populistiska radikalhögerpartierna vs. i övriga partier
Resultaten gällande den andra forskningsfrågan visade att PRH-partiernas könsskillnader
generellt var större än könsskillnaderna i icke-PRH-partierna, och detta på samtliga politiska
arenor. PRH-partierna hade en betydligt större skillnad mellan könen i sina partistyrelser,
både i jämförelse med medeltalet för samtliga icke-PRH-partier och i jämförelse med de
socialdemokratiska och konservativa partierna. Gällande väljar- och den parlamentariska
arenan var könsskillnaderna i de norska, finska och svenska PRH-partierna större än
skillnaderna i motsvarande länders icke-PRH-partier. I dessa länder stack PRH-partiernas
könsskillnader också ut som betydligt större än de konservativa och socialdemokratiska
partiernas. Danska partier, å andra sidan, hade könsskillnader i väljararenan och den
parlamentariska arenan som inte var mycket lägre än DF:s, men som däremot var betydligt
större än i de övriga nordiska länderna. Medan det fanns ett klart mönster där de norska,
finska och svenska PRH-partierna stack ut från icke-PRH-partier i sina respektive länder, låg
DF:s könsskillnad betydligt närmare könsskillnaderna i övriga danska partier.
Resultatet visade också att de nordiska populistiska radikalhögerpartierna har lett till att den
deskriptiva representationen av kvinnor i medeltal har minskat i de nordiska länderna. När jag
jämförde vad könsskillnaderna var i medeltal för samtliga partier, inklusive PRH-partierna,
med vad könsskillnaden var för enbart icke-PRH-partierna, det vill säga exklusive PRHpartierna, hade PRH-partierna en tydligt ökande effekt på exempelvis könsskillnaden bland
valkandidater i Finland och Norge. I Norge var könsskillnaden till exempel 2,2 procentenheter
126

Anna Lillkung
bland kandidaterna i riksdagsvalet medan könsskillnaden skulle ha varit 0,7 procentenheter
om FrP exkluderades. I Finland var motsvarande siffror 4,7 procentenheter (inkl. SAF) kontra
2,8 procentenheter (exkl. SAF).
3.3.3. RQ3: Smittoeffekt i de nordiska PRH-partiernas könsrepresentation
Resultatet kunde i regel inte styrka att en så kallad smittoeffekt skett över tid i de nordiska
PRH-partierna. Det var endast Sverigedemokraterna som tydligt och konsekvent minskade på
skillnaden i könsrepresentation mellan män och kvinnor när jag undersökte de senaste tio åren
(gällande den interna arenan) och kandidatlistorna i de tre senaste riksdags- och
kommunalvalen (väljararenan). SD ökade andelen kvinnor betydligt i framför allt
väljararenan, också i jämförelse med övriga svenska partier, men SD hade fortfarande en
betydligt lägre andel kvinnor i jämförelse med de övriga partierna. I övrigt såg man ingen
tydlig förändring i könsrepresentationen i de nordiska PRH-partierna. Det är dock nämnvärt
att även om DF inte ökade på sin andel kvinnor hade DF en kvinnoandel som låg på ungefär
samma nivå som övriga danska partier. I det danska fallet fanns det på så sätt inte direkt
någon högre nivå som kvinnorepresentation i DF kunde härma och närma sig.

4. Diskussion
Det första syftet med denna pro gradu-avhandling var att presentera en detaljerad
litteraturöversikt över genus och populistiska radikalhögern. Denna översikt visade att
könsrepresentationen inom denna partifamilj är det minst studerade delområdet inom detta
ämne. Det andra syftet var därför att bidra till denna forskningsgren genom att empiriskt
undersöka könsrepresentationen i de nordiska populistiska radikalhögerpartierna. Frågan som
kvarstår är om PRH-partierna kan kallas Männerparteien med hänsyn till partiernas
könsrepresentation.

En

annan

fråga

är

hur

de

skillnader

mellan

de

nordiska

populisthögerpartierna som identifierades i resultat kan förklaras.
Tidigare forskning har visat att det finns en skillnad i könens representation i PRH-partier
(t.ex. Högström, 2019; Mudde, 2007; Mulinari & Neergaard, 2017). Därför förväntade jag
mig att de nordiska PRH-partierna skulle uppvisa en skillnad mellan könens representation
som är större än 10 procentenheter, så att män utgör en majoritet på åtminstone 60 procent i
dessa partier. Resultatet stämde också överens med förväntningarna – de nordiska PRHpartierna hade generellt en andel mellan män och kvinnor som var närmare 70:30 än 60:40, på
alla politiska arenor som undersöktes. Det enda undantaget var FrP som hade en kvinnlig
partiledare under de senaste tio åren. Det fanns således en tydlig och beständig
127

Anna Lillkung
överrepresentation av män i de nordiska PRH-partierna. Denna överrepresentation var också
av liknande storlek på samtliga politiska arenor, oberoende av om man studerade
kandidatlistor, invalda ledamöter eller medlemmar i partistyrelsen, vilket indikerar ett tydligt
resultat. Resultaten visade också att samma mönster med en överrepresentation av män
existerade inom denna partifamilj i olika länder, även om det fanns viss variation länder
emellan.
Begreppet Männerparteien är således relevant. Inga av dessa partier hade en könsbalans som
låg på omkring 60:40, vilket brukar klassas som jämställt. De stora klyftorna i
könsrepresentation i dessa partier har bevisligen också haft en effekt på den totala nivån av
kvinnors deskriptiva representation i framför allt Norge, Finland och Sverige. Det innebär att
andelen kvinnor i politiken skulle vara högre om PRH-partierna inte räknades med. Detta
resultat stämde också överens med Sundströms och Stockemers (2015) studie som visade att
när PRH-partier får ett större väljarstöd har det en negativ effekt på kvinnornas representation.
Danmark stod dock ut i resultatet eftersom DF inte hade samma tydliga negativa effekt på
kvinnornas representation. DF:s könsskillnad var ofta på samma nivå som de övriga nordiska
PRH-partierna, men samtidigt även på samma nivå som övriga danska partiers.
Resultatet visade också att Muddes (2007) tes om att PRH-partier inte har en klart större
könsskillnad i representation i jämförelse med konservativa partier inte stämde i den nordiska
kontexten. PRH-partiernas könsskillnad var i Norge, Finland och Sverige markant större än de
konservativa partiernas könsskillnader i dessa länder. Däremot var PRH-partiernas
könsskillnader ofta närmare de konservativa partiernas än de socialdemokratiska partiernas,
vilket stämmer överens med tesen att vänsterpartier har en mindre klyfta i könsrepresentation
i jämförelse med högerpartier (t.ex. Mudde, 2007; Sundström & Stockemer, 2015 och 2021).
PRH-partierna hade generellt en större könsskillnad i sin representation än genomsnittet i
icke-PRH-partierna, vilket också stämde överens med mina förväntningar. Danmark var dock
igen något av ett undantag eftersom samtliga partier, inte minst danska socialdemokratiska
partiet, hade betydligt större könsskillnader än partierna i de övriga nordiska länderna. Mina
resultat stämde generellt därför överens med tidigare forskning som beskrivit att det finns en
överrepresentation av män i de populistiska radikalhögerpartierna (t.ex. Högström, 2019;
Mudde, 2007). Det finns ytterligare inga andra förklaringar (t.ex. olika väljarsystem eller
könskvotering) som kan förklara varför de nordiska PRH-partierna har en betydligt större
överrepresentation av män i jämförelse med andra partier.

128

Anna Lillkung
Gällande den tredje forskningsfrågan gav resultatet i regel inte stöd för att en smittoeffekt ägt
rum i de nordiska PRH-partierna. SD var det enda parti som markant ökat andelen kvinnor
medan kvinnoandelen i resten av PRH-partierna höll sig på samma nivå. Resultatet stämde
därmed inte överens med mina förväntningar. Det är dock viktigt att påpeka att DF låg på
samma nivå vad gäller könsskillnad som övriga stora partier i Danmark. Även om
könsskillnaden inte ändrades i DF under tidsperioden jag studerat går det inte att avfärda att
en smittoeffekt ägt rum i Danmark där DF tidigare i så fall anpassat sin andel kvinnor till
övriga partiers tidigare. Eftersom SD är det yngsta PRH-partiet i Norden är det följaktligen
möjligt att SD först nu anpassar sin kvinnoandel till övriga svenska partiers, medan en
liknande process redan tidigare ägt rum i de övriga nordiska länderna där PRH-partierna har
en längre historik med valframgång. Detta kunde i sin tur förklara varför SD fortfarande har
de största skillnaderna i könsrepresentation av de fyra nordiska PRH-partierna – och att SD
först nu håller på att anpassa sig. Denna förklaringsmodell lämpar sig bra i förhållande till SD
och DF, men förklarar däremot inte varför FrP, det äldsta PRH-partiet, inte har en högre andel
kvinnor. Könsskillnaderna i representation i både FrP och SAF ligger fortfarande långt från de
finska och norska partiernas. Det finns också andra potentiella faktorer som kan förklara
varför SD ökat sin representation av kvinnor men inte övriga PRH-partier i Norden. Detta kan
till exempel bero på att Sverige kommit längre än de övriga nordiska länderna i att arbeta med
jämställdhet som ett politiskt projekt (Borschorst, 2008), och att SD därmed är mer pressat att
öka sin andel kvinnor i jämförelse med PRH-partierna i övriga Norden. SD har också fört
fram jämställdhet i sin politik sedan 2014 (Mulinari & Neergaard, 2017), vilket i sin tur kan
ha lett till att fler kvinnor känner sig välkomna i partiet.
Resultat vad gäller Danmark avvek ständigt från de övriga resultaten i min studie. Det finns
också en paradox i att DF hade den minsta skillnaden mellan mäns och kvinnors
representation i partiet av de nordiska PRH-partierna, medan danska partier generellt hade den
största klyftan mellan mäns och kvinnors representation av alla nordiska länder. Att det finns
en större överrepresentation av män i danska partier i jämförelse med i övriga nordiska partier
har diskuterats (se Dahlerup, 2011; Melby et al., 2008; Niskanen, 2011). Melby och kollegor
(2008) poängterar bland annat att medan officiella jämställdhetspolicyer tagits fram i Sverige
och Norge har det samma inte hänt i Danmark. Feminism som begrepp är också mer negativt
laddat i Danmark än i Sverige och Norge (Christensen, 2008) och den feministiska diskursen
är mer tvetydig och ambivalent i Danmark i jämförelse med i Sverige. Bristen på debatt om
kvinnors låga andel i politiken har också ansetts vara en faktor som förklarar att kvinnornas
129

Anna Lillkung
representation i den danska politiken stagnerat (Dahlerup, 2011). Dessa faktorer förklarar
därför varför det finns en lägre andel kvinnor i danska partier än i övriga nordiska partier, men
de förklarar inte varför DF har en relativt hög andel kvinnor som representanter. En möjlig
förklaring till det sistnämnda kan vara att DF:s attityder i förhållande till genus inte sticker ut
på samma sätt som PRH-partiernas attityder i Norge, Finland och Sverige gör, där dessa
partier framstår som mer ”anti-kvinnor”. DF kan således ses som ett fullgott alternativ för
kvinnor i Danmark, eftersom de övriga danska partierna inte är mycket bättre vad gäller
genus. En annan potentiell faktor som kan förklara att DF har en högre andel kvinnor är att
DF leddes av en kvinnlig ledare, Pia Kjaersgaard, under många år. Partier med kvinnliga
ledare har nämligen bevisats ha en positiv effekt på andelen kvinnliga ledamöter i EUparlamentet (Sundström & Stockemer, 2021). Därför är det möjligt att Kjaersgaard också lett
till att fler kvinnor gått med i DF.
4.1 Studiens begränsningar och förslag för framtida forskning
Denna studie har visat att stora klyftor mellan männens och kvinnornas representation i de
nordiska PRH-partierna finns och att dessa klyftor också är större i jämförelse med
motsvarande klyftor i andra partier. Några begränsningar i studien som kunnat identifieras är
(1) att tidsperioden som sattes under lupp hade kunnat innefatta flera år för att undersöka om
de äldre PRH-partierna, DF och FrP, har sett en ökning av andelen kvinnor och därmed
upplevt en så kallad smittoeffekt i ett tidigare skede, (2) att det hade varit fördelaktigt om jag
också hade data på övriga icke-PRH-partiers könssammansättning i partistyrelser under de
senaste tio åren och inte bara i sittande partistyrelse och (3) att studien hade kunnat jämföra
PRH-partierna med fler icke-PRH-partier i större detalj, och inte bara med de konservativa
och socialdemokratiska partierna och med kombinerad data för alla icke-PRH-partier.
Gällande framtida forskning kunde studier undersöka skillnader i könsrepresentation över en
längre tidsperiod och även undersöka den interna arenan mer ingående. Framtida forskning
borde också i större utsträckning undersöka varför det finns stora klyftor mellan männens och
kvinnornas representation i populistiska radikalhögern. Sådan forskning skulle bland annat
kunna undersöka om samma faktorer som gjort att färre kvinnor röstar på PRH-partier än män
också spelar en roll med tanke på att kvinnor inte blir aktiva i dessa partier. Framtida
forskning skulle även kunna undersöka om dessa partiers genusideologi påverkar kvinnors
beslut att bli medlemmar eller inte bli medlemmar i partierna. Sådana studier behöver i större
utsträckning vara kvalitativa och innefatta intervjuer med kvinnor som är aktiva i partier som
tillhör denna partifamilj.

members. The members of the party council are re-elected yearly, except for the party leadership
which is elected every other year. The party council/board thus consists of:
•
•
•
•
•

party leader/party chair (chair of the party council is the same as the party leader),
three vice leaders (until 2021, there was a rule stipulating that at least one vice leader has to be
male, and another vice leader has to be female),
party secretary,
seven regular members, and
one representative of the parliamentary group.
