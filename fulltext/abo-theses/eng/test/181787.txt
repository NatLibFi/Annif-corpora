Abstract
Pharmaceuticals and their effects on the environment have become continually a more and
more interesting topic. Even though only 2% of all European API (Active Pharmaceutical
Ingredient) discharges are from the pharmaceutical manufacturing plants, the Finnish
environmental permit regulates reducing the amount of APIs released from the
pharmaceutical industry into wastewater by various regulations. It is extremely important to
understand the amount and location of the generated API discharges of the manufacturing
processes in order to minimize the environmental risks caused by APIs. This study includes
an inventory of the pharmaceutical wastewater. The inventory is based on the calculation of
API losses and also it presents the locations and unit processes where API discharges are
generated. After the sources and amounts of API discharges have been clarified, the entry of
pharmaceuticals into process wastewater can be controlled by technical and practical
solutions. When API discharge levels are known, it is possible to carry out a more detailed
risk assessment of pharmaceuticals, which can be used to ensure that API discharges are
below the maximum daily discharge limits.
In this study, the quantity and the quality of pharmaceutical wastewater are determined. The
inventory of lost API masses are calculated by using process data from PI-sheets (Process
Instruction Sheets). Based on the inflows and outflows, accumulated mass or product in the
equipment is calculated by proportioning masses to the API concentration. The sufficiently of
wastewater collection was qualitatively monitored by discrete samplings of wastewater of the
Granulator 3. The concentration differences before and after cleaning processes of the
Granulator 3 were detected from the results of wastewater samples. Based on the sample
results, at least x% of accumulated API4 was led to the wastewater treatment plant from the
cleaning program of Granulator 3. The results of the accumulated mass and the quality data
from wastewater samples were used for defining estimated daily discharges. The estimated
daily discharges and Predicted No-Effect Concentration values were used for risk
assessment for all APIs of tablet and injection departments. Based on the sampling results
and risk assessment, wastewater collection of rinsing phases of Granulator 3 is sufficient.
Also, smaller sources of API discharges were studied by visual observing the effectiveness
of pre-rinsing and taking samples from the rinsing water of weighing tools.

Preface and acknowledgements
This Master’s thesis in process chemistry was implemented for Orion Corporation. Because
my study and work background have focused on the area of environment, I was
indescribably happy about getting this topic. This thesis has been challenging, because the
topic requires understanding of the functionality of the whole plant and also the outside of
the plant what comes to the risk assessment. I’m glad that I was able to do this and learned
a lot of new things during my work that I can certainly utilize in the future. I also hope that my
work will provide information to others interested in pharmaceutical wastewater.
However, this work would not have been possible without my supervisors, co-workers and
support network. I’m so thankful for my supervisor Ville that you offered me this topic and
you have supported me with a positive attitude during the whole process. In addition, I would
like to thank Otto for specialist advices in the environmental field. I also want to say big
thanks to Emilia for peer support, memes, chocolate and helping me with practical things. In
addition to the supervisors, I’m grateful to several different stakeholders and co-workers who
have helped me during the whole process. On behalf of the Åbo Akademi University, I would
like to thank Professor Leena Hupa for providing the possibilities to do this and Johan
Werkelin for active and positive ways for supervising, flexibility and giving great ideas. I’m
also grateful for my dear family and friends for their support, encouragement and helping.
Last but not least, I want to thank my partner for his endless support, love and caring during
my whole study time.

Introduction
Sustainability - an important part of the pharmaceutical industry
Orion Corporation is a Finnish pharmaceutical industry company, which researches,
develops, manufactures and markets human and veterinary medicines as well as Active
Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs). The product category has increased widely since 1917,
and currently the main therapeutic areas of pharmaceutical research are oncology,
neurological and respiratory diseases. Although Orion has grown as an international
company, all the manufacturing plants are located in Finland. Orion has production and
research operations in Espoo, Turku, Kuopio, Salo, Oulu and Hanko. In the manufacturing
processes, sustainability plays a very important role. Orion has built its own sustainability
agenda, which includes four different areas: patient safety and ensuring the reliable supply
of medications, manufacturing products in an environmentally sustainable way, responsibility
of Orionees and ethics and transparency of the business (Orion Oyj, 2021a; Orion Oyj,
2021b; Orion Oyj, 2021c).
Nowadays environmental protection and climate change mitigation are important values for
the pharmaceutical companies, and this is one of the reasons why Orion has also included
manufacturing products in an environmentally sustainable way in its own sustainability
agenda. This means among other things that API discharges should be known and managed
in an efficient and sustainable way. Possible API discharges are generated when production
equipment and tools are cleaned after the manufacturing processes of pharmaceuticals.
Limits for the API discharges to the wastewater treatment plant are not regulated in the
Finnish law, and the requirements for API discharges are mainly regulated in the
environmental permit. By calculating risk assessment for all manufactured APIs, it is possible
to ensure that pharmaceuticals can be manufactured without endangering the environment.
In this study, the theory of the pharmaceutical manufacturing processes and cleaning
processes are reviewed, because those are important from the wastewater generation point
of view. The chemistry of a few interesting APIs and the risk assessment calculations are
also included as a background for the experimental study. In the method section, the
sampling procedure of the wastewater is described, and data of the API discharges for the
year 2020 is calculated and the sources of the APIs discharging are presented.

The motivation of the study
In Finland, the wastewater from households and industries are transported to a wastewater
treatment plant, where the wastewater is processed before leaving as an effluent to water
systems. Because the wastewater treatment process is not designed to remove APIs from
the wastewater, most of the harmful APIs end up in the environment, e.g. Baltic Sea. Even
though estimated API discharges from the pharmaceutical industry are rather small,
approximately 2% of the total European API discharges, it is important to minimize API
discharges in the manufacturing processes, because some APIs have severe impacts to the
environment already in small concentrations. Rest of the API discharges comes from the use
of the customers, hospitals and animals and improper disposal of expired products (Bio
Intelligence service, 2013; Larsson & G. D., 2014; Orion Oyj, 2021).
This study is part of Orion's production wastewater management program. The study is
beneficial for the company, because by having knowledge about the quantity of waste
fractions and their sources, environmental risks are easier to minimize and to manage also
in exceptional situations. The inventory system is also usable for the production to manage
the API discharges, among the other systems, and it seeks to increase an emission-minded
thinking into the day-to-day operations of the production. The inventory of the discharged
APIs also enables optimization of the separately collected wastewater and planning for the
at-source API wastewater treatment in the future.

2

The objectives of the study
The objective of this study is to investigate which unit processes, equipment or spaces
generate API discharges to the wastewater stream and calculate the annual mass flows for
the API losses based on production data from the pharmaceutical production plant. On the
basis of this research data, an inventory system was constructed in a uniform way to
manage API discharges. The requirements for the inventory system are that it is easy to
access, update and also utilize in other manufacturing plants. In addition to the quantity
knowledge of APIs, the split factors between collected and non-collected wastewater from
granulators are required to be clarified with wastewater sampling. At the same time, the most
practical sampling methods are studied. In addition to the inventory system and wastewater
sampling, technical solutions for wastewater management (e.g. valves, pipes, changes the
cleaning processes) as well as the instructions and possible changes in procedures for
operators are suggested during the thesis.
In order to aim for zero API discharges in a pharmaceutical industry plant, the amount and
location of the generated API discharges should be known in order to suggest different
technical solutions. In this study, annual mass flows of API residues are calculated in three
different departments in the pharmaceutical production plant. These include the tablet,
inhalation and injection departments. The time period for the API discharges inventory is the
production year 2020. Figure 1 shows a schematic overview of the wastewater generation
and transportation in the manufacturing process of pharmaceuticals.

Background
Tablet manufacturing process
The tablet manufacturing process consists of several unit processes. Figure 2 shows that the
first unit process is the weighing process, where raw materials of the tablets are weighed to
the containers. After the weighing process, raw materials are transported to the granulators
or compactors where the mass manufacturing takes place. Mass manufacturing process
produces granules which are easy to press to the tablet form in the tableting phase. After
pressing granules to the tablet form, those are coated with a coating solution to improve
physical and chemical properties of the final product. The final process phase is to package
the tablets to the packaging before delivering products to the customers (Pharmapproach,
2021). From the wastewater inventory point of view, the main focus is on the mass
manufacturing process, because it can be assumed that most API discharges are generated
in that unit process. Appendix 1 shows that API discharges from the coating process
correspond to the API7 concentration of x-y tablets. Some API discharges are also
generated in the weighing unit process. In addition to those sources, minor API discharging
sources from the other unit processes are also possible. Those are the reasons why this
study is mainly concentrated on the weighing and mass manufacturing unit processes.

Figure 2. The unit processes of the tablet manufacturing processes. This study focuses on
the weighing and mass manufacture unit processes.

Mass manufacturing
Granulation is a well-studied unit process in the pharmaceutical industry field. It is commonly
used in manufacturing of tablets and capsules, which can be supplied in a solid form
(Hansuld & Briens, 2014; Prakash, Julu, & Seong, 2019). The target of the granulation
process is to improve the important properties of raw materials for tableting, like flowability
and compressibility of powders (De Simone, Caccavo, Lamberti, d'Amore, & Barba, 2018).
The granulation process can be classified into two major techniques, wet and dry
granulation. In wet granulation, enlargement of the powder particles occurs. Liquid binder is
4

added to the powder and due to the reactions, new bonds between particles are formed.
Uniformly mixing process during wet granulation is an essential process phase. In dry
granulation, liquid binder is not required, because functionality of the dry granulation process
is based on the agglomeration of the fine particles under the mechanical pressure from
compression of the rolls. The dry granulation process is suitable for sensitive components of
pharmaceutical manufacturing because no heat or liquid is required (Charinpanitkul,
Tanthapanichakoon, Kulvanich, & Kim, 2008; Pishnamazi et al., 2019).

Wet granulation
There are several wet granulation techniques including high shear wet granulation (HSWG),
fluidized-bed granulation (FBG) and twin-screw granulation (TSG). Wet granulation methods
can be divided into three different phases. The first phase is wetting and nucleation, where a
liquid binder is added to the powder and nuclei formation occurs after wetting of the
particles. The second phase includes growth and consolidation, where formed granules
collide and stick together forming large granules. The last phase of wet granulation is
attrition and breakage, where large granules attrite and break into smaller granules
(Prakash, Julu, & Seong, 2019). This study concentrates on the HSWG and FBG
techniques, because those wet granulation techniques are used in the mass manufacture
unit process of the studied plant.

High shear wet granulation
High shear wet granulation (HSWG) mechanism is based on the addition and dry mixing of
powders and addition of a liquid binder into the powder mixtures during the mixing. Figure 3
shows that the HSWG includes two rotating parts: an impeller and a chopper. The principle
of the impeller is to mix the granulation mass uniformly and the chopper breaks the mass by
avoiding formation of too large agglomerates. At the beginning of liquid binder addition, the
speed of the impeller and the chopper is lower. When the liquid binder is absorbed, the
speed is increased to a product-specific level (Y. Saito, X. Fan, A. Ingram, & J.P.K. Seville,
2010).
The HSWG method has several advantages, such as a good mixing effect, short residence
time, high loading rate, high efficiency and also low energy consumption. The process can
be run without generating the process dust, because the granulation process is fully closed
(A. Kumar, K.V. Gernaey, T. De Beer, & I. Nopens, 2013; G. Luo, B. Xu, Y. Zhang, X. Cui, J.
Li, X. Shi, Y. Qiao, 2017; P. Thapa, A.R. Lee, D.H. Choi, & S.H. Jeong, 2017). However, it
also has shortcomings, such as chemical degradation of thermally sensitive materials,
5

mechanical degradation of fragile particles and the formation of clumps caused by overwetting (M. Börner, M. Michaelis, E. Siegmann, C. Radeke, & U. Schmidt, 2016; M. Cavinato
et al., 2011).

Figure 3. High shear wet granulator includes granulating bowl, lid, impeller, chopper and
tube for liquid binder addition (Prakash et al., 2019).

Fluidized-bed granulation
Fluidized-bed granulation (FBG) is a widely used unit operation in the mass manufacturing
process of pharmaceuticals. The FBG is a versatile granulation technique because it
includes wetting, drying, particle enlarging, shaping, homogenization and separation
processes and the production in one unit process phase. Figure 4 shows that at the
beginning of the FBG, inlet air is filtered in the air handling unit and added to the product
container. Airflow is controlled with the air distribution plate. Because of the added air, dry
raw material powder starts to fluidize inside the granulator. In the wetting phase, liquid binder
is pumped through the spraying nozzle into the fluidized powder particles by causing
nucleation. After the nucleation, wetted particles collide and agglomerate and short-range
physical or chemical forces are formed between nuclei. Granulation solution binds particles
together forming aggregates (granules) with the short-range forces until the bonds are
changed permanently with drying. Wetting and drying conditions affect the strength of the
bonds between particles, and it can be affected by operating process parameters from the
control panel. The droplet size of the liquid binder and temperature of the inlet air are
examples of the affecting factors to the bonding of the particles in the granulation process.
The filter bags prevent granules from escaping the granulator. Outlet air is filtered before it is
6

released into the atmosphere (Jacob, 2007; M. Jones, 1985; Parikh, 2005; S, S-R, H, & S,
2018).

unit, (3) product container, (4) air distributor plate, (5) spraying nozzle of the granulation
solution, (6) pump, (7) air expansion chamber, (8) filter bags, (9) air filter system, and (10)
exhaust blower (Burggraeve, Monteyne, Vervaet, Remon, & De Beer, 2013).

Dry granulation
Dry granulation is another major granulation technique, which is less frequently used in
pharmaceutical processing compared to wet granulation (Takeuchi, Yoshida, Ito, & Sunada,
2009). In the dry granulation method, liquid binder is not used which is the most significant
difference for the formation mechanism of granules compared to the wet granulation. In dry
granulation, granules are produced by compacting the powder mass, which is crushed and
fractionated in ambient temperature without the binder. This enables the processing of heat
and moisture sensitive products (Burggraeve, Monteyne, Vervaet, Remon, & De Beer, 2013;
Hansuld & Briens, 2014).

Roll compaction
Roll compaction (RC) is the most commonly used dry granulation technique, which has
growing importance in granulation processing. Powder is compacted to the flakes (ribbons,
sheets or strips) when pressure is exerted in a roll gap, which is a space between the
compaction rolls. Figure 5 shows that there are three different zones between the counterrotating rolls. In the feed zone powder particles are rearranged and compacted. Then those
particles are transported to the compaction zone through the gripping angle, where stress is
applied and particles deform plastically or break (Kleinebudde, 2004; Takeuchi et al., 2009).
The formed flakes are milled into granules, which can be transferred to the tableting process
phase. One of the biggest advantages of this technique is reduction in powder segregation
and increasing bulk density (Pishnamazi et al., 2019).

Cleaning processes
CIP cleaning process
Pharmaceutical manufacturing plant includes several different processes and unit processes
that are also cleaned with various cleaning methods. Usable cleaning methods take into
consideration size and material of the equipment and what kind of pharmaceutical product it
has as a residue. The cleaning process may be executed as an automatic CIP (clean- inplace) process, where water and detergents are added straight into the equipment from the
centralized cleaning distribution system. CIP processes are utilized for large equipment and
assemblies, for example for granulators in the tablet department and for large production
containers in the injection department (Ostrove, 2016). Usually several cleaning groups are
included in the CIP processes of the same equipment. The cleaning group defines the used
detergents and parameters of the CIP cleaning program for all produced products. Selection
of the cleaning group depends on the properties of the API residue to be washed, because
the CIP process can be executed in acidic and/or alkalic conditions in various parameters. If
the API residue is likely to dissolve in alkalic conditions, a base-based cleaning group is
used. In addition to alkalic conditions, higher temperatures are used if the API residue favors
high temperatures for dissolving.
In the CIP cleaning process, washing and rinsing solutions are ordered from the centralized
cleaning distribution system. The high shear wet granulator and the fluidized-bed granulator
can be washed at the same time or both devices separately. The actual washing process
proceeds in such a way that the process device indicates the need for washing, which
creates a washing and rinsing line for washable equipment. The chemical station mixes rinse
or wash solution according to the recipe in service and delivers it to the wash tank. The
control system of the fluidized-bed granulator controls the pumps, valves and heat
exchangers and monitors the execution of the steps of the requested recipe.
The washing process is divided into phases, which are typically pre-rinsing, washing, rinsing,
draining, PW (purified water) rinsing, blowing and drying phases. In the pre-rinse phase, the
main equipment is rinsed before the actual washing with the washing solution, in order to
drain the largest residues left in the device after production. Generated wastewater of the
pre-rinsing is always collected to the separate wastewater tank from tablet mass production.
In the washing step, the surfaces in contact with the product are washed once or more with a
detergent solution according to washing recipes. In the washing phase, the washing solution
can be added as a flushing or it can be circulated in the system. The purpose of the washing
step is to remove product residues. During the rinsing phase, the product contact surfaces
9

are rinsed once or more with water. The purpose of the rinsing step is to remove residues of
detergent from the surfaces of equipment. During the drainage phase, the solution left in the
pipelines is drained as wastewater by avoiding contamination of the solution to be pumped
next. PW rinsing can be used as the last washing step to perform final rinsing on inner
surfaces. These are the CIP cleaning phases, which are generating the process wastewater.
After the last rinsing phase, pipes are blown with compressed air to help drainage and
surfaces of the equipment are dried with air in order to decrease waiting time for the
beginning of next product manufacturing. During the CIP cleaning process, the whole
production room is cleaned by vacuuming, wiping and transferring garbage bags, containers
and tools away (Central States Industrial, 2019; Ostrove, 2016).
CIP or manual cleaning processes are executed to the equipment and rooms only between
the product changes, when the next manufactured product includes a different API than the
previous product. In order to speed up production and reduce losses in production, the aim
is to produce product campaigns with multi-batch series. In this case, the equipment is
washed only once during the campaign after the last batch. So, this means that wastewater
of one cleaning campaign includes accumulated API from several batches. In the case of
bulk products, the duration of one campaign can be up to a week including several batches,
in which case only one cleaning process is executed for all produced batches. Small
products are only made batch by batch and maybe once or twice a year. During the product
campaign, where only a batch is changed or the next product includes the same API as the
previous product with higher concentration, a partial cleaning process is used. In the partial
cleaning process which is executed within a product campaign, water is not used and the
equipment is not disassembled. Because no water is used, outside surfaces of the
equipment and the floor of the manufacturing room is vacuum cleaned during the partial
cleaning process. After that, the other surfaces are cleaned with ethanol wipes and the
garbage bags are changed to the new ones. Documents from the previous batch are also
filed and removed from the room according to the data integrity policy. In the partial cleaning
process of the tablet department, the sieve is also cleaned and after that the floor is cleaned
again if necessary. The production schedule is planned to minimize total and maximize
partial cleaning processes, because having longer production campaigns is a less time
consuming, more cost efficient and sustainable way to produce pharmaceuticals with a high
quality.

Tablet department
Washing area of weighing process
In the weighing process, dry raw materials are weighed and added to the containers in the
weighing room. During the weighing process, the API dust is generated to the surfaces of
the room. The room is cleaned with moist swabs by wiping dust away. When the weighed
load is transferred to the mass manufacturing process, the emptied weighing container is
transferred to the washing area. In the washing area, containers, swabs and tools used in
the weighing room are cleaned. In addition, pallet hoods, which are made from textile and
used by covering pallets as a secondary packaging material, are cleaned in the same room.
Wastewater from cleaning processes of weighing tools and containers is not collected
separately and all generated APIs are released to the wastewater treatment plant.

Cleaning processes of granulators
There are three different fluidized-bed granulators (Granulator 1, Granulator 2 and
Granulator 3) and two different dry granulators (Compactor 1 and Compactor 2) in the mass
manufacturing unit process. All the fluidized-bed granulators include a high-shear wet
granulator unit, which is connected to the FBGs. Granulator 1 has the same cleaning
programs as Granulator 2 because configuration of the devices is identical. The high shear
wet granulator and the fluidized-bed granulator can be washed at the same time or both
devices separately with all granulators.
Wet granulator 1 and Wet granulator 2 can be cleaned separately or together with the
fluidized-bed granulators. If wet granulators are cleaned separately, wastewater are
transported straight to the sewer from the wet granulators. If the wet and fluidized-bed
granulators are cleaned together, the cleaning solution goes from the wet granulator through
the fluidized-bed granulator into the sewer. Wet granulator 1 is connected to the fluidizedbed Granulator 1 and Wet granulator 2 is connected to the Granulator 2 fluidized-bed
granulator. Wet granulator 1 has two cleaning programs, base and acid cleaning programs.
The Wet granulator 2, only has a base cleaning program and a separate initial rinsing
program. The separate pre-rinsing program is used as a pre-wash after the sealing surfaces
of the granulator are cleaned manually. After that, the actual washing program recipe of Wet
granulator 2 is started. Wastewater collection occurs similarly with both wet granulators, the
wastewater from the first rinse is collected and the rest of the wastewater is led through an
intermediate well to the wastewater treatment plant.

11

Granulators 1 and 2 have four different cleaning programs. The first and second cleaning
programs of the Granulators 1 and 2 include acidic and alkalic detergents and the cleaning
programs are processed at a maximum of x degrees. The third cleaning program is executed
using a base detergent at a lower temperature with an extra circular washing phase. The last
cleaning program of Granulators 1 and 2 include a base-based cleaning program for Product
2 mass production with an extra initial rinse. All the first phases of the granulator cleaning
programs include wastewater collection.
Granulator 3 has three different cleaning programs: the first is for the fluidized-bed and wet
granulators, where alkalic and acidic detergents are used. The second cleaning program is
only for the fluidized-bed granulator, which also requires both alkali and acidic detergents. In
the cleaning program of Granulator 3 is used only with the product including API4 as API. In
that cleaning process, both the fluidized-bed and wet granulator units are cleaned. In the first
and second cleaning programs of Granulator 3, the wastewater from the first phase is
collected. In the API4 cleaning program, two first pre-rinsing phases are led to separate
collection of wastewater.

Injection department
Injection department contains two different categories of products; ampoules and
bottles. Ampoules are glass as a material and in the first they are washed, depolarized and
sealed with a flame. Ampoules are manufactured in lines 5 and 6. Bottle product solutions
are produced in lines 1 and 2. Production lines 1 and 5 have portable x-y L vessels that are
cleaned with CIP processes. Production vessels that are difficult to clean are transferred to
the washing area. Usually oil based products, for example API35 and API25 are cleaned in
the washing area for this reason. Production lines 2 and 6 include larger x L containers,
which are not transportable. Those are cleaned with CIP processes. Wastewaters are not
collected separately in the injection department.
In the washing area of the injection department, small product contact parts from the filling
line are cleaned. Those parts which included API residues are cleaned manually in baths
and some parts are also cleaned in ultrasonic baths. There is also a dishwasher for format
parts which are not in the product contact. Because parts of the devices are secondary
contact parts or include small amounts of API residues, it can be assumed that the most API
discharges are generated in automatic cleaning processes in the injection department.

12

There are large amounts of wastewater generated with no API discharges in the injection
department. Steam is used in the sterilization process of ampoules and bottles, which
generates a lot of wastewater. In addition to steam sterilization, the blue bath process is
utilized in sterilization and in studying the quality of ampoules approximately x-y times a
year. The load of ampoules is immersed in blue colored water, which is washed away. After
the blue bath, each ampoule unit is inspected either mechanically or by a person for
ampoule cracks. This process releases methylene blue into the wastewater, which is not
collected separately.

Inhalation department
In the inhalation department, all vessels and tools which are in product contact are
transported to the washing area. There are two rooms where the initial rinse of equipment
and tools is done. There are nozzles on the ceiling, which are switched on for x seconds and
sprayed water wets the dusty equipment and binds dust to the surface of the device by
preventing the float of product dust in the air. In the same room, smaller tools are prewashed manually. All of the generated wastewater from initial rinse rooms are collected
separately. Because it can be visually observed that most API residues are removed from
the equipment surfaces in the initial rinse room, it can be assumed that most inhalation API
residues from the inhalation department are collected to separate wastewater tank.
After pre-rinsing, equipment and tools are transported to the washing area in racks intended
for them. In the washing area, racks are installed to the pass-through dishwasher
(Dishwasher 5), where almost all parts from the mass manufacture and filling lines are
cleaned. In addition to the parts from the mass manufacture and filling lines, the cleaning
utensils are also cleaned in Dishwasher 5. Pass-through washing machine is loaded from
the dirty washing area space and cleaned parts are unloaded in the clean space.
The washing area also includes a smaller dishwasher (Dishwasher 6) and two ultrasonic
baths. Some parts from the filling machines are cleaned in the Dishwasher 6. Certain tools
are pre-washed in ultrasonic baths before starting the actual cleaning process. Dishwasher 7
is used to clean smaller no product contact parts from inhalation production. Strong acid and
base detergents are not used in Dishwasher 7, which enables cleaning of materials with
lower chemical durability.

Pharmaceutical wastewater
Active pharmaceutical ingredients are released to the wastewater in the pharmaceutical
industry and in common use along the domestic wastewater stream (Gadipelly et al., 2014).
Discharged pharmaceutical compounds are transferred through the pipelines to the
wastewater treatment plant as active metabolites or in unmetabolized form. Because the
common wastewater treatment processes are not able to remove pharmaceutical
compounds, most of the discharged pharmaceutical compounds end up in the sea (Heberer,
2002; Mompelat, Le Bot, & Thomas, 2009). In the pharmaceutical industry, compounds are
usually processed in a batch reactor, which releases accumulated compounds to the
wastewater stream as pulses due to the washing processes. Generated wastewater includes
a wide variety of pharmaceutical compounds (Gadipelly et al., 2014). In addition to the
cleaning processes, active pharmaceutical ingredients might be released to the process
wastewater in equipment failure situations, for example leakage of the pipe or tank.
According to the green chemistry principles, environmental risks should be minimized by
managing pharmaceutical wastewater before the processes of the wastewater treatment
plant. By using environmental risk assessment, it can be ensured that discharged API levels
from the manufacturing plant are within limits. Environmental risk assessment is challenging
to implement because pharmaceutical compounds are biologically active, which enables
fatal consequences to living organisms. (Fatta-kassinos, Meric, & Nikolaou, 2011; Heberer,
2002; Huerta & Barcelo, 2012; Iliuta & Larachi, 2001)

Regulations of pharmaceutical wastewater
Industrial wastewater often differs significantly from domestic wastewater. These so-called
industrial effluents can cause problems in sewers, wastewater treatment plants or can
prevent utilization of sludge. To avoid environmental problems and to increase sustainability
in manufacturing processes, several agreements are concluded with companies related to
the production and treatment of generated wastewater. The activities of the pharmaceutical
industry are regulated by, among other things, the laws and regulations regulated in the
environmental permit. In addition to environmental permits, industrial wastewater
agreements and other requirements affect pharmaceutical wastewater treatment (Laki ja
Vesi, 2016; Orion Oyj, 2021a).
An Environmental Protection Act (527/2014) is part of a general law, which aim is to protect
soil, water and the atmosphere. The main purposes of the environmental protection act are
14

to prevent pollution of the environment, reduce emissions and discharges of environmentally
harmful substances and minimize risks of environmental damages. From the wastewater
point of view, the aims of the environmental protection act are to reduce the amount and
harmfulness of generated wastewater (Finlex, 2019). Environmental Protection Decree
713/2014 reguates for example application procedures and permit decisions. It is also
nominating standards for the quality of the generated wastewater that is conveyed to sewers
along with the Environmental Protection Act. Generated wastewaters are also taken into
account in the environmental permit decisions (Finnish Water Utilities Association, 2018).
Environment permit of Orion for example regulates that API residues from tablet production
should be collected by vacuumed from devices before cleaning with water or collect
wastewater from the first rinsing phases to the separate wastewater tank which is treated as
a hazardous waste.

Risk assessment of pharmaceutical wastewater
Risk assessment of the pharmaceutical wastewater is used when the toxicity of the
generated wastewater is unsure. Figure 6 shows that the risk assessment can be done by
calculating a risk quotient, and the persistence and accumulation of the compound.
Comparing the amount of discharge generated by the manufacturing plant to the discharge
caused by users is not actual environmental risk assessment method but with that method it
is possible to solve the importance of the discharges of manufacturing plant (Hernando,
Mezcua, Fernández-Alba, & Barceló, 2006).

Figure 6. Different methods for API Risk Assessment calculations.

Risk Quotient
The environmental risk of an individual API can be assessed by calculating the Risk Quotient
(RQ). Equation 1 shows the risk quotient is based on the ratio between PEC or MEC and
PNEC values. PEC value is estimated environmental concentration of a substance and MEC
value is measured environmental concentration of the substance. PNEC value is assessed
as harmless environmental concentration for the substance (Hernando et al., 2006).
Equation 1. Formula for the RQ calculation.
RQ = PEC or MEC / PNEC
RQ value can be calculated for acute and chronic impact areas in the environment by using
daily API discharge masses. The reason why daily API discharging masses are used is that
the API discharges from the manufacturing plant are not constant because those are
strongly connected to production campaigns. Based on the cleaning campaigns, API
discharges are usually presented as daily pulsed discharges with kg/d unit. The calculations
of a maximum daily discharge have taken into account the API pulse discharge between
minimum and maximum losses in addition to wastewater segregation efficiency. The amount
of production campaigns indicates the frequency of daily discharges.
As table 1 shows, when the calculated RQ value is over 1, environmental risk
characterization or management of the pharmaceutical is required by avoiding harmful
effects to the living organisms. Factors affecting the high RQ value are related to ecotoxicity,
persistence, transport and fate of substances, environmental presence as well as disposal
management and prescription use (Barrie, Rhiannon, Alfred, TongLouis, & Tremblay, 2016).
For example, the RQ value of analgesic or anti-inflammatories (e.g. ibuprofen) is high in the
surface waters, because their occupancy is rather high (Hernando et al., 2006).

Predicted Environmental Concentration
Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) refers to the calculated amount of the API in
the environment. The PEC value is based on the modelling, which is derived from known
environmental persistence, transportation and bioremediation of the substance by utilizing
third-party data, for example EMEA or FDA. Persistence of the API is described as its ability
to be degraded spontaneously in the environment or in the wastewater treatment plant. A
term transportation is used when the pharmaceutical substance can penetrate biological
membranes and accumulate inside flora and fauna. The bioremediation describes the
property of the API when all ecotoxic effects are eliminated by the metabolism of living
organisms. Measured Environmental Concentrations (MEC) values are obtained by
qualification of pharmaceutical substances in the environment. MEC and PEC values can be
compared with each other by ensuring the accuracy of used PEC models (Barrie et al.,
2016).
In the PEC calculations, the characteristics and location of the receiving sea area affect the
dilution factor of the calculations. The assessment should be made on a case-by-case basis
and based on that, dilution factors of the oceans can be divided into two days (acute) or 10
days (chronic) mixing zones. The environmental location and characteristics strongly
influence the used dilution factor. If the characteristics of the water area are not available,
the default dilution factors of PSCI can be used for rivers, lakes and sea water (PSCI, 2020).

Predicted No-Effect Concentration
Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) is the concentration of the pharmaceutical
substance, which does not affect the ecosystem toxically. The PNEC value is usually derived
by using ecotoxicity data. An Assessment Factor (AF) is usually used to describe uncertainty
of the toxicity of organism in the calculations of the PNEC value. Therefore, the more
ecotoxicity is studied, the lower is the AF value. Equation 2 shows that the PNEC value can
be calculated by dividing the toxicity test result (usually marked with EC50 - Effect
Concentration of 50% or NOEC - No-Observed Effect Concentration) with the assessment
factor (Barrie et al., 2016). According to the “Pharmacology beyond the patient – The
environmental risks of human drugs” study, the default PNEC value for APIs is 0,1 µg/L if the
substance does not belong to antibiotics, hormones or their water-octanol partition
coefficient (LogPow or LogD when pH < pKa) is below 3 (Gunnarsson et al., 2019). The
default value can be used if API fulfils previous requirements and there are no study based
PNEC values available.
17

Equation 2. Formula for the PNEC calculation (Hernando, Mezcua, Fernández-Alba, &
Barceló, 2006):
PNEC = EC50 or NOEC / AF

Persistence and bioaccumulation
The environmental hazards of a substance can also be assessed by its physicochemical
properties. These properties determine mobility, persistence and bioaccumulation of the
substance. Pharmaceutical substance properties are strongly connected to the properties of
the environment, like the salinity of the sea water. However, the estimate of the mobility,
persistence and bioaccumulation is not describing numerical risks but it can be categorized
as a PBT (Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic) or vPvB (very persistent and very
Bioaccumulative) (Qingwei, Xiao, Gang, Jun, & Bin, 2016).
The identification of PBT or vPvB substances is regulated by the European Union law, the
REACH Regulation (253/2011). In the table 2 persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity halflife (t1/2) are defined for the PBT and vPvB substances. The term half-life describes the time
it takes for a substance to be 50% degraded. In some cases, very persistent substances
have a higher half-life time than persistent substances. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) is
also higher when substances are classified to the vPvB class instead of PBT class. Toxicity
has a limit only for PBT substances, which is defined as a NOEC or EC10 value (European
Union, R., 2011).

(253/2011) regulation (European Union, 2011).

Consumed based risk assessment
The last option to assess the risk of released APIs from the manufacturing plant is to
compare the amount of discharge discharged by the manufacturing plant to the discharge
caused by users. This is not an actual environmental risk assessment method, because the
purpose of the consumed based risk assessment is to determine the order of magnitude of
API discharges between manufacturing plant and consumers. By comparing discharges from
the manufacturing plant to the discharges of consumers, the significance of discharges of
manufacturing can be noticed. Fimea publishes annual pharmaceutics consumption by using
ATC (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) classification. The use of the pharmaceutical
products are divided into 14 different ATC categories, where consumption is presented as
defined daily doses in proportion to population and time (DDD / 1000 people / day) (Fimea,
2020a; Fimea, 2020b). The DDD is the assumed average dose per day for adults (WHO,
2018). Calculated value indicates, in parts per thousand, the proportion of the population
who have used the drug as a daily dose. Consumption data of Fimea is based on the sale of
pharmaceutical wholesalers to pharmacies and hospitals (Fimea, 2020; Fimea, 2020).
Consumed based risk assessment can be used for annual risk assessment of generated
wastewater by determining whether the plant is a significant point source.

Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients in environment
Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) are organic molecules which are synthesised and
modified to pharmaceutical products (European commission, 2006). Organic molecules
include carbon and usually hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen. There can be other elements or
functionality groups in the organic molecule structure. Organic molecules can be degraded
to carbon dioxide and water due to the oxidation reaction. As a result of oxidation, the other
gases such as oxygen and nitrogen can be formed as by-products. However, elements
alone are not necessarily harmful but their overall structure and pharmacological activity can
be harmful for the environment.
Pharmaceuticals work as an interaction with the binding site of a receptor and formatting a
drug-receptor complex, thus promoting the desired pharmacological activity. The receptors
to which drugs often bind to produce a drug effect are chiral. Thus, receptors can only bind
molecules of a certain shape, but their mirror images do not bind to the receptors properly.
The chirality of pharmaceuticals is important from the wastewater point of view because one
of the enantiomers may be pharmacologically active and the other enantiomer may also be
toxic. That is a reason why discharges of APIs are a cause concern, because their
19

pharmacological activity may affect negative impacts to the environment. For example
antibiotics work on the cell wall of bacteria and do not affect the human body, because cell
walls are not available (Gonzalez-Pleiter et al., 2013). If they end up in the environment,
there is a risk that antibiotics can affect other living organisms. This study focuses on the
effect of two different organic molecules as pharmaceutical products and indications, on
structure, and on environmental effects.

Darolutamide
Darolutamide (C19H19ClN6O2) is approved for treatment of men with non-metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), who are at high risk of developing
metastatic disease (Orion Corporation, 2020; PubChem, 2012). Darolutamide is a newcomer
in the pharmaceutical industry, because the structure was developed in 2008 and the
darolutamide product received a marketing authorization in 2020. The compound is only
researched from a patient-orientated point of view in the three phases ARAMIS study (Orion
Corporation, 2020). Figure 7 shows that the molecule structure of darolutamide includes
cyclic structures of which only one is fully delocalized benzene ring. In addition to the cyclic
structure and carbon elements, the structure of darolutamide also includes nitrogen, oxygen
and chlorine.
Even though the darolutamide product, Nubeqa, has only been manufactured for a short
period of time, its effects on the environment are well studied by Bayer. According to the
Assessment report of European Medicines Agency (EMA), darolutamide is stereoisomere
due to the presence of two chiral centres ((S, S)- and (S, R)-darolutamide). Both
configurations are used in the synthesis as a 1:1 mixture. Darolutamide is not a PBT
substance in the environment, because half-live studies of the persistence, bioaccumulation
and toxicity do not fulfill the requirements of the PBT substance. Darolutamide is insoluble in
water and in the pH range from 1 to 6,5, but in neutral conditions its water solubility is 12,9
mg/L (European Medicines Agency, 2020). As the number of marketing authorizations for
darolutamide products increase and production expands, it is essential to understand the
quantity and sources of darolutamide discharges in order to make the most accurate risk
assessment of their effects on the environment.

20

Figure 7. Chemical structure of Darolutamide (PubChem, 2012).

Quetiapine
Quetiapine (C21H25N3O2S) is an atypical antipsychotic used in the treatment of schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder, which is derived from piperazine derivatives that affect several
neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (PubChem, 2005). Figure 8 shows that
quetiapine has a tricyclic molecular structure, which includes three interconnected rings of
atoms. Molecule structure also includes carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen as
elements. Risk Quotient value for environmental risk assessment has been calculated for
quetiapine by AstraZeneca. Quetiapine is water soluble and it is not biodegradable in the
wastewater treatment process (anaerobic degradation after 57 days was 0%). However it is
extensively degrading in aquatic environments and that is the reason why quetiapine has no
persistent properties in the environment. Also LogPow value is low in the ambient pH of
aquatic environments, which means that the risk for bioaccumulation of quetiapine is also
low. The PEC value for quetiapine is 1,2 µg/L and the PNEC value is 10 µg/L. By calculating
the ratio of PEC and PNEC values, the RQ is 0,12. The value means that quetiapine has a
low environmental risk. However, that number defines only the risk quotient of quetiapine for
the usage in Sweden, because the PEC value takes into consideration the total maximum
daily discharge. Therefore, the value of RQ is not very comparable in the risk assessment of
manufacturing plant discharges (AstraZeneca, 2021).

21

The study of “Experimental and in silico assessment of fate and effects of the antipsychotic
drug quetiapine and its bio- and phototransformation products in aquatic environments”
indicates that quetiapine and its phototransformation products are not readily biodegradable
in aquatic environments. The main biotransformation product of the quetiapine is carboxylic
acid derivative, which is also formed by human metabolism. The results of the study
observed that transformation products of quetiapine have a greater impact on the
environment than quetiapine. UV treatment for degradation of quetiapine was also tested in
the study. Based on the results, UV treatment in the degradation of quetiapine compounds is
not sufficient, because after the treatment, phototransformation products are present and the
biodegradation of them is slower compared to the biodegradation of quetiapine itself.
Because the parent compounds may form many potentially and even more dangerous
decomposition products as degradation products, the transformation products and
metabolites of the API are required to take into consideration in the environment risk
assessment process and at the design stage of wastewater treatment methods. (Herrmann,
Menz, Gassmann, Olsson, & Kümmerer, 2016)

Technical possibilities for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment
In the pharmaceutical industry, wastewater with a high concentration of APIs is generated
abundantly every year. Currently, the first rinsing water is collected to the separate tank from
sources where manual removal of the API residuals is not possible. Those sources are for
example granulators. Inhalation department also has a wastewater collection from rinsing
rooms where most of the API residues from the inhalation mass manufacturing process and
filling lines are generated. Wastewater collection with a high amount of APIs has been seen
as an obligatory option for minimizing API discharges of the wastewater treatment plant.
However, API discharges could be treated at-source by having an API degradation process
instead of the storing and transporting separate collected wastewater to a third-party waste
management company.
Currently, wastewaters are externally treated by evaporating the water and burning the
residue, which releases CO2 emissions and generates additional costs for the company.
Treatment and transportation of separately collected wastewater releases CO2 emissions
approximately 8% of all waste in the manufacturing plant. Absolute net CO2 emissions from
wastewater treatment are the second most significant source of CO2 emissions from all
generated waste in manufacturing plant. By treating API process wastewater streams with
at-source techniques, the company saves on transportation costs and over time, it could be
more economically viable. In addition, CO2 emissions can be reduced if wastewater
treatment is changed to more emission-free technology and if there is no need for the
transportation of the wastewater. If the wastewater is treated internally, it is also easier to
influence the energy source needed for the process, for example by utilizing solar energy.
At-source segregation and treatment of wastewater supports Orion's future emission targets,
because Orion aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the near future
(Orion Oyj, 2021).
It requires a lot of study of different kinds of wastewater treatment methods before the atsource segregation and treatment of the process wastewater can be executed by the
company. In addition to the environmental requirements, the treatment process needs to be
economically viable. Process, infrastructure investments and operational cost should be at a
level that at-source processing is economically profitable. Before the investments can be
calculated and even estimated, different kinds of pre-treatment methods need to be studied
to understand their functionality and suitability to meet the needs of the processes. In this
section, three different wastewater treatment technologies for controlling discharges from

23

pharmaceuticals manufacturing are presented. Materials are based on the Pharmaceutical
Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) webinar.

Vacuum evaporation
Vacuum evaporation is a wastewater treatment method based on the wastewater
evaporation under vacuum conditions. In the treatment process, concentrated API
wastewater and clean distillate are produced. This method seems to be promising because
the treatment process is not selective for different APIs. Separation of the APIs and water is
based on the fact that water evaporates and APIs are not volatile. Other advantages of this
method are that the vacuum enables low operational temperature and because of that the
consumption of energy is low. In addition to the low energy consumption, this technology
includes a heat recovery system. In the vacuum evaporation method, API removal rate is
very high, even a few percentage higher than the API removal rate of the competitive ozone
test. A few percentage lower removal rate can increase the RQ too high for separated water.
However, the capacity of the vacuum evaporation might be a limiting factor because
maximum capacity for high API removal rate is a few cubic meters per day. Also a waste
segregation system is needed in this method (Pharmaceutical supply chain initiative, (PSCI),
2020).

Advanced oxidation process
Advanced oxidation process (A.O.P.) can be used as a pre-treatment method with
pharmaceutical wastewater processing. Figure 9 shows that the method is based on the
function of a catalyst which are converting initiators into OH· radicals. Ultraviolet radiation,
ultrasonic, semiconductor or metal can be the catalyst for this reaction. The initiator can be
hydrogen peroxide, ozone or water. The formed radicals oxidize the API of the wastewater
and degrade APIs to the harmless form. This technology has a high effectivity with organic
pollutants due to the reactive OH· radicals. That enables a high API removal rate. The
treatment unit is also built as a flexible and it is scalable from 1 m3/d to 100 m3/h. However,
the chemistry behind the APIs is quite complex and pH of the wastewater affect the
formation of OH· radical. This technology requires physico-chemical pre-treatment before
A.O.P. can be processed (Pharmaceutical supply chain initiative, (PSCI), 2020).

24

Figure 9. Oxidation pathway of the ozone pre-treatment technology (Pharmaceutical supply
chain initiative, (PSCI), 2020).

Electrochemical oxidation
Electrochemical oxidation (EOx) technology is a branch of A.O.P. and a very potential option
for pharmaceutical wastewater processing. Figure 10 shows that electrochemical cells
include cathode, anode and external source of electricity. Principle of this technology is that
electricity is applied to the system which generates hydroxyl radicals (OH·) and other mixed
oxidants at anode. Due to the oxidation, APIs are degraded to trace by-product gases N2,
H2, O2 and CO2. EOx is effective treatment technology because in reduction with several
APIs is >99% after the treatment process. It works for a wide range of APIs, like antibiotics,
anti-parasitics, anti-fungal, anti-depressants, opioids, steroids, oncology, hormones,
cardiovascular drugs. The other advantages of this technology is that the process does not
require hazardous chemicals and no liquid or solid waste generated during the process
(Pharmaceutical supply chain initiative, (PSCI), 2020).

supply chain initiative, (PSCI), 2020).

Materials and methods
Data collection
Process of analyzing different data for pharmaceutical wastewater is a rather challenging
project, because the facility includes multiple departments, different products and a large
number of different APIs within the manufactured products. Process wastewater is produced
during cleaning processes, where APIs losses are released as an effluent. The APIs that are
released with the non-collected wastewater are discharged to the wastewater treatment
plant through the process wastewater. By researching data related to the API losses and
discharges, it is required to understand the number of manufactured products and batches
and the cleaning processes of the spaces and equipment after manufacturing. This requires
a deep understanding of the operation of the entire plant and knowledge where all the
cleaning processes are undertaken. It is also important to understand that APIs classification
is different depending on their toxicity to the environment.
Process wastewater inventory is based on pharmaceutical production in 2020. That was a
typical manufacturing year, even though the Covid-19 pandemic complicated several things.
Data searching started by listing all manufactured products of all departments. After product
listing, data of the manufactured batches is collected from SAP software. The number of
produced batches, the amount of raw materials, API concentration of the produced mass,
used devices and all inflows and outflows of the product are collected from the PI-sheets of
certain products. After collecting all required information about the products, the amount of
the accumulated API is calculated. After determining the amount of accumulated API, the
mass of the lost API can be assumed to be the same. Figures 11-15 show the material flow
diagram for the manufacturing processes and wastewater generations with collected data.
By having a knowledge of the accumulated product mass, it is possible to calculate the total
residue of APIs in the devices and spaces. It is regulated in the environmental permit that
most of the accumulated mass needs to be collected before cleaning devices with water. For
example, the wastewater collection is included in the first cleaning phase of the granulators
according to the environmental permit. By minimizing API discharges to the wastewater, the
whole device is not fully cleaned between every batch of the tablet products. Manufactured
products with the same API are not cleaned with water between different batches, because
devices are cleaned at the end of the campaigns. Between the batch changes in the same
campaign, the room and some parts are cleaned by vacuuming. When the production of the
27

next product with a different API is started, the device and room are cleaned with water and
needed detergents. Calculating the amount of the generated wastewater requires an
understanding of what cleaning methods are used between batches. In addition to
calculations, the study of API4 discharges of the Granulator 3 is implemented by sampling
wastewater from an intermediate well.

Quantity of discharged pharmaceuticals on the process wastewater
Calculations of discharged APIs are based on mass flows of the unit processes. Processes
are not in steady-state, because devices have product residues after production of batches.
According to equation 3, accumulation (maccumulated) of the APIs to the equipment are
calculated by subtracting the outflows from the inflows. Accumulated mass includes
excipients in addition to API. Because only discharged APIs to the wastewater have been
taken into consideration in the inventory calculations, content of API in residues is
calculated. Equation 4 shows calculation of API content in the accumulated mass.

Equation 3. Calculation of the accumulated mass.
maccumulated = min - mout

Equation 4. Calculation of the API content of the accumulated tablet mass.
API(%) = mAPI / min * maccumulated

Tablet department
In the tablet department, API discharges are calculated in the mass manufacturing unit
process. Tables 4-6 show that batches with certain API belong to cleaning campaigns. The
cleaning campaigns include different amounts of batches which are also marked to the table.
After producing batches under one cleaning campaign, devices are cleaned and
accumulated APIs end up in the wastewater. Figure 16 shows that calculations are divided
into two parts: API discharges in the granulator and after granulator.

Figure 16. Schematic figure of mass manufacturing process of tablet department.
Granulation unit process includes 1. high shear wet granulation and 2. fluidized-bed
granulator. After the granulation unit process includes 3. intermediate container, 4. sieve and
5. final container. Black arrows describe mass flows of raw material, granules and
excipients. Blue arrows describe mass flows of added air and produced flue gases.
Total inflow of the granulator has been calculated by summarizing masses of the raw
materials, which consist of API or several APIs and excipients. Also, the content of the

30

moisture is taken into account in the calculations. At the beginning, the initial moisture
content of raw material is quite low because they are in a solid powder form. After loading
raw material into the granulator, the binder solution is sprayed into the raw material particles
by increasing the moisture of the mass. Before unloading the granulator, granules are dried
to the final moisture. The unloaded granules are sucked though the hose to the intermediate
container and the container is weighed, where comes Outflow, granulator (kg) value. After
weighing the granules, those are sieved with final additives to the final container. API
residuals in the sieve and intermediate container are calculated to the Accumulated API,
after the granulator (kg) part. The intermediate container is washed every cleaning
campaign, not between batches. The final container is weighed and transferred to the
tableting unit process. API residues of the sieving unit process and intermediate container
are calculated by subtracting the final mass of granules from the mass of the granules and
final additives. That is named as an annual API, after granulator (kg). Total API residues in
the whole mass manufacturing unit process is calculated by summing API discharges from
the granulator and after granulator unit processes. Equations 5-9 are included in the
calculations of the tables 3-5.

Total API mass to wastewater in mass manufacturing unit process (kg) = Accumulated API,

31

In calculation of PEC values, estimated daily API discharge value is used. Equation 10
shows that estimated daily API discharges include only the amount of discharged API, not
the amount of collected APIs. Collected wastewater indicates the mass of the wastewater
which has been collected to the separate wastewater collection tank. The rest of the
wastewater is non-collected wastewater, which is led through the intermediate well to the
wastewater treatment plant. Because the “Total API mass to wastewater in mass
manufacturing process (kg)” mass value includes all lost APIs from the mass manufacture
unit process, it is required to define a factor for the amount of “API collection to separate
tank (kg)”. This factor is defined in this study based on the wastewater sampling results of
Granulator 3. In cases where treatment of collected wastewater is done internally, the
effectiveness of the treatment process is deducted from the amount of the API collection to a
separate tank.
Equation 10. Formula for estimated daily API discharge calculations.
Estimated daily API discharge (kg/d) = Total API mass to wastewater in mass manufacturing
unit process (kg) – API collection to separate tank (kg)
Table 3 shows that eleven different products with different APIs are produced with the
Granulator 1 fluidized-bed granulator. API3, API13, API15, API16 and API17 are first mixed
and/or wetted in Wet granulator 1 high shear wet granulator and transported to the
Granulator 1 fluidized-bed granulator where drying takes place. With those products, the
amount of the wastewater includes wastewater from both granulators. API19, API21, API5,
API6, API18 and API12 are granulated only in the fluidized bed granulator. The cleaning
campaigns might include several different contents of API but the content of API has been
taken into account in the calculations. Negative numbers indicate that accumulation of the
previous batch has shifted with the mass of the new batch. Calculations are based on the
equations 3-9.

Table 3. Discharged APIs of the Granulator 1 and Wet granulator 1.
Table 3.
Table 4 shows that the Granulator 2 is used for production of seven different products. There
are listed x pieces of different APIs, but API7, API10 and API3 belong to the Product 3.
Product 3 is also wet granulated in the Wet granulator 2 before it is dried in Granulator 2. In
the production of Product 3, API3 is added after granulation. This explains the zero
discharges of API3 in the granulator. Negative numbers are indicating that residues of the
previous batch have moved with the next batch. Calculations are based on the equations 39.
Table 4. Discharged APIs of the Granulator 2 and Wet granulator 2.
Table 4.
The Granulator 3 is a combination granulator of high shear wet granulator and fluidized-bed
granulator. Table 5 shows that x different products are produced with that equipment. API4,
API20 (x campaigns, y batches) and API15 are first mixed and/or wetted in a high shear wet
granulator and then the mass is dried in a fluidized-bed unit. With those products, both the
high shear wet granulator and the fluidized-bed granulator unit are cleaned. API9, API2,
API8, API20 (x campaigns, y batches), API16 and API14 are granulated only in fluidized-bed
granulator. API20 is listed twice on the table, because it is included in two different products
whose manufacturing and cleaning processes differ from each other.
According to table 5, there are listed different APIs and their cleaning campaigns. The
amount of the produced batches of separate cleaning campaigns are also marked to the
table. Also in this granulator, API discharges are calculated in two phases: API residues in
granulator and after granulator. Accumulated APIs in the granulator means the mass of API
left on the surface of the Granulator 3. After granulation part includes tools and phases when
granules are transported out of the granulator. Masses of the accumulated APIs are
calculated by using equation 3-9.

Inhalation department
In the inhalation production process, no liquid is used. In the manufacture, the dry powders
are mixed together, as a result of which API residues appear as dust on the surface of the
equipment. According to the cleaning processes of the inhalation department, all tools and
vessels are transported to the washing area where pre-rinsing wastewater is collected to the
separate wastewater tank. So, it can be visually observed that most API residues end up in
the separate wastewater tank. In the equations 11-14, mass flows of the API discharges are
calculated based on the masses of the raw materials and produced mass in the production
process. After production of the inhalation mass, inhalator devices are filled with the
produced mass in the filling lines. The residues of the APIs in the filling lines have also been
taken into consideration in the calculations. In the inhalation department, all the parts of the
devices are cleaned between every batch, which means that the cleaning campaigns are not
used in this department.
Equation 11. Calculations of the theoretical mass of the inhalation department.
Theoretical mass (kg) = API inflows (kg) + Lactose (kg)
Equation 12. Calculations of the accumulated mass of the inhalation department.
Accumulation (kg) = Theoretical mass (kg) - Produced mass (kg)
Equation 13. Calculation of the API content of the inhalation department.
API (%) = API inflow (kg) / Theoretical mass (kg) *100%
Equation 14. Calculation of lost API mass in the inhalation department.
API to wastewater (g) = (API (%) / 100 * Accumulation (kg)) * 1000
The washing area of the inhalation department includes pre-rinsing rooms where all devices,
vessels and tools are rinsed before cleaning processes. All the wastewater which is
generated during the pre-rinsing process is collected separately. Wastewater from the
cleaning processes is led to through the intermediate well to the wastewater treatment plant.
Amount of the lost API to the non-collectable wastewater is dependent on the result of the
pre-rinsing process. To ensure minimal API discharges from the inhalation washing area,
devices, tools and vessels from the production line and the filling line are studied by taking
photos before and after the pre-rinsing process. Figures 17 and 18 show some parts from
the production and the filling lines before the pre-rinsing process. It can be noticed that there
is white product dust on the surfaces.

Injection department
In the injection products APIs are dissolved, because products are in liquid forms. After the
manufacturing process, the surfaces of the emptied production container drain almost clean
and potential residues are in small amounts at the bottom of the containers. In addition,
several injection products include very small content of dissolved API and no dust is
generated during the production, it can be assumed that API discharges from the injection
department are minor. Size of the batches are also smaller compared to the batch sizes of
the tablet department. In the injection department devices are cleaned between every batch,
which means that all API residues of the batches go straight to the wastewater. Mass of the
discharged APIs is calculated in equations 15-18.

Theoretical mass (kg) = API inflow (kg) + Additives inflow (kg)

Sampling of wastewater
Wastewater sampling and a working instruction of the sampling were also done in this study.
Sampling procedure is possible to do by using a discrete sampling method or composite
sampling method. The discrete sample is taken at a precise location in a certain time. It
describes the level of the API concentration at a specific time. Discrete samples are not
dependent on the volumetric flow of wastewater because the API concentration
characterizes a general API concentration level and not discharged masses of APIs. An
advantage of discrete sampling is that the sampling time can be planned according to the
cleaning processes in the production. As the sampling time follows the production schedule,
API concentration peaks can be detected. This sampling method enables identification of
sources of potential API discharges, but it is quite time sensitive. By taking samples before
and after the cleaning process, it can be determined whether rinsing of equipment and
separate collection of wastewater are sufficient.
In the composite sampling two or more samples or subsamples are collected either
discretely or continuously mixed together in appropriate known proportions. Volumetric flow
of wastewater is required for composite sampling, because masses of APIs are calculated.
The results of composite sampling give an average of the API level in the longer term, which
enables estimation of wastewater quality and average of the discharged APIs. Composite
sampling analyzes the quality of generated wastewater for example per day, but its
disadvantage is that possible API concentration peaks might not be noticed.
Figure 19 shows the differences between discrete or composite sampling methods. Red
curve corresponds to the API concentration level of the discrete sampling and black stars
describe discrete sampling points. Yellow line corresponds to the API concentration level in
the composite sampling, which is an average from the red curve. Blue columns in the chart
are mass flow of the generated wastewater to the intermediate well. Mass flow of
wastewater is based on the CIP and manual cleaning processes of the manufacturing plant.
Data of the chart is not based on the measurements.

38

Figure 19. Comparison graph of discrete and composite sampling method. Black stars are
discrete samples and the yellow line describes composite sampling during 24 hours.
At the beginning of the sampling, the working instruction was written. The working instruction
includes information about the sampling place, dimensions of the sewage well, sampler,
safety, sampling schedule, step-by-step procedure and measurement report template. After
the working instruction had been approved, the sampling was planned according to the
manufacturing schedule. The aim was to take a wastewater sample before the cleaning
process in the tablet department starts. The sample was a so-called blank sample of
wastewater. When the automation report registered the cleaning process of the desired
equipment to be performed, a certain time was consumed to ensure that the effluent fraction
was transported from the equipment through the pipeline to the well before the sampling was
started. The sample was placed in a sample bottle and warning signs were added according
to the CLP regulations. The sample was analyzed in an external laboratory.
The first sample after the cleaning process was planned to be taken after API4 mass
production. API4 is manufactured by using the Granulator 3. The cleaning process for API4
mass includes two rinsing phases with water. Both phases are collected separately to the
wastewater tank, which is processed at Fortum. The rest of the generated wastewater from
the cleaning process phases are transferred to the municipal sewerage network through the
intermediate well. The intermediate well includes all process waterwater. Process
wastewater and sanitary wastewater are collected together after this well. Intermediate well
is located at Orion and samples are taken from there.
39

Dimensions of the intermediate well
The intermediate well includes two separate manhole covers on the ground. In figure 20, the
left side of the intermediate well includes process wastewater input. Volume of the
wastewater in the intermediate well is approximately x m3. The length of the well is x m,
width x m and height x m, where the maximum surface level of wastewater is x m. In the
middle of the well, there is a x m high wall which includes five pieces of x cm holes placed x
cm from the bottom and x cm from the surface. Holes enable flow of the wastewater from the
left side to the right side. On the right side of the well, process wastewater continues to
another well where the process wastewater and sanitary wastewater are combined.

Figure 20. Cross-section of intermediate well for process wastewater.

Sampling from intermediate well
Safety is one of the main issues when starting a sampling procedure. Process wastewater
includes very acidic and alkaline detergents from cleaning processes of the manufacturing
processes. Wastewater may also contain several potent drugs in different concentrations.
During sampling, it is important to ensure that the effluent is not in contact with the skin and
eyes. Due to the hazard of the effluent, the protective gear was worn during the sampling.
The protective gear includes a reflective overall, which prevents harmful droplets from
entering the skin. The protective overall has a reflective surface, which improves visibility for
other road users, for example for the heavy traffic. The protective gear also includes goggles
or a visor. A visor may be better because it prevents all splashes from entering the face
40

area. A visor helmet may also be worn during sampling if a separate visor is not available.
Nitrile protective gloves should be worn during the sampling, preferably two on top of each
other due to the risk of tearing. In image 21, a respirator mask was used only for preventing
the spread of Covid-19 infection. In addition to the safety gear, the sampling area must be
separated and marked with safety cones and the main gate is informed about the work.

Figure 21. Sampling from the intermediate well. 1. Taking the process wastewater sample
from the intermediate well and 2. Bottling the sample.
In the sampling situation, the person from facility maintenance (FM) was asked to open the
cover of the manhole. The cover should be open only when the sample is lifted from the well
41

to the ground. Before and after that it should be closed to avoid accidents like someone
falling into the well. When a sampler is put down to the well, the depth of the sampling
container is verified from the measurement scale of the telescope stick. When a sample is
lifted up from the well, the cover is closed and the sample is bottled at least 3 meters from
the well for safety reasons. Before the sample bottling, the sampling time is marked down in
the measurement report. At the beginning of bottling, the sample bottle is rinsed once with
the sample. Rinsing solution is poured into the waste bottle. After rinsing, the sample volume
was measured with a plastic measuring glass and poured into the bottle. The sample bottle
was marked with the name of the sample, sampling date and warning signs before the
sample was placed into it. After bottling, the sample bottle was closed tightly and splashes
outside were removed. The cap was sealed with parafilm and the bottles were placed in
double plastic bags before they were sent to an external laboratory.
Two samples were taken in the sampling. The first sample was a blank sample which was
taken before the cleaning process of the granulator started. The second sample was taken
after x hours from the granulator cleaning process. The first sample was planned to be taken
approximately x-y hours after the cleaning process, but the cleaning process was finished on
Friday at 9 pm and it was not possible to take the sample that late because people from FM
were not available. The staff in the pharmaceutical manufacturing process work in three
shifts, from 7 am to 3 pm, from 3 pm to 11 pm and from 11 pm to 7 am. Saturday is not a
workday and the work week starts the Sunday night shift. Even though x hours had elapsed
since the cleaning process, it is likely that the wastewater from the granulator was still in the
intermediate well because no CIP washes were performed on Sunday evening. Generated
wastewater is transferred through a sewage pumping station and pipelines before it reaches
the intermediate well of process wastewater. The capacity of the pumping station is
estimated to be approximately x cubic meters.

Sampling after changes of the cleaning process
After the first sampling from the intermediate well, the API4 was observed to remain in the
process wastewater. Because all API4 placed in the intermediate well is discharged to the
wastewater treatment plant, the cleaning program of Granulator 3 is changed. In the original
cleaning program where the first samples were taken, x kg of wastewater is collected to the
separate wastewater tank and x kg of non-collected wastewater is led to the intermediate
well. In the changed cleaning program, 40% more wastewater was collected. The rest of the

42

x kg of the wastewater from the changed cleaning program of Granulator 3 was led to the
intermediate well.
Like in the first sampling, two samples were also taken in this sampling. The first sample was
a blank sample, which had been taken before the start point of the cleaning process of
Granulator 3. The second sample was taken x hours after the end point of the changed
cleaning program of Granulator 3. In the wastewater sampling of the original cleaning
program, the waiting time between the end point of the cleaning program and the sampling
after cleaning was x hours. In the optimal situation, the waiting time should be the same as
in the previous sampling, but then the sample of the after changed cleaning program should
have been taken on Sunday evening and it is not possible because people from the FM are
not available. The x hours should be sufficient time from wastewater to attain the
intermediate well, because wastewater is piped from the granulator to the production water
pumping station where pumps are pumping approximately x cubic meter per hour of
wastewater through the pipelines to the intermediate well. If x kg of wastewater is led to the
intermediate well, it can be assumed that at least the first phases after wastewater collection
are led to the intermediate well. After waiting time, the second sample was taken and
samples were sent to the external laboratory to get an analysis of the quality of wastewater
samples.

Sampling in the washing area
The purpose of the washing area sampling was to determine generated API residues from
the small tools (buckets, spoons etc.). The sampling was done in the washing area of the
weighing process. Because tools might contain dusty potent APIs, protection against
potential exposure is certainly important. Because the washing area is classified to the
cleanliness class E, gauze overall, cap and shoe covers are required. In addition to the
general protective gears of the hygienic requirements of the department, a waterproof apron,
sleeve protectors and motorized fresh air hood were used to prevent exposure of the API
dust and solution. Also, double nitrile protective gloves were worn during the sampling.
The cleaning process of small tools includes rinsing in the sink, manually dishwashing in the
sink with neutral detergent and cleaning in the Dishwasher 1, which uses purified water in
the last rinsing phase. After the pre-rinsing and manual dishwashing, most of the API
residues are removed. Thus, it can be assumed that all API residues from the tools go
through the sink straight to the intermediate well without separate wastewater collection.

43

Because the amount of API residues in the tools was unknown, it was determined by taking
samples from the rinsing water.
Figure 22 shows the uncleaned tools of API39. The tools were rinsed with warm water by
brushing the tools with a dish brush. Rinsing water was collected to the bucket during
rinsing. The aim of the rinsing was to use as little as possible water, because a large amount
of water dilutes the concentration of the API. Figure 23 shows the results of pre-rinsing. The
total volume of rinsing water was measured, sample bottles were rinsed with sample and
measured samples were poured into the bottles. The sample bottle was marked and packed
in the same way like previous samples before sending it to the external laboratory.

Washing area of weighing unit process
All the weighing tools and raw material containers of different departments are cleaned in the
weighing washing area. Wastewater is not collected from that area. The weighing tools of
inhalation products are rinsed before cleaning in the Dishwasher 1. Other weighing tools are
disposable. The API loss of weighing tools is studied for API39 spoons and scoops.
According to the results, x g of API39 is released to the non-collected wastewater from one
pair of spoon and scoop. It is assumed that all the spoons and scoops release the same
amount of API to non-collected wastewater. Amount of the discharged API in weighing tools
45

is calculated by taking into consideration the amount of the used tools of spoons and scoops
per year.
In addition to the weighing tools, emptied containers for weighed raw materials are cleaned
in this washing area. Containers are cleaned in Container dishwashers 1 and 2. This study
does not contain data from API residues from containers. Cleaning utensils, like swabs, used
for weighing rooms cleaning are also cleaned in this room in Washing machines 1 and 2.
Those include only a small amount of API as a dust. Pallet hoods used as a secondary
packaging material are cleaned in the same washing machines as swabs, but those do not
include API residues.

CIP and washing area in mass manufacture unit process
High shear and fluidized-bed granulators include CIP cleaning programs, where wastewater
from the first rinsing phases are collected to the separate wastewater collection tank.
Compactors are vacuumed before manual cleaning with water. Because of the wastewater
collection and vacuuming, most API losses from granulators and compactors are disposed of
as pharmaceutical waste to the third-party waste management company. Only the leftover
API residues after the rinsing and vacuuming are discharged to the wastewater treatment
plant. Table 7 shows calculated API losses for all high shear and fluidized-bed granulators
and also for compactors and direct mixers. API losses are the amount of manufactured
mass, which does not end up in the product. Calculated API losses describe the total
amount of lost API in devices, from which some part is vacuumed and collected to the
wastewater collection tank and rest of the API residues is discharged through the
intermediated well to the wastewater treatment plant. The rest of the API residues are called
as estimated daily API discharges, which is calculated for all APIs by utilizing results from
the wastewater sampling of Granulator 3. In the sampling of wastewater, the split factor
between collected and non-collected wastewater was defined for wastewater collection of
the cleaning process of API4 mass at Granulator 3. The split factor of Granulator 3 was used
as a default value for all granulators and the cleaning programs, which enabled possibilities
to calculate estimated daily API discharges for all APIs. The PEC values are possible to
calculate by using estimated daily API discharge masses.

46

Table 7. Lost and discharged APIs in the mass manufacturing unit process. *=no data.
Table 7.

Granulator 1 and Wet granulator 1
Table 7 shows that most loss of APIs comes from the high shear and fluidized-bed
granulators. In Granulator 1 fluidized-bed granulator is granulating API3, API5, API6, API12,
API13, API15, API16, API17, API18, API19 and API21. In the mass production of API3,
API13, API15, API16 and API17, the high shear granulator 1 is also used. In Product 2
production API13 is only dry mixed in the high shear granulator without adding a granulation
solution.
API losses of mass manufacturing processes are divided into two units. The first unit of the
mass manufacture process includes mass production in granulators. Granulators are
cleaned at the end of every cleaning campaign in connection with product changes. API
losses for different products are calculated for separate cleaning campaigns and those
include different amounts of produced batches. Highest API losses in total for Granulator 1
are for API3, API13, API15, API16 and API17. The highest estimated daily discharge was for
API13 and API15. The reason for higher API losses is affiliated to the amount of produced
batches and the process of mass manufacture. All of those APIs are granulated in both
granulators which affects the amount of API losses.
API loss after the granulation comes from containers and sieve, to which granules are
transported out from the granulators. API losses are also calculated for them. For API13 and
API5 mass of the after granulation unit process is negative. For API5 the slightly negative
value is only -x kg/y which can be caused by the inaccuracy of the weighing scale. For
API13, the annual mass of after granulation is -x kg/y. The mass difference of lost API13 per
batch varies from -x kg to y kg. Because the mass for many batches is slightly negative,
therefore the total mass of that unit process is highly negative. During the research phase
the manufacturing process of Product 2 was observed in order to locate the cause for mass
loss. The main reason for negative numbers is changes in mass humidity during the
process, because it is the biggest variable and the same phenomena is not faced with
inhalation and injection products, where products are totally dry or in liquid form.

47

Granulator 2 and Wet granulator 2
Table 7 shows that Granulator 2 fluidized-bed granulator is used to granulate API6, API7,
API10, API14, API16, API18, API19 and API20. Granulator 2 and Wet granulator 2 are
mainly used with the mass production of Product 3. Product 3 includes x different APIs:
API10, API7 and API3. API3 is not granulated because it is added to the intermediate
container with granules which contain API10 and API7. High shear granulator is used in
mass production of API7, API10 and API16. After that the wett mass is dried in the
Granulator 2 fluidized-bed granulator. API7, API10, API16 and API19 have the highest total
API losses in the mass manufacturing process. API19 is the only API from those which does
not include a high shear granulation process. API19, API7, API14 and API18 also have a
negative mass value for the after granulation part, which is caused by the changes of the
mass moisture.
Granulator 3
Granulator 3 includes high shear and fluidized-bed granulator units. Table 7 shows, API2,
API4, API8, API9, API14, API15, API16 and API20 are granulated with excipients in that
granulator. API4, API20 and API15 are granulated in both granulation units. Rest of the APIs
which are granulated in Granulator 3 utilizing only the fluidized-bed granulator unit. The
biggest API losses in the Granulator 3 are with API4, API9 and API15. API14, API16 and
API20 also have some API losses per year, but those losses are clearly smaller compared to
the annual API losses of API4, API9 and API15. API4 losses might increase in the future if
the amount of the increased batches increase the amount of the cleaning campaigns.

Sampling of wastewater
The API discharges from the Granulator 3 were studied with wastewater sampling from the
intermediate well. Table 8 shows the results of samplings, where the Zero sample 1 was
taken before the cleaning process of Granulator 3 and After cleaning sample 1 was taken
after the original cleaning process of Granulator 3. In the cleaning process, the first rinsing
phases of high shear granulator and fluidized-bed granulators were collected to the separate
wastewater tank. The zero sample 1 and After cleaning 1 are taken with the current cleaning
program where x kg of the wastewater is collected and x kg of the wastewater are led to the
intermediate well. Before the cleaning process, x batches of API4 mass were manufactured.
API4 concentration of the zero sample was x µg/L. After the cleaning process, the
concentration of the API4 was x µg/L. This means that the difference of API4 concentration
is x µg/L. Because the data of the mass flow of the wastewater to the intermediate well is not
available, the mass of discharged API4 is calculated by using the volume of the intermediate
48

well. According to the calculations, x g of API4 is discharged with that cleaning program.
This amount corresponds to the mass of API4 in x tablets. Based on the sample results and
maximum daily API loss which is x kg/campaign without collection, only x% of API4 is
discharged.
Table 8 also shows the API4 concentration difference in the changed cleaning program. In
the changed cleaning program, x kg of wastewater is collected instead of x kg. The
remaining x kg of wastewater is led to the intermediate well where the sampling takes place.
Before the cleaning process, x batches of API4 mass were manufactured. The API4
difference between zero sample 2 and After cleaning 2 is x µg/L. Based on the concentration
difference and the volume of the intermediate well, at least x g of API4 is discharged in the
changed cleaning program during the cleaning campaign. Thus, prolonging the collection
rinse increased API4 discharges by x g per cleaning campaign. It was not an expected
result, because the increased wastewater collection should reduce API discharges. The
reason for the unexpected result was probably that the waiting time was x hours longer in
the first sampling (Zero sample 1 and After cleaning 1), when the wastewater from the
cleaning of Granulator 3 might already pass the intermediate well. Another reason for lower
discharges in the first samples might be that effluent had been in the well over the weekend
without flow and at the time of sampling the well effluent may not have been so well mixed.
The possible lack of mixing may affect how a representative sample was taken.
Table 8. The amount of the discharged API4 and risk quotient after the cleaning processes
of Granulator 3. The worst case is not the real situation, it only demonstrates the need for
wastewater collection. *= not analyzed, the discharge mass for the worst case is based on
the maximum loss of API4 in a campaign. Question mark is an unknown variable.
Table 8.
With risk assessment, it is possible to calculate the maximum limit for daily discharging of
API4. A chronic PNEC value is x µg/L and an acute PNEC value x µg/L for API4. If the loss
of API4 is calculated as a daily loss, the discharge per day is x-y kg/d for API4 without
wastewater collection. In the worst case without wastewater collection, x kg/d of API4 would
lead to the wastewater treatment plant. Currently, the wastewater collection is used and
based on the Zero sample 1 and After cleaning 1 results, estimated daily API4 discharge in
the campaign of the original cleaning process is x kg/d. With that estimated daily API4
discharge value, the chronic PEC value is x µg/L and the acute PEC value is x µg/L.
According to these values, the acute risk quotient value for the original cleaning process of
API4 mass is x and the chronic RQ is x. In the second sampling, the estimated daily API4
49

discharge value is x kg/d, and then the chronic PEC value is x µg/L and the acute PEC value
is x µg/L. RQs for the API4 discharges of the changed cleaning program are ≤ 0,1. Those
mean that there is negligible environmental risk of the API4 with both cleaning processes,
when x-y kg of wastewater is collected. So, the wastewater collection of the original cleaning
program is sufficient. If wastewater collection would not exist, the acute RQ for API4 would
be x and the chronic RQ x in the worst case. In that case, RQ values indicate that there is a
high environmental risk of the substance. This explains the imperative need of the
wastewater collection.
According to the lost mass calculations, total API4 maximum loss for one cleaning campaign
is x kg, from which only x g is discharged in the original cleaning program. Limit for daily
discharge of API4 is x kg. This is defined by calculating the mass of the discharged API4
when RQ < 1. When the maximum API4 discharge limit for one cleaning campaign has been
taken into consideration, approximately x% of lost API4 is allowed to discharge. Based on
that value, the original cleaning program for API4 collection is sufficient because only x%
was discharged. Because API4 has become a very important API for the future, the amount
of lost API will slightly increase. However, the loss of API4 does not increase linearly with the
number of batches produced, because the number of cleaning campaigns does not increase
in proportion to the number of batches. The length of the campaign is an important factor in
the formation of API discharges, because increasing the number of batches within a series
reduces the number of washes and thus API discharges. Based on the unexpected sampling
results, it would be usable to do a third sampling after x hours of the end point of the original
cleaning program of Granulator 3.

Washing area of the mass manufacture process
After the granulation process, some portable parts from granulators are also transported to
the mass manufacture washing area. The room includes a rinsing area, Washing machine 3
and Dishwasher 2. Figure 24 shows the rinsing area, where all parts of the granulators,
vessels and vacuum cleaner hoses are rinsed before the cleaning in the machines. Figure
25 shows the API residues on the vacuum cleaner hose surface before rinsing. The
generated wastewater in the rinsing unit process is not collected. Also, the leftovers of
granulation solutions are released in the rinsing area. Granulation solutions do not include
APIs, but usually they include ethanol or gelatin in addition to the water.

the granulation solution appears on the right side of the figure.

Figure 25. Vacuum cleaner hose before rinsing.
In the Washing machine 3, filter bags from granulators are cleaned. As the figure 26 shows,
filter bags from the granulator include abundantly mass from the granulation process. Before
transportation of filter bags to the washing area, they are required to be shaken and wetted
inside the granulator. Then the rinsed filter bags are ready to be washed in the Washing
machine 3. Hoses from vacuums are also cleaned in that washing machine after pre-rinsing.
Rinsing water from vacuum hoses is not collected. Washing machine 3 has a manual
wastewater collection button which can be switched on for all washes by operator so API
residues from filter bags are collected and treated. Rest of the fluidized-bed granulator is
cleaned with a CIP cleaning process.

manufacture process. 1. Opened fluidized-bed granulator, 2. Filter bags of granulator and
spraying nozzle and 3. The bottom of the granulator.
Compactors are disassembled and the parts are transported to the washing area of the
mass manufacture. Non-disassembled parts of the compactors are vacuumed and cleaned
manually. Discharges of the direct mixing process include API as dust, which is released
from the Container dishwasher 3. According to the results of table 7, losses of APIs in
compactors are approximately x kg/y API7 and x kg/y of API17, from where most losses are
vacuumed and disposed as a hazardous waste. From the containers of direct mixing x kg/y
of API1 and x kg/y of API11 are discharged.
Because API discharges are pulse-like, the risks to the environment should be calculated
according to the maximum possible discharges during one campaign. Table 9 shows
estimated daily discharges, RQ acute and chronic values and API maximum daily limits of
APIs of tablet department. Range for estimated daily discharges are calculated by listing
minimum and maximum API losses in the cleaning campaigns for each API and taking
account the percentage of non-collected wastewater. The API content of non-collected
52

wastewater is x%, which is based on the sampling results. RQs is calculated as a proportion
of PEC and PNEC. For the APIs of unknown PNEC value, the default PNEC value for APIs
is 0,1 µg/L is used.
According to the Average of RQ acute values API19 might have a medium environmental
risk in acute areas. It is necessary to collect more data and study the ecotoxicity of API19.
API19 is manufactured in Granulator 1 and Granulator 2. High shear wet granulators are not
used in the mass manufacturing of products including API19. Annual production of API19
has x cleaning campaigns. That means that API is discharged approximately once in x
months. The cleaning group of API19 belongs to group x, where the granulator is cleaned
with base detergents at x degrees. In addition to the ecotoxicity studies, it would be
necessary to take a closer look for API19 mass calculations. API9, API12 and API15 have
low environmental risks in the acute and chronic areas. API10 and API14 also have low
environmental risks in the acute area. In addition to API9, API12 and API15, low
environmental risks in the chronic area might also occur with API3, API13 and API17. Rest
of the APIs in the tablet department have negligible environmental risk in acute and chronic
areas.

Because either acute or chronic PNEC value is available only for half of the tablet APIs, the
rest of the RQs are calculated by using 0,1 µg/l as a default PNEC value. The default PNEC
value may be misleading for some APIs. However, another problem is that different
references offer different PNEC values for the same API and it is very difficult to find out
which of the results is the most reliable. Some studies are providing computer modelled
PNEC values, but those are not reliable because there is no experimental ecotoxicity data
available. In addition, the properties of APIs affect the PNEC values. If the API is lipophilic
and LogKow>3, the default PNEC value is not appropriate for risk assessment calculations.
Also in cases of hormones and antibiotics, default PNEC is not reliable. In these
calculations, it is expected that all API discharges end up in the environment without
biodegradation or binding to the sludge. Figure 27 shows the RQs of different tablet APIs in
acute and chronic areas. APIs which RQ use default PNEC values as acute area are marked
with orange colour and chronic RQ calculations with default PNEC values are marked with
black colour.

Inhalation department
In the inhalation department all parts from production and filling lines are cleaned in the
washing area. Table 10 shows that all the parts from production and filling lines are rinsed in
separate rooms where all generated wastewater is collected to the separate tank. After prerinsing tools are mainly cleaned in the washing area of the inhalation department. Generated
wastewater from that room is led through the intermediate well to the wastewater treatment
plant. After rinsing, some parts having poor chemical resistance are cleaned in Dishwasher
7. The washing area of the inhalation department does not include wastewater collection.
Inhalation weighing tools are cleaned in the same washing area where weighing tools from
the tablet and injection department are cleaned. Tools are rinsed and then washed in
Dishwasher 1. Rinsing wastewater form inhalation weighing tools are not collected.

Cleaning of rinsed parts from

In the inhalation department, cleaning campaigns are not used because all production and
filling lines are cleaned between every batch. Because of that, the amount of batches
indicates also the amount of cleaning processes. In the inhalation department, API losses
are calculated for 7 different APIs. Table 11 shows the total amount of lost APIs in the
inhalation department. Amounts of the lost APIs are in grams per year. Figure 28 shows that
the reason for highest API loss for API39 is that its production volume is annually highest.
Amount of the produced API41 batches is second highest, but the API41 loss is rather small
because its concentration in the product is small. Table 11 also includes the number of the
annual produced batches and the amount of the lost API in one batch for all APIs. Maximum
daily discharge limits calculated for inhalation APIs with default PNEC value. Whether to
collect the wastewater or not can be determined by comparing the lost API per batch
masses to maximum daily discharge limits. Because of that, it can be noticed that API loss
55

per batch is higher for API38, API39 and API40 than the daily maximum limit. Without
wastewater collection, those APIs would be a risk to the environment. Based on that, it can
be proved that wastewater collection is required in the inhalation department.
Table 11 also includes inhalation API losses in the weighing washing area. API losses in the
weighing washing area were studied with API39. The result of the study was that x g of
API39 is lost per spoon and scoop. The API loss is assumed to be the same with all other
APIs in the weighing washing area. Masses of lost APIs in the washing area are calculated
by multiplying the amount of the washed spoons and scoops with x g which comes from the
one pair of those. Masses of lost APIs from the weighing area are discharged, because there
is no wastewater collection. If the annual masses of lost APIs from the weighing area are
compared to the max daily discharge values, all of the API discharges from the weighing
area are below the discharge limits. Discharge limits are set for a one day and masses of
lost APIs from the weighing area are for the whole year. So daily API discharges from the
weighing area are very minor and there is negligible environmental risk from those. Based
on that, wastewater collection is not needed for weighing tools.

Figure 28. Amount of the produced batches for different inhalation APIs in 2020. APIs from
the combination products have been calculated separately.
In the inhalation department, all used tools and vessels are transported to the washing area.
At the beginning of the cleaning process, tools and vessels from the production and filling
lines are rinsed in the pre-rinsing room. To ensure that most APIs from the inhalation
department are led to the separate wastewater tanks as an effluent, pictures were taken of
the production and filling lines parts before and after pre-rinsing. Figures 29 and 30 show
results of pre-rinsing. Those figures are taken after pre-rinsing and before cleaning in
Dishwasher 5. Figure 29 shows that production tools include some small API residues on the
surfaces after pre-rinsing. At least the figure 29 part 5. shows that the lids of vessels include
some API residues on the surfaces.

Figure 30 shows that glass parts from the dispenser and filling unit seem to be clean after
pre-rinsing. Wheel parts, feed screw and mixer include white product residues. In figure 30
part 4, the feed screws are only parts which are cleaned in an ultrasonic bath after prerinsing. Even though some parts still include residues from products, it can be assumed that
a negligible amount of API residues are led to the intermediate well from the inhalation
washing area. That is a reason why RQ values are not calculated for the inhalation
department.

Injection department
In the injection department, API wastewaters are mainly generated in the CIP cleaning
processes of the production vessels. Table 12 shows that the production vessels are mainly
cleaned with CIP processes but with some difficult-to-clean products, for example products
with API34 and API35, vessels are first transported to the washing area for pre-rinsing. In
addition to the pre-rinsing of vessels, some small tools are cleaned in the washing area of
the injection department. Wastewater without APIs is also generated in sterilization
processes and quality tests. In the sterilization process ampoules, bottles or other equipment
are heated with steam. Tests of the material quality are performed about x times per year
with a blue bath. In the injection department, wastewater is not collected.

In the injection department, all APIs are in liquid form during the manufacturing. In the
injection department, cleaning campaigns are not used because all production lines are
cleaned between every batch. Because of that, the amount of batches indicates also the
amount of cleaning processes. Table 13 shows that the amount of the API lost is highest for
API22. If the amount of the produced batches is compared between different APIs, products
with API22 are produced over x times less than products with API27 and still the API22
discharges are x times higher than API27 discharges. The reason for different API
discharges is that the API22 concentration is approximately x% in the product and the
concentration of API27 is varying between x-y%. Based on that, products with high API
concentration should be paid more attention from wastewater point of view. The second
highest API losses are for API23 and API37. But for those APIs, the annual API lost is below
x kg. API37 belongs to vitamins, and risk assessments are not calculated for the vitamins.
API losses per batch are highest for API22, API23, API31, API35 and API37. The higher API
losses for those APIs are the result of the higher API concentration in the product.
60

Table 13 includes the estimated average daily discharges for APIs. Estimated average daily
discharge is an average of minimum and maximum API discharges from manufactured
batches. If estimated average daily discharges are compared to the maximum discharge
limits, API22, API23, API26, API29, API31, API35 and API36 might have risk to the
environment. However, the risk quotients have many uncertainties because all the RQ
values for injection APIs are calculated by using the default PNEC value. The value is not
usable for all APIs, because they might be a lipophilic and default PNEC value is usable only
for APIs with LogKow below 3. So, API22, API23, API26, API29, API31, API35 and API36
require more study about the ecotoxicity before it is possible to categorize it to any group of
environmental risks. Before changes to the injection wastewater collection it is required to
study more the APIs with possibility of environmental risk, because default PNEC value is
used for all injection APIs and it is not suitable for all of them. After further risk assessment,
that it is necessary to consider if some wastewater needs to be collected from the injection
department. First-hand solution for minimizing API discharges is to collect manually rinsing
water from the production of APIs with possible environmental risks. When more accurate
risk assessment is done, further long-term solutions can be selected.

Suggestions for wastewater management and inventory system
Wastewater management
Figure 32 shows the comparison of annual API losses in different departments. It is easy to
see that API losses of the tablet department are by far the highest. However, most of the lost
API in tablet and inhalation departments are collected. API losses from injection are not
collected. Even though the large amount of API losses are collected from the tablet
department, figure 32 still indicates that the largest discharges come from there.

Figure 32. Comparison of annual API losses in different departments.
Dishwasher 9 room includes pre-rinsing areas for small tools and containers and the passthrough dishwasher, where after the granulation parts, e.g. containers, will be washed in the
future. Currently, there is no wastewater collection in Dishwasher 9. By minimizing API
discharges, it is necessary to plan the collection of the generated wastewater from this room
according to calculated discharges. API losses from sieves and containers are
approximately x kg/cleaning campaign. For several APIs of the tablet department the
maximum daily discharge limit is x kg. By minimizing environmental risks of APIs, API
residues should be vacuumed before washing or wastewater collection should be included to
the Dishwasher 9 room. By planning cleaning actions in the Dishwasher 9 room, wastewater
collection should be included in the pre-rinsing area for containers and vessels. If the
wastewater will be collected from that drain, leftovers from the granulation and coating
solutions can be disposed of in the same area. This also lowers risk of sewers blockage, if
the leftovers are collected to the separate tank. Total API discharges from the weighing tools
are approximately x g/y from inhalation APIs. All the annual API discharges are below the
daily maximum API discharge limits, which means that wastewater collection of weighing
tools is not required.
63

Inventory system
After calculating total losses of API for all departments, data is required to be in the form
which is easy to utilize in other manufacturing plants. In this study, separate excel files have
been done for each department. In the tablet department Granulator 1, Wet granulator 1,
Granulator 2, Wet granulator 2 and Granulator 3 have their own Excel data sheets. Table 14
shows how the lost API is calculated. All data is collected from SAP software. By calculating
“Total API lost to wastewater in mass manufacture process (kg)” value, it is required to
calculate first API losses in the granulator and after the granulator unit processes according
to the mass flows. When annual API losses for the tablet department are calculated, it is
required to understand frequency of cleaning campaigns which defines type of the cleaning
and the used cleaning program which defines amount of the generated wastewater and its
collection. After calculations, discrete wastewater sampling is required for all granulators that
it is possible to define the split factors for wastewater collection. After that PEC values can
be calculated based on the estimation of daily discharges. With PEC and the PNEC values,
RQ can be defined for all APIs. The used excel form is easily utilized also in other
manufacturing plants, but raw material data of product is required to search manually from
PI-sheets of SAP application.

For the inhalation department, mass manufacture and filling lines have their own data
sheets. Table 15 shows the principle for mass calculation is quite similar for manufacturing
and filling lines, differences are that mass manufacture line includes masses of raw materials
and filling lines include produced mass as a residue instead of raw material masses. In the
inhalation mass calculations, humidity of the manufactured mass is not included because
liquid is not used in the manufacturing process.
In the injection department, the principle of lost API calculations follows the same forms that
calculations in the inhalation mass manufacture process. At the beginning, the masses of the
raw materials are calculated for total inflow value, and after the manufacturing process,
accumulation is calculated by subtracted mass of the outflow from inflow value. Humidity of
the product does not need to be taken into consideration, because the whole product is in
the liquid form.
Table 15. Required data from SAP PI-sheets to calculate the mass of lost APIs of the
inhalation department.

After calculating the total losses, the results are presented in one table. According to the
Table 1 results from Appendix 2, further risk assessment for the APIs in tablet and injection
department is possible to calculate based on the data layout of the figure 33. RQ values for
inhalation APIs are not needed, because almost all APIs are collected. When the maximum
daily loss of APIs is defined, the PNEC and PEC values are required to find for each API.
The PNEC and PEC values are defined for acute and chronic cases by writing estimated
maximum daily discharge to the figure 33 Excel. According to the RQ values, maximum daily
API discharge can be calculated. Figure 33 shows a possible tool where the name of the API
is selected from the drop-down menu and the tool calculates the RQ values for different
objects according to the API discharges in the manufactured process. With this tool, it is
easy to see if there is environmental risk from the API discharges.

Conclusions and implications
The amount and sources of the lost APIs
In the tablet department, the highest API losses are located in the mass-manufacturing
process. If the wastewater collection split factor from the API4 sampling results is used in the
discharge calculations, API losses from Granulator 1 and Wet granulator 1 are
approximately x kg/campaign, where approximately x kg is discharged. API losses for the
Granulator 2 and Wet granulator 2 are a x kg/cleaning campaign, where only x kg is
discharged. For the Granulator 3, x kg of APIs is lost during one campaign, from which x kg
is discharged. With that collection factor, it seems that rinsing of granulators is sufficient. API
discharges from the containers and sieves are approximately x kg/cleaning campaign and
APIs from that part of the process should be minimized by vacuuming API residues or
collecting generated wastewater.
Because the API discharges are released pulse-like to the environment in accordance with
production campaigns, the risk quotient value uses estimated daily discharges of APIs in the
PEC calculations. Risk assessment was done for tablet APIs, based on the estimated daily
discharges and the default or studied PNEC values. RQ values showed that API9, API12
and API15 might have a low risk to the environment in acute and chronic areas. However,
the real environmental risk of API9 and API15 is smaller by the fact that these calculations
do not take into account biodegradation during the wastewater treatment process. API19
might have medium environmental risk in acute area. Because the RQ calculations of some
APIs use the default PNEC value, there are some uncertainties in the calculations.
Searching for the PNEC values is difficult, because the PNEC values from computer
modelling have no experimental data and several studies are also providing different PNEC
values. In addition, the default PNEC value is not suitable for all APIs because it can not be
used for lipophilic substances, antibiotics or hormones. Risk quotients for default values
provide important information about the most problematic APIs, but the ecotoxicity and
PNEC values require more studies before the risk values are fully reliable.
For the Granulator 3, sampling results showed that the original cleaning program discharges
x g of API4 to the intermediate well. That is approximately x% of the maximum loss of API4
in one cleaning campaign. After the changes of the cleaning program, the amount of the
discharged API was x g, which is x% of the maximum loss of API4 in one cleaning
campaign. After changing the cleaning program, it was assumed that the API4 discharges
67

would decrease. Because the waiting time between the endpoint of the cleaning program
and sampling was x hours shorter, the result of discharged API4 was unexpectedly higher
despite the extra wastewater collection. Even though the discharge result was expected, it
was proved that the sample can be taken after x hours of the endpoint of the cleaning
program in the future. According to the RQ values, API4 maximum daily discharge limit is x
kg. Currently for these losses of API4, x% of the API4 is allowed to discharge. So, based on
that, this sampling method should be repeated for the original cleaning program with x hours
waiting time for ensuring that the API discharge is still in the limits. Because this sampling
method was done only for the Granulator 3, the same sampling procedure should be done
for the most difficult-to-wash APIs, for example API19, for Granulator 1 and Granulator 2 by
ensuring the wastewater collection split. Based on the mass calculations, sampling results
and RQ values, it can be deduced that the original wastewater collection of the CIP cleaning
processes of API4 mass is sufficient for these API losses. After further sampling it can be
even considered, if it is possible to optimize the wastewater collection system. Optimization
is important from the three point of views: pharmacovigilance, environmental and economy.
The amount of the collected rinsing water should minimize the cost of the wastewater
treatment and the environmental impacts without compromising the cleaning results.
In the inhalation department, it can be assumed by visual observation that almost all the API
losses are collected to the separate wastewater tank. So, there is negligible risk to the
environment from the API discharges of the production and filling lines. If total API losses
without wastewater collection is compared with maximum daily discharge limits, it can be
seen that the wastewater collection for inhalation department is important and a significant
factor in minimizing environmental risks. In the current situation for the cleaning of inhalation
production and filling lines is sufficient and no changes are needed. According to the API
losses in the weighing washing area, API39 has the highest annual discharges, x g. By
comparing annual discharge to the maximum daily API discharge limit, the annual discharge
of inhalation APIs is smaller. Based on that, inhalation API discharges have a negligible risk
to the environment and separate wastewater collection for weighing tools is not required.
In the injection department all the lost APIs are led to the intermediate well. Because APIs
are dissolved to the injection products, losses of the API are annually rather small. The most
problematic APIs are those whose concentration in the product exceeds x%. According to
the risk quotient, the discharges of API22, API31 and API35 might have a risk to the
environment. However, the risk quotient is calculated with default PNEC values, which may
not be suitable for calculating the RQ value of those APIs. At least a few APIs are lipophilic
and the LogPow is above 3. Therefore, the ecotoxicity and the PNEC values for those APIs
68

should be studied and new RQ values calculated for API22, API31 and API35. Before the
calculation of new RQ values, pre-rinsing water from the cleaning processes of products with
API22, API31 and API35 can be manually collected. Also, the environmental risk from
methylene blue should be taken into account in the environmental risk assessment. When
more accurate RQ values are available, it can be considered if some long-term changes for
the wastewater collection are needed.

Sampling
In this study, the discrete sampling method was used. With discrete samples it is easy to
compare API levels before and after the cleaning process by taking samples from the
intermediate well where process wastewater streams are led. By analyzing simple samples,
the amount of API discharge is easy to calculate from the change of the concentration. With
this method it is possible to study the split factor between collected and non-collected
wastewater, which can be included in the estimated daily discharge calculations. But this
sampling method also has its disadvantages. Because the schedule of the production is very
hectic, timing of the sampling lives all the time. The problem is that production is three-shift
work and usually people who are taking samples from the intermediate well are working only
during the day. If the time between the end point of the cleaning process and sampling of the
after cleaning should be constant, it is too difficult to obtain a sampling procedure every time
in the same way. It is also a challenge to schedule sampling, because wastewater is led
through the long pipelines and production wastewater pumping station to the intermediate
well. It is difficult to know when the wastewater is in the intermediate well, because the flow
meter is not available and there are several other cleaning actions running at the same time
in the manufacturing plant. Even though the timing of the sampling is challenging, this study
proves that x hours is a sufficient time to obtain wastewater to the intermediate well.
The optimal situation could be that the online probe is measuring data from the wastewater
and based on the data, the probe sends an automatic message for valves by controlling
wastewater collection, but that is far away from the current off-line method situation. By
obtaining better data from the quality of wastewater, the sample should be taken from the
wastewater of each granulators. Sampling can be done for the most difficult-to-wash APIs.
By this way, it is possible to define split factors of wastewater collection for all granulators
and find API discharge sources if some rinsing phase of the cleaning program is not
sufficient. After the risk assessment of all APIs, quality of wastewater requires monitoring by
ensuring the function of the wastewater system. For long-term monitoring of wastewater,
69

composite sampling from the intermediate well is a better option because then multiple
cleaning processes may be included in the sampling instead of one cleaning process. It will
better describe the wastewater quality for the manufacturing plant.

Wastewater management and suggestions for the future
The next step is to find reliable PNEC values for tablet and injection APIs in the production.
After having those values, a more accurate RQ value is possible to calculate for all APIs.
When RQ values are calculated for the APIs of the tablet department, discrete samples from
the intermediate well should be taken for the most difficult-to-wash APIs with x hours waiting
time. Then the study based daily discharge limits are possible to calculate for APIs with the
wastewater collection split factor of granulators. After these phases, it can be ensured that
the collection of wastewater is at a sufficient level in the cleaning of granulators. In the
injection department, the need of the wastewater collection can be solved when RQ values
are calculated with new PNEC values. If environmental risks are observed, then the
collection of pre-rinsing phases should be included in the cleaning processes.
After the study of the API discharge limits, the quality of the generated wastewater is known.
If the company is interested in the at-site pretreatment process of the API wastewaters, the
cleaning techniques require a lot of studying because APIs can decompose during the
process into even the most harmful compounds. The reaction routes of all APIs in the
wastewater is important to understand. After studying the reaction routes of APIs, it is
inevitable that all wastewater treatment technologies are not suitable for all APIs, for
example UV treatment for quetiapine is not sufficient. It is an optimal situation that the
company could treat concentrated API wastewater at-source and reduce CO2 emissions, but
that project requires great desire for investment from the company. However, it might
become more economically viable to treat a sufficiently large amount of wastewater atsource treatment than transporting wastewater to the third-party company for treatment.
Even though the pharmaceutical industry is seen as a polluter of the environment, it is good
to remember that only 2% of European API discharges comes from the pharmaceutical
manufacturing processes. The potential point sources are good to be highly regulated but if
the protection of the environment is the most important thing, maybe it could be better to
think how to deal with the rest of 98% API discharges.

Appendix
Appendix 1. Calculations of the API discharges from the coating
process.
After the coating process of the Product 1 tablet, a sample was taken from the pre-rinsing
water in the coating drum. x liters of pre-rinsing water was left inside the equipment and it
was mixed. After mixing, x L sample was taken and analyzed in the external laboratory.
Concentration of API7 was x mg/L, which means that x L pre-rinsing water includes y mg of
API7. One tablet includes x mg of API7.
According to the sample results, API discharges are corresponding to the concentration of xy tablets. Based on the results, there is no need to collect wastewater from the coating
process.
