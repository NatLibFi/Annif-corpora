Lignin is one of the major components in lignocellulosic biomass and the most abundant
aromatic building block in nature. Technical lignins extracted from either pulping or
biorefining processes provide a variety of complex and polydisperse phenolic polymers,
harbouring great potential as a value-added product from the bio-based industry. Lignin
has for long been associated with being a challenging material to work with due to its
heterogeneous structure. This heterogeneity and wide distribution of molar mass restrict
the high value-added applications. However, the valorisation of lignin has come a long
way due to the incentive to produce more sustainable options in the hope of a more
circular bio-economy. As a result, several strategies have been developed that produce
well-defined lignin with narrow ĐM through fractionation. In this thesis, enzymatic
hydrolysis lignin was fractionated using different methods, and the fractions were
characterised to understand how different fractionation methods can tailor properties of
lignin.

Introduction

1 Introduction
A global increase in population has resulted in limited resources on the planet. Society’s
dependence on non-renewable petroleum-based products for fuel and chemicals increases
energy costs and environmental concerns. To move away from this state, sustainable
technologies that support the resource-efficient utilisation of renewable resources should
be developed. An example is converting renewable biomass into clean fuels and high
value-added chemicals to supplement or gradually replace the petroleum-based industry
(Oh, Pang, & Chua, 2010; Steen et al., 2010). The pulp and papermaking industry and
carbohydrate-based biorefineries produce vast amounts of lignin and lignin-rich wastes,
which challenges the economic feasibility of those biomass fractionation processes. The
technologies for converting carbohydrates to value-added products, such as pulp, textile
fibres, monomeric sugar precursors, and bioethanol (biofuel), are well-established.
However, the methodologies for lignin valorisation are significantly less developed, and
technical lignins are almost always burnt for energy. Developing a sustainable biorefinery
process relies on the optimal use of all three major lignocellulose components: cellulose,
hemicellulose, and lignin. Although challenging, developing reliable, affordable and
economically viable applications for valorisation of biomass by utilising lignin can be a
starting point for creating a future circular bioeconomy (Baumberger, 2002; Sherwood,
2020).
Lignin is nature’s most abundant aromatic building block, making it a cheap alternative
to petroleum-based aromatic compounds. Lately, much attention has been paid to the
functional groups in lignin with coveted complexity for value‐added applications.
However, the heterogeneous structure of lignin makes utilisation of lignin a great obstacle
to overcome, which results in the lignin not being used to its full potential. Instead, the
lignin is most commonly burned as a low-grade fuel while simultaneously polluting the
environment. A solution to this bottleneck would be to utilise lignin as a partial
replacement for fossil-based resources by recognising the advantages of lignin, such as
accessibility and affordability. These properties can make up for the deficiencies in
product performance due to the obstacles mentioned above. The lignin must undergo a
value-added fractionation process, creating a more homogeneous and stable product.
Several studies have shown that fractionating the technical lignin makes it possible to

1

Introduction
control and, therefore, to tailor the lignin properties, such as molar mass and solubility,
creating a more homogenous product suitable for future valorisation (Jiang et al., 2020;
Pang et al., 2020; Sadeghifar & Ragauskas, 2020; J. Xu et al., 2020).
The goal of this master’s thesis was to fractionate and purify technical lignin, resulting in
relatively homogeneous lignin fractions. This is a requirement to be able to reveal the
lignin structure-property correlation for further modification. Furthermore, this thesis
determines the effects of different fractionation methods on the properties of the lignin
fractions. Fractions with optimal properties would then be further utilised in value-added
applications. The lignin was fractionated by two methods to achieve this goal, and the
lignin fractions were characterised using a comprehensive structural analysis. A flow
chart of the thesis work can be observed in
Figure 1.
The goals of the thesis were the following:
✓ To select suitable fractionation methods
✓ To achieve proper purification of lignin
✓ To determine the composition in each lignin fraction
✓ To compare molar mass of each lignin fraction
✓ To quantify the hydroxyl groups in each lignin fraction
✓ To establish the thermal properties of each lignin fraction
✓ To determine the most suitable lignin for further modification or compatibilisation

2.1 Lignocellulosic biomass
Lignocellulosic biomass is the main fraction in most plant-based materials, such as wood,
perennial energy crop, cereal straws and bagasse (Wyman, 1994). It consists mainly of
cellulose (40%−60%), hemicelluloses (20%−40%), and lignin (10%−25%). Their ratio
varies depending on the origin of the plant (Liew et al., 2018). Together, the components
form a matrix that creates the cell wall in plants, as shown in Figure 2. Additionally,
lignocellulosic biomass contains small amounts of pectins, extractives, and inorganic
components (Brandt, Gräsvik, Hallett, & Welton, 2013). The abundance of
lignocellulosic biomass makes this the most economical and highly renewable natural
resource in the world (Qian, 2014).

Theory

2.1.1 Components in lignocellulosic biomass
Lignin
The purpose of lignin is to stiffen and fortify secondary cell walls, which are especially
important in forming cell walls found in wood and bark (Argyropoulos & Menachem,
1998). The lignin works as a naturally occurring composite material, filling the matrix’s
space and acting as a glue, keeping the plant cells together, as illustrated in Figure 2.
Furthermore, lignin also plays an essential role in protecting biomass against invasion by
pathogens and insects and hindering enzymatic hydrolysis (Schoenherr, Ebrahimi, &
Czermak, 2018; Zhao, Zhang, & Liu, 2012).
Lignin comprises mainly three phenylpropanoid units: the monolignols of coniferyl
alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, and p-coumaryl alcohol, observed in Figure 3 (Z. Sun, Fridrich,
de Santi, Elangovan, & Barta, 2018). These monolignols can be seen as precursors and
are usually mentioned as phenylpropane or C9 units linked through a hydroxyl group to
the C4, and substitutions with one or two methoxyl groups are present at the C3 and C5.
If a ring from the monolignol is unmethoxylated or has one or two methoxyl groups, they
create p-hydroxyphenyl (H-unit), guaiacyl (G-unit) and syringyl (S-unit), respectively
(Abdelaziz et al., 2016). The linkages between the monolignols consist of carbon-carbon
and ether bonds, resulting in a complex three-dimensional network with a highly irregular
structure. Approximately >50% of the linkages between the monolignols are β-O-4 ether
bonds. Due to this aromatic and highly branched structure, the lignin resists degradation.
The composition of lignin varies vastly between different biomass species. The lignin
content of hardwoods is usually in the range of 17–25%, consisting of G and S units,
while softwood has a bit higher content, between 25% and 35%, and consists of G units
and a small portion of H units (Lourenço & Pereira, 2017). Non-woods generally have a
lower lignin content, within the 9–20% range, and are characterised by a high proportion
of H units. The properties of lignocellulosic materials demand an understanding of lignin
composition and macromolecular structure and work as a base for vital issues in
producing lignin-based products within biomass biorefineries.

Cellulose
Cellulose gives the cell wall protection and stability. It is a linear homopolysaccharide
consisting of β-1,4-glycosidic bond linked units of D-anhydroglucopyranose sugar units,
seen in Figure 4 (Zhou & Wu, 2012). The hydroxyl groups in the glucose chain are polar,
which means that hydrogen bonds are easily formed between the hydrogen and oxygen
molecules, both between different cellulose polymers and within the polymer itself,
resulting in crystalline and amorphous regions within the microfibrils (Börjesson &
Westman, 2015). The crystallinity provides the polymer with mechanical properties.
However, high crystallinity and an abundance of hydrogen bonds in the cellulose fibres
make cellulose insoluble in water and most conventional organic solvents. The solubility
of cellulose is a significant factor when considering alternatives for cellulose isolation
and lignin purification. The low cost of producing cellulose and its coveted properties,
such as biodegradability and low toxicity, makes it an excellent polymer for paper and
packaging, the food industry, cosmetic industry, pharmaceuticals, and textiles (Wertz,
Deleu, Coppée, & Richel, 2018).

Theory

cellulose microfibrils (Zhou & Wu, 2012).
Hemicelluloses
Hemicelluloses are different saccharide polymers that interact through hydrogen bonds
with cellulose and have covalent bonds to lignin, strengthening the cell wall. Unlike
cellulose, hemicelluloses contain multiple types of sugar units with various glycosidic
bonds in one molecule. Thus, hemicelluloses appear in amorphous form. Furthermore,
the backbone of hemicelluloses is either linked by β-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds or sometimes
by β-(1,3)-glycosidic bonds. These are usually branched homo- or heteropolysaccharides
composed of pentoses (e.g., xylose, rhamnose, and arabinose), hexoses (e.g., glucose,
mannose, and galactose), and uronic acids (e.g., 4-O-methyl glucuronic, glucuronic, and
galacturonic acids) (Tanczos, Schwarzinger, Schmidt, & Balla, 2003).
Almost all the monosaccharides in hemicellulose have the D configuration, except
arabinose, which occurs in L-configuration. The composition of hemicellulose in
lignocellulosic biomass varies depending on the source (Su, 2012). Hemicelluloses from
softwood are usually found in the 25–35% range and are rich in glucomannans (e.g.,
galacatoglucomannans, seen in Figure 5a). The hemicellulose content usually varies
between

and

25%

in

hardwood

xylans

(e.g.,

arabinoglucoronxylan, seen in Figure 5b). Hemicellulose acts as a condensation polymer,
removing a water molecule from every linkage when forming glycosidic bonds (Bajpai,
2018a). The hemicelluloses can be hydrolysed to oligomeric and monomeric saccharides
to be used as value-added chemicals and promote the commercial production of

(Jing, Guo, Xia, Liu, & Wang, 2019).

Galacatoglucomannans and hardwood, b) Arabinoglucoronxylans (Su, 2012).
Extractives
Extractives can be defined as the non-structural components in biomass, such as terpenes,
fats, waxes, phenolic compounds and lignans, which are illustrated in Figure 6 (Zimbardi
& Viola, 2001). Depending on the solubility, the extractives can be divided into lipophilic
and hydrophilic extractives (Willför, Smeds, & Holmbom, 2006). Common lipophilic
extractives are waxes, fats, fatty acids, terpenoids, and steryl esters. These can cause
disturbance during analysis of biomass. Therefore, removing the lipophilic extractives is
usually required to avoid disturbance, which can be done using nonpolar organic solvents
(e.g., hexane, methyl tert-butyl ether, or toluene). Examples of hydrophilic extractives are
stilbenes, lignans, ﬂavonoids, tannins and simple phenolics. These are extracted by more
polar solvents, e.g., methanol, acetone or ethanol (Vek, Oven, & Poljanšek, 2016).
Extractives have several different roles in biomass, giving the plant colour and smell, and
can also function as an additional nutrient, plant hormones and regulate the plant cell’s
moisture content. Furthermore, extractives can also bind together with metals to act as
catalysts for biosynthesis. Nevertheless, the primary role of extractives is to work as a
8

Theory
chemical and physical defence against bacteria, fungi, and insects (Thygesen et al., 2020;
Nisula, 2018.). Removing the non-structural material from biomass before analysis is
critical in characterising biomass due to the interference extractives usually cause during
the analytical steps. Removing the extractive is usually done in a two-step extraction
process (e.g., organic solvent and water) to remove lipophilic and hydrophilic
components. Components such as inorganic material, non-structural sugars, and
nitrogenous material are usually removed with water extraction, while other components
such as waxes, oil, or other minor components require organic solvents to be extracted
from the biomass (Sluiter et al., 2008).

Figure 6 Chemical structure of common extractives (Zimbardi & Viola, 2001).

2.2 Lignin from pulp industry
Lignin from the pulp industry, also known as technical lignin, can be isolated through
various chemical, biochemical, and physical treatments depending on the desired end
product. Depending on the methods, the chemical structure and purity can be altered.
Common technical lignin includes lignosulfonates, kraft lignin, organosolv lignin, and
soda lignin (C. Xu & Ferdosian, 2017). Due to the varying nature of biomass, there is no
universal pretreatment for all technical lignins. Most treatments still have their drawbacks
and advantages.

9

Theory

The pulp and paper industry is among the largest industries in the world (Bajpai, 2014).
The pulping process mostly separates the cellulose and hemicelluloses from lignin in
biomass. It also removes extractives, which results in a pure fibre pulp that can be used
to produce paper and board products. Two different kinds of pulping processes can be
used: mechanical and chemical pulping (Nuortila-Jokinen, Mänttfäri, & Nyström, 2003)
Mechanical pulping is a pulping process that separates fibres without the addition of
chemicals (Young, Kundrot, & Tillman, 2003). This results in a high yield pulp. However,
lignin is retained in the pulp, which results in fibres with high lignin content and
consequently lowers the fibres’ strength and brightness. Thus, it is not possible to obtain
technical lignin from mechanical pulping
Chemical pulping is the most common process today due to the high purity cellulose
fibres it produces. This chemical pulping can be divided into two sections: sulphur-based
processes and sulphur-free processes, illustrated in Figure 7. The most common method
of chemical pulping is kraft pulping, which is a type of sulphur-based process. Other
common chemical pulping methods include sulphite- and soda pulping. These chemical
processes have for a long time seen lignin as a waste product. Due to its complexity, it
has been challenging to use the lignin for other purposes than energy recovery. This
creates additional pollution in the environment. This could be avoided by utilising the
technical lignin, creating a debottleneck process (Sadeghifar & Ragauskas, 2020), and
utilising a lignin first approach (Renders, van den Bosch, Koelewijn, Schutyser, & Sels,
2017).
2.2.1 Sulphur-containing pulping
Sulphur-containing lignins are derived from either kraft pulping or sulphite pulping. Kraft
pulping is the most common pulping process. The extracted lignin from kraft process
accounts for about 85% of the total lignin production in the world. The kraft process uses
a mixture of chemicals, including sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulphide
(Na2S), to process the biomass at high temperature (145–170 °C), which dissolves 90–
95% of the lignin into black liquor, which can be acidified to recover the lignins. This
pulping process fractionates the lignin macromolecules, which decreases molar mass of
lignin. Little progress has been made in the industrialisation of kraft lignin, which results
10

Theory
in the black liquor usually being utilised as a low-value energy source in the form of
combustion for heat recovery (Chen, 2015). However, several industry parties have
gathered in the late 1990s to develop the Lignoboost technology (Tomani, 2010). This
created a giant leap in industrialisation by exploiting the energy surplus of a modern kraft
pulp mill by extracting lignin from the black liquor, creating new opportunities for
economic development. This process differs from traditional lignin precipitation by redispersing and acidifying the filter cake after filtration instead of washing lignin
immediately, as in conventional approaches. This helps the lignin from clogging the filter
cake in the filter medium, creating the primary source of alkali lignin in the market after
water-soluble lignosulfonate.
The sulphite pulping process uses an aqueous sulphur dioxide (SO2) and an aqueous
solution of base, usually calcium, sodium, magnesium, or ammonium (Laurichesse &
Avérous, 2014). This separates the lignin from the cellulose in a non-precipitated form
producing lignosulfonates. The brown liquor of the sulphite pulping can later be
precipitated out though alkali conditions to recover the lignins.
2.2.2 Sulphur-free pulping
Sulphur-free lignins are of particular interest due to the structure mainly remaining the
same throughout the extraction process. Sulphur-free lignins can be divided into two main
categories, organosolv lignin, which originates from solvent pulping and soda lignin,
which comes from soda pulping (Shrotri, Kobayashi, & Fukuoka, 2017).
Solvent pulping employs organic solvents, such as acetic acid, formic acid, ethanol, and
organic peroxide to dissolve the lignin. This method can easily separate the lignin from
the hemicellulose stream and cellulose fraction, resulting in high-quality lignin. However,
there are some drawbacks, such as the cost of chemicals and energy consumption
compared to other leading pretreatment processes. On the other hand, depending on the
raw material, soda pulping extracts lignin by hydrolytic cleavage of the native lignin,
which can result in relatively unmodified lignin chemically, with high silicate and
nitrogen contents compared to the other lignin types (Laurichesse & Avérous, 2014).

2.3 Lignin from biorefineries
Biorefining can be defined as a sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of
marketable products and energy. Biorefineries cover an extensive range of combined
technologies to achieve sustainable biomass transformation and utilisation as valuable
building blocks for biofuels, energy, platform chemicals, and various materials (Morais
& Bogel-Lukasik, 2013).
A biorefinery that uses lignocellulosic biomass can be integrated into a two-step process.
With suitable technology, the first step focuses on fractionating the biomass into the three
main components, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The second step refines the
individual fractions, creating value-added products that can substitute products derived
from the fossil industry (Rajesh Banu et al., 2021). The Cellunolix® process of St1 will
be presented as an example of a biorefinery utilising timber-industrial waste, such as
sawdust and recycled wood as a raw material to obtain value-added chemicals.

12

Theory
Cellunolix® biorefinery concept
St1 Biofuels Oy is focusing on ethanol production technologies that utilize sustainable
sources, such as food industry residues, household and grocery biowaste, which are under
the concept of Etanolix® and Bionolix® biorefinery production. The Cellunolix® ethanol
biorefinery plant built in Kajaani in 2017 was the first of its kind to demonstrate the
possibility of producing advanced ethanol from substantial potential sourcelignocellulosic sawdust (Borrega, Pihlajaniemi, Liitiä, Wikström, & Tamminen, 2021). In
addition to ethanol, lignin, vinasse, turpentine, furfural, carbon dioxide and biogas are
produced as by-products of the process. The refining process starts by thermochemically
pre-treating the raw material before hydrolysing the raw material with enzymes (Figure
8). The enzymatic hydrolysis process starts by transferring enzymes from the bulk
aqueous phase to the surface of the cellulose. Afterwards, the enzymes are absorbed, and
the enzyme-substrate complexes are formed. Then, the cellulose is hydrolysed with
cellulase, which works as a catalyst by hydrolysing the β-1,4 glycosidic linkages in
cellulose. Lastly, the hydrolysis products from the surface of the cellulosic particles are
transferred to the bulk aqueous phase. The cellodextrins and cellobiose are then
hydrolysed into glucose in the aqueous phase, resulting in sugars that can be fermented
and later distilled and dehydrated to produce ethanol (Fan, 2014; Wertz et al., 2018).
The hydrolysis step generates a significant amount of lignin, which could be further
integrated into polymers. However, the Cellunolix® lignin is still considered to have a
condensed structure with low reactivity (Borrega et al., 2021). Utilisation of the lignin
demands fractionation and purifications steps due to its heterogeneous complex structure,
which is unsuitable for advanced polymer applications. This hurdle has resulted in the
lignin commonly being used in electricity and heat production.

Theory

2.4 Lignin fractionation for narrow molar mass distribution
Technical lignin derived from the traditional pulping and biorefinery process (biofuel
production) provides a class of heterogeneous phenolic polymers. The high degree of
variability and diversity of technical lignins creates problems when engineering lignin
into a value-added material. In addition, the different interunit bonds of the lignin produce
an unpredictable sequence, which results in an undefined primary structure. Combining
this unpredictable structure with broad molar mass dispersity makes the reactivity of the
lignin challenging to predict and tune (Gigli & Crestini, 2020).
Studies have concluded that molar mass and distribution impact physicochemical
properties, obtaining lignin fractions with different characteristics, promoting industrial
utilisation (Gigli & Crestini, 2020; Huang, He, Narron, Wang, & Yong, 2017; R. Sun,
Tomkinson, & Bolton, 1999). Preparation of lignin with narrower molar mass dispersity
and lower structural complexity through lignin fractionation method is one of the primary
solution to valorise lignin. Gradual acid precipitation and solvent fractionation are two
standard methods for lignin fractionation, which are illustrated in Figure 9.

2.4.1 Lignin fractionation using acids
Sequential lignin fractionation by pH-controlled precipitation from high to low pH is one
of the primary developed method. The lignin forms colloidal structures at high pH due to
the negative charge on the surface of the colloid. When acid comes into contact with the
base, hydronium ions (H+) neutralise the charge on the colloid surface, and the lignin is
precipitated and separated using centrifugation or filtration (Pang, Wang, Sun, Sui, & Si,
2021). Several studies have suggested that high molar mass lignin with small apparent
pKa usually precipitates first due to lower solubility and weaker acid groups. However,
lignin with low molar mass has a higher content of negative groups (e.g. phenolic OH and
COOH), creating a higher negative charge, which results in higher colloidal stability. This
makes gradient pH fractionation an excellent way to achieve more homogeneous lignin
fractions (Norgren, Edlund, Wågberg, Lindström, & Annergren, 2001; G. Wang & Chen,
2013).
2.4.2 Lignin fractionation using organic solvents
Solvent fractionation utilises the different solubility of lignin fragments in organic
solvents to yield more homogenous fractions (Jääskeläinen, Liitiä, Mikkelson, &
14

Theory
Tamminen, 2017). Several studies have tested different kinds of organic solvent for this
use, such as ethanol, acetone, methanol and hexane (Ajao, Jeaidi, Benali, Abdelaziz, &
Hulteberg, 2019; Meng et al., 2019). The organic solvents can be combined with other
solvents with different polarities, which may change the solubility of the lignin fractions.
The organic solvent can also be combined with a moderate amount of water, which has
been shown as a highly efficient plasticiser to enhance the solubility of lignin,
consequently increasing the yield of lignin fractions (Liang, Liu, Fu, & Chang, 2016; Y.Y. Wang, Li, Wyman, Cai, & Ragauskas, 2018). This creates an environmentally friendly
and cost-effective alternative to using several organic solvents. In addition, lignin
dissolution can be adjusted by changing the solvent to water ratio depending on the
solvent’s capability (Boeriu et al., 2014; S. N. Sun, Li, Yuan, Xu, & Sun, 2012).

2.5 Driving force towards the valorisation of lignin
Lignin is often classified as a low-value product and is an underutilised feedstock in the
growing biofuels industry, even though lignin is a primary component of lignocellulosic
biomass. The highly irregular structure of lignin results in heterogeneous chemical
features, such as molar mass characteristics, functional group distributions, constituent
aromatic units, and interunit bonding patterns. Furthermore, technical lignin usually
contains a high amount of impurities, such as extractives, ash, and carbohydrates. These
factors usually result in the lignin being dumped or burned as a low-grade fuel, which
should be seen as a waste of resources and sustains severe environmental pollution
(Gadhave, Mahanwar, & Gadekar, 2018).
15

Theory

The industrial valorisation of technical lignin requires a high purity to be able to produce
high-value platform chemicals. Developing an effective method for obtaining low
heterogeneity lignin fractions and taking into account the lignins’ impurities,
composition, molar mass distribution, hydroxyl content, and content of lignin-relevant
aromatic units is essential for the realisation of sustainable resource management. By
utilising innovative fractionation techniques, lignin can be used to produce a range of
value-added chemicals, processed into many products, such as binders, dispersants,
phenols, plastic composites, resins, surfactants, and vanillin (Bajpai, 2018b). Several
studies have concluded that fractionating lignin using methods such as gradient pH
fractionation, solvent fractionation by single/mixture solvent, and a sequential cascade of
multiple solvents could result in high purity and polysaccharide-free lignin fractions,
which can be utilised as high-value products (Balakshin et al., 2021; Cao et al., 2018; Liu
et al., 2021). Recycling lignin to replace petroleum-based resources can alleviate the
situation of over-reliance on petrochemicals and reduce environmental pollution. This
awareness has also created an incentive to produce methods to isolate purer lignin from
the paper- and pulp industry, for example, the lignin-first process (Renders et al., 2017).
2.5.1 Lignin-based thermoplastic materials
Thermoplastics are elastomers that combine the properties of thermo-plasticity and
rubber-like behaviour (Holden, 1987). When processed and melted, the thermoplastics
keep the same chemical structure and immediately develop rubber-like properties on
cooling. The process is rapid and reversible from a processible melt to a solid rubber-like
object that differs from the slower process of conventional rubbers, which must be
vulcanised to give valuable properties. The advantage of thermoplastic is processing
flexibility, which provides them with significant commercial applications. However,
thermoplastics are lacking in some end-use properties, such as solvent resistance or upper
service temperature. This usually means that thermoplastic elastomers are applied in areas
where these factors are less critical, such as footwear, wire insulations, or adhesives.
Lignin-containing polymers can be synthesised by blending rigid lignin molecules with
flexible polymers, such as polyethene, ethylene-vinyl acetate or polypropylene. The
molecules are either subsequently crosslinked or copolymerised, which results in
copolymers of different morphologies. However, the highly polydisperse lignin fractions
16

Theory
are a potential hindrance to synthesising recyclable high-performance lignin copolymers.
The high crosslink density and the lignin segments’ low molar mass result in thermosets
and brittle materials, i.e., barely recyclable (Tomonori Saito et al., 2012). Due to the
amorphous properties of lignin, lignin molecules typically has a Tg in the range of 90 to
170 ℃ depending on the plant origin and extraction method. Chao Wang’s et al. paper,
“Lignin-Based Thermoplastic Materials”, summarises some reported glass transition
temperature (Tg) versus molar mass of kraft lignin. However, it needs to be noted that
variations in plant species, extraction and separation approaches, moisture and ash
contents, and measurement methods may exist among the literature values (C. Wang,
Kelley, & Venditti, 2016).

3.1 Materials and methods
3.1.1 Enzymatic hydrolysis lignin (EHL)
The lignin used in this study was enzymatic hydrolysis lignin (EHL), which was provided
by St1 (Kajaani, Finland). The lignin was obtained as a by-product during bio-ethanol
production from pine (Pinus sylvesteris) and spruce (Picea abies) sawdust with enzyme
hydrolysis and yeast fermentation, known as the St1 Cellunolix® process. The EHL was
received in a wet cake form, which was freeze-dried before fractionation and
characterisation.
3.1.2 Extracted EHL (EEHL)
The extraction was done by washing the EHL with an acid solution (pH 2.5, adjusted by
2.5 M hydrochloric acid (HCl)) and filtered on a 0.2 µm nylon membrane filter to remove
any potential salts and water-soluble sugars from the EHL. The washing process was
repeated three times before drying the EHL in a freeze drier. Afterwards, methyl tertbutyl ether (MTBE) was used to remove the extractives by mixing the EHL with MTBE
under constant shaking using an analogue shaker for at least 72 h. The MTBE phase was
then concentrated by using rotary evaporator to recycle the MTBE solution.
Subsequently, the MTBE concentrate was dried under N2 flow and further dried under
vacuum desiccator at 40 °C for 12 h to obtain the extracted EHL (EEHL).
3.1.3 Fractionation of EHL and EEHL
The EHL and EEHL were fractionated by gradient acid precipitation or EtOH/H2O
solvent extraction, resulting in ten fractions from each starting material. The fractions and
abbreviations can be seen in Table 1.

Gradient pH fractionation
The first step of the fractionation process started with a screening to determine which pH
levels should be chosen for the gradient fractionation. This screening consisted of mixing
the freeze-dried EHL/EEHL in a sodium hydroxyde (NaOH) solution (pH 10, adjusted
by 6 M NaOH(aq))Then, 6 M NaOH(aq) was added until a pH of 12.5 was achieved. The
suspension was heated to 90 °C while stirring for 2 h to ensure that lignin was fully soluble
in the NaOH solution. Afterwards, the mixture was cooled down to ambient temperature
before centrifuging and filtrating on a 0.2 µm nylon membrane filter to excludeinsoluble
fractions, e.g., carbohydrates that were not entirely removed by the enzymatic hydrolysis
process. Then the filtrate composed of the alkali-soluble mixturewas divided into seven
parts. The pH of the solutionwas separately adjusted to pH 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2.5 with 2
M HCl(aq) to precipitate lignin from the alkaline solution as seen in Figure 10. The
screening experiment concluded that most of the lignin was precipitated at pH 5 and the
lowest pH of 2.5. Therefore, the gradient fractionation was continued using these two
pHs.

19

Experimental

Figure 10 The filtrates collected from pH screening, consisting of pH 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3,
and 2.5 filtrates.
The gradient pH fractionation started by dissolving EHL/EEHL in NaOH solution at pH
12.5 (90 °C, 2 h). Then the pH of the alkali-soluble solution was directly adjusted to pH
5 with 2 M HCl(aq) to precipitate part of the lignin. The mixture was then centrifuged at
10 000 rpm for 10 min, and then the sediments were mixed with acid water (pH ≤2.5), recentrifuged, and finally filtrated on a 0.25 µm nylon membrane filter and washed again
with acidic water. The filter cake was then freeze-dried.
The pH of the filtrate was further adjusted from pH 5 to 2.5 to precipitate and isolate the
remaining lignin using the same procedure as above. The procedure is illustrated in Figure
11.

2.5 soluble fraction.

Experimental
Solvent fractionation
The second lignin fractionation process involved using technical ethanol (EtOH) to
extract lignin sequentially. Firstly, freeze-dried EHL/EEHL was mixed with 96% EtOH
at a constant room temperature for 4 h (Figure 12). The soluble and insoluble fractions
were separated by filtration. The soluble fraction was recovered by evaporating the EtOH
under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator. The insoluble fraction was further
dissolved in 75% EtOH in water, and the separation process was repeated. All fractions
were further dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 12 h.

Figure 12 Process scheme of sequential EtOH fractionation, resulting in two different
soluble fractions from 96% and 75% ETOH, respectively.
To be able to study the impact of sequential EtOH fractionation on the properties of lignin
fractions, a direct solvent fractionation using 75% EtOH in water was used according to
the same procedure as above. The direct fractionation procedure is illustrated in Figure
13.

3.2 Characterisation
3.2.1 Molar mass determination
Determination of weight-average (Mw) and number-average (Mn) molar mass, as well as
molar mass dispersity (ĐM) of the EHL and EEHL fractions, were performed on a gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) system equipped with a differential refractive index
(RI) concentration detector and a multiangle light scattering detector in the infrared range
(MALS(IR)). The instrumental setup and the measurement with GPC/RI/MALS(IR) were
carried out following the conditions described in detail by Wang et al. (2021). The freezedried sample was dissolved in DMSO/LiBr (0.05 M) to 10 mg/mL, filtered on a 0.2 μm
Nylon syringe filter and analysed with a series of connected columns (Jordi Gel Glucose
Mixed-bed guard column (10 × 50 mm, I.D. × L) and a Jordi Gel GBR Mixed-bed column
(10 × 250 mm, I.D. × L)) using DMSO/LiBr (0.05 M) as eluent. The GPC system was
operated under the following conditions: eluent flow rate of 0.5 mL/min; 100 µL injection
volume, 60 °C column temperature. The dn/dc value of 0.15 mL/g was used for molar
mass moments calculation. Data evaluations were done using ASTRA software, version
7.3.2.
3.2.2 Lignin content
The lignin content was determined using the standardised Klason method and an
ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry analysis to quantify the acid-insoluble
(AIL) and the acid-soluble (ASL) lignin, respectively (Maekawa, Ichizawa, & Koshijima,
2006; Schwanninger & Hinterstoisser, 2002). Briefly, the AIL was determined by
hydrolysing approximately 100 mg samples with 1.5 mL 72% sulphuric acid (H2SO4) in
an ice bath. The lignin samples were stirred frequently for 2 h to ensure that the samples
were fully impregnated. Afterwards, distilled water was added to dilute the mixture into
a 3% concentration of H2SO4, and the mixture was then boiled for 4 h. The samples were
then left at ambient temperature for at least 8 h. The samples were filtrated on a glass
filter (grade 3 porosity) and washed with hot water before drying in an oven at 105 °C for
12 h. The acid-insoluble lignin was then calculated by the difference between initial
sample weight and weight of residue, described in Equation 1 (Fagerstedt et al., 2015;
Innventia; Korpinen et al., 2014).

The ASL remaining in the filtrate from the Klason analysis was later used to determine

determined by UV-vis, which is measuring the absorbance difference between the Klason
filtrate and 3 wt% H2SO4 reference solution at 205 nm. The ASL content was calculated
using Equation 2.

3.2.3 Carbohydrate content
The carbohydrate content of the lignin fractions was determined by performing both acid
methanolysis and acid hydrolysis, followed by gas chromatography (GC) according to
the procedure described by Sundberg et al. (1996). The acid methanolysis approach
determines the sugar units in hemicelluloses and pectins as well as in monosaccharides
and oligosaccharides, while acid hydrolysis gives the total sugar content.
Acid methanolysis
To determine the chemical composition as well as the content of non-cellulosic
carbohydrates in EHL and EEHL fractions, acid methanolysis and GC analysis were
performed following the procedures described by Sundberg et al. (1996). Briefly,
approximately 10 mg (± 0.1 mg) of sample was methanolysed into monosaccharides using
2 mL 2 M HCl in anhydrous methanol solution at 105 °C for 4 h. A carbohydrate
23

Experimental
calibration solution containing an equal amount of neutral monosaccharide (e.g., xylose,
galactose, mannose, rhamnose, arabinose and glucose) and uronic acid (e.g., galacturonic
acid and glucuronic acid) was also subjected to the same methanolysis process. The
mixture was afterwards cooled down to ambient temperature and neutralised with
pyridine. An internal standard of 1 mL of 0.1 mg/mL resorcinol was added before the
samples were dried by N2 flow in a 50 °C water bath. Lastly, the samples were
trimethylsilylated by adding 150 μL pyridine, 150 μL hexamethyldisilazane, and 70 μL
trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS). The trimethysilylated-derivatives of sugars and uronic
acids were analysed with a GC-FID (PerkinElmer AutoSystemXL) equipped with an
Agilent HP-1 (0.20 mm × 25 m, I.D. × L, 0.11 µm film thickness) and HP-5 (0.20 mm ×
25 m, I.D. × L, 0.11 µm film thickness) capillary columns. The non-cellulosic
carbohydrates were quantified against resorcinol using the correction factor (Equation 3,
using arabinose as an example) determined by each monosaccharides and uronic acids
from the calibration sample.

Equation 3

𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑙

Lastly, an anhydrosugar coefficient for pentoses (0.88), hexoses (0.90), and uronic acid
(0.91) were used to calculate the carbohydrate content as polysaccharides. All analyses
were done at least as duplicates.
Acid hydrolysis
The carbohydrate content from cellulose was determined by subjecting approximately 10
mg of freeze-dried sample to acid hydrolysis. This procedure consisted of adding 0.2 mL
of 72% H2SO4 into each sample and placing the samples in a vacuum oven, letting the
pressure go to zero and then back to normal to ensure that the H2SO4 penetrated the
samples, then adding 0.5 mL distilled water in each test tube, waiting 4 h and adding an
additional 6 mL of distilled water in each test tube and leaving the samples at ambient
temperature for at least 8 h. This procedure used glass balls in the vials and was kept
under constant shaking using an analogue shaker during the addition of water and the
waiting period. Afterwards, the samples went through an autoclavation for 90 min at 125
℃ and were then cooled down to ambient temperature before adding barium carbonate to
neutralise the samples. An internal standard of 1 mL of 1 mg/mL sorbitol was added
24

Experimental
before the samples were centrifuged. Then 0.5 mL of supernatant was mixed with
approximately 8 mL of pure acetone and dried before performing the trimethylsilylation
and GC-FID analysis with the same procedure as described in the methanolysis section.
In order to estimate the correctional factor, the same procedures were performed in a
separate vial with glucose.

3.2.4 Extractive content analysis
The extractive content in the lignin samples was determined by GC-FID after extraction
with MTBE at acidic conditions (Örså & Holmbom, 1994). Approximately 20 mg was
used for the EHL samples and 40 mg for the EEHL samples. Each sample was mixed
with 4 mL of HCl solution at pH 2.5. To ensure that all the samples had pH under 3, one
drop of bromocresol green as pH indicator was added, and if needed, 0.05 M of H2SO4
was added to the samples for pH adjustment. Then, 2 mL of MTBE solution containing
internal standards of heneicosanoic acid, betulinol, cholesteryl heptadecanate and 1,3dipalmitoyl-2-oleoylglycerol with the concentration of 0.02 mg/mL was added. The
samples were shaken intensely for 1 minute before centrifugation to isolate the upper
phase containing the extractives. The extraction process was repeated two more times
using pure MTBE solvent. Afterwards, the MTBE phase was evaporated using N2. The
samples were then silylated using 80 µL bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, 20 µL
pyridine and 20 µL TMCS. The samples were kept in an oven at 70 °C for 45 minutes to
ensure proper silylation. Afterwards, the samples were analysed using GC-MS (Agilent
G1530A, Agilent MSD 5973) to identify the extractives and GC-FID (PerkinElmer,
Clarus 500) on an Agilent J&W HP-1/SIMDIST capillary column (0.53 mm × 6 m, I.D.
× L, 0.15 µm film thickness) to quantify the extractives.

3.2.1 Ash content analysis
The ash content was determined gravimetrically according to Tappi T211 (1993) (Sluiter
et al., 2008). Approximately 0.25 g of EHL/EEHL was placed in a muffle furnace set to
525 ± 25 °C and left in the oven until constant weight. The ash weight percentage was
then calculated using Equation 4.

3.2.1 Hydroxyl groups quantification
The hydroxyl groups in the samples were analysed by quantitative 31P NMR (298 K) with
a Bruker AVANCE III 500 MHz spectrometer operating at 500.13 MHz for 1H, 125.77
MHz for 13C, and 202.46 MHz for 31P, using the zgig pulse program.
The samples were prepared by drying the samples in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 12 h to
ensure that the dry weight was accurately known for the quantification. Afterwards, 20
mg of the samples were phosphorylated with 100 μL of 2-chloro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl1,3,2-dioxaphospholane in (TMDP) 550 μL of anhydrous pyridine and deuterated
chloroform (1.6:1, v/v) solution containing an internal standard of 12 µmol of endo-Nhydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboximide and 1.04 g/L of Cr(acac)3 as a relaxation
reagent. The acquisition parameters had an interpulse delay of 10 s, an acquisition time
of 2.0 s, and a number of scans of 64. A signal of Cl-TMDP-water phosphorylation
product at 132.2 ppm was used to calibrate the 31P NMR spectra and the standard peak
for calculating the integral area of the internal at 152.4-151.2 ppm was set to 0.6 mmol/g.
3.2.2 Thermal properties
Glass transition temperature (Tg)
The Tg of each sample was determined using a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
with a TA instrument DSC250. The temperature profile was calibrated based on indium
standards. Each lignin fraction was dried at 40 °C under reduced pressure for 12 h before
being precisely weighted into a Tzero pan (T 140829, Switzerland) and sealed with a
Tzero lid (T 140826, Switzerland). The temperature protocol started from 40 °C and was
ramped up 10 °C/min to 120 °C and kept isothermally for 2 minutes. Then the temperature
was taken from 0 to 200 °C with a rate of 20 °C/min under N2 atmosphere (50 mL/min).
This created a ramp curve, where the midpoint of the inflexion in the second heating trace
is reported as Tg.

4.1 Extraction results
The EHL contained a noticeable amount of non-lignin substances that originated from the
wood itself, as well as some residual inorganic salts, making it unsuitable for most
industrial uses. To promote understanding of the lignin structure-application performance
correlation, it is vital to identify the components in commercial, technical lignin.
The extractive analysis results of the EHL and EEHL are shown in Figure 14. The
unfractionated EHL contained 1.2 wt% of extractives, which decreased to 0.4 wt% in the
EEHL. The most significant change occurred in the content of free fatty acids, the
phenolic related extractives and resins acids. On the other hand, the smallest difference
was observed in the triterpenoids. The lower content of extractive compounds in EEHL
indicated that the extractives removal using MTBE was successful, which resulted in a
purified lignin fraction.

4.2 Fraction analysis results
4.2.1 Yield of EHL and EEHL fractions
A compatible yield from the fractionation process is vital for industries to utilise the
process step. The yields of EHL and the EEHL fractions are based on the initial EHL and
EEHL, respectively.
EHL fractions
The yields of the EHL fractions are illustrated in Figure 15. The pH fractions of the EHL
started with 30% from the alkali-soluble fraction due to 70% of the lignin being alkaliinsoluble. Then 17% of the lignin was obtained from the pH 5 precipitation, and the
remaining lignin precipitated out at pH 2.5 had a yield of 11%. Due to the small yield of
the pH 2.5 fraction, there was not enough material to go through all characterisations. As
expected, the yield of lignin depended on the precipitation pH, which resulted in a gradual
decrease while the lignin was precipitated out in each step.
The yield of the sequential EtOH fractions decreased along with the sequence, starting
with a yield of 13% from the 96% EtOH soluble fraction. The remaining residue was
redissolved in 75% EtOH, which resulted in a yield of 5%. In comparison, the direct 75%
EtOH soluble fractionation had a slightly higher yield of 20%, resulting from a less
homogenous fractionation.

Figure 15 EHL fraction yields.

28

Results and discussion
EEHL fractions
The yield of EEHL fractions is illustrated in Figure 16. The MTBE extraction resulted in
85% of the EHL being recovered due to the removal of extractives and other soluble
compounds. This resulted in higher yields in the EEHL fractions. About 40% of the EEHL
was recovered in the alkali solution. From this, 23% was obtained in the pH 5 fraction
were obtained. The EEHL EtOH fractions had generally higher yields than the EHL
fractions, except the sequential 96% EtOH fraction, which had slightly lower yield at 9%.
This could be due to the 96% EtOH not being as efficient in dissolving the more
homogenous EEHL than the EHL. The direct 75% EtOH soluble fraction had the highest
soluble yield at 30%.

Figure 16 EEHL fraction yields.
4.2.2 Molar mass analysis
Valorisation of technical lignin demands lignin with a homogeneous feature in terms of
molar mass dispersity (ĐM). Previous research has concluded that the bulk nature of
technical lignins is too heterogeneous in structure, too impure, and too complex for
utilisation in advanced applications as a polymer (Pang et al., 2021). Therefore, the
EHL/EEHL fractions should display a change in weight-average molar mass (Mw),
number-average number-average molar mass and ĐM (Mw/Mn), and along with a
decrease in impurities, such as extractives, ash, and carbohydrates and other
heterogeneous chemical features in terms of functional group distributions, aromatic
units, and interunit bonding. Determining the molar mass characteristics of the lignin is
still a significant challenge due to the absence of reliable calibration standards. However,
29

Results and discussion
GPC/RI/MALS(IR) has been proven to be a valuable tool to monitor the absolute molar
masses of lignin (L. Wang et al., 2021).
EHL fractions
Due to the dissociation of phenol and carboxyl groups of lignin, EHL/EEHL will be
dissolved in alkaline conditions. When HCl comes into contact with the alkali solution,
H+ neutralises the charge on the colloid surface, and the lignin is precipitated (Pang et al.,
2021; G. Wang & Chen, 2013).
The Mw, Mn and ĐM of the EHL fractions are presented in Table 2. The Mw, Mn and ĐM
were higher in alkali-soluble fraction than in the EHL. The alkali-soluble fraction had a
significant higher Mw (30 000 g/mol) than the (12 000 g/mol) EHL, while the pH 5
fractions Mw (32 000 g/mol) was slightly higher than the alkali soluble but lower than the
pH 2.5, which had the highest Mw of all fractions (54 000 g/mol). The Mn of the EHL (9
900 g/mol) also got higher throughout the gradient pH fractionation. The alkali-soluble
fraction (29 000 g/mol) had a bit lower value compared to the pH 5 fraction (31 000
g/mol) and the pH 2.5 fraction again showed the highest value (54 000 g/mol). The ĐM
of the EHL started at 1.2 and decreased to 1 in all pH fractions.
It was found that the EtOH 75% soluble and 96% soluble fractions had a much lower Mw
(7 700 g/mol and 4 800 g/mol, respectively) than the initial EHL (12 000 g/mol) and pH
fractions (Table 2). The ĐM of the 75% EtOH soluble (ĐM = 1.4) and the 96% EtOH
fraction (ĐM = 1.3) was slightly higher than the EHL (ĐM = 1.2). It has been demonstrated
that fractionation with EtOH results in a fraction with more carbohydrates and extractives,
thus lowering the molar mass (Ni & Hu, 1995). The EtOH-insoluble fractions were not
fully soluble in the DMSO/LiBr eluent and thus were not adequately analysed.
The EtOH sequential fractionation used water to dilute the solvent while simultaneously
increasing the solubility of EtOH to lignin. The 75% EtOH soluble fraction had a bit

EtOH soluble fraction had significantly higher Mw and Mn values (14 000 and 11 000
g/mol, respectively), while the ĐM (1.3) was slightly lower compared to the direct 75%

The alkali-soluble, pH 5 and pH 2.5 fractions showed two distinct peaks in the GPC
chromatograms (Figure 17), the first peak appeared at 15-25 min and the latter appeared
at around 25-35 min. However, due to aggregation, the light scatter (LS) signal created a
significant exclusion peak where the refractive index (RI) signal representing the
concentration was not observed in the first peak, making the peak at around 30 min more
reliable for molar mass calculation. All RI values were similar for all fractions, while the
LS values mostly varied.

The GPC/RI/MALS curves of the EtOH soluble fractions have a singlet profile (Figure
18), which is the most significant difference compared with the GPC/RI/MALS profile
of pH fractions. The LS values of the soluble 75% EtOH soluble fraction was similar to
the EHL. However, compared to the EHL, the RI value was higher in the EtOH soluble
fraction. The sequential EtOH fractionation slightly changed the LS compared to the
unfractionated EHL. However, the RI profiles were more similar than the direct 75%
EtOH fractionation.

Results and discussion
remove impurities. All EEHL fractions showed similar molar mass changes as the EHL
fractions did during fractionation.
The alkali-soluble fraction had a higher Mw (24 000 g/mol compared to 11 000 g/mol)
and a slightly lower ĐM (1.1) than the unfractionated EEHL (ĐM = 1.2). The pH 5 fraction
had the same Mw as the alkali soluble fraction, however, the ĐM (1.3) was slightly higher
in the pH 5. The pH 2.5 had the highest Mw of all EEHL fractions (31 000 g/mol) and its
ĐM (1.1) decreased compared to pH 5 fraction.
The EtOH fractions again showed a lower molar mass than the pH fractions, similar to
the EHL fractions. Similar to the EHL fractions, the EEHL 75% EtOH soluble fraction
had a slightly higher Mw (6 300 g/mol) and Mn (4 800 g/mol) than the 96% EtOH fraction
(4 400 and 3 500 g/mol, respectively). Likewise, the sequential 96% to 75% EtOH
fraction also had higher Mw and Mn values (9 600 and 8 000 g/mol, respectively) than
75% EtOH soluble fraction. This could also be explained by the lower values of Mw and
Mn of the lignin being separated during the 96% EtOH sequential fractionation step.

4.2.3 Compositional analysis
EHL fractions
The compositional analysis of the EHL fractions is shown in Figure 21. The EHL had a
relatively high lignin content (77 wt%). However, it displayed quite heterogeneous
properties with a noticeable amount of carbohydrates (14 wt%) as well as extractives (1.2
wt%) and inorganic compounds (0.2 wt%). The lignin content (92 wt%) and extractive
content (3.2 wt%) were noticeably higher in the alkali-soluble fraction, while the
carbohydrate content was significantly lower than that of the initial EHL. This indicates
that most of the carbohydrates were removed during the alkali fractionation step, whereas
the extractives were also dissolved in the alkaline solution.
As is a result of the acid precipitation process, which partially removes the dissolved
inorganic materials and polysaccharides during the alkali-extraction (R. Sun et al., 1999),
both pH 5 and pH 2.5 fractions had high lignin contents, at 97 and 96 wt%, respectively.
Furthermore, it concurs with the decrease of carbohydrate along with the fractionation
steps.
The ash content of the fractions was all at 0.2 wt%. However, the pH 5 fraction has a
higher ash content than the other fractions (0.7 wt%). This could be a result of an
insufficient acid wash during the pH fractionation process. Many high-value products
derived from lignin require ash content below 0.1 wt%, putting most of these fractions
above the limit. (Roberts, Khan, & Spontak, 1996).
The EtOH fractions had relatively lower lignin content compared to the pH fractions. The
EtOH insoluble fraction showed high content in carbohydrates, demonstrating its ability
to purify lignin by EtOH/H2O fractionation. The 96% to 75% sequential EtOH fraction
showed among the highest lignin content, 96.3 wt%. In comparison, the direct 75% EtOH
soluble fraction and the 96% EtOH soluble fraction had a similar lignin content, around
84 wt%, with a low carbohydrate content. The sequential method seems to be more
effective in removing most of the carbohydrates compared to the direct EtOH
fractionation. All EtOH fractions had relatively low and similar ash content, except the
96% EtOH soluble fraction, which had 0.8 wt%. This indicates that the lack of additional
water could disadvantage the salt removal from the unfractionated EHL. The EtOH37

Results and discussion
soluble fractions had much higher extractives content compared to their insoluble
counterparts due to the high solubility of extractives in EtOH.

EEHL fractions
The compositional analysis of the EEHL fractions is shown in Figure 22. As concluded
in the purification results, the EEHL became more homogeneous, with higher lignin
content (85 wt%), lower carbohydrate (13 wt%), and extractives content (0.4 wt%),
compared to the EHL. The pH 5 fraction showed a lower lignin content (81.7 wt%) than
the EEHL. The pH 2.5 fraction, on the other hand, displayed the highest lignin content
(91.9 wt%). The alkali extraction to EEHL resulted in a similar change as the EHL, with
an apparent increase in lignin content (89.8 wt%) and decreased in carbohydrate content.
The EOH fractions had a generally higher lignin content, except for the 75% EtOH
insoluble fraction, which slightly decreased (74 wt%) compared to the EHL EtOH-soluble
fractions. The EtOH-soluble fractions from EEHL had significant lower extractives
content than those from EHL, most likely due to the sufficient purification of lignin by
MTBE extraction.

38

Results and discussion
The extractive content of the EEHL fractions showed a decrease compared to the EHL
fraction. Furthermore, throughout the fractionation processes, the extractive content
showed similar changes as the EHL fractions. The most significant change could be seen
in the pH 5 fraction, which decreased from 5.1 wt% to 0.28 wt%. The ash content in the
EEHL fractions was also generally lower than the EHL fractions, making the lignin
fraction from MTBE extracted lignin better for high-value products compared to the EHL
fractions.

4.2.4 Hydroxyl groups quantification
EHL fractions
The quantitative 31P NMR analysis result of the lignin samples is shown in Table 4. None
of the insoluble fractions could go through the 31P NMR analyses due to the problem with
dissolving in the NMR solvent (CDCl3/pyridine). Similarly, it should be pointed out that
the hydroxyl quantification of initial EHL and EEHL are not reliable due to the solubility
problem in the NMR solvent, resulting in presumably lower values. The total of hydroxyl
groups stayed quite similar at around 4 mmol/g throughout the gradual acid precipitation
fractionation. However, there was a composition change, as the content of aliphatic-OH
groups decreased, while the carboxyl acids increased throughout the fractionation. On the
39

other hand, the EtOH fractionation increased the total hydroxyl content in the EtOHsoluble fraction, compared to the pH fractions from EEHL. (Pavia et al., 2007).

P NMR analysis results of EEHL fractions are shown in Table 5. Like the EHL

fractions, the hydroxyl groups stayed around 4 mmol/g throughout the gradual acid

The gradual acid precipitation fractionation resulted a similar amount of aliphatic-OH and
carboxylic acid groups as pH fractions from EHL. In contrast, the total phenolic-OH was
slightly higher in pH fractions from EEHL. In EtOH soluble fractions from EEHL, the
highest content of phenolic-OH was found in the 96% EtOH fraction (3.7 mmol/g), while
the lowest appeared in the sequential 96% to 75% EtOH soluble fraction at 3.2 mmol/g.
The higher content of aliphatic-OH groups in EtOH-soluble fractions from EHL,
compared with the counterparts from EEHL could be ascribed to the interference of
extractives and carbohydrates, which is consistent with the compositional analysis.
Furthermore, the EtOH-soluble fractions from EEHL containing higher amount of
phenolic-OH than the counterparts from EHL.

4.2.5 Thermal properties
The Tg of the EHL fractions was analysed to determine the thermal properties. A low Tg
is beneficial for blending lignin with thermal plastics. The Tg results of the EHL fraction
are presented in Figure 23. The unfractionated EHL/EEHL and pH fractions showed no
signs of Tg in the temperature range of 0 to 200 °C, while the alkali-soluble fraction had
a high Tg value, such as 132 °C and 152°C for the alkali-soluble fractions from EHL and
EEHL, respectively. This may be due to the use of HCl in the acid precipitation process,
which affects the thermal properties of the obtained lignin fractions. All EtOH-soluble
fractions showed Tg, and the lowest value of 57 °C appeared in the 96% EtOH-soluble
fraction from EHL. However, the Tg value of the 96% EtOH-soluble fraction from EEHL
was 89 °C. Similarly, the Tg value of EEHL fractions were generally higher than that of
EHL counterparts. A reason for this could be that the EtOH may extract out the extractives
remained in the EHL, lowering the Tg of lignin fractions. It is common for Tg to decrease
along with molar mass (Laurichesse & Avérous, 2014). As expected, the Tg values of
EtOH-soluble fractions from EHL and EEHL decreased with the decreasing molar mass
of lignin.

Conclusions

5 Conclusions
The EHL obtained from the Cellunolix® biorefinery process requires purification
and fractionation to obtain more homogeneous lignin with a higher reactivity
suitable for further modification. An MTBE-extraction and two different types of
fractionation methods were tested to obtain lignin fractions with defined
properties. The EHL and EEHL, as well as all the fractions obtained, were
characterised, and compared by determining the composition, molar mass,
hydroxyl groups distributions and thermal properties. The goal was to determine
which fractionation method produced the most suitable fraction that could be
further used for modification or compatibilisation.
The gradient pH fractionation started in alkali condition. In addition to lignin, it
also dissolved inorganic impurities and part of polysaccharides in the solutions,
and water-soluble compounds were removed during the acid precipitation process.
This made the gradient fractionation an overall more efficient method to purify
the lignin, which was evidenced by the pH 5 fraction from EHL having the highest
lignin content at 96 wt%. Furthermore, the pH fractions also had higher yields
(20–40%) compared to the EtOH fractions (10–20%). However, only the alkalisoluble fraction from the pH fractions displayed a Tg during the thermal analysis.
On the other hand, the EtOH fractionation was not successful in purifying the
fractions, and the EtOH-soluble fractions contained more impurities than the pH
fractions due to the direct fraction of EHL, which did not properly remove
extractives, carbohydrates and salts from the EHL. If the EtOH fractions were
used in further studies to study the property-application relationship properly, it
would most likely require a purification process in combination with acid water
washing and MTBE extraction to remove some of the carbohydrates and
extractives. Due to the presence of extractives, the EtOH-soluble fractions from
EHL generally obtained lower molar mass values higher ĐM, and lower Tg values.
As expected, fractionating the EEHL with EtOH resulted in a further increase in
Tg. The 96% to 75% sequential fractionation purified the EHL most efficiently

43

Conclusions
compared to the other EtOH fractions. However, compared to the other EtOHsoluble fractions, the 96% to 75% sequential fractionation had a very low yield.
The fraction with the overall lowest Mw and ĐM was the EEHL 96% EtOH soluble
fraction.
The MTBE extraction was successful in removing the extractives and purifying
the initial EHL. Both fractionation methods showed promising results for potential
value-added products. All of the fractions had different pros and cons. However,
based on yield, molar mass, hydroxyl groups and Tg analysis, the alkali-soluble,
pH 5, and 75% EtOH soluble fractions from EHL/EEHL are suitable candidates
for further modification or compatibilisation with polymers.

Summary in Swedish

6 Summary in Swedish - Svensk sammanfattning
Fraktionering och karakterisering av enzymatiskt hydrolyslignin
Lignin är naturens mest förekommande aromatiska polymer, vilket gör det till ett billigt
alternativ till petroleumbaserade aromatiska föreningar. Tack vare ligninets funktionella
grupper och eftertraktade komplexitet bidrar ligninet med utmärkt potential för
mervärdestillämpningar. Dock finns det flera hinder för att isolera ett homogent lignin
med hög reaktivitet på grund av ligninets heterogena struktur, vilket resulterar i att
ligninet inte används till sin fulla potential och i stället förbränns som energi inom
pappersindustrin och bioraffinaderier. Flera studier har visat att fraktionering av ligninet
gör det möjligt att kontrollera och därför skräddarsy ligninets egenskaper, såsom
molmassa och löslighet, vilket skapar en mer homogen produkt lämplig för framtida
mervärdestillämpningar (Jiang et al., 2020; Pang et al., 2020; Sadeghifar & Ragauskas,
2020; Xu et al., 2020). Ligninets fördelar, såsom tillgänglighet och låga priser, ger ligninet
mycket potential som råvara för delvis ersättning av fossilbaserade resurser.
Ligninets egenskap- och applikationsrelation är kritiskt att definiera för att kunna utnyttja
ligninet för ytterligare modifikation eller kompatibilisering, vilket kräver ett homogent
lignin med hög reaktivitet. Målet med detta diplomarbete var att fraktionera och rena
tekniskt lignin, för att isolera relativt homogena ligninfraktioner. Dessutom avgör denna

Enzymatiskt hydrolyslignin (EHL) tillhandahölls av St1. Ligninet är en biprodukt vid
produktion av bioetanol från barrträd med enzymhydrolys och jästjäsning, känd som St1
Cellunolix®-processen. Detta EHL kräver rening och fraktionering för att erhålla mer
homogent lignin som är lämplig för ytterligare modifiering. En MTBE-extraktion och två
olika typer av fraktioneringsmetoder testades för att erhålla en renad EHL. Både EHL och
EEHL, såväl som alla erhållna fraktioner, karakteriserades och jämfördes genom att
bestämma sammansättning, molmassa, hydroxylgrupper och termiska egenskaper. Målet

45

Summary in Swedish
var att bestämma vilken fraktioneringsmetod som gav den mest lämpliga fraktionen som
kunde användas vidare för modifiering eller kompatibilisering.
Cellunolix® EHL var i en våtkaksform, som frystorkades före fraktionering och
karakterisering. Extraktion av ligninet utfördes genom att tvätta EHL med en syralösning
av 2,5 M saltsyra (HCl) och filtreras på ett 25 µm nylonfilter för att avlägsna eventuella
salter från EHL. Tvättprocessen upprepades tre gånger före torkning av EHL i en frystork.
Efteråt användes metyl-tert-butyleter (MTBE) för att avlägsna extraktivämnen genom att
blanda EHL med MTBE under konstant skakning med en analog skakapparat i minst 72
timmar. MTBE-fasen filtrerades senare ut och torkades i en vakuumugn vid 40 °C i 12
timmar för att erhålla den extraherade EHL (EEHL). Både EHL och EEHL fraktionerades
genom gradient-pH-fraktionering och lösningsmedelsfraktionering, vilket resulterade i
tio fraktioner från varje utgångsmaterial. Fraktionerna och förkortningarna kan ses i tabell
1.
Det första steget i pH fraktioneringsprocessen började med en gallring för att bestämma
vilka pH-nivåer som bör väljas för gradientfraktioneringen. Gallringen utföres genom att
blanda den frystorkade EHL/EEHL i en natriumhydroxidlösning (NaOH) med en
koncentration av 6 M. Ytterligare NaOH tillsattes tills ett pH av 12,5 uppnåddes.
Suspensionen upphettades till 90 °C under omrörning i 2 timmar för att säkerställa att
lignin var helt lösligt i NaOH-lösningen. Efteråt kyldes blandningen ned till
omgivningstemperatur innan den centrifugerades och filtrerades på ett 25 µm nylonfilter
för att utesluta fällningar, så som kolhydrater som inte helt avlägsnades genom den
enzymatiska hydrolysmetoden. Därefter delades alkalilösningen i sju delar och provernas
pH justerades till pH 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 och 2,5 med HCl (2 M) för att fälla ut lignin från
alkaliblandningen, se figur 11. Från denna gallring drogs slutsatsen att det mesta av
ligninet fälldes ut vid pH 5 och det lägsta mängden vid pH 2,5. Gradientfraktioneringen
fortsattes med användning av dessa två pH-värden.
Gradient pH-fraktioneringen startade genom att lösa EHL/EEHL i NaOH-lösning vid pH
12,5 (90 °C, 2 timmar). Därefter justerades provets pH direkt till pH 5 med HCl för att
fälla ut en del av ligninet från alkaliblandningen. Blandningen centrifugerades sedan vid
10 000 varv/min under 10 minuter, blandades med surt vatten (pH ≤2,5) och åter

46

Summary in Swedish
centrifugerades och filtrerades slutligen på ett 0,25 µm nylonfilter och tvättades igen med
surt vatten. Filterkakan frystorkades sedan. Filtratets pH justerades ytterligare från pH 5
till 2,5 för att fälla ut och isolera det återstående ligninet med användning av samma
procedur som ovan. Proceduren illustreras i figur 12.
Den andra ligninfraktioneringsprocessen utnyttjade teknisk etanol (EtOH) för att
extrahera lignin sekventiellt. Först blandades frystorkad EHL/EEHL med 96 % EtOH vid
konstant rumstemperatur i 4 timmar. De lösliga och olösliga fraktionerna separerades
genom filtrering. Den lösliga fraktionen utvanns genom att indunsta EtOH under
reducerat tryck i en rotationsindunstare. Den olösliga fraktionen löstes ytterligare i 75 %
EtOH i vatten, och separationsprocessen upprepades. Alla fraktioner torkades sedan i en
vakuumugn vid 40°C under 12 timmar.
För att kunna jämföra den sekventiella effekten av EtOH-fraktioneringen användes en
direkt lösningsmedelsfraktionering med 75 % EtOH i vatten enligt samma procedur som
ovan. Proceduren för direkt lösningsfraktionering illustreras i figur 14.
Gradient pH-fraktioneringen startade under alkaliska förhållanden, vilket löste de
oorganiska materialen och polysackariderna i lösningarna och avlägsnades under sura
utfällningsprocessen. Detta gjorde gradientfraktioneringen till en över lag mer effektiv
metod för att rena EHL. Detta resulterade i relativt homogena fraktioner, varav pH 5
fraktionen från EHL visade högsta ligninhalten vid 96 viktprocent. Dessutom hade pHfraktionerna också högre utbyten (20–40 %) jämfört med EtOH-fraktionerna (10–20 %).
Dock uppvisade endast den alkalilösliga fraktionen en glasomvandlingstemperatur (Tg)
under den termiska analysen.
Å andra sidan var EtOH-fraktioneringen inte framgångsrik i att rena fraktionen och
innehöll fler föroreningar än pH-fraktionerna på grund av den direkta fraktionen av EHL,
som inte korrekt avlägsnade kolhydrater eller salter från EHL. Om EtOH-fraktionerna
användes i ytterligare studier för att korrekt studera egenskaps-tillämpningsförhållandet,
skulle det med största sannolikhet kräva en extraktion med ett mer polärt lösningsmedel,
såsom MTBE-extraktion, för att avlägsna en del av extraktivämnena och kolhydraterna.
Emellertid erhöll EtOH-fraktioneringen från EHL lägre molmassa (Mw) och högre
molmassadispersitet (ĐM). Dessutom visade EtOH-fraktionen lägre Tg-värden än EHL.
47

Summary in Swedish
Vidare resulterade EtOH-fraktionering av EEHL ytterligare lägre Tg-värden. Därtill
förbrukade EtOH-fraktioneringen mindre energi och var lättare att använda och en
snabbare process. Av EtOH-fraktionerna renade 96 % till 75 % sekventiell fraktionen bäst
EHL. Dock hade denna fraktion väldigt lågt utbyte och högre Mw och ĐM jämfört med de
andra lösliga EtOH-fraktionerna. Fraktionen med den totala lägsta Mw och ĐM var den
EEHL 96% EtOH-lösliga fraktionen.
MTBE-extraktionen var framgångsrik för att minska mängden extraktivämnen och rena
EHL. De erhållna fraktionerna hade olika för- och nackdelar och det konstaterades att
båda fraktioneringsmetoderna tillsammans med MTBE-extraktionen visade lovande
resultat för vidare mervärdestillämpningar av EHL. Baserat på utbyte, molmassa,
hydroxylgrupper och Tg-analys var EEHL fraktioner som fraktionerats via pH 5
fraktionering, samt de lösliga fraktionerna från alkalilösningen och 75 % den direkta
EtOH lämpliga kandidater för ytterligare modifiering eller kompatibilisering med
polymerer.
