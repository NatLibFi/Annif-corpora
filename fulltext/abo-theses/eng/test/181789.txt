ABSTRACT
This thesis focuses on finding effective and environmentally friendly fire retardant
(FR) formulations for opaque exterior wood paints. The utilisation of green chemistry
and incorporation of mineral-based FRs were deemed to improve the sustainability of
wood paints and prolong the material’s life cycle in comparison to those utilising
conventional halogenated FR additives. Six additives were selected for further
evaluation based on the conducted literature research. These compounds were: 1)
epsomite, 2) bentonite, 3) precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC), 4) wollastonite, 5)
dolomite and 6) expandable graphite (EG). The reported effective FR properties of the
compounds were the main criteria for their selection, besides the possibility of
simultaneously improving the physical and mechanical properties of the finished
coating product with these fillers. The FR efficacy was assessed with cone calorimeter
analysis.
Precipitated calcium carbonate, followed by dolomite were proven to be the most
effective additives based on their highest ability to reduce the heat release rate (HRR)
in this series of experiments. Hence, these fillers could be vital components in future
timber FR products. However, additional research work is still required to optimise
components and composition and refine the optimal opaque exterior FR paint.

1 INTRODUCTION
Timber is a renewable, sustainable and unique material for several different purposes,
among these as a building material. Wood is a highly accessible product in most of
northern Europe; in Finland, Sweden and Norway approximately 90% of single-family
houses are built with timber cladding.1 Compared to aluminium, brick, steel and
concrete, wood requires less process energy and emits less carbon dioxide.2 However,
sometimes the natural properties of the wood can limit its applications. In the building
industry, especially when building high-rise houses, flammability is one such
problematic inherent characteristic. An effective solution to this is to treat the timber
with fire retardants (FRs).
Climate change has led to an increase in environmental disasters, and wildfires are no
exception. Approximately 85 to 90% of wildfires are caused by humans, and higher
outdoor temperatures lead to more devastating fire spread. 3 FR-treated houses could
prevent a fire from starting or slow down the spread of forest fires. Additionally, by
using green chemistry in coatings, e.g. water born coatings instead of organic solvents,
and sustainable construction material, the impact the building industry has on the
global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions could be decreased significantly.
The constantly growing environmental awareness and concern has changed the FR
market over the years. Several previously frequently used hazardous halogenated FRs
(mostly brominated FRs) have been restricted or even forbidden within the European
Union and companies have voluntarily abandoned these chemicals. Some halogenated
compounds are toxic carcinogenic, persistent and bio-accumulative, to list some of
their problematic properties.4 Furthermore, halogen compounds have been found in
the arctic region, supporting the theory that at least some of these compounds are
spread over a long range via atmospheric transport and/or ocean currents.5 The
problematic aspects have increased the demand for more sustainable yet equally
effective FR alternatives. The possibility to treat wood with sustainable FRs has
opened new doors for larger wood constructions, such as high-rise houses, and growth
in this field has already been noted. 6

____________________________________________________________________
Active research over the past years has led to new and more efficient discoveries in
the sustainable FR sector. There are several categories of non-halogenated FR
compounds used today. The most promising components for wood protection are
inorganic metal hydrates and carbonates, intumescent, phosphorus-based, nitrogenbased and silicon-based compounds.7 Mineral and intumescent additives are two
examples of categories in high demand and will be investigated more in this thesis.
Minerals are often widely available, naturally occurring, inexpensive and therefore of
commercial interest.8 Intumescent additives are slightly more cumbersome to produce,
but many intumescent systems have been proven highly effective.9
Fire protection is not the only property needed and strived for in modern FR wood
coatings. Different mechanical and physical properties are also crucial and
environmental regulations must be met. Furthermore, the possibility to tint the wood
with translucent or opaque coatings is sought after on the market. This is a challenging
task since such a product needs to provide fire protection in addition to fulfilling all
the properties needed in regular opaque paint. FR additives can affect the coating’s
mechanical properties or lead to an unstable suspension. Additionally, the high
concentration of binder required in opaque paint is contributing to its flammability.
The aim of this master´s thesis is to develop different FR formulations for an opaque
paint for timber. The focus is effective fire protection, but other property requirements
in a final paint formulation will further be discussed briefly. The additives are first
analysed in a one-coat system, where each water-insoluble compound is 10% solid
content (SC) of the formula. The water-soluble additive is 38% SC and has the same
total SC as the first reference sample. After cone calorimeter analysis the most
potential FR additives were further tested as a one-coat system with a higher SC and
in a few two-coat systems in order to gain a better understanding of its potential.

2 WOOD AS A CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL
Before discussing FR alternatives for wood, it is important to understand the basics
and distinctions between different wood species and materials. Wood species are
different in many aspects, such as composition, moisture content, density, degradation
process and heating value.10 The aim of this chapter is to provide a deeper insight into
why and how FR wood is an excellent building material alternative for large
constructions even when compared to concrete and steel.

2.1 Composition of wood and timber products
Wood mainly consists of three polymeric materials: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.
Lignin works as a “glue” between the hemicellulose and cellulose units, while
cellulose consists of long chains of repeated glucose units that form the cell walls by
cross-linking with the hemicellulose. The cells are mostly vertically oriented and
elongated cells that differ in size and form depending on wood species. The
composition and structure give the wood its unique properties that are well suited for
many applications such as construction. The differences in composition and types of
wood cells affect the properties and some wood species can therefore be more
challenging to protect with FR coatings than others. 11
Wood can be divided into three axes: radial, tangential and longitudinal (Figure 2).
These axes have different mechanical properties and, hence, wood is considered to be
an orthotropic material. This is important to consider when building timber
constructions, especially larger buildings, and buildings where the bearing
construction is made out of timber. 12

Figure 2. The different timber axes.12

Besides the differences in the composition between wood species, different wood
products are also different and can behave differently during a fire. Wood products
refer to common timbers, processed sawn timber and more advanced engineer products,
such as cross-laminated timber (CLT), glued laminated timber, laminated veneer
lumber (LVL) and I-beams etc. (Figure 3).

13,14

Furthermore, wood composites have

also become more common throughout the years. It is important that each FR coating
is tested on the specific wood product that it is aimed to protect since the effectiveness
of different formulas and compositions might differ between timber surfaces. Some
wood species are more difficult to chemically impregnate and hence to fire protect. 15

2.2 Timber cladding versus load-bearing timber
When talking about timber it is important to differentiate between load-bearing timber
and timber cladding. Load-bearing timber is often compact and heavy and made from
CLT. CLT was invented in the early 1990s and has since become a very popular timber
product because of its superior mechanical properties.19 Compared to cladding it is
seldom exposed to the exterior environment and, hence, does not need the same kind
of environmental protection. Cladding is usually less compact and the main function
of timber is to keep weather and humidity out, in addition to improving the aesthetic
appearance of the building. This thesis work will focus more on cladding since FRs
are used mainly on exterior and interior timber claddings.
Structural and fire regulations limit the use of timber in larger load-bearing
constructions. Structural regulations are made since wood is a biomaterial and, hence,
exposed to microbial attack and infestations leading to biodeterioration of wood.12
However, there are several advantages when using load-bearing timber construction.
When timber is heated it starts to form an insulating char layer on the surface (at
approximately 300 °C) that protects the inner structure (Figure 4). The charring rate is
slow, 0.65 mm/min for solid timber and potentially lower for CLT (according to the
standard EN 1995-1-2), depending on the wood and adhesive composition. In other
words, the fire rate is relatively stable and can therefore be predicted. Heavy timber
framing, thus, has an inherent property to resist fire. Furthermore, wood construction
is relatively easy to repair after fire damage. 20,21
However, few materials can fully prevent fire spread and CLT and other timber
products are no exception. Therefore, more research is needed regarding fire protection
of wood and knowledge about the fire behaviour of the adhesives and other
components used during wood construction. 21

To build the load-bearing construction in larger building out of timber has been a
controversial topic for a long time. A common misconception is that CLT is more
receptive to fire damage compared to concrete and steel, but this is not necessarily the
case. For concrete, explosive spalling can occur already at 250 °C, depending on
concrete, and if the temperatures reach around 600 °C, the concrete building may
collapse.22 When steel is exposed to higher heat it starts to deform and melt. The
deformation can occur already before the stress relieving temperature at approximately
650 °C is reached, depending on the type of steel. Worth mentioning is that steel too
needs protective paintings, e.g. for corrosion and environmental protection. 23

2.3 Wood combustion
To successfully be able to design new and effective FR additives for wood products,
it is crucial to understand wood pyrolysis and combustion. The fire tetrahedron, an
elaborated model of the outdated fire triangle, describes the essential ingredients of
sustained fire: heat, oxygen, fuel and chain reactions (Figure 6). If any of these
components are removed or altered, for example with FRs, the combustion process
will be affected. In case an untreated wood sample is exposed to high enough heat, and
a spark, additionally to sufficient oxygen is present, the wood combustion will start
fuelled by the wood pyrolysis. Combustion can be divided into the following steps:
•

100–200 °C: water and non-flammable gases are released, such as CO2

•

180–350 °C: thermal degradation of hemicellulose

•

250–500 °C: thermal degradation of lignin

•

275–350 °C: thermal degradation of cellulose

•

> 450 °C: release of fuel gases:11,25

How rapidly the wood burns and how fast it ignites depends on the density and wood
species. The thermal conductivity and heat capacity are both dependent on the density
and the higher the density the longer the delay of ignition. Structural elements and
thickness do not affect the ignition but affect the mass-loss rate during combustion. A
higher mass-loss rate is noticed in species with a larger ratio of vessel elements. The
fire endurance time is affected by thickness, mass loss rate and density. 26

2.4 Regulations and classifications
2.4.1 Fire protection classification for buildings in Finland
Finland classifies construction material (floors excluded) based on reaction-to-fire
according to the harmonised European fire classification system, assumed that the
material meets the stated criteria. An untreated solid wood panel, for example usually
classifies as D-s2, d0, while an effective FR coating can improve the classification to
B-s1, d0. The first letter states the heat release amount and the ability for flames to
spread, the second term refers to the smoke amount, and the last term states the amount
of burning droplets or particles during the initial fire phase.

28

This classification

system is mainly based on the Single Burning Item (SBI) analysis method (standard:
EN 13823). However, cone calorimetry (standard: ISO 5660) can be used to estimated
SBI results, and other classification systems are further used, based on cone
calorimetry or other fire standards, depending on country and materials tested. The
classification system is often referred to as the Euroclass system. 29,30

classes can be reviewed in section “APPENDIX 1”. The abbreviations are described under
“ABBREVIATIONS AND DEFINITIONS”. 30

The fire standards utilised to determine a product´s FR properties vary depending on
the country, the standards used to determine Euroclasses are listed in Table 2. However,
a trend towards unified European standards will probably be seen in the future.

Buildings in Finland are divided into four different fire safety classes: P0, P1, P2 and
P3. P0 is a building that is designed based on estimated fire development and P3 is a
building with a low resistance to fire. Depending on the size and use of a building,
different measurements must be considered when building a larger house in timber.
Several factors affect the assigned fire safety classes, among these:31
-

Load-bearing capacity

-

Structural integrity

-

Insulation

-

Fire classification of the construction material used for the building

-

Fire classification of the floor

-

Automatic fire extinguishing, e.g. sprinklers

2.5 Waste treatment and sustainability
The waste treatment is a central part of a sustainable product’s life cycle. Handling
and treatment of waste are dependent on each country’s legislation. In Europe, wood
residue (wood from construction, renovation or demolition sites) can be divided into
three waste classes: A, B and C. Chemically untreated wood is classified in group A,
chemically treated wood in class B (if the treatment is free from halogenated
compounds or heavy metals) and in class C if halogenated or heavy metal compounds
are present.32 Non-halogenated FR products are hence easier and more sustainable to
dispose of if needed. FR products are more difficult to dispose of by incineration,
however, this could facilitate a new type of business opportunity in the future. 33

2.6 Challenges with sustainable fire retardant treated wood
2.6.1 Biodeterioration of timber
Wood is a biological material and exterior wood is hence susceptible to insects and
microbial activity, such as fungi (mould, stain and decay fungi) and bacteria. Mould
and stain fungi do not affect the mechanical properties significantly, since such fungi
exist and feed on substances within the wood cells. However, the conditions that

11

Wilma Lindqvist
Master’s Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
favour less serious fungi are similar to the conditions that favour wood-destroying
fungi (decay fungi). The decay fungi seriously affect the mechanical properties of the
wood by attacking the cellulose directly, reducing the strength of the wood. Fungi can
be difficult to detect at an early stage and the mechanical properties can be decreased
by more than 10% before weight loss is observed and the decay fungi are detected.
Even less harmful fungi infestations are undesirable because of the discolouration of
the wood surface.
Bacteria mostly affect the properties of the wood over a long time but can also increase
the moisture absorption early on. Absorption affects the adhesion when coating the
timber and a coated surface can have worse properties than expected since the coating
is more likely to absorb into the wood. Furthermore, insect damage can occur, and
treatments are slightly different depending on insect infestation. 12
An antimicrobial agent is a necessary additive in a wood coating to preserve the wood,
minimise frequent maintenance and avoid decay and discolouration of the surface.
There are two types of preservatives: in-can preservatives and dry-film preservatives.
Depending on the formula both types of preservatives are usually needed, in-can
preservatives protect the coating during storage, before application and dry-film
preservatives protect the dry finished coating.34 Antimicrobial additives can be toxic
and must be chosen and handled carefully. It is important to choose additives that work
well in your system without leaching to maximise effectiveness and minimise
environmental impact. More sustainable antimicrobial additives have been in focus in
recent studies. Nanoparticles (zinc, copper and silver), propolis, chitosan oligomers
35,36

, essential oils 37 etc. are among investigated compounds.

3 FIRE RETARDANTS FOR OPAQUE EXTERIOR PAINT
3.1 Components and challenges
Regular exterior latex paint is a low-cost solution for protecting wood surfaces against
environmental conditions. These conditions include rain and moisture, high winds, UV
exposure and the paint must further be able to withstand temperature fluctuations, i.e.
the thermal expansion or reduction of the timber. Naturally, weather conditions are
different depending on location, which is important to note when developing a certain
product. 38
In recent years, there has been a strong shift from organic solvents to waterborne paint
coatings. In general, modern paints consist of water, binder, fillers/extenders and
several additives. Additives are added in smaller amounts, compared to fillers, and can
provide fire protection, opacity, colour, antifoaming and control of viscosity, UV
resistance and biological resistance etc., whereas fillers are often added in larger
amounts than other additives in order to reduce costs and improve performance. Paint
can be used directly, or in a multi-coat system, for example in combination with a
primer. 39

3.1.1 Binder
An opaque FR latex paint requires more binder and pigments, compared to a more
transparent paint, to achieve full coverage. The binder is regarded as the most
important component in paint since it contributes to the physical and mechanical
properties of the paint to a great extent. However, latex binders are usually flammable,
and a higher amount of binder leads to a decrease in fire protection. This is a major
challenge in the field and the reason why most current FRs for wood are transparent,
or semi-transparent. The binder used in this study had a relatively large particle size
needed for an opaque product, to avoid penetration into the wood. A smaller particle
size is used if the aim is for the binder to penetrate the surface. A non-flammable binder
with the right properties would be an ideal solution in this case. This is something that
could be studied more in the future.

13

Wilma Lindqvist
Master’s Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
A good binder should provide the following long-term properties:
-

Weather stability

-

Elasticity

-

Surface hardness

-

Blocking resistance

-

Good adhesion and wet adhesion

-

Water repellent

-

Environmentally friendly 40

3.1.2 Fire retardant additives
All additives and fillers in a good paint formulation are required to fulfil certain desired
properties, but the focus of this research work is on fire protection. Several potential
FR additives, manly minerals and one intumescent/ mineral-based compound, were
tested in combination with current FR solutions, i.e., a non-halogenated fire retardant
(FR-NH) and a synergistic fire retardant (FR-S).
These chemicals are a much better alternative to halogenated FRs, from a sustainability
point of view. However, higher amounts of these compounds may be needed for
achieving sufficient fire protection. A higher concentration of FR additive might affect
the properties of the coating in a negative way. It is preferred that components in the
same system do not react with each other in an antagonistic manner. If so, it is
important to know the underlying mechanisms and reactions in order to circumvent
negative interactions that scrutinise fire retardancy and other essential coating
properties. 41

3.1.3 Dispersing agent
The dispersing agent, a form of surfactant, is also crucial in a suspension. The ideal
amount of dispersing agent is dependent on e.g. type of dispersing agent, solid particle
concentration and specific surface area of the particles. In this case, the dispersing
agent was added only based on used particle concentration, whereas the surface area
was not taken into account. This is something that needs optimisation since an optimal
14

Wilma Lindqvist
Master’s Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
amount of dispersing agent gives the best result. There are different types of dispersing
agents suitable for different systems. This is further discussed in section “3.2 Colloidal
stability”. 42

3.1.4 Salt
Salt such as epsomite, which will be discussed later, is a challenging component and
contributes to problems in a dispersion and during film formation. Adding salt to a
dispersion contributes to instability and negatively affects the film formation and
drying properties of the coating. In general, adding electrolytes causes contraction of
the electric double layer which leads to flocculation. The use of the right dispersing
agents can prevent destabilisation in a system, at least to a certain extent, depending
on composition. How salt impacts stability is discussed more in the next section “3.2
Colloidal stability”. Salt can further react with other components due to ion
exchange.43
Additionally, the drying rate and film formation of a salt-containing latex dispersion,
is affected. A study published in 2008 stated that the film drying rate decreased with
the presence of salt. The salts analysed were sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and
sodium persulphate (NaPS). The presence of these salts proved to decrease the film
thickness and the evaporation rate during drying. Figure 7 displays the logarithmic
̅ ) as a function of the volume fraction polymer for different NaPS
evaporation rate (ℎ´
concentrations, under and above the critical coagulation concentration (CCC). Skin
formations at the coating surface is a common phenomenon when salt is present in a
dispersion. This means that salt solution is trapped under a dried skin on top of the
coating, which leads to slow drying rates and uneven film formation. The skin formed
can function as an osmotic membrane and water from the environment can therefore
penetrate the skin and lead to leaching of the salt and other components. How the film
formation is affected depends on salt type and concentration. 44

Figure 7. How different concentrations of NaPS affect the dispersion’s film drying process. 44

The skin formation and decreased evaporation rate of a salt-containing coating
naturally result in poor mechanical properties. A good film formation is an important
key factor in a good coating or paint. To avoid problems accompanied by the presence
of salt, one or several of the following courses of action could be the solution:44
-

Use a two-coat system with more salt in the primer product and less or no salt
in the topcoat product

-

Increase the binder concentration

-

Lower the salt concentration if possible and find an FR substitute with better
properties

-

Use a different formula that shields the salt from the ambient humidity

-

Use a suitable dispersing agent

16

3.1.5 Pigments
The type of pigments used in a coating also affects the properties, mostly the optical
properties. There are organic and inorganic pigments with different particle sizes and
shapes. Organic pigments are affected by light, contrary to inorganic particles. Hence,
inorganic particles are better for exterior use. Organic pigments are often brighter and
more transparent, but the transparency is also dependent on pigment particle size. A
larger particle usually gives more hiding power and a polydisperse particle size
distribution further improves the hiding power. The addition of lamellar fillers, such
as talc or other fillers/extenders to broaden the particle distribution makes the paint
opaquer. Furthermore, coarse pigment particles have a better hiding power in
comparison to fine particles. 45
Opacifying pigments can also be added to opaque paint. These pigments can work in
a similar way to other opacifying fillers. The refractive index (RI) plays a big role in
the opacity of paint and substances with an RI less than 1.7 are commonly referred to
as fillers or extenders, while substances with an RI greater than 1.7 are classified as
white pigments. Worth mentioning is that the pigment carbon black, in many ways, is
an exception among pigments. It absorbs radiation from the whole spectrum, is
transparent in small amounts as fine particles, and can be used to improve weathering
resistance, due to them being photostable.

In conclusion, an ideal pigment composition for an exterior opaque paint should fulfil
the following criteria:
-

Inorganic

-

Large particle size

-

Polydisperse particle distribution or addition of lamellar fillers or other fillers
to make the distribution more polydisperse

-

Coarse particles

-

Addition of fillers or other substances with a low RI value

3.2 Colloidal stability
The stabilisation of a colloidal suspension can be divided into electrostatic, steric,
electrosteric and depletion stabilisation (Figure 9). Dispersing agents are added to
achieve stabilisation and the suitable dispersing mechanism is dependent on the
dispersion composition. 47

Figure 9. Stability mechanisms. 47

Wilma Lindqvist
Master’s Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
All the components and how they interact affect the stability of a system. One
component that contributes most to stability issues is salt (the presence of free ions) in
a highly polar medium. An increase in salinity severely affects the electrostatic
repulsion hence leading to instability of the system, without the right surfactants
(Figure 10). To avoid this problem, electrosteric, steric, depletion dispersing agents or
combinations thereof need to be used. 48,49
However, this issue is far more complex and sometimes difficult to resolve since not
all mechanisms affecting stability are known. Things to take into consideration are
that:
-

Electrosteric stability depends on the salt type and dispersing agent molecular
weight and concentration 48

-

Steric dispersing agents can be used in most paints, but the dispersing agent
can block the surface of a particle, and this can be problematic in some
applications 49

3.3 Particle size, morphology and shape
A mineral or mineral-based compound can show different properties with varying
particle sizes and shapes. It has been reported that the addition of nanosized additives
into a coating may improve wear resistance, adhesion and optical properties, besides
improving fire retardancy. Intumescent systems normally show poor resistance to
external factors, however, this shortcoming can be balanced by the addition of
nanosized particles.

6

By tailoring the shape of particles, one can induce unique

properties. For example, disc-shaped particles can improve the gas barrier and FR
properties, whereas spherical particles provide low viscosity and random coils provide
high viscosity. 50

3.4 Limitations for fire retardant additives
3.4.1 Cost
No specific cost limits have been addressed in this work. However, to be able to
commercialise a product, the cost must be price competitive with similar products. To
keep the price down the process must be simple and the components must be relatively
cheap, or if more expensive and effective in smaller quantities.

3.4.2 Availability
In this work, it was deemed, that used additives needed to be commercially available
and ideally naturally available in Finland or close by. Availability further affects the
cost directly and good availability is key to a more sustainable product.

3.4.3 Toxicity
Balancing sustainability and effectivity is a constant challenge, but not an impossible
task. Minerals and mineral-based components are here selected to minimise toxicity
for humans, animals and the environment. The minerals used in this research work are
all naturally derived and non-toxic compounds. Beyond environmental regulations,
that must be fulfilled, the aim here is to find the most sustainable compounds that still
can perform well in an FR coating
EG, the only intumescent compound, is often presented as an effective, more
sustainable alternative to halogenated compounds. Nevertheless, it is important to note
that the production process of EG and the compound itself can be hazardous to a certain
degree. EG often contains sulfuric or nitric acid which will be released during
combustion. EG can, hence, be seen as slightly more problematic compared to the
other mineral compounds studied in this thesis. 9

4 POTENTIAL FIRE RETARDANT ADDITIVES AND
FILLERS
Fire retardants work in different ways to alter one or several of the parameters needed
for combustion, discussed in the section “2.3 Wood combustion” (Figure 6). FRs can
be categorised into three different groups based on their FR mechanism: endothermic-,
gas phase- and char forming/ intumescent FRs. 51 Synergists, which are chemicals that
enhance fire protection of a present FR additive, are sometimes referred to as a separate
group. Herein, different minerals and intumescent/mineral-based additives and their
mechanisms are discussed and analysed with the aim to develop an effective opaque
FR paint for wood.
After literature research, six different mineral or mineral-based additives were selected
for testing, as shown in Table 3. They were all chosen with the motive to develop a
sustainable final product. The most effective alternative in this series will be further
analysed and refined. The focus of this research work is on FR efficacy, but in an
exterior opaque paint, many other properties come into play, such as mechanical
properties, optical properties, viscosity, adhesion and drying, to name a few.

4.1 FR-NH
FR-NH is a component currently in use as an FR additive since it has been proven
effective. This component is therefore added in all the suspensions and not included in
the six additives that are selected for analysis in this thesis.

4.2 Epsomite and its derivatives
Epsomite or magnesium sulphate heptahydrate (MgSO4·7H2O) is highly soluble in
water (731 g/L). Epsomite can therefore be applied to wood as a water solution in large
amounts, compared to less soluble substances. A study published in 2016 compared
epsomite and borax salt as a treatment for wood and stated that high concentrations of
epsomite effectively worked as an FR. In the study wood samples were vacuum
impregnated with large loadings of epsomite, which is possible and rather feasible
since the salt is highly water-soluble, inexpensive and naturally occurring. Magnesium
sulphate heptahydrate is the most stable and the only naturally occurring form of
MgSO4·nH2O.
Epsomite decomposes endothermically and releases water vapour in stepwise
dehydration between 60 and 303 °C. The main step of dehydration occurs between
25°C and 100°C, which correspond to the MgSO4.7H2O → MgSO4.H2O transition. The
water content of epsomite is high (51,2 wt%) compared to other inorganic salts used
for fire protection such as magnesium and aluminium hydroxide (31,0 wt% and 34,6
wt% respectively). When wood coated with epsomite is burning, the released water
vapour dilutes the solid and gaseous wood compounds that work as fuel. This leads to
cooling of the surface and a prolonged onset ignition time. Between 896 and 1148 °C,
anhydrous MgSO4 is decomposed into MgO (17 wt%) and SO3 (31,7 wt%). The
Thermogravimetric analysis (Figure 13) shows the different stages of epsomite
decomposition during combustion. 52

23

Master’s Thesis

Figure 12. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the TGA curve´s derivative (DTG) of
epsomite. 52

The hypothesis is that epsomite might improve the FR properties of the system but not
enough without the addition of other mineral or mineral-based FR additives. The FRNH load is diluted when epsomite is added and this might affect the fire protection if
epsomite alone is less effective. The two formulations, one containing FR-NH and one
containing a combination of FR-NH and epsomite, are compared based on FR
properties.
The degradation of epsomite has further been proven affected by the presence of other
compounds. One study published in 2007 stated that the rate of the dehydration steps,
discussed earlier in this section, is reduced if organic additives are present during the
formation of epsomite crystals. This indicates that these additives are present in the
epsomite lattice.53 An additional reference with epsomite as the only compound
present should be analysed to assure that no other compound is formed.

4.3 Nanosized hydrophilic bentonite
Bentonite is a clay that consists mostly of montmorillonite. Different clay additives,
such as bentonite, montmorillonite and modified versions of these, have proven
effective as an FR for several different polymer and polymer composite materials.54-58
Clays have also been proven effective on wood, but often as a synergist in intumescent
systems, as surface-modified molecules or applied with more complicated methods
compared to brushing or spraying.6,58 A common mechanism of organo-bentonite
(organically modified bentonite) in an intumescent system is its characteristic to
strengthen the insulating layer formed during combustion by enlarging and
restructuring the layer to better resist oxygen and heat from reaching the underlying
surface. 59
One study, published in 2017, studied the effect of colloidal montmorillonite on the
fire retardancy of delignified balsa wood (Ochroma pyramidale). Cone calorimetry
was performed, and it was stated that the delignified clay impregnated wood had the
best fire performance with a peak heat release rate (HRR) of 157 ± 9 kW/m2 (Figure
14 and Table 4). 60

Delignification followed by impregnation of clay is unfortunately not a possible
application method for the formulas that were under study in this thesis. The coating
formula must be easily applicable (sprayed or brushed) and effective for untreated
timber. In this study, the FR properties of nanosized hydrophilic bentonite were
analysed in a regular wood coating.
Bentonite is also interesting from another point of view, i.e., as a rheology modifier or
thickening agent. Clays have been used as a thickener in different paints and coatings
for a long time. Especially when larger particles are present, a rheology modifier might
be needed to avoid sedimentation due to gravity and help achieve a more stable
suspension (Figure 15). The advantage of using clay is the fact that it is naturally
occurring and therefore often more sustainable and cost-effective in comparison with
other rheology modifiers.61 Furthermore, nanosized clay could enhance mechanical
and barrier properties and work as a coupling agent. 54,62

particles in a system. The network of clay is disbanded when the system is exposed to
mechanical strain. 63

4.4 Calcium carbonate
Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) decomposes between 600 °C and 830 °C. During
decomposition, an endothermic reaction takes place and CO2 and calcium oxide (CaO)
are formed.

64

As discussed earlier, this endothermic reaction contributes to heat

removal from the surface and dilution of flammable gases with non-flammable gases,
CO2 in this case. Furthermore, the calcium oxide that is formed during combustion can
form an insulating layer on the surface further protecting the surface. 51
When the concentration of nanosized CaCO3 is increased the limiting oxygen index
(LOI) is increased, which usually is associated with enhanced fire retardancy (Figure
16).65 A higher gloss of the coating can be obtained with the addition of small particles
of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) and it has the potential of partially replacing
binder and the white pigment titanium oxide (TiO2) to some extent. These properties
are sought-after, especially in opaque paint. 66,67

Different types of nanosized particles have been proven effective as FRs.6,68 The size
of the particle has been confirmed to affect the fire retardancy in several systems
(Figure 17) and this is probably also the case for many wood coating formulations.69
In this study, PCC with a median diameter (d50) of 130 nm in dispersion was studied.
Smaller particles in a suspension further contribute to a more even spread of the
coating.

4.5 Dolomite
Dolomite, composed of calcium magnesium carbonate CaMg(CO3)2, works as an FR
partly in a similar way as CaCO3. Depending on conditions and origin (natural or
synthetic), dolomite can decompose in different ways.

70,71

One possible course of

reactions under equilibrium could be explained with reactions (I) to (III). 72

CaMg(CO3)2  CaO + MgO + 2CO2

> 801.1 K

(II)

CaCO3  CaO + CO2

> 1118.8 K (III)

The CO2 formed dilutes the flammable gases and the two mineral oxides, CaO and
MgO, can form an insulative layer further protecting the wood.

4.6 Wollastonite
Nano-wollastonite (NW), a calcium silicate mineral (CaSiO3), has been reported as
potential FR in several studies.73-76 NW has been reported to enhance the thermal
conductivity of medium density fibreboard (MDF). A higher thermal conductivity
coefficient of the surface leads to better heat transfer, thus, preventing the heat from
accumulating near the flame, resulting in an ignition delay.

77

As a mineral,

wollastonite also works as a layer against fire penetration, by decreasing heat transfer
in the radial direction towards the wood surface.

78

The TGA and DTA curves of

wollastonite can be seen in Figure 18, to better understand the thermal degradation.
The weight loss of approximately 5.5 wt% is due to water and possible impurities.

79

Furthermore, silicon-based additives have been proven to decrease the carbon
monoxide amount released during a fire and improve the mechanical properties of a
coating. 80

29

Wilma Lindqvist
Master’s Thesis
____________________________________________________________________

Figure 17. DTA and TGA data for wollastonite. 79

The optimal level of NW load depends on the formula, surface and coating method. A
higher load usually improves the fire retardancy and delays the ignition but increases
the water absorption and treatment costs. To some extent, the mechanical properties
can further be improved. However, each system requires optimisation to achieve the
ideal NW amount. 74
Due to availability issues, larger particles of wollastonite have been analysed in this
thesis (Nano-wollastonite is currently difficult to obtain in Europe). There are several
methods to synthesise wollastonite, but synthesis is more commonly used in the
medical field, where wollastonite is used as a bone regenerative and as a drug delivery
carrier.

81

A top-down approach such as grinding is a more common approach

commercially. However, nanosized particles are often more expensive to produce, and
manmade nanosized particles could include known or currently unknown health risks.
82

Respirable wollastonite could potentially show adverse effects, but wollastonite is

rapidly cleared from the lungs with shorter halftime than most minerals (from under a
week up to 21 days). Several studies on animals have concluded that cancer or fibrosis
is not caused by wollastonite, and the mineral has been proven highly unlikely to be
biopersistent.83

Listed in Table 5 are the components present in the wollastonite used in this study.
The needle-shaped particles have a median particle size (d50) of 3.5 m and a specific
surface area of 3.25 m2/g. It is important to note that a compound’s properties might
differ depending on particle size (larger versus nanosized).

4.7 Expandable graphite
Expandable graphite (EG) works as an intumescent fire retardant (IFR). Two types of
IFR coatings are used today: traditional chemical IFR and EG. The following
properties contribute to the IFR’s good fire protection:
•

High thermal conductivity in the fibre direction (Figure 2) distributes the heat
evenly over a larger surface.

•

Low thermal conductivity and heat absorption in the perpendicular direction of
the surface (radial direction) contribute to a large temperature gradient.

•

Even char formation and high stability of the system, whereby the so-called
“popcorn effect” can be avoided.

•

High heat capacity delays ignition and prevents rapid fire development.

31

Wilma Lindqvist
Master’s Thesis
____________________________________________________________________

Figure 18. Expandable graphite. 9

EG contains crystalline graphite sheets stacked on each other and bonded together with
covalent bonds. An acid, sulfuric or nitric acid, exists as an intercalant between the
crystalline graphite planes (Figure 19). When the system is heated the acid vaporises
and expands, thereby forcing the graphite planes apart. In this case, a “worm-like”
insulating layer is formed (Figure 20). The expansion rate can vary from 30 ml/g to
over 500 ml/g, depending on EG composition. The EG used in this study has an
expansion rate of 100 ml/g. The formed layer was porous and protected the underlying
surface from burning because of its suitable thermal properties as listed earlier. The
layer forms a temperature gradient that protects the coated material from high heat and
prevents direct contact between oxygen and flame.9,84
The boiling point for an acid increases with a higher acid concentration. A sulfuric
acid concentration of 50 weight percentage gives a boiling point of 123°C, whereas at
higher concentrations one can reach a boiling point of over 300°C. Consequently, EG
can be tailored to expand at a suitable temperatures range and properties such as pH
and expansion rate can, hence, be altered by changing the composition and size of the
EG particles.85

analysis.

Expandable graphite is considered a more sustainable alternative to chemical IFRs
since it contains fewer toxic chemicals that can leach. Nevertheless, expandable
graphite has some shortcomings. The “popcorn effect” is a well-known phenomenon
where the expandable graphite expands too fast for the binder to hold it in place. This
leads to parts of the product popping loose from the surface and it might even remove
underlying material in the process. The air turbulence from a fire can also cause the
intumescent coating to fall off the surface. Therefore, it is very important to find a
suitable formula and a binder that holds the coating together. 9
Another notable problem is the environmental impact. Even though expandable
graphite is seen as far more environmentally friendly compared to many other FR
compounds it is not always a completely sustainable material. The production and
combustion of expandable graphite can lead to pollution. 86 However, new methods to
produce expandable graphite have been evaluated. 87,88 It is further important to note
that a smaller amount of expandable graphite might be as effective as large amounts
of another substance. This is important to keep in mind when calculating the
environmental impact and the cost of a certain formula or additive.

4.8 Other materials
Based on current research, there are numerous different additives and other
components that could be of interest in an FR product. The additives all contribute to
specific properties (both positive and negative), while simultaneously providing FR
properties. The necessary properties in a product could be achieved with the right
additive(s). The key factor here is that all these additives are seen as possible
components in an environmentally friendly product, hence in accordance with a green
chemistry approach.
In addition to wollastonite and bentonite, other minerals, such as silicon-based
compounds have been proven effective. Among these: kaolin, talc, mica and silica
particles. These additives are often used in combination with other FRs, for example,
to reinforce intumescent systems or in a system that amplifies the silicon-based
additives FR mechanism. Talc has a similar FR mechanism as kaolin and the other
clays bentonite and montmorillonite. A protective barrier layer is often formed on
substrates with these additives present and other property improvements have been
demonstrated, such as increased char expansion of intumescent systems with the
presence of kaolin. Mica, a group of aluminosilicate minerals, have plate-shaped
particles that form an even and thin coating. Mica is a common FR in electrical cables
but can further be used in/on other materials. Mica can improve the protective layer of
char, formed during combustion.80,89 Additionally, Phosphate minerals and other
phosphorous-based compounds have shown great potential, an example is struvite. 90
Metallic hydroxides, especially aluminium trihydrate (ATH) and magnesium
dihydroxide (MDH), are also effective FR additives. ATH is cheap and easy to
incorporate in several formulas. The FR mechanism can be explained by the
endothermic reaction that leads to water release and the formation of metal oxide. This
affects the combustion mostly by 1) diluting the oxygen 2) diluting the fuel and the
flammable gases 3) increasing the enthalpy of decomposition 4) prolonging the time
for the material to reach pyrolysis temperatures and 5) insulating the underlying layer
from some of the heat. ATH decomposes between 180°C and 200°C in comparison to
MDH that decomposes at higher temperatures between 250°C and up to over 300°C.
Desirable improved mechanical properties can further be obtained with ATH and
MDH. 80
34

Wilma Lindqvist
Master’s Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
Other carbon-based compounds, besides EG, have been proven to be effective FRs.
Carbon nanotubes, exfoliated graphite, graphene and graphene oxide are some of these
compounds. Several studies prove that graphene and graphene derivatives can slow
down pyrolysis by increasing the thermal conductivity and heat absorption.
Furthermore, each derivative contributes to specific properties. Graphene and its
derivatives are most commonly used in plastics, but these additives have also become
more common in wood coatings, in combination with synergists. 91

The materials used are listed in Table 6 (additional information is found in Table 3).
Detailed experimental description for all prepared suspensions and cone calorimeter
samples is to be found in this section. Cone calorimeter analysis was utilised to assess
the fire retardancy properties of each suspension applied on wood to find the most
efficient FR additive(s) for wood. The most potential additive was investigated in a
few different systems, to better understand what a potential system could consist of.

The mineral additives were studied in combination with two current FR compounds:
i.e., FR-NH and a FR-S. Additionally, basic components needed for a good paint
formulation were present: binder, dispersing agent, defoamer and distilled water. No
pigments, fillers or other additives, such as biocides were added at this stage. In total,
ten suspensions were prepared: two references, five 10% SC one-coat systems, one
20% SC one-coat system and two two-coat systems. A high shear mixer was used for
preparation (Figure 21).

5.1.1 Reference suspensions
Even though both compounds; epsomite and FR-NH, have been reported to
significantly improve the fire retardancy of wood products, the relatively high amount
of binder in the product inhibit the compounds from working effectively. As a result
of the binder concentration, epsomite nor FR-NH were anticipated to show good FR
properties in the formulation on its own. However, the magnesium sulphate salt was
compared with the current component, FR-NH, to determine if the addition of
epsomite can improve the fire protection of the wood.

To be able to determine the most potential mineral additive, five one-coat systems with
10% SC analysed substance “x” were prepared. A one-coat system here, in comparison
to a two-coat system, means that no primer product has been used underneath.
All substances, except expandable graphite, were prepared according to the following
instructions:
1. Distilled water, dispersing agent and defoamer were mixed at 700 rpm for 10
minutes.
2. Substance “x” and FR-S was added, and the mixture was stirred for an hour at
800 rpm.
3. Binder was added, and the mixture was stirred for an hour (800 rpm)
4. The FR-NH solution was added, and the mixture was stirred for an hour (800
rpm)

The mixture obtained when step 2 was completed will herein be referred to as a
“premix”. If the premix becomes stable or not depends on several factors, e.g. the
particle size (the larger the particle the higher the risk for sedimentation).
Sedimentation was noticed in some of the premixes, meaning that the stabilisation

40

needs improvement either with a different formula or with different sized/shaped
additive particles. However, this should not affect the FR properties and was not
addressed at this stage. The particle size of expandable graphite was too large for the
suspension to stay stable even for a short while, and EG was hence mixed into the
suspension when step 4 was completed.
Based on initial cone calorimeter results PCC exhibited the most potential. For further
testing another one-coat system, named “PCC 2”, was prepared, with 20% SC PCC,
to evaluate how the concentration of PCC affects the fire performance. This suspension
was prepared in the same way as the 10% SC PCC suspensions listed in Table 10.

“PCC 2 A” and “PCC 2 B” were the same suspension but coated in different loads (see
no. 8-9 in Table 7).

5.1.3 Two-coat systems
The two-component system “Primer + PCC 3” (no. 10 in Table 7) consists of a primer
layer and a topcoat. The primer layer consists of approximately 45% SC FR-NH and
the topcoat was prepared in the same way as the one-coat systems with PCC, the
component concentrations can be seen in Table 10. The FR-NH amount in this system
was slightly lower to see how this affects the FR properties.

The two-coat system “Primer + IPA + PCC 2” also consists of a primer and a topcoat.
However, in this case, the primer consists of the 45% SC FR-NH solution mixed with
0.5% (wet basis) isopropyl alcohol. The topcoat was the same formula as the “20% SC
PCC” one-coat suspension described in Table 11.

5.2 Cone calorimetry
Сone calorimeter is a relatively simple way to assess a coatings fire retardancy
properties. Several samples were analysed of each coating in order to minimise random
fluctuations in burning results. Fluctuating results can raise from a combination of
changes in the density of the wood, coating load of suspension and overall suspension
application technique. The first HRR peak is directly related to the initial burn rate.
The lower the peak, the more effective the FR. The second peak, usually at 800 to 900
seconds for untreated wood, becomes visible when the wood surface starts to crack,
and oxygen can reach deeper into the wood. If the FR coating penetrates deeper into
the wood, the second peak appears later, or it exhibits a lower peak HRR value. 92

5.2.1 Sample preparation
The cone calorimeter test specimens were spruce, free from knot holes and resin, with
the measurements 100.3 cm * 100.3 cm * 2.20.1cm. The suspension’s solid
content (Table 7) and the difference in sample measurements were not considered
during sample preparation but taken into consideration when the results were analysed.
The first step of sample preparation was to sandpaper the edges and possible splinters.
This was done to keep a slight roughness of the surface but to even out major roughness.
Hence, when the coating was applied it settled more even, and more reliable and
uniform cone calorimeter results were received. The samples were left to dry in the
same laboratory for approximately 5 days to acquire similar dry percentages.

43

Wilma Lindqvist
Master’s Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
The second step was the coating of the samples. The coating load of FR per sample
was measured by the difference in weight of the dry spruce sample before and after
treatment. The amount of coating was applied as weight per surface area, meaning that
the wood sample’s initial weight did not affect the coating amount. Each sample was
coated on the top and on the sides, but not on the bottom. The bottom and the sides
were protected with aluminium foil during cone calorimeter analysis. A brush was
used to apply the suspension on the spruce samples.
The final step, before analysis, was drying. Three samples of each suspension were
coated and dried for 7 days at room temperature (relative humidity: 50-60%). When
dried, two of these were analysed with cone calorimetry. If the peak HRR between two
samples with the same suspension differentiated much, a third sample was analysed to
receive a more reliable result and find potential outliers.

The FR-NH suspension (Reference 1) showed similar cone calorimeter results as the
epsomite containing suspension (Reference 2). A higher coating load generally
displayed slightly improved FR results. Both samples showed similar heat release rate
(HRR) curves, but reference 2 had a prolonged time to the onset of ignition. Since FRNH is a well-known fire retardant, it was used when preparing the other samples.
However, further analysis with epsomite should be executed, for example, tests with
epsomite as the only compound to avoid possible reactions.

____________________________________________________________________
Of the 10% SC one-coat suspensions, precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) showed
the lowest mean peak HRR at 142 kW/m2 (Table 11). This result is due to a
combination of PCC’s many FR mechanisms of action and other properties that have
been discussed earlier in the theoretical section. The small particle size of PCC further
contributed to a relatively stable suspension. Dolomite is also an effective FR additive
in the system, with a peak HRR of 146 kW/m2. However, the dolomite in this research
had a relatively large particle size and the suspension was not stable for long. The
particle size might also affect the mechanical properties of the finished coating.
Dolomite with a smaller particle size could have more potential and should be analysed
further. Both PCC and dolomite have similar fire protection actions.
The second peak HRR of approximately 100 kW/m2 further indicates that PCC is an
effective FR additive. A logical explanation could be that calcium carbonate better
hinders oxygen from penetrating the wood, as the small and evenly distributed
particles constitute a barrier for oxygen. In contrast, EG exhibited a high second peak.
This can be attributed to the worm-like intumescent structure formed by EG during
combustion. When EG expands it leaves small spaces in between the formed wormlike structures, where oxygen probably can penetrate, leading to an increase in the
HRR peak value. An improvement possibility here could be to add another FR additive
to the EG suspension to stabilise the insulative layer and prevent the oxygen from
reaching the wood surface.
The best ignition delay was obtained with the bentonite suspension, however, the peak
HRR was noticeably higher than for other suspensions. The ignition delay could be
explained by the early decomposition of bentonite (< 100 °C) when heated (Figure 23).
Most other additives start to decompose at a higher temperature, and they might
therefore not improve the ignition time as effectively. The bentonite suspension was
also the most viscous, because of the internal network bentonite forms. This was a
good feature in this case, since the ease of application was improved substantially.

Since PCC showed the most potential, two new PCC suspensions were prepared and
tested in four different systems. These samples give a better initial understanding of
how the FR properties can be improved. From these tests (Table 11), several
conclusions can be drawn:
•

A one-coat system with 10% SC PCC was more effective than a system with
20% SC PCC.

•

PCC 2 A showed slightly improved HRR values and a slight delay in the
ignition time. However, a larger coating load of 350 g/m2 was not significantly
more effective than a load of 200 g/m2.

•

A small amount of IPA in the primer can improve the FR properties.

•

A higher percentage of FR-NH improves the FR properties.

•

The most effective FR system thus far was the sample “Primer + IPA + PCC
2”

The second peak HRR for the sample “Primer + IPA + PCC 2” occurred later in
comparison to other PCC samples, but the second peak value was surprisingly high.
This phenomenon was also noticed slightly in sample “Primer + PCC 3”. The second
HRR peak of “Primer + IPA + PCC 2” surpasses the other PCC sample values at
approximately 900 seconds (15 minutes). A prolonged combustion is sought-after
since people are more likely to have time to escape a potential fire. IPA should help
47

Wilma Lindqvist

the FR-NH to better penetrate the wood and hence protect it, hindering a high second
HRR peak. However, a possible explanation for the high second peak for sample
“Primer + IPA + PCC 2” could be an unstable char layer and hence cracking of the
wood surface, leading to heat and oxygen penetrating the wood. Another explanation
could be that the FR-NH in the primer was accumulated on the surface because of the
so-called “chromatographic effect”, where only solvent, and not the active ingredient,
penetrates the material. 95
Usually, a higher amount of additive improves the FR properties, but simultaneously
worsens the mechanical properties. However, a higher load of PCC in this system does
not give an increased fire resistance, probably because the amount of FR-NH is
decreased when other additives are added in larger amounts. The high amount of FRNH in the topcoat has earlier been proven to reduce the mechanical properties, such as
wet-scrub resistance and other important properties. Furthermore, leaching of the FRNH can be problematic if much FR-NH is present. The binder improves the mechanical
properties, but probably not as much as needed. The FR-NH in the topcoat must
probably be decreased or removed and more suitable substituents must be found that
also enhance the other properties needed in opaque paint.
A solution to decrease the FR-NH on the surface could be to introduce a two-coat
system with as much FR-NH as possible in the primer coat, but less or no FR-NH in
the topcoat. IPA, or some other component to improve coat absorption, could be
present in the primer to improve compound absorbance into the wood. This could
further decrease the chance of FR-NH being removed if the topcoat were to be applied
with a brush.

6.2 Primer penetration
As noted in this study, a primer or undercoat is likely needed to improve fire retardancy
properties and maintain good mechanical properties. While the topcoat determines the
ignition time and part of the fire retardant properties, especially the first peak HRR,
the primer should penetrate the wood, to effectively protect it during the fire.
Additionally, a primer should ideally improve the adhesion and physical and

48

Wilma Lindqvist
Master’s Thesis
____________________________________________________________________
mechanical properties of the topcoat. To obtain an opaque paint, the topcoat should
not penetrate the surface and most components should, hence, have a larger particle
size.
There are numerous methods to analyse the penetration, the most suitable method
depends on material and treatment formulation. Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)96,97, X-ray Fluorescence Microscopy (XFM)98, High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC)99,100 and staining techniques101-103 are some of the most
effective methods used to measure penetration.
The penetration depends on the material/species treated, the location, the treatment
formulation and environmental factors. Furthermore, the formulation’s viscosity,
polarity, surface tension and particle size, distribution, shape and morphology also
alter the penetration. To improve penetration depth incising (pre-treatment where
small slits or incisions are cut into the wood) or pre-steaming can be used. Penetration
enhancing agents have further been proven very effective. 104

6.3 Future optimisation
A possible optimisation pathway to explore could be to test the mechanical and
physical properties of the most potential system “Primer + IPA + PCC 2”, when made
into a finished paint. If the system shows good enough properties, one could further
refine the formulation with other additives. Experimental design could be utilised to
improve effectiveness and reduce the costs of the product.
If, however, the system does not meet the criteria, following actions could be:
•

Decrease the FR-NH concentration or remove the FR-NH from the topcoat and
explore if potential substitute additives are to be found.

•

Analyse the properties of the other so far identified FR additives in a similar
system.

•

Evaluate other nanoparticles in a similar system, since nanoparticles have
shown improvement for, e.g. mechanical properties.

•

7 CONCLUSION
The results indicate that the most effective FR additive in this system was precipitated
calcium carbonate, closely followed by dolomite (Table 11 and Graph 1). PCC and
dolomite showed good cone calorimetry results with peak HRR 142 ± 2 kW/m2 and
146 ± 7 kW/m2 respectively. Bentonite displayed the best ignition delay, likely because
of its low thermal decomposition temperature. However, the peak HRR value for
bentonite was significantly higher than the other additives. Initial optimisation of a
PCC system named “Primer + IPA + PCC 2”, displayed the overall most potential FR
results, based on both peak HRR (128 ± 1 kW/m2) and ignition time (16 ± 2 s).
Of the reference suspensions, a combination of epsomite and FR-NH was suggested
slightly more effective, compared to a pure FR-NH suspension. Both reference’s peak
HRR were the same (approximately 197 kW/m2), but the average time to ignition was
4 seconds longer for the epsomite containing reference. The base of the suspensions
and the primers contains only FR-NH at this stage, but cone calorimeter results suggest
that epsomite could be a potential candidate in the formulation.
The next product development step could be to analyse the mechanical and physical
properties to know where improvements still are needed and continue from there. It is
likely that the FR-NH amount in the topcoat must be decreased or removed to improve
these properties and the binder amount increased for a stronger opaquer exterior paint.
Further additives or combinations of different additives could further be investigated.
When an effective FR formula with the properties needed is discovered, SBI analysis
could be used to state the fire classification.

8 SVENSKSPRÅKIG SAMMANFATTNING
Icke-halogenerade flamskyddstillsatser i en heltäckande flamskyddsfärg
för trä

Trä är ett miljövänligt material som i flera avseenden är ett bättre byggnadsmaterial än
exempelvis metall, tegel och betong. Användning av trä innebär en markant minskning
av koldioxidutsläpp under bearbetningen från råvara till färdig produkt. En bärande
konstruktion av korslimmat trä (CLT) har också påvisats hålla längre än de flesta
material vid brand, tack vare lagret av förkolning som bildas på ytan och isolerar
kärnmaterialet. Då metall utsätts för hög värme och smälter beter det sig mer ”spagettilikt” och betong har en tendens att spjälka vid högre temperaturer då vattenånga i det
porösa materialet förgasas och expanderar. Dessa egenskaper kan leda till att den
bärande konstruktionen kollapsar tidigare jämfört med en byggnad konstruerad i trä.
Då ytbeläggningen är av trä behöver den skyddas med flamskyddsmedel eller med ett
annat material som inte brinner. Det är här viktigt att förstå att det är skillnad mellan
en bärande konstruktion och en ytbeläggning. Ytbeläggning av trä på större
konstruktioner har tidigare varit ett hinder på grund av träets naturliga egenskap att lätt
fatta eld. Men vartefter att nya, mer hållbara flamskyddsalternativ har kommit ut på
marknaden har trähöghus blivit allt vanligare. Tidigare har halogener, främst bromider,
använts som flamskydd, men en konstant växande mängd forskning har kunnat påvisa
de höga riskerna med användning av dessa ämnen. Många halogener är bland annat
giftiga, cancerframkallande, svårnedbrytbara och bioackumulativa vilket har lett till
att dessa ämnen stegvis har börjat förbjudas i Europa och runt om i världen.
Ytbeläggning av trä har idag blivit allt vanligare på höghus då nya kommersiella
miljövänliga flamskyddsalternativ blivit vanligare och i och med att den globala
uppvärmningen tagits mer på allvar. Forskningen går hela tiden framåt, men att
framställa hållbara och effektiva produkter, med alla de egenskaper en målarfärg eller
beläggning kräver, är ännu aningen utmanande. Vissa komponenter som ger ett bra
flamskydd

kan

våtnötningsmotståndet. Bra mekaniska egenskaper är extremt viktigt i en beläggning,
särskilt i en exteriör produkt eftersom den oftast utsättas för olika extrema
väderförhållanden. Det finns även andra utmaningar med en heltäckande exteriör
flamskyddsfärg. Bindemedlet, som behövs i större mängder i en mer täckande färg, är
lättantändligt. Det flamskyddssystem som analyseras här har även påvisats påverka
stabiliteten och filmformationen negativt.
Målet med denna avhandling är att undersöka potentiella tillsatser och kombinationer
som skulle kunna verka som flamskydd i en heltäckande exteriör färg. Tillsatser är
epsomsalt, wollastonit, dolomit, utfälld kalciumkarbonat (PCC), bentonit och
expanderbar grafit (EG). Ämnena analyseras i kombination med ett icke-halogenerat
flamskydd (FR-NH) och ett synergistiskt flamskydd (FR-S), eftersom de kemikalierna
är beprövade flamskydd från tidigare. Denna avhandling koncentrerar sig främst på
produktens flamskyddsegenskaper, medan de andra nödvändiga egenskaperna inte
undersöks utan enbart diskuteras i korthet.
Flamskydd kan kategoriseras i fyra grupper baserat på flamskyddsmekanism:
endotermiska flamskydd, gasfasflamskydd, kolformande eller svällande flamskydd
och synergister. Endotermiska flamskydd fungerar genom att bortföra värme från ytan
och genom att avge vatten och/eller andra gaser som späder ut de lättantändliga gaser
som annars bidrar till brand. Metallhydroxider, som under brand bryts ner till
metalloxider, är en typ av endotermiska flamskydd som ytterligare kan skydda ytan
genom att bilda en skyddande beläggning. Gasfasflamskydd fungerar genom att
reagera med de fria radikalerna som behövs till förbränning, vilket leder till ett
långsammare brandförlopp eller till och med att branden slocknar. Till denna grupp
hör exempelvis halogener. Kolformande flamskydd bildar ett isolerande lager på ytan,
som gör att värmen och syret som behövs för brand inte når in till resten av materialet
lika snabbt. Till denna grupp hör exempelvis svällande flamskyddsmedel. Synergister
verkar genom att förstärka mekanismen hos ett annat flamskydd på olika sätt.

De totalt sju producerade suspensionerna målades i mängden 350 g/m2 på träbitar
utsågade för analys med konkalorimeter (10cm*10cm*2,2cm). Alla substanser
undersöktes som ettskiktssystem (ingen grundbeläggning eller toppbeläggning), delvis
i ett försök att förenkla applikationen och delvis för att förbättra möjligheten till en
mer täckande färg (nummer 3–8 i Tabell 2).
Efter konkalorimeter analys kunde det konstateras att kalciumkarbonat var det mest
potentiella flamskyddet i detta system, om man jämför värmeavgivningshastigheten
55

vid den första toppen (eng. peak heat release rate – peak HRR). Bentonit dröjde längst
till antändning men gav i allmänhet inte ett bra flamskydd däremot kan bentonit också
förbättra suspensionens stabilitet och viskositet. Referensversionerna påvisade
liknande flamskyddsegenskaper, bortsett från att version 2, bestående av blandningen,
i medeltal hade 4,5 sekunder senare antändningstid. Eftersom FR-NH är en mer
beprövad förening användes den i vidare analys. Vidare experiment med epsomsalt
som enda förening kunde vara mer riktgivande för att undvika eventuella reaktioner.
Kalciumkarbonat undersöktes vidare som ett ettskiktssystem där 20 % av torrhalten
var kalciumkarbonat i olika applikationsmängder, och som tvåskiktssystem. I
tvåskiktssystem bestod grundbeläggningen av enbart en lösning med FR-NH eller en
blandning av en lösning med FR-NH och isopropanol (IPA). Topplagret bestod av
20 % kalciumkarbonat av den totala torrhalten med FR-NH i olika mängder. Alla
resultat är sammanfattade i tabell 2 och graf 1.
Av de undersökta suspensionerna visade sig det mest potentiella systemet vara ett
tvåskiktssystem där grundbeläggningen (200 g/m2) bestod av FR-NH och isopropanol
och topp produkten (200 g/m2) bestod av kalciumkarbonat (20 % av torrhalten) med
en så hög FR-NH koncentration som möjligt (nummer 12 i graf 1). Detta system
fungerade troligen bra som flamskydd eftersom sakthalten i primer produkten var hög
och drog bra in i träet med hjälp av isopropanolen och även på grund av att
toppbeläggning bestod av relativt höga mängder både salt och kalciumkarbonat.
Problemen med detta system är att den totala mängden bestrykning är ganska hög och
att de mekaniska egenskaperna troligen inte är de bästa eftersom salthalten är så hög i
topplagret. Dessutom är en heltäckande färg troligen svår att uppnå om inte halten av
bindemedel höjs.
Nästa steg i utvecklingen av en heltäckande flamskyddsfärg är att förbättra de
mekaniska egenskaperna och undersöka och optimera de optiska egenskaperna.
Kalciumkarbonat borde enligt litteraturen ge aningen bättre våtnötningsmotstånd och
ämnet borde också kunna fungera som substitut till bindemedel och det vita pigmentet
titandioxid (TiO2), till en viss grad. Epsomsaltet kunde också vara intressant att
undersöka vidare, både skilt för sig och i blandning med FR-NH eftersom blandningen
gav en fördröjning i antändningstiden. Det finns flera olika standarder som bestämmer
i vilken klass ett flamskydd hamnar; den mest riktgivande standarden är SBI-metoden
56

(provning av enskilt brinnande föremål). Kriterierna som behövs för en viss klass är
listade i APPENDIX 1 på engelska. Målet med en flamskyddsfärg för trä är att den
uppnår standarden B-s1, d0, och att de kemiska och de mekaniska egenskaperna
motsvarar målen.
