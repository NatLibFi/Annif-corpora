Abstract:
This thesis aims to provide an in-depth insight into the perceptions and experiences of native
English-speaking teachers (NESTs) teaching EFL in South Korea and Finland. The main focus
of the study is to examine the similarities and differences between these two countries as EFL
contexts and how NESTs position themselves in respect to them by discussing their thoughts
on the respective EFL education systems, their students’ proficiency in English and how EFL
should be taught, the global presence of English, and their roles as NESTs in an EFL teaching
context. A justification for this comparative study are the various similarities in South Korea
and Finland as contexts. An additional motivator behind this study is the gap in international
rankings of English proficiency levels between Finnish and Korean EFL learners, despite the
high performance of both countries’ education systems in international comparisons. This
thesis examines and discusses potential reasons behind this.
The methods employed in the study were semi-structured audio-recorded interviews with five
NESTs teaching in Korea and six teaching in Finland. The interviews were transcribed and
analysed through thematic analysis, with the help of the qualitative analysis software NVivo.
The data showed various similarities between the EFL education contexts of Korea and
Finland. Both appear to be shifting towards a more communication-based language learning
approach, although the emphasis on refining skills in reading and writing remains strong. Both
have traditionally emphasised a particular variety of English in the teaching material, but this
emphasis is giving way to a more diverse representation of Englishes. Regarding Korean and
Finnish EFL learners, both begin learning English formally at a young age, and encounter
many similar difficulties due to the linguistic dissimilarity of English to their mother tongue.
Furthermore, both are commonly more at ease with written demonstrations of English
proficiency, at least in formal learning contexts. The interviewed NEST in both countries
agreed that communication practice should be featured more in EFL classrooms, and that using
English as the language of instruction can have many advantages, particularly with more
advanced learners. Furthermore, many believed they as NESTs had unique strengths as EFL
teachers. The most commonly mentioned ones were the ability to provide cultural context for
the language, as well as a more intuitive, nuanced understanding of English. Simultaneously,
the data revealed that NESTs teaching in Finland were generally more satisfied with the
education system and more ambivalent concerning their role as NESTs than their Korea-based
counterparts. The Finnish EFL education was also reported as featuring more varieties of
English, and the Finnish students were reportedly more motivated to engage with English
outside the classroom.
These findings suggest that the presence of English, both in the formal education system and in
society at large, may be more solidified in Finland than in Korea, which in turn would account
for the higher scores on international proficiency tests.

1. Introduction
This thesis presents a comparative case study of English as a foreign language (EFL)
education in South Korea and Finland, from the perspective of native English-speaking
teachers (NESTs) teaching in these two countries. The focus was on the attitudes and
experiences NESTs teaching in these two EFL contexts had concerning the respective
EFL education systems, their students’ proficiency in English and how EFL should be
taught, the global presence of English, and their roles as NESTs in an EFL teaching
context. The study was conducted through semi-structured interviews with five NESTs
teaching in Korea and six teaching in Finland, and the interview data was analysed
with the help of thematic analysis.
The main justification for this comparative study are the various similarities in
South Korea and Finland as contexts. Both are wealthy, industrialised nations that have
undergone rapid economic development since the mid-20th century, and whose
education systems have merited much international praise for high performance.
English has traditionally been constructed as a foreign language in both countries, and
the primary local language in each differs significantly from English. An additional
motivator behind this study is the gap in international rankings of English proficiency
levels between Finnish and Korean EFL learners, as this thesis also examines and
discusses potential reasons behind this. While there have been previous studies
comparing Korean and Finnish EFL textbooks (e.g. Kim, 2020; Namgung, 2016),
there is a lack of more in-depth qualitative research on the topic. Moreover, this thesis
provides insight into an additional element of EFL teaching, namely, NESTs and how
they position themselves (and are positioned) as EFL teachers in these two countries.
The thesis first presents an overview of some of the hot topics in EFL education
today in chapter 2: World Englishes and the diversity in variety and purpose of English
language use, English as the language of instruction in EFL classes, and the role of the
NEST in EFL teaching. Chapter 3 provides an insight into South Korea as an EFL
context and notable aspects of its EFL education system, and chapter 4 introduces the
presence of English in Finland and the Finnish EFL education system, as well as a
brief comparison of the situations in Korea and Finland. The current case studies and
methods used are presented in chapter 5, and the results of the studies are analysed in
1

chapter 6. Chapter 7 features additional analysis of interesting and relevant themes
identified in the interview data. The findings of the study will be discussed in chapter
8, with a conclusion of the main implications and limitations of the thesis in chapter 9.

2. English as a global language

2.1. Ways of defining World Englishes
The culturally, linguistically, and geographically pluralistic nature of the English
language and its uses today is hard to contest. English is used for a variety of both
intranational and international purposes by, and between, speakers from different
cultural and linguistic backgrounds and with varying degrees of English competence.
It is because of this that the plural term “World Englishes” is regularly used by
scholars, and, as Bhatt (2001:527) argues, it “represents a paradigm shift in research,
teaching, and application of sociolinguistic realities to the forms and functions of
English” towards a more equal and pluralistic view of English. Moreover, various
models have been developed with the purpose of defining and categorising World
Englishes. One is the trichotomy of speakers of English as a native language (ENL),
speakers of English as a second language (ESL) and speakers of English as a foreign
language (EFL). ENL speakers are defined as those born and raised in a country where
English has traditionally been spoken as a first language. ESL speakers are speakers
from the former colonies of the British Empire, where English often has an official
status and is used for a variety of official purposes. EFL speakers come from countries
where English has no internal tradition of use (Jenkins, 2009). Obviously, this model
has several problems, as it does not account for pidgins and creoles, the linguistic
variation between and within traditionally English-speaking countries, or the problems
that arise when attempting to define who is a native speaker of what language, due to
how widespread bi- and multilingualism are (McArthur 1998 in Jenkins, 2009).
Braj Kachru’s (1988) three-circle model of World Englishes continues to be a
widely used one, and is in many ways similar to that of the previously presented model.
However, instead of referring to native, second language and foreign language
speakers, it refers to geographic areas as belonging to one of three circles: the Inner
Circle, the Outer Circle, and the Expanding Circle. The boundaries roughly correspond
to the ENL, ESL and EFL categories of the previous model: ENL speakers are found
in the Inner Circle, ESL speakers in the Outer Circle, and EFL speakers in the
Expanding circle. Kachru has defined the Inner Circle as being “norm-providing”, the
Outer Circle as being “norm-developing” and the Expanding Circle as being “norm3

dependent”. Jenkins (2009) argues that even this model is overly simplistic and reflects
a historical perspective rather than a current reality. Additionally, the boundaries
between the circles cannot be clearly defined.
Other models, such as McArthur’s (1987) Circle of World English and Modiano’s
(1999) English as an international language (EIL) place International English at the
centre. In McArthur’s model, it is Standard World English, a (yet) undefined variety
emerging from the interplay of all the localised varieties of English surrounding it,
both ones traditionally considered native varieties as well as those considered nonnative. In Modiano’s revised model, the centre is English as an International Language,
defined as the core linguistic features comprehensible to most native and proficient
non-native speakers. Outside this core is a band of features that are potentially on their
way to becoming core features. On the edges of the model are five groups: American
English, British English, Major Varieties, Other Varieties, and Foreign Language
Speakers. While this model gives the most comprehensive picture of the globalisation
of English and the extent to which it is used as a Lingua Franca even between speakers
not classified as native speakers, defining the five groups on the edges and whether a
variety is a major one or not is not entirely straightforward, as Jenkins (2009) observes.
Additionally it must be noted that all of the aforementioned models are already
somewhat dated, as they were created in the pre-internet era and therefore do not
account for the widespread use of and exposure to English present in many contexts
today. Nonetheless, these models continue to be regularly used and referred to in
research.
An issue that is the subject of much discussion is whether the global dominance
of English is a new form of imperialism, an intentionally deployed machine carrying
with it the culture and mode of thought of its original homeland and threatening the
existence of other languages and cultures, or whether it is a purely instrumental tool
for facilitating global communication and deepening international cooperation,
independent of its roots. Kayman’s article “The state of English as a global language:
communicating culture” (2004) deals precisely with this question. He argues that
although the current global use of English may be free from its cultural and
imperialistic heritage, it is by no means devoid of culture per se, and the ‘triumph’ of
the English language is the result of a series of intentional factors, such as the extensive
imperial operations of the British Empire, USA-driven Cold War politics, and the
creation of English teaching specialists by the British Council as part of their post-war
4

educational aid strategy in Europe and their former colonies. Additionally, the
highlighting of the use of English for communicative purposes, and the widespread
dissemination of the principles of ‘effective communication’ is, in itself, an ideological
choice. Kayman (2004:18) concludes that “[w]hat is being packaged as ‘Global
English’ is, in sum [...], a utopia of communication in which ‘English’ becomes the
very image of a desire for global networks where informational and symbolic messages
flow without resistance across frontiers”.
Specifically relevant to this study is pondering upon South Korea’s and Finland’s
position within the world of World Englishes, and to what extent they are comparable
contexts in regard to English presence within them, and attitudes towards English. In
chapter 3, both contexts will be presented and compared. For the sake of clarity, the
models of World Englishes this study will refer to are the ENL/ESL/EFL trichotomy
as well Kachru’s model of the three circles of World Englishes, although it is evident
they are inadequate tools to capture the whole complexity of the relationship contexts
such as South Korea and Finland have with the English language, and do not account
for the differences between the conceptualisations of English in Korea and Finland.
2.2. Immersion as a language acquisition method and the role of the native
speaker in EFL education
The second main focus of this thesis is native English-speaking teachers (henceforth
NESTs). Teachers who can be classified as native speakers have traditionally been
favoured as (foreign) language teachers over teachers with another first language, and
even over bi/multilingual teachers. This preference for a native speaker is closely
linked to the Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) method, which emphasises
the acquisition of communicative proficiency as the main goal of L2 teaching. An
implicit tenet of CLT has been that native speakers are ideal for “promoting natural
and spontaneous communication” (Llurda 2009:8), which is an integral part of CLT.
This kind of approach to L2 language teaching generally involves using the target
language as the primary or sole language of instruction. However, whether it actually
is preferable to teach a foreign or second language entirely through the target language
is a matter of dispute (Kostková, 2006; Jeon, 2009, Macaro & Lee, 2013) and whether
native speakers are inherently better teachers than non-native speakers is also doubtful
(Chun, 2014; Jeon, 2009; Schenck, 2018).
5

Through an oral test and experimental lessons taught in English, Kostková (2006)
compared the English communicative competence of two groups of Czech beginnerlevel English learners in the third grade of which one group was taught through English
and the other primarily through Czech (although neither were taught by NESTs). She
found that those who were taught through the L1 performed better on the oral test
whereas those taught through the L2 were better able to follow target language
instruction. Furthermore, Macaro & Lee (2013) conducted a study on Korean sixthgrade elementary and university students’ opinions on native speaking vs. non-native
speaking EFL teachers as well as on English only instruction. The results indicated
there was no clear preference for either teacher type over the other, although university
students were more positively inclined overall towards native-speaking teachers than
elementary students. In regard to English-only instruction, neither group was
particularly in its favour but the older learners were more aware of the benefits of
instruction in the target language, whereas young learners were likely to find Englishonly instruction challenging to follow and comprehend. In addition, the majority of
participants from both groups worried about not being able to comprehend everything
in English-only instructions. Interestingly, advocates of teaching young learners
entirely through the target language stress the importance of non-verbal
communication to support the verbal instruction and claim children are competent at
extracting meaning without fully understanding the received input (Willis, 1991 &
Halliwell, 1992 in Kostková, 2006).
Chun (2014) and Schenck (2018) observe that the lack of educational requirements
for hiring native speakers as EFL teachers is controversial since they are often not
required to have any teaching qualifications. Schenck (2018:3) goes as far as to state
that “NESTs without proper training or understanding of the local culture may not be
effective, severely impacting linguistic development of the learner.” Nonetheless,
Chun’s (2014) study on Korean university-level EFL learners’ perceptions of native
vs. non-native English-speaking teachers’ strengths and weaknesses show that NESTs
may be better equipped to prepare learners for real-life interaction with native
speakers, are more likely to use a variety of teaching methods, have a superior
command of English, are able to provide cultural context to the usage of English, and
teach reading skills more effectively, perhaps due to the aforementioned cultural
awareness. In contrast, the advantages of non-native English-speaking teachers
(NNESTs) were that they were perceived as being better prepared for lessons, more
6

suitable for teaching writing, listening, grammar and preparing students for tests, as
well as being more sensitive towards challenges (Korean) EFL learners face.
2.3. Exposure to and attitudes concerning non-native varieties of English
It is also relevant to examine EFL students’ and teachers’ attitudes towards nonnative or traditionally stigmatised L1 varieties of English, both their own local
varieties and varieties of other English users, as well as their exposure to them in their
EFL education. Another question related to this is whether students and teachers see
an idealised native speaker as the model for English learning or whether they see
English first and foremost as a tool for global interaction and co-operation, often with
other EFL or L2 users.
Ranta (2010) conducted a study on Finnish upper-secondary students’ and
teachers’ awareness on the global role of English. More specifically, they were asked
about their attitudes towards native and non-native speakers of English and whether
they themselves imitated a native variety. They were also questioned on the
proportions in which native and non-native speakers of English were featured in their
EFL classes. The study found that most students and younger teachers were well aware
of the significance of ELF (English as a lingua franca). The students indicated they
mostly used English with other non-native speakers and the majority also reported not
imitating any particular native variety. However, they felt the education emphasised
British and American English disproportionately. The interviewed teachers, on the
other hand, all reported emulating either British (85%) or American English (15%) in
their speech and writing. Simultaneously, they also tended to use English either more
with non-native speakers or equally with native and non-native speakers, and they also
expected their students to use English more with non-native speakers in the future.
When it came to the actual content of their instruction, the majority reported that
other native varieties besides British English and American English

came up

occasionally, but the representation of non-native varieties was somewhat less
frequent. A slight majority considered native speakers a suitable point of comparison
when evaluating their students’ language production. A majority saw the testing
system, specifically the matriculation examination as limiting their teaching and not
testing skills relevant for the use of English in the ‘real’ world. Both students and
teachers felt there was a discrepancy between the English present in EFL teaching and
7

the English encountered outside the classroom (Ranta, 2010). English was clearly seen
in an instrumental light by the participants in this study, especially by the students.
Simultaneously, the education system was perceived as emphasising traditional ENL
varieties to a disproportionate and irrelevant extent.
Ahn and Kang (2016) studied Korean university students’ attitudes towards
different varieties of English, both native and non-native. They were asked to rate four
samples of spoken English, one with a Korean, one with an Italian, one with an Indian,
and one with a European-American speaker across four criteria: speech quality, level
of understandability, traits of the speaker, and the students’ desire to communicate
with the speaker. Overall, the Korean and American speaker were rated higher on
speech quality, level of understanding, and traits of the speaker than the Italian and
Indian speaker. However, all four were rated similarly regarding desire to
communicate with them. Several students pointed out their desire to learn more about
other varieties of English, and their general attitudes towards Korean English were also
positive. Simultaneously, many expressed feeling a need to learn English from a native
speaker, particularly a native speaker of American English (Ahn & Kang, 2016). Based
on this study, it would appear that ENL speakers are frequently constructed as model
speakers of English in Korean EFL education. However, it seems to primarily be
speakers of standard American English that are perceived in this light, rather than all
speakers from ENL countries, as for instance a speaker of Irish English was not
identified by the students as a native speaker in Ahn and Kang’s study.
Namgung (2016) compared the representation of different cultural backgrounds in
Finnish and Korean EFL textbooks for upper-secondary and high school students,
respectively. He examined four books in total, two from one Finnish and two from one
Korean series, and found that in the studied examples the Finnish textbooks
emphasised English-speaking culture much more than the Korean ones. Out of a total
of 24 instances in the Finnish textbooks, 13 dealt with English-speaking culture and
only one with non-English-speaking culture (the rest were related to general culture,
contrast culture, or Finnish culture). Conversely, the Korean textbooks only contained
one instance of English-speaking culture out of a total of 16. Out of the remaining
instances, 12 were related to general culture, two to non-English-speaking culture, and
one to Korean culture. This finding corresponds to the report in Ranta (2010) of a
traditionally heavy emphasis on British and American English in the Finnish uppersecondary school curriculum, but does not indicate a similar emphasis in Korean
8

textbooks regarding English-language culture, despite the seeming linguistic
prevalence of American English hinted at in Ahn & Kang (2016); and discussed in
chapter 6.3.

3. History and current status of English in South Korea

3.1. English education and proficiency in South Korea
English was first taught as a foreign language on the Korean peninsula in the late 19th
century (Jeong, 2004), and it is currently a compulsory subject for all from 3rd grade
elementary school to the end of high school. It is also one of the mandatory subjects
on the national scholastic aptitude test (SAT) high school students take. Since scores
for this test largely determine entry to universities in Korea and getting accepted into
a prestigious university is generally highly valued (Kim, 2020), the EFL education in
Korean high schools is inevitably influenced by the format of the English SAT, a
phenomenon known as ‘washback’ (e.g. Namgung, 2016). In fact, Namgung (2016)
noticed in his comparative study of Korean high school and Finnish upper-secondary
school English textbooks that the listening, reading, speaking, and writing tasks in the
Koreans textbooks were short and numerous, corresponding thus to the format of the
SAT. Additionally, national testing plays a big part in the Korean education system,
with students obliged to participate in national standardised tests at least four times a
year. At the university level, getting a good score on an international proficiency test
such as Test Of English for International Communication (henceforth TOEIC) or The
Test of English as a Foreign Language (henceforth TOEFL) may be important for
career opportunities, as many jobs require applicants to meet a certain score on one of
these tests in order to be accepted (Kim, 2020).
A phenomenon currently prevalent in EFL education in Korea is the so-called
“English fever”, an almost obsessive fervour to become highly proficient in the
language, which is fuelled by the highly competitive society in both education and the
labour market in addition to the both real and imagined demands brought on by the
growing use of English internationally (e.g. Jeon, 2009; Jeong, 2004).This English
fever is exemplified by the significant financial investments both the Korean
government and Korean parents put into English education. For instance, the Korean
government spent a total of 15 trillion won (c.15 billion USD) on English education in
2005 (Park, 2009) whereas Korean parents spend an average of 20 trillion won (c.20
billion USD) on supplementary education for their children, of which English
10

education often forms a large part (Kang, 2012). Furthermore, although English is
taught as a compulsory subject in all Korean schools from third grade elementary, only
23,8% of the money spent on English education comes from school tuition costs
whereas private tuition and hagwons (private educational institute) cover 73%,
according to Lawrence (2012). Sending children abroad to an English-speaking
country is also a common strategy (Lawrence, 2012; Park, 2009) and sometimes the
mother will move abroad with the children while the father stays behind to work in
Korea (Kim, 2015 in Schenck, 2018).
Joseph Sung-Yul Park (henceforth Park SY, 2009) lists some reasons why
parents choose to invest in these additional measures to acquire English: a distrust in
the Korean education system at large, considering the amount of English instruction at
schools inadequate, and a fear that other children will get ahead of their own in learning
English. There is also a commonly held belief in Korea that all Koreans are
incompetent at English and are incapable of acquiring ‘good enough’ English unless
they devote great time and effort to learning it, preferably through immersion. This is
something Park SY (2009) deals with at length, and some of his findings about
ideologies related to English in Korea will be dealt with later, in chapter 3.2. It is
notable that despite these numerous efforts to achieve high levels of proficiency in
English, Korean students are nowhere near the top in international assessment tools
such as TOEFL (Schenck, 2018), with their speaking proficiency being especially
weak (Kim, 2020). According to the 2020 English Proficiency Index by Education
First, which measures the English proficiency of volunteers from various age groups
through an online proficiency test, South Korea ranked 32nd out of 100 countries 1
(Education First, 2020).
The current landscape of English education in South Korea can be traced to
1995 when the focus in the new National Curriculum was shifted to emphasise
communicative skills and fluency more heavily (Shin, 2007 in Jeon, 2009) in contrast
to the previous preference for grammar. The reforms did not end here; in 1997 English
language teaching was set to begin three years earlier than previously, in the third year
of elementary school (Jung & Norton, 2002 & Park, 2004 in Jeon, 2009), and the
Korean Ministry of Education adopted a policy in 2001 for English to be the sole
language of instruction in the teaching of English (Kang, 2012).
1

It should be noted that the English Proficiency Index is based on results from tests taken by
volunteers, and therefore may not accurately reflect true proficiency levels in any given country.

11

However, the success of this policy of teaching English through English
(TETE) has been limited due to reasons including teachers’ lack of English
proficiency, students’ inability to understand instruction and the impact these factors
have on the ability to keep to schedule in coursework (Macaro & Lee, 2013; Shin,
2012) and the policy was modified to encourage teachers to be flexible in regard to
TETE in 2010 (Macaro & Lee, 2013). Furthermore, the “Five Year Plan for English
Education Revitalization” was introduced in 2005; the aim of which was to employ
one native-speaking English teacher in every middle school in the county by 2010 and
encourage elementary and high schools to likewise hire a native speaker (Jeon & Lee,
2006 in Jeon, 2009).
Closely related to these government-driven policies is the English Program in
Korea (EPIK), first introduced in 1995. The program essentially recruits native
speakers of English who are citizens of any of the following seven countries: the UK,
Ireland, the USA, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The only
additional requirements are that they possess a bachelor’s degree, a good command of
English (residence in one of the aforementioned countries for at least 10 years, began
learning English from the first year of middle school at the latest), good physical and
mental wellbeing, and willingness to adapt to life in Korea. These teachers are
generally hired for at least one year at a time (Jeon, 2009).
3.2. Roles and functions of English for Koreans
In his book The Local Construction of a Global Language : Ideologies of English in
South Korea (2009) Joseph Sung-Yul Park outlines the most prevalent ideologies
concerning English and its presence in Korea and examines how they are propagated
through official political debates on the status of English as well as through humour,
television programs, and face-to-face interactions between Koreans. Park observes that
although Korea has traditionally been viewed, and viewed itself, as a monolingual and
homogenous society, “English has permeated many aspects of Koreans’ lives as a
symbol and vehicle for globally circulated cultural forms and ideas” (Park SY,
2009:30) and goes on to note the noticeable presence of English in media and pop
culture; not only in the form of foreign English-language products but also in locally
produced ones. For instance, he mentions one study by Lee (2006), which found that
80% of all studied weekend primetime television commercials used some form of
12

English. English also has a strong presence in the physical linguistic landscape of
Korea in the form of shop names, signs etc. Additionally, many major corporations
have adopted English or Romanised names, and English is an important linguistic
resource for Korean pop music, which frequently features inserted English words or
even full phrases into the otherwise Korean lyrics (Park SY, 2009), and, more recently,
releasing full songs or even albums in English has become more commonplace.
Namgung (2016:28) also emphasises the presence of English mass media in Korea:
Korean[s] [...] can have many chances to get in touch with English programs
through the internet, cable TV, etc. There are a variety of English broadcasting
programs in Korea including news programs, documentaries, English dramas
and pop song channels. These programs are normally broadcast in English or
with Korean subtitles without dubbing but public TV programs such as KBS,
MBC and SBS mostly provide dubbed programs (Kim, 2008). Korean[s] [...]
can have enough English input through the mass media [..].
One medium that has recently been studied a lot in regard to language learning
is electronic and online gaming. Jeon’s (2015) doctoral thesis The impact of playing a
transnational on-line game on Korean EFL learners’ L2 identity and their offline
learning dispositions interviewed ten young Korean adults on their experiences
communicating in English while playing on the North American server of the popular
game League of Legends (LOL). The interviewees reported various positive effects,
such as gaining a deeper understanding for the global use of English and realising that
English is not only the property of native speakers. They also realised that
communicating intelligibly and efficiently was more important than linguistic
accuracy, and they became more accepting of their own difficulties and mistakes. This
influence on their English-related ideologies, as well as the new-found positive
associations with English due to connecting it with success in playing LOL made them
more confident and motivated to use English both in online and offline contexts. One
of the interviewees commented:
I’m not embarrassed because there are people from various countries whose
English is also not perfect. Actually, nobody cares about English competence as
long as they can communicate [...] I’ve met people from Russia, Thailand, and
other countries, but we can all communicate in English. In that way, English isn’t
America’s language (Jeon, 2015:126)
The interviewees agreed that using English while gaming had improved their
pragmatic competence in English, and that they had learned various colloquial
expressions and words that made their English more ‘natural-sounding’. Many also
13

reported having previously seen learning English as a chore, as something they were
forced to study and become perfect in. Through using English while playing LOL, they
felt they were able to develop their skills without external pressure and judgement from
others. Ultimately, Jeon’s (2015) study demonstrates the positive effect games can
have on foreign language learning. However, although gaming is highly popular in
Korea, most international games get translated into Korean, and so Korean students do
not necessarily have any incentive to use English while playing games (Namgung,
2016).
Park SY (2009) found three main ideologies dominating the official discussion
as well as the informal representations of attitudes towards English in Korea: the
ideology of necessitation (that English, due to its global status and promise of upward
social mobility, is a necessary language to acquire), the ideology of externalisation
(that English is an intrinsically foreign language and mode of thought which
potentially poses a threat to the Korean language and culture), and the ideology of selfdeprecation (that Koreans are all bad at English). This third ideology of selfdeprecation was especially prevalent not only in the analysis of the official discussion
of English but also in the instances found in humour, television programs, and faceto-face interactions. He maintains that “Koreans’ anxiety over English is not a mere
psychological reﬂex of inadequate English skills, but a socially constructed part of the
habitus that is inculcated in the speaker through socially-situated constraints of
metalinguistic discourse” (Park SY, 2009:231).
Although some outsiders might reduce this as mere stereotypical Asian ‘shyness’
and ‘modesty’, something some of the participants in my own study also appeared to
gravitate towards when bringing up their students’ unwillingness to speak English in
class, Park SY (2009) disproves this by contrasting the behaviour of a group of Korean
students while practicing English and practicing Japanese. While the practice of
English was coupled with noticeable hesitance to engage in displaying English skills
and frequent negative assessment of their own English competence, no such features
were present when the same students were engaging in producing Japanese. In fact,
the students displayed relaxed and confident attitudes while using their Japanese skills,
despite their skills in Japanese being relatively rudimentary. While the numerous
typological similarities between Korean and Japanese could well be a factor, it seems
there are also ideological factors at play here. Park SY (2009:210) summarises that
“the way Japanese is conceived by Koreans is exactly opposite to the way English is:
14

Japanese is considered to be unimportant but easy, English is considered to be
important but difﬁcult.”
He furthermore argues that the simultaneous ideological construction of English
as an indispensably important language and of Koreans as never able to achieve
‘sufficient’ English skills leads to a fetishism of English in Korea and is an important
factor behind the previously discussed English fever. It also erases differences in
English skills between Koreans and the fact that many Koreans are, in fact, highly
proficient in English. Additionally, it reinforces the dominance of English and of the
native speaker of English. This is problematic for various reasons, one of them being
that it can serve as a justification for inequality both within Korea, where those with
the sufficient resources to spend on learning English are more likely to attain the
desired skills and the privilege attached to it, as well as inequality Korea may face on
a global level. Furthermore, if this pattern is not unique to Korea, it
may lead to a naturalization of the ideological mapping of globalization onto the
linguistic market structured around hegemonic notions of linguistic ownership,
preventing an imagination of an alternative global order in which linguistic and
economic balance and sustainability may prevail (Park SY, 2009:229).
It is interesting to observe that some of the ideologies and assumptions identified
in the Korean portion of the interview data of this study correlate with Park SY’s
(2009) ideas, as will be shown in the coming chapters. The general consensus was that
Korean students tend to be hesitant or not appear confident in using English, and three
out of the five interviewees admitted they found their students’ English skills lower
than they had anticipated. The English proficiency of Korean students was also heavily
defined according to Anglo-American ideals concerning language use, e.g. valuing
spontaneous and informal communicative proficiency and the ability to engage in
small talk and the assumption that language production should conform to AngloAmerican standards regarding form and pronunciation. It appears based on the
interview data that some of these attitudes are quite imbedded in Korean EFL
education at large and are not solely propagated by NESTs within it, but are enforced
from higher up. On the other hand, Korean EFL education also continues to prioritise
skills traditionally valued within Korean education and society at large, such as high
performance on tests measuring comprehension and memorisation of the subject.
Thus, there appear to be somewhat conflicting ideologies present in the current
landscape of Korean EFL education, making the role of NESTs within it a relevant
15

topic of research. Finally, it is noteworthy that the discussed attitudes regarding
students’ verbal English use (or lack of it) were also somewhat present in the Finnish
interview data, despite a in many ways different EFL educational climate and history
of English presence in Finland, as will be discussed next.

16

4. History and current status of English in Finland

4.1. English education and proficiency in Finland
English was first introduced into the Finnish education system as a core subject in
secondary schools for girls in 1918, shortly after Finland gained independence from
Russia (Leppänen et.al, 2011). However, before the 1940s, only a minority of children
studied foreign languages at all, as they were mostly taught only in grammar schools,
and especially in pre-Second World War Finland, Latin and/or German were generally
preferred to English. From the mid-1940s onward, the presence of English in Finland
slowly began to rise. This can be attributed to a variety of factors. Firstly, English was
the language of two of the most prominent victors of the Second World War and
therefore more attractive than the language of the defeated Germans, a language that
had previously been considered more important for Finns to learn. Secondly, English
was the rising language of international business and communication and Finland was
becoming increasingly involved internationally. Thirdly, the infiltration of AngloAmerican popular culture, such as movies, music and fashion into Finnish society
meant Finns became increasingly familiar with the language (Jaatinen & Saarivirta,
2014; Leppänen et.al, 2011). As a result, more and more schools began to offer English
as a subject, and by the late 1960s, it had become the most popular foreign language
to study. In 1970, the Finnish education system was reformed and the comprehensive
schooling system was introduced. This meant that all children were to study their own
mother tongue (Finnish or Swedish), the other official language (Finnish or Swedish),
and one foreign language. Although technically the choice of foreign language has
always been free, English remains the most commonly provided, as well as
overwhelmingly the most popular foreign language to study (91% of all 3rd grade
primary students studied it as their 1st foreign language in 2008).
Currently, the teaching of the first foreign language begins officially in the 3rd
grade of primary school, but the newest national core curriculum does mandate the
introduction of an A1 language (which can be a foreign language or the second national
language) in grades 1-2 through games, songs and dynamic activities (Finnish National
Agency for Education, 2014). Unlike in Korea, English is not a mandatory subject in
17

the matriculation examination required by students to take in order to complete uppersecondary school, which may put less pressure on students in learning English.
Nonetheless, Finns are known to do well in international rankings of English skills;
for instance, in the international English Proficiency Index from 2020 by Education
First, Finland ranked 3rd out of a 100 countries (Education First, 2020), with South
Korea taking 32nd place in the same index. Interestingly, according to Kim (2020),
official TOEFL results show that Finnish and Korean students’ skills in listening,
writing, and reading are of a similar level, but Finnish students clearly outperform their
Korean peers when it comes to speaking. One factor in the education system
influencing this difference in communicative proficiency might be the higher number
of vocabulary items and longer sentences featured in Finnish EFL textbooks and the
fact that Finnish textbooks use more authentic English texts, such as literary works and
movie scripts (Kim, 2020; Namgung, 2016). Additionally, communication practice
activities in the Finnish textbooks were found to encourage more organic production
of English than the Korean ones in Kim’s (2020) study.
The results of Leppänen et.al’s (2011) survey on the uses and meanings of
English and attitudes towards the language in Finland, with 1 495 participants, indicate
that almost 70% of all respondents felt they had mastered English at least moderately
in 2007; the number would doubtless be higher today, especially considering that out
of the two younger groups, the 15-24-year-olds and the 25-44-year olds, 54-72%,
depending on the skill, rated their proficiency in reading, understanding, writing, and
speaking English as fluent or fairly fluent. Conversely, the corresponding figure for
the oldest age group, the 65-79-year-olds, was a mere 7-10%, with 55-62% indicating
their proficiency level in a particular skill was only a few words or no proficiency at
all. In general, the proficiency levels were the highest in urban Finland, among the
well-educated, and among those occupying managerial or expert positions.
4.2. Roles and functions of English for Finns
According to a traditional model such as Kachru’s (1988) model of the three circles of
World Englishes, Finland, like South Korea, would generally be placed by default into
the third Expanding Circle, or be classified as an EFL country, since the number of
people who identify as native speakers of English has always been low, and English
has never occupied the position of official language nor, at least traditionally, of one
18

used extensively in the public sphere in lieu of other languages (Leppänen et.al, 2011).
Nonetheless, it is nowadays relatively easy to find English versions of official
documents in Finland, suggesting a belief that there is a demand for English in the
Finnish public sphere, albeit mainly among non-Finnish residents. Moreover,
Leppänen (2007:149) advances the idea that “Finland is no one expanding circle, but
rather a series of overlapping circles in which English manifests itself and spreads in
distinctive ways”, as the English language is employed in a variety of contexts for
different purposes; for instance, as an additional linguistic and cultural resource in
youth subcultures, as a lingua franca in transnational corporations, and as a means of
intracultural communication in educational classes or programs taught in English.
Overall, Leppänen et.al (2011:17) argue that despite Finland’s multilingual
identity,
the linguistic foundation of the country has largely been monolingualism. The
majority of Finnish-speaking Finns have been able to manage by using only
their first language in all areas of life, and most Swedish-speaking Finns are
proficient in Finnish, too. Hence, unlike the situation in many other bi/
multilingual countries where different linguistic groups have needed a
vehicular language to communicate with one another and to participate fully in
society, Finnish-speaking and Swedish-speaking Finns have had no need for
such an additional language.
Although Leppänen et.al’s (2011) statement on the Finnish proficiency levels of
Swedish-speaking Finns may be slightly overestimated, and, on occasion, English may
be used as a lingua franca in communication between speakers of Swedish and Finnish
in Finland, it cannot be considered the primary function of English for Finns in
Finland. Regarding the supposed monolingualism of Finns, the survey results in
Leppänen et.al. (2011) indicate that in 2007, 83,8% of all the participants saw
themselves as monolingual, with the proportion increasing among the older, more
rural, and less educated respondents. Additionally, 98% had received their basic
education in their mother tongue. Nevertheless, 90% had studied some foreign
language during their life, with English as the most commonly studied language.
English was also the foreign language the participants used the most, especially while
travelling and as part of their work, as well as the foreign language most commonly
encountered in the environment.
In Leppänen et.al’s (2011) survey the participants were presented with a
number of statements regarding the importance of English in Finland and were asked
to respond to them on a five-point scale (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly
19

disagree, or no opinion). The majority agreed that young people and people of working
age must know English, that English is more useful than Swedish, that Finns traveling
abroad must know English, that social services must be offered in English, and a small
majority agreed that English enriches Finland’s native languages. On the other hand,
the majority also maintained that the mother tongue is still more useful than English,
and that Finns must know other languages in addition to English. A small majority
disagreed with the statement that Finns can be international without knowing English,
and that it is important for the development of a multicultural society that everybody
should be able to speak English. Additionally, the majority disagreed with the
statements “all companies in Finland must offer services also in English”, “English
skills are overrated”, “elderly people must know English”, “the spread of English in
Finland is a threat to our own languages” and “the spread of English in Finland is a
threat to Finnish culture”. On the whole, the younger participants exhibited more
positive views towards the importance of English in Finnish society and were more
likely to feel it is important for everyone to know English. Also, the importance of
knowing and offering services in English and other foreign languages was more
emphasised among participants living in cities, as well as the more highly educated.
When asked in what context they use English the most, only 9,4% stated they
never used English. 51,5% used English the most in their free time, followed by those
who used it most at work, 26,8%. 12,3% of the participants used English the most at
school, these respondents mainly belonging to the youngest age group (15-24). When
asked how often they consumed English-language media, 88% indicated they watched
subtitled films or television programs at least once a week, and 85% that they listened
to music in English at least once a week. The proportion of respondents who watched
films or television programs without subtitles at least once a week was 24,5%, whereas
only 9,1% listened to English radio programs on a weekly basis. When it came to
reading in English, 56,4% read web pages in English at least once a month, making it
the most commonly read format in English. English-language manuals and emails
were read monthly by almost 50%, while books, newspapers, magazines, and comics
were read monthly in English by around 10-30%. Writing in English was less common
than reading, with only 25,6% writing emails in English monthly (this being the most
commonly chosen category). When asked about how often they speak English in their
free time and for what purpose/with whom, 15,5-24,6% of the participants indicated
speaking English in their free time at least once a month, depending on the audience
20

and reason. The most frequently chosen situation for speaking English was when
expressing negative emotions, which emerged as slightly more common than using
English for expressing positive emotions. In regard to audience, it was unsurprisingly
most common to speak English with non-Finnish/Swedish-speaking friends, followed
by speaking it with tourists in Finland. Speaking English with fellow Finnish/Swedishspeaking friends was the least commonly chosen option. All in all, listening to Englishlanguage content was clearly more frequent than reading, and both passive forms of
English use were more frequent than active production of the language.
This shows that already in 2007, many teenagers and young adults regarded
English as a supplementary linguistic and cultural resource useful for personal
expression and consolidating peer solidarity. Leppänen’s (2007) article examined in
closer detail examples of the use of English within four Finnish youthscapes: game
talk, hip-hop lyrics, fan fiction, and weblogs. In her example of game talk, Leppänen
(2007) observed that English was used through intersentential code switching, with
many of English lexical items taken straight from the game. However, English words
and phrases were also used to indicate shifting alignments with the game activity; for
instance, English was used more when the players were speaking as their game
character. In the example of Finnish hip-hop lyrics, the English elements were
individual words and phrases imbedded in a Finnish syntactic framework. The English
used came from English hip-hop discourse and other studies on hip-hop scenes in other
non-English-speaking countries show similar patterns of usage (Leppänen, 2007).
The example of fan fiction studied was a Finnish fan fiction based on the
American tv series The Invisible Man. It was written as a bilingual text with the
dialogues involving the characters of the series in English, and the rest of the text in
Finnish. It was published on a Finnish fan fiction site, implying that the writer expected
their audience to have sufficient proficiency in English to read it. A similar
presupposition seems to have been present in the final example of a weblog post,
written almost entirely in English although posted on a Finnish blog site, with only a
few individual words and first names in Finnish. Leppänen (2007) argues that this final
example could be interpreted as a case of language shift, because the writer could have
just as well chosen to write entirely in Finnish. Ultimately however, Leppänen (2007)
does not believe that these examples indicate English is threatening Finnish. Rather,
English has been adopted as a communicative resource in specific contexts and for
purposes such as self-expression, global reach, and, as in the case of the Invisible Man
21

fan fiction, as a contextual tool to help the reader distinguish between the ‘real’ world
and the world inside the series. The Finnish youths’ use of English is often
characterised by appropriation and playful creativity. Based on personal observation,
this appears to be the case among young people in Korea as well.
4.3. Comparison of South Korea and Finland as EFL contexts
It appears that both South Korea and Finland constructed their identity as relatively
homogenous, and the citizens generally considered themselves to be monolingual at
the end of the first decade of the 21st century. Simultaneously, the importance of
acquiring English skills in order to maintain relevancy and co-operation globally has
been recognised in both contexts by both decision-makers and the general public. Both
Koreans and Finns, especially the younger generation(s), are routinely exposed to
English in educational, professional and informal contexts, and English is used as an
additional linguistic resource in areas such as pop culture (Leppänen, 2007; Park SY,
2009). High English competence is associated with youth, modernity and a privileged
socio-economic and educational background. Nevertheless, there are concerns about
English jeopardising the stability and vitality of the local languages in both countries
(Park SY, 2009; Sánchez & Tuomainen, 2014). Within the education system, both
countries officially emphasise the CLT approach in the classroom (Kim, 2020), but the
implementation of CLT is somewhat limited by the emphasis on written proficiency
and passive competence in the SAT and matriculation exams. For instance, the Finnish
textbooks studied by Namgung (2016) included translation assignments which are not
generally considered concomitant with the goals of CLT. However, English
matriculation exams in Finland include various translation assignments (Ranta, 2010;
Yle, 2021), which no doubt influences the inclusion of them in the textbooks.
There are nevertheless a few differences. No evidence of a widespread
ideology of self-deprecation regarding English skills can be identified in the
contemporary Finnish context. This could be due to a number of reasons. Firstly,
English has been taught at the primary school level since 1970 in Finland since the
comprehensive schooling system was implemented, whereas English education began
in the first grade of middle school in Korea up until 1997. Secondly, while both
countries favour subtitling foreign-language films and tv content over dubbing,
Korea’s public broadcasting channels dub all foreign-language content (Namgung,
22

2016), whereas Finnish broadcasters only dub children’s and animated shows. Thirdly,
South Korea is a country with a population of 51.78 million (Statistics Korea, 2019),
whereas Finland’s population of 5,538,350 in 2021 is barely more than a tenth of that
number. Thereby, the market for Korean-language products is larger, and for instance
games are more readily translated into Korean (see Namgung 2016 in chapter 3.2.).
Fourthly, there may be geographic and historical factors at play. English has been used
since the mid- 20th century as a medium for inter-European co-operation among
countries where English is not the main L1, and there has been talk in recent years
among scholars of ‘Euro English’, a variety of English that has developed through
interaction across linguistic borders within the European Union. On the other hand,
Korea’s relationship with English has been more heavily defined historically in terms
of interaction with an ENL nation, namely the USA. Moreover, Finland has a longer
history of established multilingualism and has two official languages (Finnish and
Swedish), which may make the society more open to adopting yet another language.
Ultimately, the more long-standing and arguably more pervasive presence of English
in Finland, coupled with the absence of a widespread and strong belief of
incompetence, may be additional factors raising especially the communicative
proficiency of Finns vis-à-vis their Korean counterparts, in addition to educational
factors mentioned in chapter 4.2, especially the higher degree of competitiveness and
focus on testing in the Korean education system. This phenomenon is also more
prevalent in the Korean society at large, and may be at least partially connected to the
more hierarchical societal structure. Korean students are likely to experience greater
pressure from the education system, parents and other superiors to acquire high
proficiency in English than Finnish students, and this can backfire especially in the
case of less academically successful individuals.
It is moreover interesting to compare the difference in attitudes between
learning and speaking Japanese versus English in Korea and between learning and
speaking Swedish versus English in Finland. According to Park SY (2009:210)
“Japanese is considered to be unimportant but easy, English is considered to be
important but difﬁcult” by Koreans, leading them to feel more confident and
enthusiastic about using Japanese, but feeling more obligated to master English. In
Finland on the other hand (for Finnish speakers), English is often considered important
and easy whereas Swedish is considered an unimportant and difficult, yet obligatory
language to learn, leading many Finnish-speaking students to be quite reluctant and
23

unmotivated to learn Swedish. English is generally viewed as not only a more useful
but also more attractive language to master. It is hard to determine what exactly might
be the causes of these differences in attitudes – one plausible cause could be the degree
to which learners feel they are ‘forced’ to learn a language, as Japanese is not a
nationally obligatory subject to learn in Korea, unlike English. Conversely, English is
not technically an obligatory language to learn in Finland (although in practice almost
all students learn it) whereas Swedish is, for all Finnish speakers from 1st grade lowersecondary at the latest. Further research on student attitudes towards learning and using
different languages in South Korea and Finland could potentially provide further
insight into this topic.

5. Presentation of the two case studies

5.1. Collection of data and analysis of methods used
In order to get a more in-depth picture of the experiences and thoughts of actual NESTs
teaching in Korea and Finland as well as into the differences and similarities between
these two EFL contexts and English education landscapes, two case studies were
conducted, one in Korea and the other in Finland. The research questions motivating
the comparative study are the following:
1. What attitudes and experiences do NESTs in Korea and Finland have regarding
Korean/Finnish EFL education, the English proficiency of their students and how their
students should learn English, the global presence of English, and their role as NESTs?
2. In what respects are the attitudes displayed and experiences related similar between
the Korean and the Finnish contexts, and in what respects are they different? What do
these similarities and differences reveal about EFL education and the presence of
English in these two countries?
Both studies were conducted in the format of semi-structured interviews which
were audio recorded and transcribed. A total of five interviewees teaching in the
Gyeonggi-do province participated in the Korean study, and each participant was
interviewed once in person during the spring of 2019, with four of the participants
being interviewed in pairs while one was interviewed individually. Although
interviewing in pairs was a convenient and time-efficient method, some degree of the
participants influencing each other’s statements was evident in the interview data.
They answered a total of 12 sets of questions related to various aspects and potential
challenges of teaching English as a foreign language in Korea as native-speaking
teachers. These included questions on their expectations and impressions of their
students’ levels of proficiency, common challenges and errors they noticed in Korean
EFL learners’ English, the form and varieties of English emphasised in both their own
teaching as well as in South Korea at large, attitudes towards Konglish and the
Koreanised use of English, overall thoughts on the English education system in Korea,
and on teaching English through English. As the purpose was not only to compare the
South Korean and Finnish contexts with each other but also see how comparable the
25

experiences and attitudes were between NESTs teaching in different types of
institutions and with different backgrounds within each respective country, the
interview participants were intentionally chosen to represent a variety of teaching
institutions and levels of experience.
The six participants in the Finnish study, who had all taught or were teaching
in South-Western Finland, were interviewed once individually during the summer and
autumn of 2020 via online calls on Zoom. One of them answered a total of 11 sets of
questions, which were identical to the ones asked in the Korean interviews, with the
exception of the question regarding Konglish. For the remaining five participants, the
question regarding Konglish and the Koreanised use of English was modified to
enquire about attitudes concerning Anglicisms in Finnish and their use. The term
Finglish was avoided, as it is commonly used in academic research to refer to the
variety/language spoken by Finnish immigrants in the USA. Additionally, two new
questions were added based on information that arose from the Korean data and other
studies: one concerning the perceived motivation of students to use English outside
the classroom and its effect on their proficiency levels, and one on the role and
potential benefits of a NEST. After the Finnish interviews were completed, two of the
participants of the Korean study were asked these two additional questions not
originally included in the Korean set of interviews, but which were added to the
Finnish portion. These were answered in writing and added to the original transcribed
data.
The data was analysed through thematic analysis, a method of qualitative data
analysis that looks for, analyses, and reports salient themes in the data, as outlined by
Braun & Clarke (2006). The strengths of thematic analysis are its independence from
a pre-existing theoretical framework, allowing it to be used in a number of different
theoretical paradigms for different purposes, and its ability to provide a detailed, rich
and complex account of qualitative data. Three paradigms generally employed in
research are the essentialist, which “reports experiences, meanings and the reality of
participants” (Braun & Clarke, 2006:81) in a matter-of-fact way, the constructionist,
which “examines the ways in which events, realities, meanings, experiences and so on
are the effects of a range of discourses operating within society” (Braun & Clarke,
2006:81) and the contextualist, which positions itself in between the aforementioned
two paradigms. Thematic analysis can be used for both essentialist and constructionist
analysis, as well as contextualist analysis; this current study leans more heavily
26

towards the constructionist paradigm due to the emphasis on identifying and
discussing ideologies and assumptions concerning English, EFL education and NESTs
that are propagated through social norms and interaction. A theme in thematic analysis
“captures something important about the data in relation to the research question, and
represents some level of patterned response or meaning within the data set” (Braun &
Clarke, 2006:82). The criteria for defining what is a theme in the data is largely up to
the researcher, who can also choose at what level themes are identified, whether at a
semantic level, which identifies themes from the explicit surface meanings of the data,
or at a latent level, which involves examining underlying ideologies, ideas, and
assumptions that are present in the data. The analysis in this study focused more on
the latent level, as identifying underlying ideologies of the participants was a central
focus.
The qualitative analysis software NVIVO was used as an aid in carrying out the
thematic analysis. The software allows for the importation of data in various formats
onto the software interface and aids in the organising of the data into themes via either
manual or automatic coding. It also features the possibility of performing search
queries and displaying data in word clouds or word frequency charts (QSR
International Pty Ltd., 2020) The thematic analysis process of this study can be
described as follows: after the interviews were transcribed, the answers to the
interview questions were sorted into codes according to the question and compared
with each other. In addition, the transcribed data was examined for themes displaying
ideologies, ideas, and assumptions relevant to the research questions of the study
within the answers to a specific question, within a specific interview, within the
Korean and Finnish interview portions as well as the interview data as a whole.
Various methods were employed for this, including close reading, search queries of
certain key words, auto-coding and word clouds displaying the most commonly
occurring words in any selected portion of data. Of these methods, close reading and
manual search queries proved the most fruitful. The themes were identified both based
on frequency of occurrence and relevance/interest to the study. The themes included
in this study were generally relatively independent of each other, which is why using
subthemes was not considered relevant.
Since the approach chosen for this study is an ethnographic one, I have
deliberately chosen to include large portions of verbatim and near-verbatim quotes
from the interviews with the motive of allowing the participants’ thoughts to be
27

displayed with minimal filtering and more clearly display the underlying ideologies
and assumptions present in them, since the aim of the study is to examine the attitudes
and experiences of the interviewed NESTs as displayed in their answers. The use of
verbatim quoting also minimises the danger of misinterpretation or skewing of the
interview data in the reporting.

In the Korean portion of the study, four different nationalities were represented among
the participants. Abigail came from New Zealand and taught kindergarten and
elementary students at a Korean school. She was a certified teacher and also had a
degree in TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) and had taught
EFL for 15 years in Korea. Peter was a university teacher from Australia and taught
English in Japan for 5-6 years prior to teaching in Korea, where he had been teaching
for 10 years. Callie was an American teaching at a private Christian school with an
EFL teaching experience of three years in addition to experience teaching ESL to
adults in the US. She had a BA degree and had completed minor studies in language
education; however, she did not have any teaching certification. Della was also an
American with a BA degree and had been teaching EFL at a public middle school for
two years, likewise without an educational background in education. Finally, Elise, a
South African native and Bachelor of Education had taught elementary and middleschool students at a hagwon (private educational institute) for 11 months, prior to
which she taught in schools and done private tutoring for almost 10 years in South
Africa.
Their Finland-based counterparts likewise came from four different countries.
Nathan was English with a Finland-Swedish mother and had taught Business English
to Finnish adults for around 10 years as well as some shorter stints teaching EFL in
Swedish-speaking schools, mostly at the upper-secondary level. He had altogether
taught English for 15-20 years in Finland and had a TEFL (Teaching English as a
Foreign Language) certificate. Additionally, Nathan was completing a master’s
degree in English Language and Literature at the time of the interview. Anne was
originally from Ireland and had taught EFL in a number of countries since 1995. She
had a master’s degree in ELT (English Language Teacher) and Materials
Development, and had been teaching EFL to university students in Finland for almost
2,5 years. Charles was American and had taught EFL in comprehensive schools for
13-14 years as well as English to immigrant children whose first language was English
or who had lived abroad in English-speaking countries, to adults at a civic college, and
Finnish students whose general language of instruction was English. He was
completing a master’s degree in English Language and Literature at the time of the
interview, but had no previous qualifications for teaching English. Jason was from
England and had been teaching EFL in Finland altogether for over 30 years, having
taught EFL to university students since 1995. He had a degree in teaching, but not in
29

English. Joan came from the USA and was a certified English teacher. She had taught
English in a comprehensive school for 15 years, teaching both normal EFL classes as
well as English to students attending an English language class with content and
language integrated learning (CLIL). Lastly, Kassie was originally from Finland, but
had moved to England at 16 and used English as her home language for 30 years, thus
having native-like competence in English. She had taught grades 3-6 EFL and history
in English for two years to students whose language of instruction is English, prior to
which she taught English in British and American schools in Dubai for 20 years and
briefly EFL in Finland in the 1980s. She had a master’s degree in English Language
and Literature.

6. Results
In this chapter I will present the interviews conducted and comment on the opinions
and experiences the interviewees shared in response to the questions asked (see
appendices A and B). The fields touched upon in the interview encompass:
1. Language use in class and the teachers’ perception of the English proficiency of
their students;
2. Challenges encountered and observed in teaching and learning EFL in Korea
and Finland, respectively;
3. Time and resources dedicated to teaching communicative vs. written
proficiency;
4. The representation of different varieties of English in the curriculum;
5. The teachers’ impression of their students’ motivation to use English outside the
classroom and the effect of using English outside school on proficiency levels;
6. Attitudes and thoughts regarding Konglish and its effect on Koreans learning
English/Anglicisms in Finnish and their effect on Finns learning English,
respectively;
7. The future of Korean and Finnish EFL education and potential room for
improvement;
8. Thoughts on teaching EFL through English;
9. Whether they believed they had something to offer as native speaking teachers
that differed from what a non-native-speaking teacher could offer.
6.1. Language use in NEST classrooms
In order to get a picture of the language use in the classrooms of the interviewees, they
were asked to rate their proficiency level in the local language(s) as well as whether
they used any of the local language(s) in their teaching. Abigail reported not being
able to “speak whole sentences in Korean very well” and as a result she taught
primarily through English, occasionally providing the translation of a word into
Korean. Peter, despite having some proficiency in Korean, also taught through English
and only used individual Korean words for translating particularly difficult concepts,
noting that not using Korean for teaching was “a matter of policy” for him personally.
31

Della, who described herself as a beginner in learning Korean, and Elise, who, in her
own words, “kn[e]w about four words”, similarly reported using English as the
language of instruction. The only teacher in Korea who used a notable amount of
Korean in her teaching was Callie, who reported speaking Korean at an upperintermediate level. As she taught pre-Kindergarten (3-5 yrs) all the way through eighth
grade, she preferred using primarily Korean with her younger students and then
switching to only English with her older, more proficient students.
Among the teachers in Finland, three reported using only or primarily English
during teaching. Nathan, who had taught both Finnish and Swedish speakers, but
whose Swedish was stronger than his Finnish, nonetheless reported using English as
the language of instruction in both contexts. Anne and Jason, who both taught
university students and whose knowledge of Finnish was weak, also taught solely
through English. Charles spoke good Finnish and used both English and Finnish while
teaching in standard EFL classrooms:
when I'm teaching in the Finnish schools if it's not an immersion school of
course then yeah I notice that whatever goals I had of like no I owe it to the
kids I need to just speak the English to them but surviving the day with things
like bathroom breaks and making it to lunch [...] also just [for] the feeling of
safety [..] and of course with colleagues in other classrooms [...] yeah I use
[Finnish] quite a bit in the classroom [...] I normally will give my instructions
in English and [...] if I know there's someone [...] in the class who’s absolutely
not gonna be with it I'll say my instructions in English and then [...] repeat them
again in Finnish and particularly if there's a stressful situation [...] but for
regular classroom assignments and things like that I always start in English and
then give them directions again in Finnish
He also noted that striking the right balance between English and Finnish could be
a challenge: “it's a constant process of checking myself and saying oh I think I just
heard way too much Finnish out of my mouth and [...] I don't notice I'm code switching
all the time and I’m like man I just you needed to hear that in English”. Joan, who
described herself as having near-native competence of Finnish, used Finnish in her
standard EFL classes for explaining grammar due to the broad range of skills of her
students, but used English for discussing the topics in the students’ learning materials.
On the other hand, while teaching English to students whose general language of
instruction is English, she used only English, although she would occasionally give an
example in Finnish if they had trouble understanding. Kassie, whose original first
language was Finnish, found that even those who attended CLIL classes responded

32

much better when she used both English and Finnish, especially her youngest (year 3
primary) students.
It can observed that, naturally, the teachers with little to no competence in the
students’ L1, i.e. Abigail, Della, Elise, Anne, and Jason, did not use much of it in
their teaching. Similarly, the teachers who reported using it often had either good or
excellent skills in the local L1 (Callie, Charles, Joan and Kassie). Nonetheless, two
teachers who were quite familiar with at least one of the local L1 languages, Peter and
Nathan, still reported only minimal use of it during teaching. Of course, it must be
noted that their students (university students, adults using English for business, and
upper-secondary students) were already relatively experienced EFL learners, and thus,
it can be presumed, more likely to have sufficient competence to follow even more
advanced target language instruction than more inexperienced learners. Additionally,
there is not the same kind of need for extra-curricular guidance as there is with younger
learners, which is where Charles pointed out using Finnish was more effective.
Additionally, both Peter and Nathan believed TETE was a good method for teaching
their students (see chapter 6.7.). Ultimately, the relevant factors for choice of language
of instruction in this study appeared to be the teacher’s level of proficiency in the
students’ L1, the EFL proficiency level and age of their students, and potentially,
attitudes towards L1 and target language use in foreign language education.
6.2. Perceived English proficiency levels in students
The interviewees were also asked to estimate when their students first started learning
English and their ability to follow English-language instruction, as well as their initial
impressions of their students’ English skills. Based on the interviewees’ answers, EFL
learners start learning English from an early age in both Korea and Finland (in
accordance with the national policies detailed in chapters 3 & 4). Both Abigail and
Callie taught Korean pre-Kindergarten-age beginners, and Elise, Della, and Peter all
indicated that most of their students started learning at a similar age, although Peter
mentioned that some of his students began learning English in middle school. Anne,
Joan, Jason, Charles and Kassie said their students began learning English either in
1st or 3rd grade primary. Nathan, who had taught Finnish-speaking adults of various
ages, maintained that the younger ones began learning English at a young age, but that

33

many of his older students appeared to have had less EFL instruction, and overall
weaker skills.
Since all interviewees reported using English to either a moderate or high
degree during their teaching, as detailed in chapter 6.1., a relevant follow-up question
was “If [your classes] are (only) in English, do your students understand your teaching
and instructions without any problems?” The answers were somewhat mixed. Among
the Korean participants, Elise was the most positive about her students’ ability to
understand the teaching and instructions:
generally the kids respond well to instructions I think also many of them also
look at body language [...] and associate it with certain words and that's how
they then start learning the English language if you say no and do a cross [...]
with your hands they will know that no is not good you know so it's a whole
lot of body language especially for the younger for the first graders and the rest
are actually doing really really well […] and they do understand what I'm
saying and the readings that we do in class
Abigail noted that since her students were very young beginners, the teaching
content consisted of simple words and phrases appropriate for their age and level. She
also brought up the importance of non-verbal cues to help new learners understand,
explaining how she used tools such as flashcards, pictures, body language and miming
to aid her teaching. In Callie’s and Della’s experience the ability to understand
teaching and instructions depended on how early the students started learning the
language, with those who started earlier having a clear advantage. Della also pointed
out that the level of the motivation of the students to listen and try to understand the
teaching made a difference. Peter found that while the teaching itself did not give his
students any trouble, ensuring they understood his instructions was more difficult.
Interestingly, Peter’s experience supports a study which found that understanding
teachers’ instructions for carrying out tasks was a particularly challenging element in
immersion-type language classrooms (Macaro, 1997 in Macaro & Lee, 2013).
Among the Finnish participants, Anne and Jason, who taught university
students, reported having no major issues with their students’ ability to understand.
Anne

observed that any issues she may have encountered were likely to be

interpretation issues, and that her students were good at asking for clarification if
needed. Nathan had also found the general instruction understanding ability of his
adult students to be good. Those who taught younger students had encountered more
difficulties, on the other hand. Charles mentioned that he would repeat instructions in
34

Finnish if he noticed his students having difficulty understanding the initial English
instructions. Joan likewise noted that her students did not always understand her
instructions initially, in which case she would try to find an alternative way of getting
the message across, such as using simpler language and gesturing. She also pointed
out that the stronger students in the class would often explain to the weaker ones as
well. Kassie found it surprising that even though she taught CLIL students, giving
instructions in Finnish proved to be much more effective than giving them in English,
particularly with her younger students.
I also asked the interviewees about their initial impressions of their students’
level of English and whether it corresponded to any expectations they may have had.
Among the Korean participants, similar teaching experiences in the past or the lack
thereof, in addition to the level of students taught, directly impacted the answers given.
Peter, who, as already mentioned, had taught university students in Japan before
coming to Korea, expected, and also found, the level to be similar in both countries.
Abigail, who taught children just starting to learn English, already knew she would be
teaching beginners and consequently had no expectations of her students having much
command of English. On the other hand, Callie, Della and Elise all confessed that they
were initially unimpressed by their students’ English skills:
D: you know I did not know exactly what to expect but it was quite different
C: I'd say their levels were quite lower than I expected
D: yeah
Q: was it the same for you?
D: yes especially because they did inform us that that students are learning
English from such a young age
Q: right
C: that's why I was surprised too because I heard they learned from you know
4 or 5 years old so I expected they would have higher levels
[...]
C: at least conversational
D: yes
C: but many of them write English they do a lot of writing or reading but they
can hardly even hold a conversation
[...]
D: even the very very basic questions like what's your name it can sometimes
be met with a blank stare
E: when you come from an English-speaking country now you're so used to
using full sentences you know you don't actually have to rely on using body
language as much as when I started teaching in Korea it was all about a lot of
body language expressions making things big you know and clear and a whole
lot of repetition as well and also another thing is I found that I kind of have to
35

lower my level teaching especially with the younger ones so that they can
understand
Among the Finnish participants, Kassie, who previously taught students with
English as their L1, also found that simplifying language was inevitable, and described
some differences between teaching L1 and EFL learners:
it is interesting because I have taught I've done most of my teaching abroad
teaching native speakers you definitely notice the Finnish background don't
you and the fact that they come from a monolingual environment the mistakes
I feel like are very similar they’re very homogenous
Kassie also noted being surprised that many of her students were very hesitant to speak
and appeared noticeably weaker in speaking than in writing English, saying “because
they're little so I thought they'd be willing to chat away in English and try things out
and all that”. Nathan observed having been struck by the Finnish way of speaking
English: “the initial impression was this kind of Finnish funny monotonous Finnish
pronunciation kind of [..] didn't have much emotion in it and quite little sort of
variation in tone and pitch that's quite different from a native English speaker”. At the
same time, Nathan had also expected his students to have a high level of English
competence, and found his expectations met, despite the differences in pronunciation.
Jason admitted not having any particular expectations, as he had previously worked
only with English students, and his only impression of his Finnish students was that
“it was just meeting people who sometimes spoke funny English”. Conversely,
Charles, Anne and Joan all said they were impressed with their students’ English,
with Anne and Charles remarking that they had been under the impression that Finns
had good English skills even before coming to Finland, and that they had not been
disappointed. All three attributed this in large part to the strong presence of English in
the media children and young adults consume in Finland, while Anne also mentioned
the good global reputation of the Finnish education in general. Nonetheless, Anne did
note that many of her students struggled with academic English, even though their
skills in informal English were very fluent, and she rated their overall proficiency level
as being the highest out of all the countries she had taught in.
With the Finnish participants, no specific pattern in the answers was
identifiable, unlike in the Korean data. Simultaneously, the interviewees in the Finnish
portion of the study were comparatively more experienced in teaching EFL than the
interviewees in the Korean portion, with a rough average of 17 years of experience
36

versus an average of 7 years of experience. Furthermore, it can be stated that the
attitudes toward students’ English were on the whole more positive in the Finnish data
than in the Korean data. While this is likely in part a reflection of higher levels of
English competence among Finnish students, other factors such as the Finnish
participants’ higher experience levels and greater familiarity with Finnish students and
the Finnish context most likely influence this result as well.
6.3. Challenges teachers and students may face in Korean and Finnish EFL
classrooms
The following questions asked are related to two potentially challenging aspects
teachers and students may encounter in EFL classrooms taught by NESTs; the
linguistic and cultural barrier between student and teacher, and (although not specific
to NEST classrooms) the linguistic challenges in acquiring a new language, especially
one unrelated to one’s mother tongue, such as is the case with Korean and Finnish vis
a vis English. When asked the question “What have been the greatest challenges as a
NEST teaching EFL with potentially limited command in your students’ native
language?” the answers given varied widely between the participants, but difficulties
related to cultural differences were mentioned by four.
In Korea, Della maintained that motivating her students to try instead of giving
up when facing struggles learning English was one of her biggest challenges. Callie
worried about “how to teach them to actually have a mastery of the language because
so many of them have a lot of exposure to English but they still can't speak”. Moreover,
as Callie’s school wanted her to teach through the Bible as well as specifically
Christian vocabulary, she added that she had a hard time making everything she taught
applicable to the lives of her students and conveying the material in a way that helped
them learn to speak the language. Abigail and Peter observed that the greatest
challenges for them were not related to linguistic differences but rather to cultural ones,
as they found it hard to gauge how well their Korean students were making progress
and understanding what was being taught due to what they perceived to be a general
inhibition and reluctance to ask questions or speak if unsure. Likewise, Elise did not
perceive teaching EFL through English to Korean students as a challenge per se but
nevertheless had experienced some cases of miscommunication between her and her
students due to differences in the way things are expressed in English versus Korean.
37

For Jason in Finland, as for Peter and Abigail in Korea, the perceived shyness
and unwillingness of his students was his biggest challenge. He contrasted the way his
Finnish students and exchange students responded in class:
I mean for example [...] for French and German exchange students and Czech
exchange students if I ask a question to a German exchange student more often
than not what comes back is about 5 or 6 minutes of chat you know if I ask a Finn
I might get a few sentences okay so I get the very basics and if I want to get more
of course I'd have to kind of extract more by asking more questions you know
Joan’s main challenge was earning the trust of the schools, as she noted they
tended to be sceptical about whether she had sufficient competence in Finnish and
knowledge of the Finnish school system to be able to handle potential conflicts or
bullying situations between students. For Kassie, the need to simplify her language
use in class was the greatest challenge, and Charles admitted he had at times worried
about his American accent and spelling, especially in the beginning of his career, due
to a traditional emphasis of British English in the Finnish education system and
matriculation examination. In addition, he had encountered situations where he
struggled to adequately explain or translate an English word or phrase into Finnish,
particularly with adult students, something Nathan had also experienced as a struggle.
Simultaneously, Nathan even mentioned having experienced advantages as a British
native speaker in Finland, due to Finns’ interest in British culture, such as the royal
family, as well as due to a cachet being attached to being British. Lastly Anne, in fact,
found the English level of her Finnish students so high she could not identify any
particular challenges.
Conversely, the responses related to common linguistic challenges or confusion
students face when learning English revealed several reoccurring aspects, even
between the Korean and Finnish contexts: Callie, Peter and Elise all mentioned
mastering the English SVO word order in sentences as a challenge, as Korean uses the
SOV word order. Similarly, although contemporary Finnish uses SVO as the default
word order, it is believed to be originally an SOV language and word order remains
very flexible in Finnish, making the learning of the stringently SVO word order of
English a potential challenge for Finnish students, something Nathan, Joan and
Kassie all pointed out. Interestingly, Charles felt that his students manage to learn
English word order surprisingly well, due to the ‘SPOTPA’ (subjekti, predikaatti,
objekti, tapa, paikka, aika) mantra used to drill it into Finnish students. Elise noted her
Korean students frequently left out words such as “is” and prepositions such as “at”
38

and “in”, and many teachers (Nathan, Jason, Charles, and Joan) in Finland also
brought up that their students frequently struggle with prepositions. This is likely due
to the more synthetic nature of Korean and Finnish as well as the preference for
postpositions in these languages. Struggles with using the indefinite and definite article
among Finnish learners was mentioned by Charles, Kassie, Joan, and Nathan.
Interestingly, none of the teachers in Korea mentioned any difficulties with using
articles, despite the absence of articles in Korean (although Callie did touch on the
general complexity of article use in English in response to a later question).
Elise and Callie had, however, observed their Korean students having difficulty
using verb tenses correctly and Callie commented on the differences in forming
questions: “a lot of my students really struggle to ask questions in English and as I’ve
studied Korean I’ve noticed they don't have a different form for asking questions just
their intonation changes so a lot of my students really struggle with forming
questions”. Peter and Abigail touched on challenges related to pronunciation as Peter
remarked that /l/ and /ɻ/ are frequently mixed up (the Korean equivalents /ɭ/ and /ɾ/ are
allophones), as well as /f/ and /p/ (/f/ does not exist in the Korean language). Abigail
approached pronunciation challenges from a more general perspective, pointing out
how the differences in alphabet cause mispronunciation of English words because they
are frequently written in the Korean script and thus changed to conform to the rules of
hangeul.
Among the Finnish participants Jason, Charles and Kassie also highlighted
pronunciation difficulties: Jason mentioned the /θ/ and /ð/ sounds and the fact that
silent letters such as the ‘l’ in salmon often are pronounced by Finnish students.
Charles brought up the pronunciation and spelling of consonants not native to Finnish,
such as /b/ and /g/. Kassie remarked on struggles with English rhythm and intonation.
Finally, Della simply found getting her Korean students to even speak English during
her classes such a great challenge it was hard to pinpoint specific linguistic stumbling
blocks, as many students could not even form basic sentences in English. Conversely,
Anne had trouble thinking of any common errors due to the generally high level of her
Finnish students, but she mentioned confusion related to certain specific terms such as
chapter and paragraph. Challenges mentioned in the interviews are summarised in
Table 2.

6.4. Focus of EFL education
Since proficiency in a language, especially one that has a written form, consists of
several elements (e.g. competence in writing, understanding spoken language, ability
to utilise vocabulary and grammar), foreign and second language education curricula
vary in the degrees of attention given to the respective elements. In the following
section the interviewees were asked to discuss whether they considered written or oral
proficiency more important for their students to learn, possible preference for either at
the school they worked at, and whether they had observed any bias in the country’s
EFL education at large.
In response to the first question “In your opinion, is communicative proficiency
or written proficiency more important for your students to learn?” all participants
either considered oral communicative proficiency more important or both equally
important. Of the Korean participants Peter, Callie, and Della wanted their students
to focus on learning communication skills, with Peter implying communicative skills
are more relevant for most speakers:
I would rather [have] them learn communication for sure because they can
probably do a lot of reading practice at home not so much writing practice but
in the real world not a lot of us need to write much even as native speakers but
we do need to be able to speak and communicate so definitely my classes and
that's why Korean schools hire foreign teachers so we can teach the
communication skills
Elise on the other hand firmly believed all aspects work together and therefore should
be taught and practiced equally:
I think both are very very important because to be honest English is an
international language and you cannot go anywhere in the world and they don’t
know how to speak English or at least understand the English language and I
40

do feel in order for you to be able to speak you need to be able to read so the
reading and the writing is also very important and I feel that’s also one of the
ways that you can actually improve every aspect of English you know whether
it's reading writing whatev- all of that actually works together in order to
produce you know your speaking you know if you can’t speak then you can’t
write you can't read so everything works together
Abigail also maintained that a balanced integration of listening, speaking, reading and
writing into the curriculum is necessary but observed that the main focus of NESTs in
Korea is often to specifically teach communication, as they are better able to motivate
the students to communicate in English:
I do feel that for us as native speakers that is the priority to get the kids speaking
English when they have Korean teachers the kids naturally just wanna speak
Korean and even where I'm working my Korean teachers always have a hard
time getting Korean kids to speak in English cuz they said you're a Korean
teacher so you speak Korean so I'm gonna speak Korean to you but when I'm
a foreign teacher it's very easy to say you can only speak English because I
can't speak Korean so it gives them a motivation to speak English
Of the Finnish participants, Kassie was a strong advocate of focusing more on
communication skills, as her students’ reading and writing skills were generally
stronger:
I think that is really really important for them to learn to speak confidently for one
I'm not even that focused on the writing because that's like their happy place that's
where they're much more comfortable so because they're already sort of quite good
at the writing [...] and I do think that [speaking is] to me that's a more natural place
to start
Jason concluded it depended on what the student intended to use English for, but that
his classes mainly focused on developing communicative skills. He further observed
that
yeah I think it's important to speak good English you know [...] the other thing of
course is communicating if a student is communicating fairly well but making
grammatical you know mistakes OK you correct them but the thing is the main
thing is that you're getting the message over
The other teachers in Finland emphasised a balance of both skills and maintained their
classes integrated reading, writing, speaking and listening practices in equal
proportions.
In the Korean participants’ response to which aspect their school placed more
emphasis on Callie and Della were both emphatic that more attention was given to
learning as well as testing written proficiency in addition to a heavy focus on
41

memorisation in Callie’s case. In Peter’s experience at the university level EFL
education was strongly coupled with preparing students for the TOEIC (Test of
English for International Communication) and therefore the teaching was tailored to
improve students’ performance in TOEIC. Elise was the only one who felt the assigned
curriculum was balanced and effective:
to be honest it’s […] balanced it really is balanced because I think this hagwon
that I'm working for now understands that in order to be an efficient English
speaker all aspects are very important reading writing speaking memorising
you know being able to observe and interpret body language so for me all those
aspects are very important and I feel that we are addressing all of those at the
hagwon
All the teachers in Korea agreed that learning to read and write English has
traditionally been more heavily emphasised than learning to speak and understand it
in Korean EFL education. Della and Callie mused that although having good
communicative skills is valued and many wish to be proficient at English, the
education system focuses on teaching the written form of the language instead. Peter
noted that there has been somewhat of a shift at the university level towards
understanding spoken language as tests such as TOEIC (which are mandatory for
university students to pass in order to graduate) include a listening comprehension
component. However, he pointed out that the education system still does not create
much incentive for learning how to produce spoken English as taking speaking tests is
not compulsory. As for the possible reasons behind focusing more on reading and
writing, Elise presumed it to be the importance of academic success as well as parental
expectations concerning it:
I think it has got to do more with the written skills because I think for the kids
it's about achieving its about getting A+ on this and this and that whereas you
know you can't necessarily we don't necessarily grade them for speaking per se
in class so the writing aspect is what the parents always want to see what's in
the textbook what's been written in the textbook did you do any work at school
did you not do any work at school so yeah textbook work is more important
for Korea
Several of the Finnish participants also indicated that there has traditionally
been more of an emphasis on teaching and testing reading and writing skills in the
formal EFL education, but that there has been a shift towards incorporating and valuing
communicative skills in recent years. In Nathan’s experience teaching at a Swedishspeaking upper-secondary school
42

in the curriculum it's all equal strictly speaking I think that that no one element is
kind of pushed more than another the aim is just to be able to use English in a
variety of situations comfortably and fluently but in the book that we used [...] it
was actually pretty equal [...] in fact all the units had their speaking reading writing
listening sections and it was actually quite even
At the same time, Jason and Kassie noted it is often easier to test and evaluate written
proficiency (and potentially viewed as more legitimate by parents), even though they
themselves valued communicative skills more:
J: it's a lot easier to evaluate [written proficiency] you know you have more time I
think also the background of the way that English has been taught in the schools
it's based very much on writing and doing exercises you know I can give exercises
to the students and they whish it through in a few minutes it's like they’re so well
versed in doing exercises grammatical exercises and stuff like that but coming to
talking and speaking it’s a different matter altogether
K: the teachers in general still feel that it's so much more kind of reliable [...] to
test written skills and also I feel that there's this thing of being worried about the
especially in primary school and secondary being so worried about the parents and
such that if you can show that this is what the grade is about about these specific
things on paper
Joan also reported having noticed a clear difference between her CLIL classes and
standard EFL classes in terms of time devoted to communication practice. The reduced
emphasis on speaking and listening in the standard classes led to the students being
less confident in speaking:
you can see the difference between the language [CLIL] classes and the normal
[standard EFL] classes because the kids in the language classes they're just really
spontaneous whereas the ones in the normal classes they’re a bit more timid they
don't want to be heard making a mistake or something so they're very conscientious
about this speaking
An aspect Nathan and Kassie pointed out is that although reading and writing
proficiency is generally what is officially tested in Finnish schools, speaking skills are
still assessed throughout the term and Kassie even maintained that being active in
communicating during class time was actually valued in her school more than written
prowess.
6.5. Varieties of English in Korean and Finnish EFL education
In the case of languages that have several spoken and written varieties, such as English,
the degree to which these different varieties are represented in a given curriculum is
43

yet another variable. This section deals with the varieties of English featured in the
interviewed teachers’ classes and the degree of representation of different varieties in
the Korean and Finnish EFL teaching at large. It should be noted however that the
interviewees used the terms variety and accent somewhat interchangeably, as is
evident from their quoted responses.
In terms of preferred variety of English, American English (AmE) proved to
be dominant in three of the Korean participants’ classes and schools. Callie and Elise
reported their curriculum being entirely standard AmE and Callie added that her
students’ knowledge of other varieties seemed very limited. Elise, as a South African,
found that although she was not required by her workplace to alter her accent, she had
resorted to modifying some aspects of her pronunciation to resemble AmE, (e.g.
pronouncing post-vocalic /ɻ/ and pronouncing “dance” as /dæns/ instead of /dɑːns/) in
order to prevent confusion among her students, as most of her NEST co-workers were
American. Della observed that she strived to introduce different varieties of English
such as British English (BrE) and African American Vernacular English (AAVE) but
most of her teaching was conducted through her native variety, standard AmE. In
addition, she accepted both British and American spelling in her students’ work but
the Korean English Teachers at her school accepted only American spelling in their
classrooms. Furthermore, all three felt that AmE was the preferred variety in the
Korean society at large and Della reported having seen job postings hiring NESTs that
requested applicants to have a standard American accent.
Abigail also acknowledged the prevalence of AmE and noted she had once
been asked by a Korean co-worker to teach with a standard American accent but had
otherwise been completely free to teach in her native New Zealand English (NzE).
Peter stated that the varieties featured in the EFL curriculum at the university level are
largely dictated by the TOEIC test, which currently features American, British,
Australian, and Canadian English in the listening comprehension component, and
therefore all four varieties were included in the curriculum. Moreover, both American
and British spelling were accepted in Peter’s classes.
Based on the Finnish portion of interviews, it seems there has traditionally been
an emphasis on BrE. Ranta’s (2010) finding that the majority of upper-secondary EFL
teachers chose to emulate BrE in their English use supports this (see Chapter 2).
Charles even admitted to worrying about his American accent especially in the
beginning of his teaching career in Finland:
44

Especially beginning this I felt like there's still like a I obviously have a very
American accent and that there's definitely a among native as well as non-native
teachers of English in Europe in particular like that that's not the right English and
not in a horrible way but you can tell that there's a little bit of this like uhm that's
not correct that’s... and I joke with British colleagues [...] oh did you mean to put
a U in the word [...] color favorite [...] and I sometimes worry I actually worry
about that because when I mentioned about teaching to the test that's something
that I think Finland’s the examinations have gotten better in that sense that teachers
are not as pedantic about which variety of English you're using when you write but
that's something that I've definitely kind of felt conscious of early on when teaching
my particularly my middle school students because I’m going oh wait in a few
years you’re gonna be trying to take your matriculations and if this gets stuck in
your head I said I need to make sure I'm teaching you the Queen's English in order
that when you do that test that you're not getting bad marks just because of the
dialect you chose
On the whole, most of the teachers in Finland maintained the curriculum they used
featured several varieties and they would try to introduce a range of accents and
spellings as well. Nathan mentioned mostly teaching differences in vocabulary
between BrE, AmE, and AuE, but noted that the listening comprehension assignments
featured “different accents and dialects”. Anne taught through Irish English, which
uses British spelling, but she tried to make her students aware of vocabulary and
spelling differences between BrE and AmE, and, as the focus of her teaching was
academic English, she drew on examples from journal articles to demonstrate. She also
said she was open to either spelling as long as it was consistent. Jason, another
university teacher, spoke received pronunciation (RP) English as his native variety,
but he introduced other varieties of BrE during his classes either through videos or him
speaking different varieties, such as Cockney.
Joan, Kassie and Charles all reported that the current textbooks used in their
classes contained several varieties of English, including traditionally underrepresented ones such as Jamaican and Indian English. Charles and Kassie both
emphasised how pleased they were at the wide representation of varieties in the newest
edition of textbooks and why featuring diverse varieties is important:
C: the latest set has definitely has more international English or World Englishes
[...] they've always had things about Australia and the UK and Canada and the
United States but the last even actually the previous edition [...] had information
on India and South Africa but I the latest instalment [...] I wanna say that they've
been a little bit better about putting other accents on the recordings as well as
acknowledging that there's a lot of people speaking different kinds of English but
I'd say like even let’s say three generations of these books ago [...] when I first
came [...] it's definitely from the UK of course they had some American accents
but I think it's been neat to hear like for example some of the listening exercises
45

for the say 5th and 6th graders actually had very thick Indian accent recordings and
things like that I said that's cool because in other cases [...] they might have filtered
that out and said well that’s we don't want the kids learning that and I think it’s
good that’s your learning reality[...] that you are going to be communicating with
[...] all kinds of varieties and [...] you respect and understand that
K: luckily the materials that we use it's a new book series that has a nice variety of
English there so one of the things we've been looking at just now is Indian English
which is great and at the same time I notice that the students they burst into laughter
straight away when they heard the Indian accent so we had a discussion about it I
feel quite passionate about that I feel it’s important to not value the RP over other
varieties
Kassie, who was originally from Finland and had lived and taught in both
American and British contexts, further noted that “it’s OK that I'm from everywhere”,
meaning it did not matter to her school or students that her English usage contained
influences from various varieties. Joan and Kassie also were open to their students
using either British or American spelling, and maintained that the textbooks and
teachers introduced both. They were adamant, however, about their students being
consistent and not mixing spellings in the same text. Charles, while he aimed to point
out and explain the differences between British and American spelling, admitted he
did not really care if a student mixed the two, as he claimed most Americans are not
particularly pedantic about spelling variety. Clear spelling errors, however, he would
correct.
6.6. Impression of students’ motivation to use English outside the classroom
and effect on proficiency levels
Both Jeon’s (2015) study and Leppänen et.al’s (2011) indicate that encountering and
using English outside the formal education system can be a significant positive factor
in the acquisition of English, especially in current times due to the global dominance
of English in various contexts. With this in mind, the interviewed teachers were asked
to evaluate the extent to which their students used English outside the classroom, and
any perceived effect a motivation to use English in their free time had on proficiency
levels in a classroom context. In the answers to this question, a clear difference
between the Korean and Finnish contexts could be identified. All the Finnish
respondents reported their students were generally very likely to engage in various
activities such as playing games, watching movies, listening to music, or conversing
46

with people in English. Anne, Charles, Joan and Kassie all said they noticed a
difference in English proficiency with the students who engage with English-language
activities more:
J: it's my experience that the kids who use English outside school also are not only
motivated to use it but they also do better at English and so it does raise their
proficiency because you've got quite a few things working for them you’ve got the
motivation you’ve got the practice and you've got the supportive environment so
if you speak English with your friends you're getting that support there and so it
definitely has an impact on the proficiency
Nathan hypothesised that although exposure to English or even more than one
language in general can be advantageous for acquiring English, personality also played
a notable part in how much his upper-secondary school students would demonstrate
their English skills in class, as he remembered having some students who rarely spoke
up in class but who nonetheless demonstrated good proficiency once prompted to
engage in using English. Joan reported having noticed a difference between the
students in her CLIL classes and her standard EFL ones, with the students who used
English more at school also being more engaged with using it outside the classroom.
Charles also noted that socio-economic differences can impact the extent to which
English is used and the level acquired both in and outside the classroom, a point that
emerged in Leppänen et.al’s (2011) study and various Korean studies, e.g. Park SY
(2009).
The responses from the Korean participants (responses were obtained only
from Della and Callie), on the contrary, revealed a somewhat different situation. Both
reported their students were unlikely and unmotivated to use English or consume
English-language content outside the classroom, and the minority who did were
generally students who already had strong English skills and were motivated to use
English in class. Nevertheless, Della did point out that she taught in a very rural area,
and she believed this may have lowered her students’ motivation to use English. Callie
also admitted that the school she taught at routinely discouraged its students from using
media, and therefore those who did tended not to be very open about it. Callie did
mention, however, that many of her students would speak to her in English if they
encountered her outside school. She also observed that even those who were not
particularly invested in learning would occasionally watch a TV show in English, “but
as they use subtitles, it does not really help their English growth”, revealing that she
had a negative attitude towards learning a language through subtitled content. Park SY
47

(2009) also was critical of the practice of subtitling movies and TV shows in Korea,
viewing it as an impediment to Koreans’ ability to acquire English.
These attitudes are in direct contrast to observations made by Leppänen et.al
(2011) and Ranta (2010), who by large explain the positive effect global media has
had on the English proficiency of Finns through the widespread practice of subtitling,
as opposed to dubbing. It is interesting to consider why this difference in attitudes
towards learning English through subtitled content exists. A potential factor may be
the greater presence of subtitling vs. dubbing in Finland (see chapter 4.3.), but
individual attitudes and beliefs of the writers and interviewees may also be at play.
6.7. Attitudes towards Koreanised and Finnicised English
Koreanised English or so-called Konglish lacks a clear, comprehensive definition.
According to Lawrence (2012), Konglish can be defined via pronunciation, vocabulary
and grammar which combine features of Korean and English. Konglish is most
commonly characterised in terms of vocabulary, as Korean anglicisms and pseudoanglicisms are numerous; in fact, all participants in this study associated the term
“Konglish” primarily with vocabulary, although Callie and Della brought up the
pronunciation aspect as well. Kim (2012) presents four groups of Konglish vocabulary
according to the morphological and semantic changes manifested: 1. Semantic shift,
2. Creative compounding, 3. Mixed-code combination, 4. Clipping. In words such as
service the meaning has shifted from the original English one to refer to items or
services added free of additional cost to a purchase (colloquially “on the house” in
English). An example of creative compounding given by Kim (2012) is hand phone to
replace the English compound mobile phone. In addition, she exemplifies mixed-code
combination and clipping with terms such as gamjachip (potato chip/crisp) and be pu
(best friend), respectively. In addition to lexical items that have undergone change
during the borrowing process, there also exist a number of direct English loans in the
Korean language, and English words and phrases such as yeah and you know are often
used as interjections in casual speech, especially among younger Koreans. An example
of how standard Korean phonetic conventions affect English loanwords is the Korean
pronunciation of the loanword smoothie /sɯmudi/: as certain consonants cannot occur
adjacent to each other, such as /s/ and /m/, the vowel /ɯ/ has been inserted in between
them. In addition, the voiced dental fricative /ð/ has shifted to its closest approximation
48

existent in the Korean language, the voiced alveolar stop /d/, and the tense high back
rounded vowel /u:/ has become shorter (Korean does not distinguish between long and
short vowel sounds). The high central unrounded vowel /ɯ/ is also frequently added
to the end of loanwords ending in certain consonants, as there are restrictions on which
consonant sounds can occur at the end of words in standard Korean. For instance, the
aforementioned Konglish word service is pronounced /sʌbisɯ/.
Regardless of how one chooses to define Konglish, its widespread use in
Korean society is apparent and appears to carry a connotation of luxury, youth and
modernity with it (Ahn, 2014). However, McPhail (2018) alleges that Konglish lacks
prestige in Korean society and is commonly regarded as a lesser form of English, while
Ahn’s (2014) study on the attitudes of English teachers in Korea towards Korean
English and Konglish indicated mixed attitudes concerning their legitimacy and
appropriate scope of use. As Konglish is a significant by-product of the spread of
English in South Korea, the participants in the study described here were asked to share
their thoughts and opinions regarding Konglish, their own personal experiences with
it, and whether they believed it affects the way Koreans learn English.
Peter and Abigail approached Konglish from the perspective of developing
World Englishes, viewing it as a natural process whilst still cautioning Koreans against
confusing it with standard English:
P: I think it's a product of Korean culture and when they speak in Korean they
can use it you know when they say service for you know it's on the house and
I don't mind but if they try and use it in English and it causes
miscommunication then I would tell them this is actually Korean style English
we don’t say that overseas so just be aware of it I don't want to denigrate the
use of English in Korean because that’s their language they can use it however
they want
A:yeah cuz you just even look at how much English has changed in other
countries every country is developing their own unique style of English like if
you look at even New Zealand has its own English words that Americans don't
know and it's going to happen in countries all over the world as it becomes
international all countries are going to make up new English words new ways
of saying things yeah I don't think it's wrong either but yeah like [Peter] was
saying as long as it's understood though that if they use that word in another
country abroad they people may not know what they are saying
Callie and Della, despite praising it for it for being descriptive, likewise voiced their
concerns about Koreans using Konglish with non-Koreans, especially native English
speakers, due to its deviance from standard English:

49

D: I don't know [...] I feel like it can be useful I feel like it's often much more
descriptive than some regular like standard English words if they say it it's like
I know what it means
C: I think because I live in Korea it's easy for me to figure out what a lot of
Konglish words mean but I think if they were to just go to an English speaking
country and use those words maybe about half would be understood right away
but half because people don't know the Korean culture I think could really be
confusing for native speakers so on one hand I like that through Konglish they
at least hear the sound of English but the problem is a lot of times instead of
learning the English they just automatically use the Konglish assuming it
means the same but it doesn't
[…]
D: I agree it defaults
The interviewees were then questioned about whether they had ever
experienced confusion due to Konglish. Elise said that as she does not speak Korean,
hearing and seeing Konglish and English words makes it easier for her to extrapolate
meaning from her surroundings.
Callie and Della mentioned having been confused by it in certain instances, but they
did report using Konglish at times. However, Della asserted that it was important for
her to limit her use of Konglish to outside the EFL classroom:
I don't use it in the classroom and that's primarily because they want me to give
the students a full American English experience […] so if I use any type of
Konglish [the students will] think that's okay and that's how everyone speaks
and so I try to counter that and not use it
Upon being asked “Do you think Konglish affects how Koreans learn
English?” all the participants unanimously agreed that it did affect Korean English
learners but had differing opinions about how it affected the learning of English. Peter
and Abigail contended that it only affected their learning of vocabulary in cases such
as cunning where a semantic shift has occurred (the Konglish meaning is ‘cheating’)
or in the case of German loanwords such as arbeit and allergi which are commonly
assumed to be English loanwords, but not their learning of grammar or pronunciation.
By contrast, Della and Callie maintained that Konglish namely affects Koreans’
pronunciation and considered it a real challenge in teaching English:
C: it 100% affects their accents I really have to work hard to unteach that accent
the Korean
D: yeah
C: especially with consonants because Konglish it really splits up a lot of
consonants into more syllables and adds vowel sounds
[…]
C: so I really struggle to
50

D: yeah I agree
C: get my students to pronounce consonants together
D: mhhmh
C: I would say that's one of my biggest struggles actually
D: I totally agree with that I second it
Elise’s statements suggest a belief in the concept of “pure English” (as referring to
standard written English) and she compared the use of Konglish to using slang English
such as SMS English:
you've got pure English okay pure English is there you know and people have their
own versions of slang English and you know like SMS English and all those other
things so it really does because look I haven't experienced it here but I know from
experience as a teacher back home in South Africa when kids would be doing
writing essays writing assignments they would basically write in SMS language
you know instead of writing the letters t o they would write 2 like I want to go to
the shops you know they’d go I want in words and then like the number two and
I’m like no you don't write like that so I see it really does affect their ability to
learn pure English at its best
There appears to be even less scholarly work done in regard to defining Finnicised
English in Finland. Instead, most research seems to focus on the general presence of
English in Finland or attitudes towards the use of anglicisms. I argue here that
Finnicised English can be at least partially defined in similar terms to Koreanised
English in the sense that the pronunciation, vocabulary and grammar combine features
of Finnish and English, as Koreanised English combines features of Korean and
English. The aforementioned groups of Konglish vocabulary as introduced by Kim
(2012), namely semantic shift, creative compounding, mixed-code combination, and
clipping are equally suitable for describing anglicisms in Finnish that are not direct
loans: an example of semantic shift is jees (good) an example of both creative
compounding and mixed-code combination is farmariauto (estate car), an example of
mixed-code combination is brändäyskysymys (a question of branding) and an example
of clipping is bestis (best friend). Additionally, direct translations of English words
and phrases are common, such as pitkässä juoksussa (in the long run). The same
loanword given as an example of Korean pronunciation of English loanwords,
smoothie, will be used to illustrate pronunciation changes that occur in English
loanwords and Finnicised anglicisms. The fully Finnish pronunciation is /smo:thie̯ /,
but the pronunciation /smu:thie̯ / is also common, displaying a partial adaption of the
English pronunciation despite it contradicting Finnish spelling conventions. Like
standard Korean, standard Finnish also lacks /ð/ and interprets the letters t and h as
51

separate phonemes. Likewise, the monophthong /i:/ has shifted to the diphthong /ie̯ /.
Interestingly, standard Korean and Finnish both have limitations on words ending in
consonant sounds, which is why English loanwords in Finnish often have /i/ inserted
as a final phoneme in pronunciation and spelling, e.g. brand is written as brändi and
pronounced as /prændi/ or /brændi/.
Moreover, as in the Korean context, both established direct loanwords and more
incidental English interjections are common, especially in informal speech,
advertising, and media content, and their presence continues to grow more prominent
despite concerns in both countries that anglicisms are ‘polluting’ or even destroying
the local languages (Park SY, 2009; Sánchez & Tuomainen, 2014).
When asked about their personal thoughts concerning anglicisms in Finnish,
Nathan and Charles both reported having benefited personally from the existence of
anglicisms in Finnish, as it helped them understand what people were talking about
better. Simultaneously, they expressed awareness of the concerns of certain groups in
Finland that anglicisms are threatening the integrity of Finnish. Anne on the other hand
found it difficult to even identify anglicisms in Finnish, due to them looking and
sounding so different from their English origin. Joan confessed she felt irritated at
times upon hearing anglicisms and English words inserted into Finnish conversation,
as she felt the words were sometimes being ‘used wrong’ if the nuance had changed
in the borrowing process. She also mentioned the unknowing use of inappropriate
English words as irritating:
I have say that it irritates me a lot things like someone will be speaking Finnish
and then all of a sudden say what [...] and that really irritates me or things like even
swear words our neighbour here there's a little boy about four years old and he'll
be playing outside and [...] saying the F word [..] and that really irritates me of
course he doesn't know what it means and he's heard it somewhere[...] I wanna go
and say no don't you should not be using that word I have to say it really irritates
me because sometimes because they get the nuances of the meaning wrong [...]
they're using it wrong and then that becomes a pattern [..] and it's like you guys are
using this wrong you know you don't use it like this
Kassie found it “funny and kind of wonderful for an English teacher”, but also
admitted she found it concerning from the point of view of the Finnish language.
In regard to the effect the use of anglicisms has on Finnish learners of English,
the opinions were mixed. Kassie viewed the effects as being positive, as she argued it
encouraged her students to feel more comfortable using English and playing with
language, as she believed the most important thing for her as a teacher was “to make
52

[the students] happy and give them the confidence to use English in the normal daily
life”. Joan surmised that the use of anglicisms may demonstrate a knowledge of
English, but at the same time it can make EFL learners more likely to use English
words in a Finnish way even when speaking English:
I would say both because in a positive way in the sense that I know that they’re
processing the language I know that something's going on upstairs here and so
I know that they’re using their skills in a more varied way it just tells me that
their brain is working basically and they have a deep understanding of the two
languages but in a negative way in the sense that with these different nuances
definitely because if they use it wrong when they're mixing it with Finnish then
they use it wrong in English as well
Charles, and Nathan saw them as both potentially confusing and potentially helpful:
C: I mean it probably helps in that they're kind of like oh I use that word and
then when you show them it in proper English they're like oh okay so they
already have the meaning and then the struggle is just like oh let me change the
spelling a little bit yeah I would say that at least for the younger students it
definitely helps cuz then they see the comparison [...] and then it's easier for
them to pick it up when it maintains the meaning
Q: because when it doesn't then maybe it gets a bit confusing
C: yeah
...
C yeah cuz there are some of those that totally don’t go the other way or I
would have a student write a totally Finnish word and then try and put some
kind of English conjugation on it [...] the ones that I've seen the kids have been
able to tie it directly to the English word and say okay I can use this and it’s
helped them
N: that's an interesting question I could imagine that [..] it wouldn't help a
teenager to learn kind of proper English to be slipping these words in into
Finnish I'm not sure that would be a helpful thing I could see it might get a bit
confusing but then on the other hand I don’t know maybe using those
anglicisms in Finnish illustrates some kind of knowledge of English
6.8. The future of English in South Korea and Finland, of EFL education and
potential room for improvement
The questions “How do you see the future of the English language – and English
language education in Korea/Finland? Do you think English education in
Korea/Finland could be improved, and how?” were intended to give the participants
in this study an opportunity to share their predictions regarding the future of EFL
education in Korea and Finland as well as suggest improvements to the education
systems.
53

Peter expressed positive views on the future of Korean EFL education, citing the
ever-increasing spread of English and rising proficiency levels both globally and
within Korea:
I can see that in general very slowly the level of English throughout the country is
getting better and whereas in the past older people didn’t understand any English
nowadays many people in their even in their 50s or 60s they understand English
so I think the future is bright for English education here in Korea
Della and Callie on the other hand were more sceptical, feeling that the current
education system is hampering further improvement in proficiency. It must be noted
however that Della and Callie primarily constructed the idea of English proficiency as
communicative proficiency, ignoring the relatively high written proficiency of many
Korean students (see Kim:2020 in chapter 4.2). On the Finnish side, Jason and Anne
shared similar views with Peter on the continuous growth of English:
A: I think it will continue to be really strong and prevalent I would say maybe there
might be more of it in the tertiary level I think especially with international students
coming here and I've had some and they've said that they find it a bit tough to find
enough courses in English when they’re here on exchange so I think there might
be more for international students in the future
J: I would presume it will carry on as it has been carrying on I think the language
skills are getting better all the time I think now also that the language of the
business world is English which is encouraging a lot of people to use the language
and [...] English is everywhere [...] and of course with the Internet phenomenon
and everything then things are looking good
Nathan, Joan, and Kassie, although recognising the global importance of English,
expressed concerns that English is given too much attention at the expense of other
languages, even the domestic languages Finnish and Swedish:
N: I hope that they encourage other languages to be learned as well I think it's a
little bit boring when everyone concentrates so much on English although of course
globally it's an important language to learn and yeah people should learn it [...] but
yeah I hope also that they don't kind of lose sight of other languages they are useful
to learn as well and also Swedish as well you know there's a problem with Swedish
learning at the moment and I hope they don't lose sight of that
J: It’s the language that people want to learn but the problem is it's pushing out
opportunities to learn other languages I think Finland in that sense is going in the
wrong direction I think they are placing much too much emphasis on English OK
I may be making myself redundant as a teacher as I'm saying this but I think there
should be equal opportunity to learn all languages and right now that's not
happening

54

K: I'm a bit concerned as a Fennophile of course because it does seem to be taking
over more and more it seems that the relevance of Finnish as an academic language
and all that is threatened
The main areas the Korean interviewees expressed discontentment about were
an overemphasis on testing and textbook work and a lack of focus on communication
practice. Elise had previous experience of teaching EFL classes that only included
written textbook work and deemed this practice undesirable in EFL education:
I do feel it could be improved […] I came from two different hagwons ok and
this one was a hagwon where somebody came you know and decided this is
the curriculum we are going to use and these are the books we are going to use
and I didn't feel the kids were benefiting much because literally it was all about
textbook and choosing an answer so they didn't do much communication in
that particular hagwon but now this hagwon has got a beautiful system […]
there’s a time for us to write there’s a time for us to speak so it's nicely balanced
whereas my previous hagwon it was more about textbook based you know so
I do feel that there are many other ways that certain hagwons can actually
improve and that is basically by focusing on all aspects of the English language
and not making an excuse of oh no they’re just starting English you know
they’re beginners level and parents want them to focus on the textbook no
there's no such a thing so I really do feel that many other hagwons need to start
focusing on all aspects not just the writing or not just the speaking but all of
them
Callie and Della voiced doubts concerning the potential for increase of English
communicative proficiency in Korea under the current education system:
D: I think at the core like in administration things need to change because then
it will affect the teaching styles and the focus of the teaching and with the
politics of it like testing is so important here over communication so until the
focus is off testing I doubt that there will be a growth in communication
[…]
C: yeah I also think similarly that um because Korean education system is so
based off of college entrance exam primarily the students study to pass that
exam and get into a good college but due to that pressure we are pretty much
forced I would say
D: mhhmm
C: to teach in that same style
Adding further to her and Callie’s previous thoughts, Della noted that she had
observed a pattern of students being unwilling to speak in English for fear of making
mistakes and a lack of teachers encouraging students to try to express themselves in
English. Moreover, she criticised the tendency of Korean teachers of English to switch
to teaching in Korean if their students had difficulty understanding the English content.
Callie expressed frustration over the fact that EFL classes at her school only dedicated
55

time to learning and testing grammar and almost no time was set aside for practising
speaking or sentence patterns. She admitted her school did conduct speaking tests but
as they were solely based on memorisation, she wished they would incorporate
spontaneous conversation in the tests.
Peter and Abigail shared in the other three participants’ criticisms regarding
lack of emphasis on developing strong communicative skills and overemphasis of
testing:
P: my opinion is you shouldn't just focus on a few tests like the TOEIC test
many people just focus on that and the trouble with that is it's an easy [...] copout rather you know you cop out of having to learn how to carry a conversation
because the TOEIC test doesn't require you to be able to make you know do
small talk so some people have very high TOEIC scores but they can’t really
make small talk
A: yes
P: which is a minus if you're going to do business in English if you know you
can't even talk about the weather
A: or travel
P: but you know all these hard words so I would say please don't focus on
TOEIC or even TOEFL focus on communication practice communication
A: yeah there is a testing culture they are big on tests and they don't really test
speaking so the students they want to get a high score so they're not focusing on
speaking and I agree that it would be so much better if they could learn how to
speak to foreigners in a natural sort of everyday small talk level yeah that and
if they were able to I know they'd be do better at speaking and be able to
communicate with foreigners better and business and if they travel abroad
Of the Finnish participants, Jason and Joan also wished for a heavier emphasis on
developing speaking skills in the EFL education, as they had observed a discrepancy
between students’ written and speaking skills:
Jason: I think that as the younger pupils are learning the English that they should
also be given a chance to actually speak it as they are progressing which might
mean a lot more commotion in the classroom but it would be certainly good and
probably not so much control by the teacher probably they need to allow the
students to be a bit more free in using their language skills you know it might be
changing though
Joan: I think put more emphasis on spoken skills in the normal classes definitely
because now that I've been in the university for a couple of years I’ve noticed that
the students their spoken skills are actually quite like almost poor because I don't
think they really get that opportunity to speak so much English and so I think more
emphasis should be placed on spoken English or at least place equal emphasis on
written English reading and speaking because I think [...] it’s very imbalanced and
so I think they should be brought closer together

56

Kassie thought there should be a greater amount of native English-speaking
teaching materials, as she worried errors such as disregard of word order were passed
along to the students from their Finnish teachers. Anne reported having found many
of her students did not really understand the difference between informal, spoken
English and formal, academic written English, and so she concluded it might be
worthwhile to emphasise the distinction more clearly in primary and secondary school.
Nathan felt he did not have a sufficiently comprehensive picture of the EFL education
system in Finland to be able to evaluate any need for improvement, as he had only
taught in schools for a short time. However, he expressed satisfaction with his own
personal experience teaching within it. Charles likewise had mostly praise for the
Finnish education system, but mentioned that some mother tongue teachers are
concerned about the effects of starting foreign language education in the 1st year of
primary school. Overall, he gave the Finnish EFL education system credit: “here we
are trying to it is a constant conversation but it's like let's find the balance of where we
want to go but also [...] lessen the subtractive effects of English teaching”
6.9. Thoughts on teaching English through English (TETE)
In Chapter 2.2. two studies on TETE were presented, one comparing students’
communicative proficiency between those who had received TETE instruction and
those who had been taught EFL through the native language, and another study
comparing university and sixth-grade elementary students’ attitudes towards Englishonly EFL teaching. As detailed previously, the results of the cited studies were
ambiguous, and since the interview participants in this present study all had experience
of using English to a high degree in their EFL teaching as well as limited proficiency
in their students’ L1 in some cases, I hoped their views on the efficacy of TETE might
provide additional insight.
Surprisingly, everyone teaching in Korea exhibited very positive opinions of
TETE, despite some complaints of their students not understanding all of the
instruction. Della and Callie felt it helps learners acquire English in a more natural
way and facilitates growth in communicative skills as it entails greater exposure to
sentence patterns. Furthermore, they believed it prompts students to extract meaning
from spoken English and helps them learn standard AmE inflection:

57

D: I do it helps them to learn more organically whereas if it's spoken in Korean
they have to there’s more thinking involved […] you’re training the brain to
respond in the language that you’re hearing […] so therefore when they learn
in an English spoken only environment I feel like they are more likely to
communicate more often
C: mhhmm
D: and more fluently
C: I agree I think teaching through English it helps even like their
pronunciation for sure […] and I would say it helps sentence patterns definitely
because the students mimic what they hear so if they never hear English and
they can't mimic what the teachers are saying and I would say a big part of
learning a language is listening for meaning not listening to understand every
single word
D: yeah
C: because when you start learning a language you it's just impossible
C: to understand everything
[…]
C: so if you never hear English then you don't get used to hearing the key parts
of the sentence and extrapolating the meaning
D: yes
C: but if they're taught in English then they may not understand everything but
they can at least understand the gist of what's going on
D: and especially because they're learning standard US English and inflection
D&C: is a huge part
D: of communication with us and if they don't hear that they're not going to be
able to be just taught that and if they're not practicing it they're not utilizing it
then they'll never learn how to properly use it
Peter and Abigail supported the use of English for EFL instruction even with
beginners. Peter argued that it familiarises learners to the sounds of English, while
Abigail asserted that it is possible to teach in the target language and still ensure the
input is comprehensible:
P: I definitely think teaching English through English is a better way even from
a very low level even at the beginner’s level even say an adult learning the
language for the first time I would still say try and use as much English as
possible because at the very least you get used to the sounds of English I think
most Koreans even now understand and appreciate the benefits of having a
native speaker or a Korean national teaching English in English definitely I
would say keep the L1 or your native language to a minimum that would be
my opinion
A: yeah cuz I've read too it's like a full immersion and as a way and it's gotta
be comprehensive the input so depending on your students’ level and their age
that what you are teaching them they're able to comprehend so that's why you
can teach only in English you don't need to have their first language to translate
because if you're providing comprehensible input then they are able to learn
the language

58

Elise maintained that TETE is beneficial for helping learners master English and also
encouraged the use of creative tools, such as performing arts, in the EFL learning
setting:
I do because in order for you to learn a language you kind of need to do so
without the aid of your own […] language […] not completely you know you
can have help here and there with certain words and phrases cuz English can
be a very complicated language […] to be honest teaching English as a way of
through immersion like just completely a 110% English once you step into the
classroom is ideal […] in order to produce efficient English speakers although
I also do believe that there are other ways of teaching English like for me
personally performing arts using performing arts to teach English is also
another good way to enhance the learner’s confidence […] there are certain
aspects of drama that could be incorporated in the English classroom
The Finnish participants mostly shared their Korean counterparts’ enthusiasm
for TETE. Joan, Kassie, and Charles found it very effective even for young
beginners, and felt it was the most natural way to introduce English to their students.
Kassie advocated strongly for an immersion setting where English is introduced
through playful activities, because then the learner is able to associate the language
with actions. Joan noted that TETE seemed to motivate her students more:
I think it is yes I think it gives more maybe more motivation for the students to
try harder because they really have to try and understand and I notice this for
example with the 1st graders that some have absolutely no idea what's going
on sometimes and the others you know will help them along well this is what
she meant and this is what we need to do and I think even though it places
pressure on the weaker ones I think it gives them more motivation as well to
try harder and but when you use Finnish in the lessons then I think they get the
idea that oh she speaks Finnish so I don't have to learn as hard you know
because she speaks Finnish anyway and so I think that speaking English gives
them more motivation
Anne and Jason similarly found TETE to work very well for them. They did however
mention that explaining concepts in the students’ L1 can be useful especially with less
experienced learners:
A: I would say it's worked for me even in the past I've had students at all levels
from beginner and it's always been through English and it's been I think it's
worked well I think it's a benefit to have the first language of the students at
least something but I know there's a lot of discussion about native speakerism
at the moment and yeah I think it should be wide open I think whatever works
for the teacher and the students
J: I think for me and the students I have I think it's great it's perfect and the
students like it they've reached a level where I think they want to use their
language and they don't get much opportunity to be in a classroom where
59

English is spoken all the time you know so but of course at the beginning when
you first start out you have to have things explained in Finnish you know so
they so they understand so I think as they progress you know less Finnish
should be spoken and more English but to begin with of course that Finnish
has to be there to explain yeah
Nathan argued that TETE (and immersion in general) is a good method for language
teaching with experienced learners and those learning a language similar to their
mother tongue (such as Swedish speakers learning English), but that beginners whose
L1 is not related to the target language (such as Finnish speakers learning English)
should be taught with the help of their L1. Nathan based his opinion on his own
personal experience attending a beginners’ course in Finnish that was taught entirely
through Finnish, as he found it very challenging to understand the basics of Finnish
when they were not explained in English.
6.10. Thoughts on role as a native-speaking teacher
As previously discussed in chapter 2.2., there has been much discussion both in
academic and layman spheres on what it means to be a native speaker and the role of
the native speaker in foreign and L2 language learning. Llurda (2009) argues that there
is a widespread belief outside the field of applied linguistics that non-native equals
imperfect, and that therefore native speakers are linguistically superior and, by
extension, superior at teaching a language. Furthermore, the dominance of the
Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) method has reinforced this as there has
been an implicit ideology connected with CLT that native speaking teachers are better
able to elicit spontaneous and natural communication. In addition, these ideologies
undermine bi- and multilingualism and ignore the fact that not all language users fit
neatly into either category. However, recent research on non-native speaking teachers
has shown that the shared experience these teachers have with their students of
learning the language may be more valuable than the absolute knowledge of the
language native speakers can be presumed to have (Llurda, 2009).
In light of these findings, it is interesting to examine how NESTs view their
own identity as a native-speaking teacher. Five of the Finnish participants and two of
the Korean participants were asked whether they thought they had something to offer
as native speakers of English that was different than a Finnish or Korean native had to
offer. Thus, they were not asked whether they thought themselves to be better than a
60

non-native speaker, rather, whether they thought they had any unique strengths. The
most frequently mentioned advantage of a NEST was their ability to introduce cultural
knowledge to the students. This was mentioned by all five of the Finnish participants
(Nathan, Charles, Anne, Joan, and Kassie) and both of the Korean participants
(Della and Callie) who responded to the question. In addition, Abigail also pointed
this out in response to another question. Some thoughts on this were:
Callie: [l]anguage is not isolated from the cultures from which it proceeds, rather
the two are interwoven. Native teachers expose students to not only the language,
but also to at least one of the cultures associated with it. This, in turn, encourages
deeper understanding of the language itself.
Anne: I wouldn't say I have anything better but yeah maybe different and it's not
really a language thing it's more a cultural thing I think students are often interested
in you know how something might be said or done in my own country [...] so no
not in terms of language but maybe in terms of cultural meaning
Joan: there are cultural aspects behind certain expressions or words or something
that [Finnish teachers] don't necessarily know
Kassie: there are so many things that you want to explain just like culturally as
well sort of different ways of doing and being and such and the you know range of
words and the range of usage [...] it’s genuinely communicating a different culture
a different way of being [...] I think it's really important and you know English as
a language is used in so many different countries so many different cultures so I
think that it's really important to be able to sort of bring in some of that kind of
difference you know about different ways of being [...] that language is a tool to a
different culture to understanding a different world and I think that's what I want
to teach
Another frequently mentioned strength was the nuanced understanding of the
language and how words and phrases are used. Nathan concluded that “it's better to
have a qualified native speaker because they know the language more”, and Callie
argued that “native teachers can help students know what vocabulary is currently being
used and in which situations. Foreign teachers will not be able to do this unless they
have lived for a long time in an English-speaking country”. Joan also related having
noticed some of her native Finnish colleagues misusing certain words and
compounding words that are not compounds in English, as well as not having a deeper
understanding of why certain expressions are different in different contexts, despite
their generally high competence in English. Della expressed similar sentiments by
stating
[u]nless the teacher has lived in a native speaking country for several years, it is
unlikely they will understand nuances and terminology associated with using that
61

language fluently. This is primarily because the vernacular within each language
can vary so vastly, even within a country
Della admitted that “native speakers are not all knowledgeable and might miss or be
unaware of the language used within a specific region” but concluded that they can
still provide thorough insight into the areas of language use they are familiar with.
Other mentioned strengths mentioned were the ability to teach native
pronunciation, that having a NEST encouraged students to use and develop their
English more, and better ability to teach cadence, stress, and the correct use of articles.
The ability to teach native pronunciation was brought up by Callie, who stated that
“[n]ative speakers can teach and expose children to native pronunciation. They can
also correct the students when they think they are pronouncing something correctly,
but are not. [...] A native teacher notices these differences right away and can correct
the students”. Additionally, Abigail mentioned in an answer to another question that
“that is why they have native speakers here so they can learn speaking from a native
teacher so they can learn the correct pronunciation in the natural way”. Similarly,
Callie and Abigail also felt that students were more motivated to use English with
NESTs. Abigail observed that
when they have Korean teachers the kids naturally just wanna speak Korean and
even where I'm working my Korean teachers always have a hard time getting
Korean kids to speak in English cuz they say oh you're a Korean teacher so you
speak Korean so I'm gonna speak Korean to you but when I'm a foreign teacher
it's very easy to say you can only speak English because I can't speak Korean so it
gives them a motivation to speak English
Callie expressed similar thoughts, saying that “Students have to try harder to actually
use English and correct pronunciation with a native teacher, since they cannot just
speak to the teacher in Korean or in Korean pronunciation. This encourages students
to both use and improve their skills”. Joan did not specifically mention NESTs, but
did argue in her response to the question on thoughts on TETE that “When you use
Finnish in the lessons I think they get the idea that oh she speaks Finnish so I don't
have to learn as hard because she speaks Finnish anyway and so I think that speaking
English gives them more motivation”. Callie discussed the advantage of having a
NEST to teach cadence, stress and correct use of articles:
[n]ative teachers can teach students natural cadence and stress, which greatly aids
in the students’ English being understandable. They can also teach the students
where to put stress in a sentence and where to use certain reductions. [...] Native
teachers know right away when an article is misused and can correct students.
62

Some of the teachers in Finland also touched upon the issue of putting undue
emphasis on being a native-speaking teacher. Nathan argued that it is important the
native speaker is qualified to teach because
there's a lot of native speakers who get jobs teaching just on the basis that they’re
a native speaker which isn't right I think that's stupid because just because you’re
a native speaker first of all doesn't mean that you can speak it ‘properly’ you may
not speak a standard [...] you might speak ‘bad’ English even if you're a native
speaker and then secondly it doesn't mean you can teach it just because you can
speak it
Charles and Anne noted they did not see any difference in teaching competence
between themselves and their Finnish colleagues. Charles further expressed his
frustration at the favouritism in job hiring related to English skills, concluding his only
real strength as a NEST is the confidence he has in his English skills:
I know for certain cuz I work with translators and editors that they have excellent
English [...] and I hate that when [...] I can see where native speakers or people
with a native name are given work and things that could just as easily go to a
Swedish or Finnish translator who will do possibly a better job actually [...] which
isn't right [...] if there is anything that... my advantages in teaching come from my
mistakes in learning languages and kind of my acceptance my tolerance [...] but I
don’t think that has anything to do really with my being a native English speaker
[...] my Finnish colleagues have said [...] that sometimes it’s the confidence that I
can just keep talking [...] I don't have that little ghost inside my head saying oh I
don't know if that's the right conjugation [...] the majority of the people I work with
are educated in Finland and so I don't see a difference [...] in Finland we have very
strict rules on classroom teachers

7. Thematic analysis of prominent ideologies and assumptions
Many of the interesting and relevant themes identified in the interview data were
various ideologies and assumptions related to (1) the spheres and functions English
has in the world today, (2) EFL learners and (3) how these teachers positioned
themselves as native speakers of English teaching EFL. The following ideologies and
assumptions were identified in the data, and deserve more detailed discussion: 1.
English is not readily spoken by Korean and Finnish EFL learners in class, 2. English
is a global language, 3. English is threatening other languages in Finland, 4. Local
English varieties are a positive development, 5. Local English varieties are less
legitimate, and 6. English is learned (primarily) to interact with native speakers. In
addition, other assumptions regarding potential incentives of their students to learn
English are discussed in 7.7.
7.1. Korean and Finnish EFL Learners often appear unwilling to speak
English in class
One theme which was very prominent in both the Korean and the Finnish data was a
seeming unwillingness of students to speak English in class, which the teachers
perceived to be due to incompetence, shyness, or general unwillingness. In fact, the
only participants not to mention it at all were Elise in Korea and Charles in Finland.
Della and Callie blamed it primarily on the lack of focus on speaking practice in the
curriculum and the pressure the Korean education system places on the students. On
the Finnish side, Joan also maintained it was due to insufficient instruction in
communicative skills, as she noted a clear difference in willingness to speak between
her CLIL classes and her standard EFL classes:
C: they're exposed to English many of the students will have English 2 to 4
times a week [...] but in almost none of those classes do they have speaking
time [..] so they need to practice in English but they don’t get the opportunity
to
[..]
D: right
or if they do learn them it's not encouraged for them to make mistakes
[...]
C: true

64

D: and therefore if they do learn it like [Callie] said they're not practicing it
and if they do make a mistake then from there that discourages them and then
they don't want to try anymore
[...]
C: there is a big pressure in Korea to be perfect
D: yeah
[...]
C: I think that comes across in a lot of different areas but definitely in the
English curriculum
D: I agree
C: the students who speak in class are usually the top students
D: yeah
[...]
C: and the other students only speak in Korean
J: you can see the difference between the language classes and the normal
classes because the kids in the language classes they're just really spontaneous
whereas the ones in the normal classes they’re a bit more timid they don't want
to be heard making a mistake or something so they're very conscientious about
this speaking
Abigail and Peter in Korea, and Anne and Jason in Finland theorised it was
due to culture, although Jason speculated that the education system might also be
partly to blame. Anne, who had taught in Asian countries such as China and Vietnam,
drew a comparison with her experiences there:
something that I was surprised about was the reticence to speak I worked in
Asia where you get the stereotypical image of quiet students and I find actually
here some were very quiet and you might ask a question and you would get
silence it's not because they don't know they it’s you know they don't really
want to speak up [...] that did surprise me actually the quietness and then you
get to know them and you kind of make a joke about you know the Finnish you
know style of being quiet and only saying something when you really need to
but yeah I encourage them to speak up
In Nathan’s (Finnish) experience the hesitance to speak was likewise not necessarily
a question of incompetence:
there were still quite a wide gap between not necessarily in the levels of although
of course there was a difference in their ability but also in their willingness to use
English that was a bit of a surprise to me cuz I was under the impression that all
teenagers would be happy speaking English and kind of find it easy to do but even
if on a written test they got quite a good score that didn't necessarily mean they
were able to communicate effectively verbally [...] they just didn't want to say
anything [...] either they were too shy or too cool or whatever to actually use it in
class
It seems very likely that ideologies related to Anglo-American modes of language use
and cultural behaviour as well as stereotypes about Korean and Finnish culture and
65

people lie behind many of these comments, especially as cultural differences were
commonly cited as a reason for the perceived unwillingness of students to
communicate in English. Jokes and anecdotes about Finnish or Korean ‘shyness’ and
‘modesty’ are numerous and are often contrasted with a stereotypically AngloAmerican ‘easy-going’ approach and tendency to exaggerate or ‘show-off’. As
mentioned in chapter 3.2. the ability to communicate spontaneously and on one’s own
initiative was generally valued highly by the interviewed NESTs, which could in part
be a reflection of Anglo-American cultural norms.
7.2. Ideologies related to English as a global language
The ideology that English is a global language and therefore should be understood and
spoken by a global community with diverse varieties was evident in answers given by
Peter, Abigail, and Elise out of the Korean participants and Nathan, Charles and
Kassie out of the Finnish participants. Peter and Abigail believed in the concept of
English as an international language (EIL) and showed support for the continued
development of new varieties of World Englishes:
P: definitely they can choose whatever accent they want and in terms of the
way EFL is going there's now a concept of International English you don’t
really need to speak like an American or British person
A: yeah
P: as long as you can communicate and people understand you it's not a
problem to have an accent so yeah my students are free to choose whatever
they want to
[...]
A: same here most important thing is that they can communicate and you can
understand it doesn't matter how they sound
[...]
A: yeah cuz you just even look at how much English has changed in other
countries every country is developing their own unique style English like if you
look at even New Zealand has its own English words that Americans don't
know and it's going to happen in countries all over the world as it becomes
international all countries are going to make up new English words new ways
of saying things yeah I don't think it's wrong either
Elise displayed an assumption that English has a global reach as a language by
stating “to be honest English is an international language and you cannot go anywhere
in the world and they don’t know how to speak English or at least understand the
English language”. Nathan from the Finnish side merely mentioned “the importance
66

of English in the global situation isn't going to decrease anytime soon”. Charles and
Kassie argued for the importance of adequate representation of other varieties besides
standard AmE and BrE, especially traditionally stigmatised or delegitimised varieties,
and were pleased that the latest Finnish EFL textbooks in use in their schools featured
a wider range of varieties:
C: the latest set has definitely has more International English or World Englishes
[...] they've always had things about Australia and the UK and Canada and the
United States but the last even actually the previous edition [...] had information
on India and South Africa but I the latest instalment [...] I wanna say that they've
been a little bit better about putting other accents on the recordings as well as
acknowledging that there's a lot of people speaking different kinds of English but
I'd say like even let’s say three generations of these books ago [...] when I first
came [...] it's definitely from the UK of course they had some American accents
but I think it's been neat to hear like for example they some of the listening
exercises for the say 5th and 6th graders actually had very thick Indian accent
recordings and things like that I say that's cool because in other cases [...] they
might have filtered that out and said well that’s we don't want the kids learning
that and I think it’s good that's your learning reality [...] that you are going to be
communicating with [...] all kinds of varieties and [...] you respect and understand
that [...] I think that English education in general has kind of come to acknowledge
that there are tons of varieties
K: luckily the materials that we use it's a new book series that has a nice variety of
English there so one of the things we've been looking at just now is Indian English
which is great and at the same time I notice that the students they burst into laughter
straight away when they heard the Indian accent so we had a discussion about it I
feel quite passionate about that I feel it’s important to not value the RP over other
varieties
7.3. English is threatening other languages in Finland
In the Finnish data, three participants (Nathan, Joan, and Kassie) suggested English
is taking over foreign and L2 language teaching and even sabotaging the Finnish
language in Finland. Nathan hoped Finnish education providers and students would
not neglect the learning of other languages, such as Swedish (in the case of the Finnishspeaking majority):
I hope that they encourage other languages to be learned as well I think it's a little
bit boring when everyone concentrates so much on English although of course
globally it's an important language to learn and yeah people should learn it [...] but
yeah I hope also that they don't kind of lose sight of other languages they are useful
to learn as well and also Swedish as well you know there's a problem with Swedish
learning at the moment and I hope they don't lose sight of that

67

Joan also noted that many more opportunities are provided for learning English in
Finnish schools than other foreign languages, although technically the primary (A1)
L2 language can be any foreign language or even the second national language
(Finnish National Agency for Education, 2014):
It’s the language that people want to learn but the problem is it's pushing out
opportunities to learn other languages I think Finland in that sense is going in the
wrong direction I think they are placing much too much emphasis on English OK
I may be making myself redundant as a teacher as I'm saying this but I think there
should be equal opportunity to learn all languages and right now that's not
happening
Kassie mentioned the ever-increasing use of English in the academic world:
I'm a bit concerned as a Fennophile of course because it does seem to be taking
over more and more it seems that the relevance of Finnish as an academic
language and all that is threatened
No corresponding ideology could be identified in the Korean data, despite similar
concerns that English is jeopardising the integrity and vitality of the Korean language
expressed by some Koreans (Park SY, 2009). Two potential reasons for this are an
arguably higher integration of English in Finland and the smaller number of Finnish
speakers, which would make English a greater threat for Finnish. Additionally, the
group of interviewed NESTs in Finland were on average more integrated into Finnish
society than their Korean counterparts, and therefore can be thought to have a greater
concern or at least awareness of the issue.
7.4. Local English varieties are a positive development
Related to the previously discussed ideologies concerning English as a global language
is seeing localised Expanding Circle English(es) in a positive light. Peter and Abigail
(Korea) both had very positive views concerning Koreanised English:
A: and I think even a lot of students these days they might be speaking when
they're older you know Korean English using a Korean accent which is
absolutely fine because I've spoken to a lot of Korean people speaking English
and they don't have another foreign accent but they’re very easy to understand
can communicate really well
[...]
P: I don't want to denigrate the use of English in Korean because that’s their
language they can use it however they want
A: yeah cuz you just even look at how much English has changed in other
countries every country is developing their even their own unique style English
68

[...] I think it’s great that countries develop their own English as well in their
own country
7.5. Local English varieties are less legitimate
On the other hand, there were also statements given by two Korean participants (Della
and Callie) that indicated seeing the Koreanised use of English as less legitimate and
less intelligible than the English used by speakers from Inner Circle countries:
D: so if I use any type of Konglish they’ll think that's okay and that's how
everyone speaks and so I try to counter that and not use it
[...]
C: yes [Konglish] 100% affects their accents I really have to work hard to
unteach that accent the Korean
D: yeah
[...]
C: [n]ative teachers can teach students natural cadence and stress, which
greatly aids in the students’ English being understandable. [...] Students have
to try harder to actually use English and correct pronunciation with a native
teacher, since they cannot just speak to the teacher in Korean or in Korean
pronunciation
One Finnish participant (Joan) found it hard to accept anglicisms in Finnish where
semantic shift has occurred, feeling they are being used ‘wrong’: “I have to say it really
irritates me because sometimes because they get the nuances of the meaning wrong
[...] they're using it wrong and then that becomes a pattern [..] and it's like you guys
are using this wrong you know you don't use it like this”.
7.6. English is learned to interact with native speakers
The ideology that English is learned by EFL learners in order to interact with native
speakers of English arose in Della’s and Callie’s (Korea) answers as a (perhaps
implicit) assumption:
C: I think because I live in Korea it's easy for me to figure out what a lot of
Konglish words mean but I think if they were to just go to an English-speaking
country and use those words maybe about half would be understood right away
but half because people don't know the Korean culture I think could really be
confusing for native speakers
[...]
C: if they're taught in English then they may not understand everything but they
can at least understand the gist of what's going on
D: and especially because they're learning standard US English and inflection
69

D&C: is a huge part
D: of communication with us and if they don't hear that they're not going to be
able to be just taught that and if they're not practicing it they're not utilising it
then they'll never learn how to properly use it
This ideology may be partially fostered by the EFL education ideology they are
surrounded by, as Della mentioned elsewhere that her school wanted her to give the
students “a full American English experience”. Abigail also brought up some of the
reasons Korean schools may want to have at least one NEST: “that is why they have
native speakers here so they can learn speaking from a native teacher so they can learn
the correct pronunciation in the natural way and it gives them an opportunity to hear
[...] a native English speaker and learn from a native English speaker”. Abigail’s
statement furthermore is highly ideologically normative, as it presupposes there is a
‘correct pronunciation’ which is the pronunciation of a native speaker. Jeon’s (2015)
study on the effects of playing an online game in English indicates that the Korean
EFL education may disproportionately emphasise native English speakers, especially
AmE speakers, as the principal users of English (see chapter 3.2.); Ahn & Kang’s
(2016) study likewise suggests this may be the case (see chapter 2.2.).
Ranta’s (2010) study indicates that both teachers and students in Finland are
generally well aware of the global, lingua franca nature of English and view English
first and foremost as an instrumental means of communication between speakers of
different L1 languages. Notwithstanding, Namgung (2016) found in a comparative
study of a Korean and Finnish EFL textbook series that the Finnish textbooks
discussed native English-speaking culture more than the Korean textbooks.
Additionally, both teachers and students in Ranta’s (2010) study noted that the
curriculum placed heavy emphasis on AmE and BrE. In the results of the present study,
the Finland-based interviewees indicated the presence of a higher number of different
varieties of English in the EFL curriculum than the teachers based in Korea, who
mostly noted the prevalence of AmE.
Another factor to consider is the current prevalence of American pop culture,
and thereby content featuring AmE, internationally. Given that AmE has been, and to
an extent remains, the dominant variety in Korean EFL education, AmE may be the
English(es) a majority of Korean EFL learners are most exposed to, besides Korean
English. Callie also mentioned her students being generally unfamiliar with British
spelling, which would indicate they are not exposed to written BrE in any case. In the
70

case of Finnish EFL education, where BrE has traditionally been the dominant variety
(although, as evident from the results of this study, this dominance is greatly
diminished), it can be hypothesised that although EFL learners in Finland have in the
past encountered mostly British English in the classroom, they have still been exposed
to AmE outside of it through popular culture. Thus, there has been less of a hegemony
of one variety of English in Finland than in Korea. Furthermore, it must not be
forgotten that South Korea has been more closely involved politically and militarily
with the USA than Finland has been with any one English-speaking country. These
factors may well be an influence on how the ownership of English is constructed by
education providers and EFL learners/users in these two countries.
7.7. Assumptions regarding uses of English
A number of the interviewees also expressed other assumptions they had regarding
what their students learn English for. The identified assumptions were, as shown in
table 4, that English is useful for professional purposes, studying abroad, academic
success, traveling, communicating with people from other countries, and
communicating with native English speakers. Using English for professional purposes
was mentioned by Abigail and Peter in Korea and Nathan, Jason, and Joan in
Finland, mainly in relation to doing business in English. Joan pointed out that English
is the corporate language of several companies in Finland. Abigail in Korea and Joan
in Finland mentioned studying abroad as a common incentive for young EFL learners
in Korea and Finland:
A: yeah for universities so they can study because many want to study abroad
in universities they need a higher command of English
J: many of the kids they want to go abroad to study and that's also kind of a
motivation to learn it
Communicating with people from other countries and traveling were closely
connected contexts for using English and were brought up by Abigail in Korea and
Anne in Finland. The idea that English is learned to communicate with native speakers
of English, which was discussed in depth in the previous chapter, was evident in the
interview with Callie and Della. Another theme only present in the Korean data was
learning English for academic success, as Peter discussed the fact that passing an
English proficiency test is often a requirement to graduate university in Korea, which
71

creates an incentive for students to learn English to perform well in these tests. Apart
from the two last discussed incentives, the purposes for learning English appear similar
in both contexts.

8. Discussion of Interview Results
This chapter will present an overview of the ideologies directly related to the interview
questions which are particularly relevant to the research questions of this study,
namely:
1.What attitudes and experiences do NESTs in Korea and Finland have regarding
Korean/Finnish EFL education, the English proficiency of their students and how their
students should learn English, the global presence of English, and their role as NESTs?
2. In what respects are the attitudes displayed and experiences related similar between
the Korean and the Finnish contexts, and in what respects are they different? What do
these similarities and differences reveal about EFL education and the presence of
English in these two countries?
The following models were created to summarise the main findings regarding each
part of the questions.

As can be seen from the models, the perception of a heavier focus on written
proficiency as well as a desire to see more investment in improving students’
communicative skills and encouraging them to engage in verbal communication in
English during classroom time were common themes between the Korean and Finnish
data. The perceptions of a stronger emphasis on written proficiency match the
requirements of the SAT exam in Korea and the matriculation exam in Finland. The
greater portion of the exams test reading comprehension and grammatical knowledge,
in addition to a short written essay in the Finnish matriculation exam. A listening
comprehension segment is included, but spoken skills of the students are not tested in
either exam (Yle, 2021; Korea Educational Broadcasting System, 2021). In addition,
a number of the interviewed NESTs in both studied contexts commented on the
unwillingness of students to speak, which would explain why there was a desire to
encourage students to engage in speaking English more.
Regarding the other desires for improvement, less focus on testing was
mentioned by all the Korean participants whereas as it was not brought up by the
Finnish participants, indicating that there is indeed a stronger testing culture in Korea.
Namgung (2016) also points out the frequent use of national testing in Korea (see
chapter 3.1.) On the other hand, national testing is not commonly practiced in the
Finnish school system. This heavier focus on testing and demonstration of memorised
74

learning in Korean education is likely linked an overall more competitive, hierarchical
society.
Two of the Finnish participants (Nathan and Charles) expressed a high level
of appreciation for the Finnish EFL education system. Of the Korean participants,
Elise was pleased with the curriculum used at her hagwon, but remained sceptical of
the Korean EFL education system at large, as were the other Korean participants. The
desires for more distinction between formal and informal language and including more
authentic English-speaking materials in the Finnish data were mentioned by just one
interviewee each, and no corresponding statements could be identified in the rest of
either data. As detailed in chapter 6.5., there appears to be a difference in the varieties
featured in the Korean and Finnish curricula, with the greatest diversity of varieties in
the Finnish comprehensive school curriculum. An interesting finding in the Finnish
data was that students often seem to prefer American spelling and pronunciation
despite a potentially heavier emphasis on BrE in the curriculum, something noted by
Anne, Charles, Jason, Joan and Kassie. The main reason given for this was the
popularity of American pop culture.

It is evident from the national educational policies of Korea and Finland (see
chapters 3 and 4) as well as the data collected in this study that English is learned from
a young age in both countries. Regarding the ability to understand and follow targetlanguage instruction, those teaching younger students in Finland reported more
struggles with this than those teaching older students. However, in the Korean data it
was not possible to identify any clear pattern among the responses, although Callie did
mention it being a bigger problem for students who had transferred for middle school
and did not begin learning English as early as the students who began their education
at her school.
In terms of linguistic struggles faced by students learning English,
prepositions, word order and pronunciation were brought up by teachers in both the
Korean and Finnish data. Struggles present only in the Korean data were struggles with
English verb tenses and asking questions, and struggles only present in the Finnish
data were intonation and rhythm, and the use of articles. Verb tenses in Finnish are
arguably more similar to verb tenses in English (both languages use present, past,
present perfect and past perfect tenses in a similar manner) than Korean verb tenses
(the most commonly used tenses are the present, imperfect and future tenses. The past
76

perfect tense exists but is not as commonly used). On the other hand, both Korean and
English have commonly used, distinctive forms for expressing future, while Finnish
does not. Regarding asking questions, intonation and rhythm, and the use of articles,
both languages differ markedly from English and based on personal observation, the
conventions governing these aspects in English can be difficult for both Korean and
Finnish EFL users to adapt to. Therefore, the mention of them in only one context and
not the other may be due to the small number of participants.
A difference in attitudes toward the English proficiency levels of students is
noticeable when comparing the Korean and Finnish data. The attitudes among the
Korean participants were either negative (three participants) or neutral (two
participants), whereas among the Finnish participants they were either neutral (three
participants) or positive (three participants). A possible reason for this difference in
perception in the Korean and Finnish data could be the relatively greater experience of
the teachers interviewed in Finland, as the more experienced teachers in the Korean
data (Abigail and Peter) also had less negative perceptions of their students’ English.
Other factors could be a potentially more successful integration of communication
practice in Finnish EFL education (see Kim, 2020 and Namgung, 2016 in chapter 4)
and potentially higher amounts of exposure to and opportunities to use English for
children and young people in Finland.
The perceived unwillingness of Korean and Finnish students to speak English
is discussed in detail in chapter 7.1. However, the idea that it was due to some kind of
incompetence appears stronger in the Korean data, as exemplified by the following
quotes:
Peter: some people have very high TOEIC scores but they can’t really make
small talk
Callie: but many of them write English they do a lot of writing or reading but
they can hardly even hold a conversation
[...]
Della: even the very very basic questions like what's your name can sometimes
be met with a blank stare
These evaluations of incompetence carry certain ideological and cultural expectations
within them, as these interviewees evidently conceptualised the ability to communicate
according to Anglo-American conventions (e.g. Peter’s comment about “making
small talk”) as an important part of competence in English. Although Joan in Finland
also noted having observed that Finnish university students’ speaking skills “are
77

actually almost poor”, other teachers, such as Nathan and Anne, specified they did
not believe the quietness was due to incompetence. Anne even praised her students’
overall English skills as being the best out of all the countries she had worked in.
Incidentally, Anne and Joan were referring to students at the same university in their
interviews. Regarding motivation to use English and consume English-language
content outside the classroom, Finnish students were described as being more
motivated than Korean students (see chapter 6.6.). However, only two of the Korean
participants answered the question regarding this as opposed to five Finnish
participants. Furthermore, these Korean participants taught in a rural school (Della)
and a private Christian school (Callie), whereas all the Finnish participants besides
Nathan taught or had taught in urban areas and everyone teaching at the
comprehensive or upper-secondary level did so within the public school system. These
factors may well skew the data in this direction.
An additional variable that was identifiable in the Finnish data was the
comparison between how Finnish-speaking and Swedish-speaking students in Finland
learn English. Nathan and Charles, who had experience teaching and interacting with
both, concluded that Swedish speakers have a natural advantage when it comes to
acquiring English, due to the greater similarities of the languages:
N: I'd say in general Swedish speakers probably find it easier to start learning
English [... just given that many words are more similar in Swedish and the
grammar’s more similar it's just a more similar language [...] so I think it's
inevitable that there will be some difference but I wouldn't necessarily say that
that is the case for my teaching
C: I definitely notice if I look at the students I notice a clear benefit for those
students who speak Swedish in their English it doesn't mean that there aren't
Finnish students who aren’t doing brilliantly it just means that overall you can
tell that they definitely benefit from Swedish

In the Korean data, English was clearly the preferred language of instruction, as only
one participant (Callie) reported using the local L1 as a primary language of
instruction, and even in her case, only with her younger learners. In the Finnish data,
79

the use of English vs. the students’ L1 was more balanced: three used English as the
language of instruction while three used both English and Finnish. Knowledge of the
local language(s) was also higher among the Finnish participants, as four out of six
reported having either good or excellent skills in Finnish or Swedish, as opposed to
two participants out of five having good skills in Korean in the Korean data. No doubt
this is a factor contributing to the higher use of local L1 in EFL teaching in the Finnish
data. As stated in chapter 6.1., the teacher’s level of proficiency in the students’ L1
and the EFL proficiency level and age of their students appear to be the most decisive
factors behind choice of the language of instruction in both sets of data. However, the
ideals of the EFL education policies in Korea and Finland (both emphasise the use of
the CLT method in EFL education; Kim: 2020) and of the schools the participants
worked in as well as their own personal attitudes towards TETE may well have an
influence as well.
Regarding attitudes concerning TETE, they were generally positive in both the
Korean and Finnish data. Of the Finnish participants, Nathan, Jason and Anne
indicated that TETE is potentially more effective with more experienced learners,
particularly if their L1 is very different from English (Nathan). The other participants
in Korea and Finland believed it was effective regardless of the learners’ level or age.
The main justifications for this belief were the ideas that it facilitates a more organic
learning process, as it mimics the way children learn how to speak their L1, and that it
encourages learners to produce more spoken English.
Regarding inclusion of different varieties in the EFL curriculum, two of the
Finnish interviewees (Charles and Kassie) explicitly stated they thought introducing
a number of different varieties of English was important. Besides them, a number of
teachers both in Finland and Korea reported introducing additional varieties besides
their own in the classroom. Overall, most of the interviewed teachers demonstrated an
awareness of the plurality of English and considered introducing this plurality as a part
of teaching EFL. Everyone except Charles believed their students should be consistent
in their choice of spelling variety, even though all the Finnish participants and three of
the Korean participants allowed their students to choose what variety of English they
wanted to use. The most commonly stated suggestions for improvements in Korean
and Finnish EFL education were giving more attention to communication practice and
in Korea lessening the focus on testing. These, along with the other suggested
improvements, are discussed at more length in chapters 8.1. and 6.8.
80

Finally, several of the interviewed teachers acknowledged their belief that
NESTs have unique strengths as teachers and that hearing native speakers of English
can help EFL students learn certain aspects of English. The interviewees’
conceptualisation of their role as NESTs will be illustrated and discussed below.

As detailed in chapter 6.11., the ability of NESTs to introduce culture was the most
frequently brought up asset of NESTs in both Korea and Finland. It is interesting to
compare this finding to Kayman’s (2004) arguments discussed in chapter 2.1. that
English cannot be learned or used in a purely instrumental way or completely removed
from a cultural context. Nuanced understanding of the English language was the next
most commonly mentioned strength of NESTs. Abigail and Callie in Korea noted that
NESTs seem to be able to encourage EFL learners to speak English more, as well as
help them learn standard pronunciation. Callie also argued that the example of native
English in terms of cadence, stress and article use that NESTs provide is an asset in
EFL teaching. In the Finnish data, ambivalence regarding the role of NESTs was more
evident, although Kassie wondered if having learners constantly exposed to incorrect
word order, etc. by Finnish EFL teachers made these errors more ingrained in the
students, an idea that echoes Krashen’s theory of comprehensible input – where
‘faulty’ input can be seen as a ‘contamination’ in the process of language acquisition.
On the other hand, Nathan and Charles felt NESTs were often overrated as EFL
teachers as well as translators,. It should be noted that they were both pursuing a degree
in English Language and Literature that included courses related to these questions,
which may have prompted this awareness. Anne and Charles furthermore stressed
they saw their Finnish colleagues as equally competent EFL teachers. Charles thereby
concluded his only strength as a NEST was his confidence in using the English
language without having to worry about the correctness of his English.
The higher ambivalence present in the Finnish data is an interesting finding,
which could potentially be a result of the seemingly higher integration of English in
Finnish society, and subsequently a higher level of proficiency in English, that has
become evident throughout this thesis. It is also important to note that Finland does
not have a particular governmental program for hiring NESTs as Korea has, indicating
that NESTs may not have the same function or prestige in Finnish EFL education as
in Korean EFL education. Other factors could be the personal views of the
interviewees and the fact that the Finnish participants were in general not only more
experienced EFL teachers but also more familiar with Finland and its local languages
and cultures.

82

9. Conclusion
The purpose of this thesis was to present a comparative case study of EFL education
in South Korea and Finland, from the perspective of NESTs teaching in these two
countries. Its aim was to study the attitudes and experiences NESTs teaching in these
two EFL contexts had concerning the respective EFL education systems, their
students’ proficiency in English and how EFL should be taught, the global presence of
English, and their roles as NESTs in an EFL teaching context, analysing the various
ideologies and assumptions the participants had regarding these issues. The purpose
was not only to compare the South Korean and Finnish contexts with each other but
also see how comparable the experiences and attitudes were between NESTs teaching
in different types of institutions and with different backgrounds within each respective
country. The various similarities in South Korea and Finland as contexts and the
simultaneous gap in international rankings of English proficiency levels between
Finnish and Korean EFL learners acted as the primary justification for the comparison
between the two countries.
This study clearly has various limitations, such as the very small number of
participants, the wide range of teaching experiences and backgrounds of the
participants, and the difficulty in comparing experiences between different teaching
contexts, both in terms of type of learning institution and the level taught, as well as
between the two larger EFL contexts of South Korea and Finland focused on in this
study. The lack of comparability between previous research on the presence of English
in Korea and Finland, as is evident particularly in chapters 3 and 4, is an additional
limitation, as it makes the comparisons between these two contexts in this thesis more
problematic and less objective. Also, due to the loosely structured format of the
interviews conducted and the employment of thematic analysis in studying the data,
the conclusions drawn are ultimately highly interpretative and specific and cannot be
taken as solid evidence of any general patterns. Additionally, in the cases where
participants were interviewed together (Abigail and Peter as well as Della and Callie)
it is noticeable that they influenced each other’s responses to some extent.
Notwithstanding, the results of this study do support pre-existing research on
EFL teaching in Korea and Finland and on trends within EFL teaching at large, despite
the disparities between and within the studied groups and the limitations of the study
format, as they provide further evidence to indicate the following: The EFL education
83

systems of the two nations studied appear to be shifting from a system centred around
proficiency in reading and writing towards one that values oral communicative skills,
as the opportunities (and necessity) for international communication in English have
become increasingly relevant. As the global presence of English and its uses as a lingua
franca have become more tangible, it is becoming more present in EFL education. One
practical example of this is the increased number of varieties of English being featured
in the curricula. These developments put NESTs in a somewhat paradoxical position.
On the one hand, a higher emphasis on communicative skills appears to be tied to an
increased desire to hire native speakers of English to teach these skills (c.f. Llurda,
2009). On the other hand, the conceptualisation of English as a global lingua franca
devalues the prestige of native speakers of English and their ownership of the
language. Of course, both of these dimensions are equally ideological, as Kayman
(2004) reminds us: the acquisition of English can never be purely instrumental or
removed from culture or ideology, whether ENL speakers and culture are emphasised
or using English as a means of global communication is emphasised.
Furthermore, being exposed to English via digital media and popular culture is
increasingly common even in EFL contexts. This means EFL education provided by
schools and academies is no longer the only, or perhaps even the primary medium
through which English skills are acquired. It also means the labelling of English as a
foreign language in these contexts is becoming inaccurate, and the lines between the
circles in Kachru’s model are increasingly blurred. This raises questions about how
best to structure formal EFL education so that it can complement this informal
acquisition of English whilst simultaneously reflecting the characteristics of English
use in today’s world. It also raises questions concerning the role NESTs have to play
in EFL education.
Based on this study, these trends can be identified in both Korean and Finnish EFL
teaching. It appears, however, that they are stronger within Finland. One plausible
hypothesis for this is that as English was solidified as a primary school subject earlier
than in Korea, Finland is slightly further along in the process of internalising English
as its own medium, for its own purposes, which simultaneously results in the
construction of NESTs as the owners of English being less prominent. Also, the
absence of such a heavy emphasis on testing and quantifiable academic success and
less competitive and hierarchical social structures have arguably made the transition
from a more written-based approach to a more communication-based one smoother in
84

the Finnish context and aided in causing the language to infiltrate society on a more
grassroot level. It can also be hypothesised that Finnish society is more ready to
associate itself with English-language culture than Korean society, leading to a higher
level of integration of the English language not just in a physical sense but on an
ideological level as well. There may be many reasons for this but a few notable ones
could be a greater exposure to and demand for English-language media content as well
as more solidified co-operation and interaction in English in the European geographic
region. Other socio-cultural and historical factors are doubtless at play as well, such as
the two nations’ different relationships with ENL countries and Finland’s longstanding bilingualism.
In light of this, it is fascinating to note how similar the Korean SAT exam and the
Finnish matriculation exam for English are (Yle, 2021; Korea Educational
Broadcasting System, 2021), indicating that formal assessment methods have not
‘caught up’ with the developments in society at large, and especially in Korea, may
well be inhibiting the evolution of English in the region in this direction due to the
importance placed on them. The opinions expressed by the participants of the Korean
interviews support this hypothesis.
Based on the background literature and the interview data of this study, it appears
that the increased desire to hire native speakers of English as EFL teachers is more
emphasised in Korean EFL education, whereas the conceptualisation of English as a
global lingua franca is more prominent in the Finnish landscape. This could at least in
part explain why the Korean participants in general emphasised their role as NESTs
more and were more likely to associate English with native speakers of the language,
whereas the Finnish participants were less likely to differentiate themselves from their
local colleagues and tended to emphasise the use of English as an L2 or foreign
language for global communication. Even this may well be related to the differences
in reasons for acquiring English proficiency and the general educational climates of
the two countries; if the primary incentive for learning English in Korea is to achieve
academic success and thereby a successful career, it makes sense that the education
system would aim to provide the most ‘perfect’ representation of English, embodied
by the NEST at least in terms of communicative skills. Conversely, if the primary
incentive for learning English in Finland is personal use (e.g. for global
communication or media consumption) it is not surprising that the EFL education

85

system would be more likely to emphasise the global use of English and place less
emphasis on the NEST.
Even in 2010, Ranta’s study found that Finnish upper-secondary students mostly
tended to view English as a means for global communication and generally used it
with other non-native speakers. At that time, they also felt the formal EFL education
emphasised native speakers of English to an extent that felt removed from their lives.
The interview data gathered for this study indicates that since then Finnish EFL
education has shifted its focus towards its role as a means of global communication,
evident from the inclusion of diverse varieties of English and the way the interviewed
NESTs positioned themselves within the education system, as discussed above.
Simultaneously, Ahn and Kang’s (2016) and Jeon’s (2015) studies imply that Korean
students also are interested in learning more about the ELF dimension of English and
devaluing the emphasis on the native speaker, but (formal) English proficiency being
linked so strongly to success and the strong emphasis on measurable success in Korean
society at large seemingly make it a less attractive dimension of English to focus on.
This study has provided an in-depth look into Korean and Finnish EFL
education through the lens of NESTs working within them, but it is by no means
exhaustive. Further research on differences in Korean and Finnish EFL teacher
training, more comparable quantitative studies on the presence and uses of English in
Korea and Finland as well as ideologies related to English in these countries, studies
focusing on how local NNEST EFL teachers in South Korea and Finland see NESTs
and how they position themselves in comparison, and research on the experiences and
attitudes of NESTs in other EFL countries could provide more insight into the issues
discussed in this thesis.

10. Svensk sammanfattning – Summary in Swedish
En jämförande studie om infödda engelskalärare i två engelska
som främmande språk-länder: Sydkorea och Finland

10.1. Inledning
I denna magisteravhandling presenteras en jämförelse mellan två fallstudier om
infödda engelskatalare som jobbar som lärare i engelska som främmande språk i
Sydkorea och Finland. Dess syfte är att ge en djupare insikt i hurdana uppfattningar
och erfarenheter infödda engelskalärare har om engelskaundervisningen i de här två
länderna och om deras roll i den som infödda talare. Avhandlingen fokuserar på
likheter och olikheter mellan engelskaundervisning i Sydkorea och Finland samt
engelskans övriga roll och ställning i dessa två länder. I den ena studien intervjuades
fem infödda engelskalärare i Sydkorea och i den andra sex infödda engelskalärare i
Finland, med syfte på de senare nämndes erfarenheter av att lära finskspråkiga
finländare. Intervjufrågorna handlade om lärarnas språkanvändning i klassrummet,
deras elevers kunskaper i engelska och när de började lära sig språket, svårigheter på
grund av eventuell språk- och kulturmur mellan lärare och elever och vilka språkliga
utmaningar koreanska och finskspråkiga elever brukar ha i förvärvandet av engelskan.
De också handlade om läroplaners innehåll och betoning, vilka engelskavarianter syns
i läroplaner, hur motiverade lärarna tyckte deras elever var att använda engelska
utanför klassrummet, lärarnas attityder till engelska lånord i koreanska och finska, hur
de såg framtiden för engelska och engelskundervisning i Sydkorea och Finland och
om de tyckte att undervisningen kunde förbättras, deras åsikter om språkbad som
undervisningsmetod, och om de tyckte att de hade någonting speciellt att erbjuda som
infödda engelskalärare.
10.2. Motivering
Den huvudsakliga motiveringen bakom avhandlingen är de många likheter mellan
Sydkorea och Finland som engelska som främmande språk-områden (enligt Kachrus
1988 ”three-circle model of World Englishes”). Bägge länder är rika och utvecklades
87

snabbt från jordbruksbaserade länder till industriländer under den senare delen av
1900-talet. Bådas skolsystem har fått mycket uppmärksamhet och beröm tack vare de
koreanska och finska elevers framgång i internationella kunskapsutvärderingar.
Engelska har traditionellt uppfattats som ett främmande språk i båda länderna, vilket
skiljer sig mycket från de primära inhemska språken, koreanska och finska. Ändå
brukar finska elever klara sig bättre i internationella kunskapsutvärderingar i engelska
än deras koreanska motparter. Exempelvis tog Finland tredje plats i den internationella
English Proficiency Index år 2020 (Education First, 2020), som jämför frivilliga
examenstagares kunskaper i engelska i hundra länder, medan Sydkorea tog trettioandra
plats. Enligt Kim (2020) visar offentliga Test of English as a Foreign Language
(TOEFL)-resultat att finländska och koreanska studerande är på ungefär samma nivå i
fråga om hörförståelse, läsförståelse och skrivning, men när det gäller muntliga
kunskaper är finländska studerande på högre nivå. Mot den bakgrunden utredas i
avhandlingen möjliga orsaker till detta. Det finns tidigare forskning om skillnader i
koreanska och finländska engelskaläroböcker (t.ex. Kim, 2020 och Namgung, 2016)
men mer kvalitativ forskning i skillnader mellan engelskundervisning i Sydkorea och
Finland fattas. Dessutom ger avhandlingen en omfattande bild av infödda
engelskalärare i dessa två länder och hur de ser sig själva (och hur de uppfattas av
deras elever och kollegor) som engelskalärare.
10.3. Genomförandet och resultatredovisning
De fem lärarna i Sydkorea intervjuades våren 2019 och de sex lärarna i Finland
intervjuades sommaren och hösten 2020. Intervjuerna bandades och sedan
transkriberades. Tematisk analys användes som redovisningsmetod och intervjuerna
analyserades med hjälp av programmet NVivo. Resultaten visade många likheter
mellan engelskaundervisningen i Sydkorea och Finland. I båda fallen verkar det som
att muntlig språkförmåga har börjat betonas allt mer, men att övningen av skriftligt
språk ändå är en mycket stark del av undervisningen. I Sydkorea har den mest synliga
engelskavarianten varit standard amerikansk engelska och i Finland har det varit
standard brittisk engelska, men under de senaste åren har läroplanerna och
läroböckerna börjat ge mera uppmärksamhet åt andra varianter också. I fråga om
koreanska och finska elever, börjar formell undervisning i engelska redan på
lågstadienivån. På grund av olikheten mellan koreanska och engelska respektive finska
88

och engelska, lär koreanska och finska elever ha många likadana utmaningar i
förvärvandet av engelskan, till exempel gällande användning av prepositioner,
ordföljd, och uttal. De brukar tillika vara mera bekväma åtminstone i
engelskaklassrummet med skriftliga övningar än muntliga övningar, enligt de
intervjuade lärarna. Därför ansåg de flesta deltagarna att muntliga övningar borde
betonas mer i engelskaundervisningen, och att språkbad som undervisningsmetod kan
vara till nytta för elevers förvärvande av språket. Alla som intervjuades använde också
engelska antingen som det primära undervisningsspråket eller till en hög grad i
undervisningen. De tyckte även att infödda engelskatalare har vissa särskilda styrkor
som engelskalärare, såsom förmågan att introducera engelskspråkig kultur och en mer
nyanserad och intuitiv förståelse av språket.
Emellertid visade intervjuerna att deltagarna som jobbade i Finland var mer
nöjda med landets engelskaundervisning och deras elevers kunskaper i engelska än de
som jobbade i Sydkorea. De var också mer kluvna i fråga om deras roll som infödda
engelskalärare. Dessutom syntes mer mångfald gällande engelskavarianter i finländska
läroplaner och lärarna i Finland uppfattade deras elever som mera aktiva användare av
engelska utanför klassrummet än lärarna i Sydkorea uppfattade sina elever, även om
de båda använder engelska lånord och lånfraser mycket. De här forskningsresultaten
antyder att engelskans roll och ställning är mer etablerad i Finland än i Sydkorea.
