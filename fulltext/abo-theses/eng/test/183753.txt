ABSTRAKT
Nyckelord: termografiska fosforer, optisk sprejkammare, yttemperatur,
värmeöverföring
För att påskynda övergången till en högre andel förnybar energi i kraftproduktionen och utfasningen
av fossila bränslen inom sjöfarten behövs ytterligare utveckling av förbränningsmotorn. Forskning om
motorer och utvecklandet av dessa har traditionellt skett genom testkörning av multicylindriga
motorer. För att påskynda utveckling, validering och implementering av nya tekniker har trenden varit
att allt mer använda digitala verktyg för simulering, och virtuell testning. För att exakt kunna simulera
förhållanden inuti en förbränningsmotor behövs valideringsdata, för att kalibrera t.ex. CFD-modeller.
Syftet med denna avhandling är att producera valideringsdata för konjugerade värmeöverföringsmodeller som förutsäger den termiska belastningen på motorn och dess komponenter.
I denna avhandling diskuteras hur en avancerad laserbaserad metod för att mäta yttemperaturen kan
implementeras i en nybyggd industriell optisk sprejkammare. Generellt sett har tillvägagångssättet i
denna avhandling varit att använda tillgänglig forskning för att utföra yttemperaturmätningarna. Detta
resulterade i en omfattande litteraturundersökning, som inleds med att beskriva den karakteristiska
förbränningsprocessen i en typisk marin dieselmotor och avslutas med en detaljerad genomgång av
hur mätningar med termografiska fosforer går till. Vidare genomfördes temperaturmätningen på en
specialgjord instrumenterad platta. Utöver temperaturmätningarna användes totalt sex olika
mätmetoder, alla synkroniserade med bränsleinsprutningen i kammaren, för att förstå de komplexa
förhållanden som råder inuti en förbränningsmotor.
I arbetet beskrivs utmaningarna med den komplexa mätmetoden och de mycket utmanande
mätförhållandena, som är karakteristiska för en förbränningsmotor. I avhandlingen presenteras
visualiseringar av brinnande bränslesprejer och resultat från de olika mätningsteknikerna av de
reagerande bränslesprejerna i den optiska sprejkammaren. De termografiska fosformätningarna gav
en yttemperatur på 880 K, vilket är rimligt med tanke på mätförhållandena. Avhandlingen avslutas
med en diskussion som utvärderar mätningarna och förslag till förbättringar av mätuppsättningen ges
med fokus på noggrannhet och precision. Vidare approximeras värmeöverföringen och användning av
resultaten som valideringsdata för CFD-modeller diskuteras.

ABSTRACT
Keywords: Thermographic Phosphors; Optical Spray Combustion Chamber; Surface
Temperature; Heat Transfer
To implement a higher share of renewables in power generation and accelerate the de-carbonization
of marine transportation, further development of the internal combustion engine is needed.
Traditionally, technology development and research have been validated by hours and hours of test
running in multicylinder engines. To accelerate the development, validation and implementation of
new technologies, the trend has been to implement digital tools for simulation, virtual testing, and
validation. To accurately simulate in-cylinder conditions, there is a need for validation data to
calibrate, e.g. CFD-models. The purpose of this thesis is to produce validation data for conjugate heat
transfer models predicting the thermal loading on the engine.
The work discussed in this thesis presents the process of implementing an advanced laser-based
surface temperature measurement method in a newly built industrial Optical Spray Combustion
Chamber. In general, the approach in this thesis has been to utilize available research to conduct the
surface temperature measurements. This resulted in extensive literature research, starting by
describing the characteristic combustion process in a large compression ignition engine and ending
with a detailed review of measurement techniques utilizing thermographic phosphors. Furthermore,
the temperature measurement was implemented on a special plate instrumented with heat transfer
sensors. Additionally, there were in total six different measurements applied and synchronized to the
fuel injection in the chamber.
The work revealed the complexity of the measurement and the very challenging measurement
conditions, similar to the once in an engine. The outcome of the thesis presents visualizations and
results from the different measurements of the reacting fuel sprays in the Optical Spray Combustion
Chamber. The thermographic phosphor measurements yielded a surface temperature of 880 K, which
is a reasonable number considering the measurement conditions. The thesis is concluded by a
discussion, evaluating the measurements and suggesting improvements of the measurement set-up
to improve accuracy and precision. Furthermore, the heat transfer is approximated, and possible
utilization as validation data for CFD models is discussed.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This thesis was in collaboration with Wärtsilä Finland Oyj at the Research and Technology
development department. I would like to express my gratitude to Åbo Akademi University and my
supervisor, Cataldo de Blasio, for the flexibility enabling the extended work in this thesis. I’m also
grateful to Tekniikan Edistämissäätiö for the small grant they provided me to write this thesis.
When starting my B.Sc. thesis back in 2018, by designing the concept for an Optical Spray Combustion
Chamber, it started from scratch. I had never even heard of anything similar. As the project went along,
the learning curve was steep. Now, nearly four years later, when I’m finishing my M.Sc. studies, the
Chamber has been built and taken into use. We’ve been visualizing both non-reactive sprays and
reactive sprays in engine relevant conditions in it. The topic for the present work came as an idea
during the design stage of the Chamber, and in the end, it became the first campaign utilizing laserbased diagnostics and hot stage on the Chamber. This project was better than any engineering student
can dream of. It provided both challenges and opportunities to work and cooperate with some truly
brilliant minds. Therefore, I would like to extend my gratitude to some of the key persons involved in
this thesis work.
First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to my superior, supervisor, project owner, and maybe
most of all, my mentor. Jari Hyvönen, this project would never have become a reality without you.
Thank you for listening, motivating, and challenging my ideas during this project. Even though the
workday has ended, you’re always interested in catching up, eager to discuss ideas and challenges.
I’ve improved my skills and developed as a person during my years in your team. Thank you for
believing in me. Another important person for this thesis is my collage, Patrik Nyberg, whose M.Sc.
thesis correlates to the present work. Without you, this work wouldn’t have been half as fun. I admire
your passion for precision and patience to get things right.
The Spray Chamber has been built by a group of students, from different universities, with different
languages, cultures, areas of expertise and level of study. Diversity has made us strong. With this team,
we’ve spent early mornings and late evenings in the lab, constantly trying to solve a problem. The
willingness to learn, curiosity and courage to face challenges outside the comfort zone has really been
the trademark of this group of students. Thank you, Roberth Sjöström, Mikko Lähteenmäki, Joonas
Koivuluoma, Eddie Westerlund, Lokesh Mopuri, Ahmad Zeeshan and Cheng Qiang.
A humble thanks to Mattias Richter and Henrik Feuk. It was nice of you to participate in discussions
and meetings during this thesis. Your professionalism and dedication have been truly inspiring for me.
I would also like to thank Heikki Kahila for his positive attitude and good discussions throughout the
project. It has been helpful and interesting to discuss challenges from a simulation point of view, I’ve
learnt a lot. Thanks to Dave Lowe and Gavin Sutton for interesting meetings and cooperation regarding
the pyrometer. It was a pleasant experience to use the pyrometer, and it became a helpful tool for
this thesis even though it was mainly intended for the DynPT project. Thanks also to Alberto Cafari for
helping with the engine relevant test conditions and to Tomi Riiki for his assistance from the
instrumentation & measurements team. I would also like to extend my gratitude to various Wärtsilä
personnel for their contribution to this project. You’re brilliant.

Last but certainly not least, I would like to express my gratitude to my family for understanding my
childish passion for work. The weekends in the forest, mainly together with my father, has been a
great way of getting my mind elsewhere, thank you. I would especially thank my beloved Emma, who
has influenced me with her magnificent creativity and graphic design, maybe more than you know.
Despite long days and early mornings, thank you for encouraging me to be the one I am.

INTRODUCTION

This thesis has been written on behalf of Wärtsilä Finland Oyj, at the Department of Research and
Technology Development. Wärtsilä is a company providing complete lifecycle solutions for both
marine and energy markets, with the internal combustion engine as the main workhorse. The general
approach in this thesis is to utilize available research and learnings to build an optical measurement
set-up and measure temperature utilizing thermographic phosphors. This chapter will motivate the
need for this thesis. It starts with a brief background and problem description followed by discussing
the main purpose of the thesis. In the second half of the introduction chapter, limitations stating the
boundaries of the thesis is presented. The chapter ends with a presentation of the disposition in the
thesis. In general, this thesis has a thorough literature research within the field of interest.

1.1

Background and problem description

According to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (ICCP), emissions from
greenhouse gases, emitted by humans, have contributed to a temperature increase of 1.1 K,
approximated from the start of the Industrial Revolution (IPCC, 2021). The climate has already started
to change e.g. non-reversible sea level rise (IPCC, 2021). A strong reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions and a transition to renewable energy sources would limit the climate change and stabilize
the temperature quite quickly (IPCC, 2021). The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is
responsible for the safety and pollution prevention from the shipping industry (IMO, 2021). One of the
areas within pollution control at sea involves air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Although
shipping is considered an energy-efficient way of transportation, the international shipping
contributed approximately 2.89 % to the global emissions of carbon dioxide in 2018 (IMO, 2021). The
vision of IMO has been to decrease the greenhouse gas emissions with 50 % by 2050, pursuing towards
a zero carbon footprint consistent with the Paris Agreement (IMO, 2021). Previous actions by IMO
have resulted in reduced emissions of sulphur oxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) (IMO, 2021).
Another market where the internal combustion engine has an important role is the power generation.
The share of renewables has been rapidly increasing to 23.3 % of the global electricity generation 2019
(IEA, 2021). However, the characteristics of many renewable energy sources such, as wind and solar
energy, is their intermittent operation yielding a need for balancing power to ensure grid stability.
Traditionally, hydro power plants have been used both as base-load power and for grid stability
(Gürbüz, 2006). As hydro balancing power plants are dependent on suitable geography, other
solutions are needed to ensure grid stability and power availability. Gonzalez-Salazar, et al. (2018)
investigated the flexibility for several technologies within the power generation. The outcome of this
study yields that reservoir hydro, internal combustion engines and aero-derivative gas turbines can be
regarded as a highly flexible balancing power generation options with respect to load variations
(Gonzalez-Salazar, et al., 2018).
Due to global warming and the fact that one of the biggest energy transitions stills lays ahead of the
humanity, it is still motivated to improve the performance of the internal combustion engine. The
internal combustion engine is a key to integrate renewables in a flexible energy market as well as
enabling sustainable marine transportations. To power a carbon free future, technology development
possesses one of the key roles. Optimizing the quality of new solutions and accelerating their way to

1

the market, by the help of simulation, modularization, virtual testing and validation, laying on top of
the toolbox (Wärtsilä, 2021b).

1.2

Purpose

The previous section motivated the existence of internal combustion engines and the reason why
there is still a need to further improve and develop the technology, despite the history of the internal
combustion engine. A general trend for modern engine research and technology development has
been to reduce the amount of testing time on full-scale, multicylinder engines as it is both time
consuming and expensive. As the computing power has increased drastically over the past years, the
possibilities of simulating engine behaviour through models have been gaining more and more
interest. The models and simulations can be built in many ways depending on the application. For
instance, the Finite Element Method (FEM) is a common way of analysing solid mechanic problems
while Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a way of simulating complex fluid flows where chemical
reactions can take place.
As a step towards a carbon-free future, using simulations and virtual validation will be a key asset, as
mentioned in the previous section. Particularly for the cases of complex in-cylinder phenomena such
as heat transfer from a burning diesel flame. However, despite the great benefits of having high
computing power, enabling more simulations and a higher degree of virtual validation, there is a need
to validate the accuracy of the models by the help of experimental data. Ones the simulations have
been verified against measured data, full metal engine testing can start. The purpose of the present
thesis work is to produce validation data for conjugate heat transfer models. Conjugate heat transfer
models can be used to determine the heat load from the combustion process to the components
yielding the combustion chamber. Thus, improving simulation models will improve the development
process and enable a more optimized design for reduced emissions and improved lifetime.

1.3

Thesis goals

The goal of this thesis is to successfully implement an advanced temporarily resolved temperature
measurement technique, utilizing thermographic phosphors to resolve the surface temperatures close
to a combusting diesel spray at engine-relevant conditions. To reach the goal, the thesis starts by a
thorough literature study, in order to find out the best measurement method within the relevant
fields. Furthermore, the experimental set-up and implementation phase of the thesis will be utilizing
knowledge from the literature part combined with a detailed test plan and complementary CAD
models.

1.4

Limitation

As the thesis goal focuses on utilizing and implementing existing research, the work in this thesis does
not have any intentions to improve or research methods of temperature measurements. Except for
temperature measurement by thermographic phosphors, there will be a variety of optical
measurements and sensors included in the same set-up. Some of the measurement techniques
complements the temperature measurement technique and will therefore be used to motivate
changes to the measurement set-up or as a complement to the results assessment. Additionally,
another M.Sc. thesis utilizing a heat transfer sensor to evaluate the heat flux will be performed

2

simultaneously. During the experimental phase of the thesis, synergies are expected between these
two theses. However, the present work will not include any technical details regarding the working
principle of the heat transfer sensor nor any assessment of that measurement method. Instead, for a
detailed discussion, the reader is referred to Nyberg (2022). Additionally, post processing the raw data
from the experimental tests will not be included in this thesis. The data retrieved in this thesis work
will be analysed by the help of an existing MATLAB script, obtained from Lund University.
As the engine platform at Wärtsilä is extensive, there is a need to focus on a particular engine size.
This work only concerns 4-stroke diesel engines with direct injection technology, more specifically the
W31 Wärtsilä engine. As the optical tests will be performed in the newly built Optical Spray
Combustion Chamber at Wärtsilä, there is a focus on building a toolbox with a set of basic optical
measurement techniques to be used at the chamber. Building an optical toolbox will not be included
in the present work, even though some equipment needed for this set-up was chosen based on criteria
to match also other techniques.

1.5

Disposition

The thesis is structured as follows: The second chapter introduces the principle of diesel combustion
in an internal combustion engine. Furthermore, different combustion strategies and modes of heat
transfer inside an internal combustion engine is briefly reviewed. It also presents different
temperature measurement methods on a general level, before focusing on phosphor thermometry,
which will be the method of interest for the intended measurements. The third chapter presents the
chosen experimental set-up followed by a description of the design of all needed components. In this
chapter details about optical filters, electrical connections and trigger managing are also discussed.
Furthermore, the calibration, optical set-up and testing procedure is explained in detail. The testing
was done in an iterative manner, each time implementing learnings from the previous round in order
to improve the measurements. However, the present disposition does not follow the chronological
order. The fourth chapter is focusing on the results and only comments on how the measurement
point was obtained. A more detailed assessment of the results can be read from chapter 5. Chapter 5
also suggests some improvements or actions that were implemented for further testing. The 7th
chapter concludes the thesis and suggest future research on the subject.

LITERATURE REVIEW

This part of the thesis mainly focuses on the phosphor thermometry method for remote surface
temperature sensing. It starts from a general introduction to the diesel combustion process in an
internal combustion engine and an overview of available methods of measuring temperatures. The
purpose of this chapter is to give a general overview of the challenges of measuring surface
temperatures inside an internal combustion engine and the methods available for measurements. This
chapter will also act as a theoretical base frame for decision-making, choice of experimental set-up
and CAD design. The idea is that the literature review will discuss, highlight, and motivate decisions
done during the realization of the measurement campaign. As mentioned in the previous chapter, the
present work in this thesis has no intentions to improve or perform research in themethods of
temperature measurements.

2.1

Fundamentals

An internal combustion engine converts chemical energy in form of a liquid or gaseous fuel into
mechanical work and heat. The heat generation is a parasitic result of the combustion event, which is
needed to rise the pressure on the piston according to the basic working principle of an internal
combustion engine (Cengel, et al., 2019). According to Heywood (2018), the heat losses to the coolant
from a diesel engine is in the range of 30 %. Apart from this, there are also losses to the exhaust gases,
but this can be recovered to some extent using for instance a turbocharger. The losses are generated
in different stages in the engine. The main source is the combustion event that takes place inside the
cylinder (Heywood, 2018). During the development history of the internal combustion engine taking
off in 1876, different solutions to reduce the heat losses have been implemented (Heywood, 2018).
One example is the turbo utilizing the energy in the hot exhaust gases. The development of the internal
combustion engine is still relevant, even after 150 years. In the modern world, the development has
been driven towards cleaner emissions, higher fuel flexibility and efficiency. This has been laid out as
the general motivation for many of the recently published research, as heat losses still is an object for
improvements, e.g. (Knappe, 2013; Abou Nada, 2016; Binder, 2019). This chapter will introduce the
reader to the general complex concept of diesel combustion, different strategies, and the phenomena
of in-cylinder heat transfer. The general working principle of a 4-stroke piston engine and its main
components will not be presented in this chapter but has been reviewed in detail by many literature
references, for instance (Heywood, 2018; Cengel, et al., 2019).

2.1.1 Diesel Combustion
The combustion process for an internal combustion engine operating with compression ignition has a
few characteristic features. Heywood (2018) summarized the main characteristics of the diesel
combustion in an internal combustion engine. The fuel is injected, with a high penetration velocity,
when the piston is close to the top dead centre at the end of the compression stroke. The fuel spray
penetrates the hot and high-pressure surroundings while atomizing into small droplets. The droplets
vaporizes and mixes with the air prior to self-ignition followed by combustion until all injected fuel has
passed this process. The fuel injection is timed to start the combustion at a desired time. The ignition
delay should be kept as short as possible to ensure good repeatability. As the combustion process
proceeds, the ignition delay time for the rest of the injected fuel is decreasing due to increased
temperature and improved vaporization. The chemical energy release is mainly taking place in a small
sheet around the downstream part of the spray plume where the fuel and air are mixed close to a

4

stoichiometric portion.
The diesel combustion process, including some characteristic temperatures for the different phases
described earlier, can be seen in Figure 1 (Heywood, 2018). According to Binder (2019), the
temperature prior to fuel injection is in the range of 750 K. In Figure 1, however, the hot air
surrounding the atomizing and vaporizing spray is in the range of 950 K for fully developed spray and
combustion (Heywood, 2018). At the end of the liquid spray region, where all the fuel finally has
vaporized, the temperature has been cooled down to 650 K (Heywood, 2018). The fuel-air ratio, φ, in
this region is typically very rich and close to four, this would correlate to air-fuel ratio , λ, of 0.25
(Heywood, 2018). The cold, rich mixture of fuel and air is heated up to 825 K by circulating combustion
products from the diffusion flame sheet surrounding the spray. At this point, the fuel mixture starts to
oxidize and rises the temperature further to approximately 1150 K. As a result, locally available oxygen
is consumed and 10 to 15% of the chemical energy is released (Heywood, 2018). The temperature
increase accelerates the chemical reactions and eventually reach 1600 K where hydrocarbons start to
build soot particles when heated by radiation.
As Heywood (2018) stated, at the end of the diffusion flame temperatures up to and above 2700 K can
be found, at least well above 2000 K, as Binder (2019) suggests in his thesis. In this region, the high
soot concentrations are oxidized into CO2 and H2O (Heywood, 2018). In this part of the flame, oxygen
from the surroundings diffuses into the flame sheet in a close to stoichiometric ratio, or even with
some excess oxygen (Heywood, 2018). In these regions air pollutants as, nitric oxide is formed
(Heywood, 2018). As Figure 1 represents the combustion concept of a quiescent single diesel spray
more as a simplified model, there will be differences to a real engine case such as charge air motions
introduced to the combustion chamber, multiple injection strategies, multiple sprays (Heywood,
2018). These features are essentially used to affect the mixing with air, ignition delays and burning
rates of the spray to reach high combustion performance with low emission levels.

Figure 1 The process of a burning diesel flame in a compression ignition engine described with characteristic
features and temperatures originally made by Dec, et al., (1999) then updated by Heywood (2018)

The torque output from a compression ignition engine is generally heavily dependent on injected fuel

5

amount and the rate fuel is burning (Heywood, 2018). The amount of air in the cylinder is usually
sufficient to oxidize injected fuel. The challenge is instead to reach high enough reaction rate to
complete the combustion process within an optimal window, usually around 40-50 CAD (crank angle
degree) (Heywood, 2018). The Wärtsilä 31 engine operates at a 750 rpm, which means that 1 CAD
corresponds to 222 μs, hence the time estimation for a diesel combustion would be 11 ms
(Corporation, 2019).
There are many different approaches for improving fuel and air mixing and the overall combustion
performance in a compression ignition engine. One approach is to create a rotating air motion inside
the combustion chamber. Also, the positioning of the fuel injector and chamber geometry are
parameters that have been frequently changed to optimize the combustion process. Heywood (2018)
has been reflecting over different strategies and designs, which can be seen in Figure 2. Quiescent
multi-spray approach seen in Figure 2 a) does not have any high swirl motions. Instead it requires high
fuel injection pressures to get sufficient air fuel mixing and distribution (Heywood, 2018). This concept
is suitable for 4-stroke Large bore engines, bore size 150 – 900 mm, operating at engine speeds of 120
– 2100 rpm (Heywood, 2018). In Figure 2 b) and c) an air swirl is generated in the deep bowl in piston
design to speed up the air fuel mixing rates (Heywood, 2018). These are both commonly in use, b) in
medium and c) in small-sized engines running at a speed of 1800 – 3500 rpm (Heywood, 2018). Figure
2 d) is showing the hemispherical bowl-in-piston design, which was developed for the automotive
industry mainly to decrease the noise levels from the combustion process (Heywood, 2018). In this
approach there was only one fuel jet injected in a tangential direction along the piston wall resulting
in much slower evaporation rates compared to multi-spray technologies (Heywood, 2018). The
turbocharging technology has compensated the advantages with these techniques and it is in practice
not used in commercial engines anymore (Heywood, 2018).

Figure 2 Four different combustion system designs used in direct injected compression ignition engines
(Heywood, 2018)

Apart from, trying to optimize the combustion chamber geometry including piston and fuel injector
positioning different combustion strategies may be applied. The combustion strategy involved in the
examples explained so far has been the mixing-controlled combustion (Heywood, 2018). This concept
uses a single injection sequence followed by atomization, vaporization and combustion of the diffusion
flame combined with different arrangements in order to achieve turbulence and mixing (Heywood,
2018). Other concepts for combustion can roughly be divided into two groups.

6

The first one, multiple fuel injection strategies, is widely utilized in modern diesel engines where it
enables an optimization of mainly noise and emission levels (Heywood, 2018). There are also some
efficiency gain possible. This fuel injection strategy does not require any major changes to the engine
components or the way of operating them. The difference compared to the classic mixing-controlled
combustion is that there are several injection sequences during the same power cycle. Usually, the
injection is divided into 2 – 5 injection sequences (Heywood, 2018). Generally, multiple injections
consists of 1-2 short pilot sprays injected before the piston reaches top dead centre followed by one
longer main injection (Heywood, 2018). The combustion cycle is then ended by 1 – 2 post or late
injections. There has been an arising interest and research efforts done on optimizing and fine tuning
the concept of multiple injections for different engine sizes. Among these for example Lee, et al.
(2009), Mingfa, et al. (2009) or Biswas, et al. (2016).
The second group, advanced combustion, is a step away from the classic working principle of a
compression ignition engine with mixed-controlled combustion (Heywood, 2018). The aim with the
advanced combustion techniques is generally to make a notable impact on the emissions, and also to
improve the efficiency (Heywood, 2018). The common main target for different approaches is to get
a spontaneous ignition of the fuel – air mixture in the engine (Heywood, 2018). Controlling such a
process is very difficult and might need some modifications of the engine. In the literature there are a
lot of different approaches to implement this feature in the combustion engine, for example
Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI), Reaction Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) or
Premixed Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI) (Heywood, 2018).

2.1.2 In cylinder Heat Transfer
Heat transfer is in general an unwanted feature in an internal combustion engine. As previously stated
the heat transfer phenomena removes a significant fraction of the chemical energy released from the
combustion process, resulting in a lower efficiency. According to (Heywood, 2018) heat transfer
directly affects the design approach, performance, efficiency, and emissions from an engine. In order
of magnitude the heat flux to the walls of a combustion chamber might be in the range of 10 MW/m2.
Furthermore, the heat flux in the cylinder may vary depending on the flow of the hot gases in the
cylinder. Generally, the heat flux will reach the highest levels where the gases temperatures and flow
velocities are the highest. Heywood (2018) mentions that too high temperatures must be avoided to
reduce the risk of fatigue cracking due to high thermal stresses.
According to Cengel, et al. (2019) heat transfer is characterized by its driving force, temperature
differences between a system and its surroundings. This results in an interaction between the system
and surroundings where the heat transfers from a higher towards a lower temperature (Cengel, et al.,
2019). This process will continue until the system is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings
(Young & Freedman, 2016). There are three mechanisms for the heat to transfer from one place to
another, conduction, convection and radiation. These mechanisms may take place simultaneously.
Conduction is a mode of heat transfer that takes place inside a body or between two bodies (Young &
Freedman, 2016). Particularly metals conduct heat very efficiently thanks to their special structure of
atoms sharing electrons. The electrons can quickly transport thermal energy from a hot place to a
colder. Young & Freedman (2016) also point out that the special structure of metals also results in the
capability of being a good electrical conductor. Heat transfer by conduction can be reasonably
estimated using Fourier’s law:
𝑞̇ = 𝑘∇T

(1)

7

where, 𝑞̇ , is the heat transfer per area and time, k, is the thermal conductivity and ∇T, is the
temperature gradient. As Binder (2019) pointed out, all heat losses generated in the cylinder will
transfer through components that encapsulates the combustion in the engine. The basic principle is
that the better the conductivity the bigger is the heat loss from the hot working fluid generating
torque. To minimize conductivity, materials with poor thermal conductivity should be used (Binder,
2019). Since most of the components must be made from metals because of the harsh conditions and
great stresses in the engine the thermal conductivity is usually quite good. Therefore, another option
is to apply a coating on top of the in-cylinder components to affect the conductivity (Binder, 2019).
This has been the subject for a lot of research projects, like (Binder, et al., 2017; Paik, et al., 2019;
Somhorst, et al., 2019).
Heat transfer by convection is a complex process influenced by the velocities of the fluid mass in
motion and the temperature (Binder, 2019). Young & Freedman (2016) points out that there is no
general equation to describe heat transfer by convection for an arbitrary case. However, by
experimental test some conclusion can be made. The heat transfer by convection is directly
proportional to the surface area (Young & Freedman, 2016). This indicates that a large area would
enable higher heat fluxes. This is also a parameter in engine design where the area of the combustion
chamber is kept as small as possible. For instance, Arato & Takashima (2015) and Funayama, et al.
(2019) have evaluated how to reduce the heat loss by optimising the combustion chamber. Heat flux,
𝑞̇ , can be determined for steady flow conditions by the help of following equation
𝑞̇ = ℎ (𝑇𝑔 − 𝑇𝑤 )

(2)

where, Tg and Tw describes the temperatures in the gas and at the wall. The heat transfer coefficient,
h, is an empirical constant influenced by a variety of variable and needs to be identified from
experimental data (Heywood, 2018). One approach that to overcome this problem is to create a model
for determining the spatial average heat transfer coefficient in the cylinder of the internal combustion
engine. As (Binder, 2019) mentions there has been a lot of effort put into developing a model for the
heat transfer coefficient. One of the most well-known model is Woschni’s model from 1967 and this
one is used still widely today (Binder, 2019) (Binder, et al., 2019). More details about Woschni’s model
can be found in (Woschni, 1967) and a more detailed discussion of different models and derivation of
equations are presented by (Heywood, 2018).
Heat transfer by radiation is in fact thermal energy transferred by electromagnetic radiation (Young &
Freedman, 2016). The most obvious example is the radiation of sunlight. The electromagnetic spectre
of interest for this thesis can be divided into three sections. Ultraviolet light has wavelengths between
100 nm and 400 nm (Young & Freedman, 2016). Visible light between 400 nm and 700 nm. The infrared
region ends at 1 mm. Heywood (2018) specified the wavelength spectra of interest being much
narrower compared to the general theory of heat transfer by radiation. According to (Heywood, 2018)
the expected wavelengths are in the visible and infrared region only. Binder (2019) pointed out that
the characteristic diffusion flame from a burning diesel flame, discussed in chapter 2.1.1, is likely to
generate much higher heat losses from radiation compared to other combustion concepts lacking a
luminous flame. By looking at the intensity at different wavelengths, shown in Figure 3, from a burning
n-heptane flame the emitted wavelengths can be expected to be longer than 450 nm for a burning
diesel spray.

8

Figure 3 Normalized Intensity of emitted wavelengths from a burning n-heptane flame (Binder,
et al., 2020)

According to Heywood (2018) the heat transfer by radiation contributes as much as 20 – 35% of the
total transferred heat. Skeen, et al. (2014) on the other hand, showed that that the radiative heat
transfer would more likely be in the range of 0.01 – 0.46%. There seems to be a disagreement between
several research outcomes in respect to this area. This was something that Binder (2019) had noticed
and discussed by giving examples of different research in the area. The general order of magnitude for
heat transfer by radiation remains unclear but it seems to be lower than previously expected (Binder,
2019). However, it is clearly a phenomenon worth investigating when considering in-cylinder heat
losses, especially in large diesel engines with luminous sooty flames behaving as a blackbody.
The heat flux from radiation can be explained by the concept of a black body (Heywood, 2018). A black
body is an ideal body with a surface that absorbs and emits radiation of all wavelengths equally well
(Heywood, 2018). The heat flux, 𝑞̇ , between two parallel plane black bodies with no absorbent
material can be calculated by
𝑞̇ = 𝜎 (𝑇14 − 𝑇24 )

(3)

where, σ, is the Stefan-Boltzman constant and T is the temperatures of the two bodies (Heywood,
2018). This equation is an ideal case where both bodies exhibits no reflection of any radiation. In a
real case, especially with gases, there will be reflections which is connected to certain wavelengths.
This can be accounted for by introducing a correction factor called emissivity, ε (Heywood, 2018).
Furthermore, emissivity can be calculated for simple cases but for the case of a burning diesel flame
in an internal combustion engine the process is rather complex and requires more advanced models
to get accurate. For further details, Heywood (2018) presents different approaches on a more detailed
level.
Apart from the wavelength spectrums discussed above it is good to remember that there are other
sources of radiation with other wavelengths spectrums, partly overlapping the discussed ones. This
could be for example X-rays, Gamma rays with short wavelengths and microwaves as an example of
longer wavelengths (Young & Freedman, 2016). Figure 4, gives a good overview of different

9

wavelength regions which can be helpful to keep in mind while reading this thesis.

2.2

In cylinder temperature measurement techniques

As stated in the chapter of in-cylinder heat transfer, the heat transfer is driven by temperature
gradients. Due to this fact, the temperature is relevant when trying to estimate and simulate the heat
transfer during engine operation. The purpose with this section is to review some of the most common
surface temperature measurement methods available for in-cylinder temperature measurements.
These have been divided into two groups where the first one is categorized as contact techniques and
the second one presents remote techniques. A similar approach was used by Abou Nada (2016) and
Binder (2019) when they evaluated suitable measurement techniques.

2.2.1 Contact techniques
The contact techniques refer to a measurement method where a sensor is attached to the surface of
interest. The contact techniques require some modifications to the surface of interest to fasten the
sensor. Often, some threaded holes need to be considered. In general, the biggest challenge with
contact techniques is the sensitivity. In this section templugs, thermocouples and thermal paints will
be discussed.
The templug has a history starting from the early 1970’s when it was developed as a thermal sensing
technique (Testing Engineers INC., 2013). According to the user guide, provided by Testing Engineers
INC. (2013), the templug is a threaded screw made from alloy steels. The basic working principle of
the templug is the change in hardness upon exposure to heat. The templugs can be used for measuring
the maximum temperature during steady state conditions with rapid heat up and rapid cooling prior
to exposure and after exposure. The exposure to in-cylinder conditions in steady state shall according
to Testing Engineers INC. (2013) be kept between 1 and 100 hours for maintaining accuracy.
Furthermore, it is advisable that 25% of the exposure time is with the maximum temperature (Testing
Engineers INC., 2013). MAHLE & Dreger (2016), suggested that a typical test with templugs lasts for
10 hours. The advantages of using templugs are the easy and fast set-up with a high measurement
accuracy (MAHLE & Dreger, 2016). Some disadvantages may be the long running time needed to
obtain accurate results for one measurement point only (MAHLE & Dreger, 2016). Furthermore, the
analysis of the templugs requires expertise and special tools and is therefore often outsourced to
specialists. Binder (2019) also points out that the templugs are not suitable for measuring surface

10

temperatures due to their size. It is also perhaps good to explicitly mention that this measurement
technique only yields a maximum temperature (Binder, 2019).
Maybe the most common way of measuring temperatures in general is by using a thermocouple. The
thermocouple is appreciated for its simplicity, robustness, size, low cost, and wide range of
temperature sensitivity (Knappe, 2013; Abou Nada, 2016; Binder, 2019). The working principle for a
thermo element is based on the Seebeck effect. Childs, et al. (2000) explain that a thermocouple is an
electric circuit with two different metals connected to each other in a junction point. When the
junction experiences a thermal gradient, it will generate an electromotive force. In Figure 5, adapted
from Kinzie (1973), four different circuits can be seen where the basic concept of the thermoelectric
electromotive force is transformed to a temperature measurement device. In Figure 5, T1 < T2. Circuit
a) shows the needed elements to achieve an electromotive force (Childs, et al., 2000). This circuit is
not very suitable for temperature measurements, it merely shows the basic principle. In the case b), a
third material has been included. This metal does not interfere with the thermoelectric electromotive
force unless there is a net thermal gradient across the junction. The same logic applies for case c)
where the circuit has been rearranged to become the basis of a thermocouple (Childs, et al., 2000). In
the last step, case d), a voltmeter has been added to monitor the change in voltage. So far, the
description of the circuits is showing changes in potential between the wires. To achieve meaningful
readings, the temperature, T2, should be known. T2 is often referred as the reference junction
temperature and is usually calibrated in an ice bath of 273 K (Childs, et al., 2000).

Figure 5 Working principle of a thermocouple (Kinzie, 1973)

Despite all the advantages of the thermocouple, there are some major drawbacks making them
unsuitable for surface temperature measurements in internal combustion applications with high
demands on response time. Binder (2019) and Abou Nada (2016) were arguing that the thermocouple
need to be connected to the object in a way that requires invasive methods. Additionally, the electrical
wiring makes it hard to mount the thermocouples on moving objects (Abou Nada, 2016; Binder, 2019).
The wiring problem can be solved by utilizing a real time telemetry temperature measurement for
sending temperature readings from a moving object to the observer as explained by MAHLE & Dreger
(2016). Other challenges are the chemical stability in such harsh conditions as underneath a burning

11

flame and the possibility of electromagnetic interference disturbing the low signal levels in the cables
(Binder, 2019). Knappe (2013) also pointed out that the response time is a major concern of the
thermocouple when trying to measure fast transient conditions since the junction point needs to be
in thermal equilibrium with the measurement object.
Another way of determining temperatures is by using thermal paints. A thermal paint can be defined
as a coating permanently changing colour, at a specific temperature (Indestructible Paint Ltd, 2021).
The change is governed by a chemical change in the solid component of the paint (Indestructible Paint
Ltd, 2021). Childs, et al. (2000) categorises thermo-sensitive crystals along with the thermal paints.
The thermo sensitive crystals will melt at a certain temperature (Childs, et al., 2000). Knappe (2013)
defined the advantages of using thermal paints as low cost, easy to use. Perhaps the biggest advantage
is 2D resolution and information about hotspots in internal combustion engine applications. The
downside with thermal paints is that they are only showing maximum temperatures and require rather
long exposure times, in order of minutes, before a colour change can be observed (Knappe, 2013).
Different versions are available on the market, some of the paints have multiple sensitivity regions to
visualize different temperatures, for example Indestructible Paint Ltd (2021), Surisa (2021) or Thermal
Paint Services (2021).

2.2.2 Remote techniques
Remote techniques strive to move all measurement equipment outside the area or object of interest.
This would ensure that there is no or as little as possible impact of the measurement set-up on the
results. Another advantage of remote measuring is the flexibility of swapping measurement points
quite fast, with no or very little changes to the set-up. The remote techniques extract temperature
information from emitted light or radiation by converting it to a picture or an electrical signal (Abou
Nada, 2016). This also means that there is a need for optical access, where a photosensor, camera or
similar device can be positioned.
Heat transfer by radiation, which were discussed previously in chapter 2.1.2, can be utilized to
measure the temperature of an object. Pyrometry is utilizing the fact that thermal radiation increases
with the temperature (Binder, 2019). Childs, et al. (2000) and Knappe (2013) pointed out that the
variation in thermal radiation for different wavelengths is described by Planck´s law. Figure 6 shows
the emitted wavelengths for various surface temperatures for a perfect black body radiation in
corelation to the behaviour described by Planck´s law (Vollmer & Möllmann, 2010). The dotted line
seen in the Figure 6 shows the radiation maxima, calculated according to Wien´s law. For a detailed
discussion and presentation of Planck´s law the reader is referred to the references, for instance
Childs, et al. (2000) or Vollmer & Möllmann (2010). As Figure 6 shows that the wavelengths are
reduced with increased temperature, which is represented by Stefan-Boltzmann’s law, and radiation
maxima is increased for increased temperatures, according to Wien´s Law, there is two common ways
of measuring temperature for pyrometry utilizing these facts (Knappe, 2013).

12

Figure 6 Planck´s law for blackbody radiation with respect to wavelengths, radiation maxima described
by the dotted line according to Wien´s law (Vollmer & Möllmann, 2010)

As Knappe (2013) discussed there is two major techniques for measuring temperature by thermal
radiation. The first one is commonly referred to as total radiation pyrometers. These are measuring
the intensity of emitted light in a broad spectrum of wavelengths. Morris & Langari (2021) presented
a variety of different pyrometers with slightly different measurement principals. These temperature
detectors, measuring single points, require calibration depending on the object of interest. The
emissivity has a huge impact on this type of a sensor performance. The second technique for
measuring temperature is often referred to as ratio pyrometer or two-colour pyrometer. This
technique is based on the fact that the emission spectra is shifted towards shorter wavelengths with
higher temperatures (Knappe, 2013). The thermal radiation of interest is split into two parts and
analysed through two carefully chosen bandpass filters and detectors (Morris & Langari, 2021). The
ratio of the output signals will be temperature dependent and since the temperatures are measured
as a ratio the results are independent of emissivity. Morris & Langari (2021) pointed out that even if
the ratio technique clearly has the advantages of 2D measurements and independency of emissivity
the measurements are not that accurate. However, an improved version called multiwavelength
pyrometer considering three or more wavelengths has improved the accuracy of the measurements.
For a thorough presentation and discussion of different detectors, measurement performance and
applications the reader is referred to the literature for example Vollmer & Möllmann (2010), Sposito,
et al., (2020), Morris & Langari (2021) or Childs, et al. (2000).
To conclude the section reviewing pyrometry as a suitable measurement technique for internal
combustion engines, there are several pros and cons to be considered. (Abou Nada, 2016) concluded
that the infrared thermometry enables measurements on moving objects for a wide range of
temperatures. The downside is that the temperature readings will be affected by in-cylinder particles,
dust or flames that causes thermal radiation as well as the object of interest. Binder (2019) on the
other hand, mentioned the 2D measurement capabilities as the greatest advantage. The downside
would be the strong relation to a good emissivity, it might be needed to coat the measurement object
with high emissivity paint. When trying to measure piston temperatures, it won’t be possible to
measure the temperatures through a burning diesel flame (Knappe, 2013; Binder, 2019).
Another measurement technique that is semi remote is phosphor thermometry. The term phosphor
originates from the 17th century when a crystalline stone was found to emit red light in the dark upon
excitation from the sun during day time (Yen, et al., 2007). The name phosphor was given to these

13

light emitting stones since it means “light bearer” in Greek. Luminescence, fluorescence, and
phosphorescence are three concepts related to each other. Yen, et al. (2007) explains that
luminescence contains both fluorescence and phosphorescence. Luminescence is defined as the
phenomenon where the electronic state of a substance emits photons upon excitation of an external
energy source. Fluorescence is the phenomena where photons are emitted simultaneously as the
substance is being excited, while phosphorescence is a phenomenon where photons are emitted even
though the excitation has ended. These concepts will be discussed in more detail in section 2.3.1.
Phosphor material is widely used in the industry in various applications, for example in light sources,
displays, detector systems or paints (Yen, et al., 2007). Some of the phosphor exhibit an intensity decay
of the emitted photons as a function of temperature (Knappe, 2013). This has led to the development
of phosphor thermography. Phosphor is not to be confused with the ground element phosphorus.
As earlier mentioned, the phosphor thermometry is a semi remote technique, because there is a need
to coat the area of interest with a thin layer of phosphor coating (Abou Nada, 2016). The phosphor
coating consists of a host and an activator. The activator will emit photons upon excitation by a light
source, usually in the UV region. The emitted photons are captured through a detector system either
with a camera or a sensor depending on the measurement method (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). In general,
the phosphor thermometry is a good option for harsh conditions with a high spatial and temporal
resolution (Abou Nada, 2016). As both Binder, (2019) and Abou Nada (2016) argued the phosphor
thermography is beneficial to use when trying to measure temperatures in a harsh environment with
a lot of background noise, for example on a piston inside an internal combustion engine. However,
there are also some drawbacks with this method which is mainly the need for optical access to the
combustion chamber, phosphor coating affecting the heat transfer and the complex way of conducting
the measurements (Abou Nada, 2016; Binder 2019). As the phosphor thermometry will be the main
subject of this thesis, a more detailed description will be presented and discussed in the next chapter.
The increased optical capabilities to the combustion chamber, a need for a higher spatial and temporal
resolution of the temperature measurements has led to an increased interest in usage of thermographic phosphors. A lot of research on diesel engine application has been carried out for example by
Husberg, et al. (2005), Knappe, et al. (2011) or Binder, et al. (2017). The thermographic phosphors
have also been frequently utilized in different measurement campaigns on gas turbines (Khalid, et al.,
2010).

2.3

Phosphor thermometry

Phosphor thermometry is the main subject of this thesis. To successfully set-up and conduct
measurements utilizing this technique, it must be reviewed in more detail. In this section, the working
principle of thermographic phosphors will be clarified. The chapter also discusses two different ways
of utilizing the temperature-sensitive nature of phosphors and why they, among other methods, are
suitable for internal combustion engine conditions. The section ends by an overview of excitations
sources, detectors, bounding techniques and a presentation of the accuracy of phosphor
measurements along with potential error sources.

2.3.1 Principles of phosphor thermometry
In the previous chapter, phosphor thermometry was briefly introduced as a comparison to other
temperature measurement methods. However, this chapter will continue the discussion. In history,
phosphors has mainly been developed as a luminescent material for lamps and displays (Knappe,

14

2013). The thermographic phosphors possess an unwanted functionality since their intensity is
decreasing with increased temperature. However, this link has made certain phosphors interesting for
temperature measurement applications such as the ones to be utilized in this thesis work.
As earlier mentioned, luminescence is a concept describing both fluorescence and phosphorescence.
However, before proceeding to a more detailed review of the phosphorescence, the Jablonski diagram
in Figure 7 will give a better understanding of luminescence as a concept. In Figure 7, a set of different
energy levels can be seen marked with black lines. The bold lines, S0, S1 and S2 represent available
singlet states (no unpaired electrons) and T1 represents triplet states (2 unpaired electrons) (Khalid &
Kontis, 2008). The thinner lines indicate vibrational and rotational energy levels. Excitation or
absorption of energy will result in electrons transferring to a higher energy level, like S1 or S2. Bell, et
al. (2001) mentioned that the ground state is the only stable state, which means that the electrons
will try to return to the lowest energy level as soon as possible.

Figure 7 Jablonski diagram describing the concept of luminescence and the difference between fluorescence
and phosphorescence (Khalid & Kontis, 2008)

The de-excitation process can be executed in a series of events, some with a higher probability than
others. Khalid & Kontis (2008) explained that the events releasing energy from the electrons returning
to the ground state will differ in several orders of magnitude in terms of their characteristic time. As
Figure 7 Jablonski diagram describing the concept of luminescence and the difference between
fluorescence and phosphorescence is showing, the phosphorescence originates from a triplet
state, T1, which requires a spin forbidden transition to take place. Even though the internal conversion
to the triplet state, T1, is forbidden according to the selection laws of quantum mechanics, it simply
means that the likelihood of this conversion is very unlikely to take place (Knappe, 2013). Turro (1978)
mentioned that the probabilities are dependent on the molecule structures and increases with
increased atomic size. Heavy metal atoms, like platinum doped in a ceramic crystal structure, will
increase the likelihood of internal conversion (Bell, et al., 2001). For a more detailed explanation and
discussion of the selection rules and system conversions, the reader is referred to the literature, for

15

instance Turro (1978), Bell, et al. (2001) or Khalid & Kontis (2008). The thesis will continue by discussing
the phosphor and the thermographic characteristics.
Abou Nada (2016) explains that a thermographic phosphor is usually an inorganic material consisting
mainly of a host and an activator. The host is usually a ceramic lattice, which is doped with an activator
or luminescence centre (Binder, 2019). The host should be stable in all relevant measurement
conditions to increase the capabilities of measuring in harsh conditions with high temperatures, above
1873 K (Abou Nada, 2016). While the host is inactive in the photon emitting process, the activator will
play the key role. The activator or luminesce centre is usually lanthanides or transition metals like; Eu,
Dy, Tb or Ag. Correlating to the previous paragraph, both lanthanoids and transition metals have quite
a high atomic number. The reason for choosing lanthanides or transitions metals as activators can be
explained from the electron configuration of these elements (Binder, 2019). Knappe (2013) reasoned
that the lanthanoids found in the 6th period of the periodic table have their 4f shell filled with electrons
after the 6s shell is full. Thanks to the electrons in the outer shells; 5s, 5p and 6s, with lower energy
the optically active electrons in the 4f shell are shielded (Knappe, 2013). The transition elements, as
before, are commonly referred to as the d-block in the periodic table. The elements in the d-block
have a partially filled d-sub shell, which is shielded by a completely filled outer orbital, similar to the
case with the lanthanoids (Knappe, 2013). Knappe (2013) points out that the shielding effect of the dsub shells seems to be weaker compared to the lanthanide case implying that this type of phosphors
is more dependent on their host lattice. A more detailed explanation of the electron configuration
and how the different shells are filled can be red from Yen, et al. (2007) or Chepyga (2018).
Phosphors sometimes also contain a sensitizer in addition to previously mentioned host and activator.
Abou Nada (2016) explains that the sensitizers are sometimes added to enhance the absorption of the
excitation energy. Sensitizers are essentially impurities, ions, added to the host, which will transfer the
absorbed excitation energy to an activator to increase the probability of luminescence. Abou Nada
(2016) also points out that a sensitizer might be optically active and emit photons, some sensitizers
can even show a temperature dependency. Chepyga (2018) discussed that not all impurities will act
as a sensitizer, in fact, most of the impurities will absorb the excitation energy and weaken the signal.
Impurities are usually hard to get rid of, and usually it is unavoidable to have a small amount of
impurities in the phosphor material (Chepyga, 2018). Figure 8 illustrates a phosphor containing both
sensitizers and activators and shows how the excitation energy is transferred in the material (Abou
Nada, 2016).

Figure 8 Example of a phosphor consisting of both activators and sensitizers and showing how the excitation
energy is transferred inside the material (Abou Nada, 2016)

16

The energy exciting the phosphor usually originates from a short laser pulse in the UV region of the
electromagnetic spectra, but it can also be excited by an electron beam or an X-ray (Binder, 2019). The
excitation source will be discussed in more detail in chapter 2.3.6. This part of the thesis will focus on
the events leading to a temperature-dependent emission of photons upon excitation from e.g. a short
laser pulse in the UV region. Even though the absorption of energy and relaxation was partly covered
previously in the discussion differentiating luminescence, fluorescence, and phosphorescence, it is
needed to clarify the events of phosphorescence in more detail to highlight temperature sensitivity.
When the phosphor material is exposed to an excitation source, the activators or luminescence
centres will absorb the energy and be transferred to a virtual state called excited state (Knappe, 2013).
This can be seen from Figure 9 where the blue arrow represents the absorption (Knappe, 2013). In the
previous section, in Figure 8, it was shown that the energy might be transferred through sensitizers in
the host material until it encounters an activator.
Chepyga (2018) explains that the excited activator will return to the ground state by losing the same
amount of energy as absorbed, which correlates to the statement by Bell, et al. (2001) in the previous
discussion about luminescence. Since the exited activator has reached a higher vibrational state, it will
transfer through a non-radiative relaxation to the lowest vibrational state in the excited state (Abou
Nada, 2016). This event will occur immediately upon absorption and the relaxation takes place within
picoseconds (Chepyga, 2018). As the activator has reached the lowest vibrational state in the excited
state, there is a possibility that it will emit a photon to de-excite and reach the ground state (Chepyga,
2018). Knappe (2013) discussed that the emitted photon will have a longer wavelength compared to
the absorption photon because of the centre band being Stokes shifted towards the red emission
wavelengths. This has been marked as the distance, ∆R, in Figure 9 (Knappe, 2013). Ones the activator
reaches the ground state, it can ones again relax through non-radiative relaxation from a higher
vibrational state to the lowest vibrational state.

Figure 9 Configurational diagram showing possible absorption and emission of photons for phosphorescence
(Knappe, 2013)

Emitting a photon is however not the only way the activator can de-excite back to ground state. There
are other de-excitation processes that can take place entirely without emitting any photons. These are
commonly called non-radiative relaxations. Knappe (2013) described the radiative and non-radiative

17

relaxations as two competing processes. Figure 10 shows three different non-radiative relaxation
processes. In process a) the ground state and the excited state has a common intersection point
allowing the activator to relax through non-radiative processes. Knappe (2013) points out that the
probability of the process a) increases with increased temperature. In process b) there is no
intersection point between the ground state and the excited state. Instead, the vibration bands of the
two parabolas are overlapping, allowing non-radiative relaxations to occur (Knappe, 2013). The
likelihood of this event to take place also increases with increased temperature as the gap in
vibrational energy decreases. The process c) involves a third potential called charge-transfer state.
According to Knappe (2013), the charge-transfer state connects the activator with the host lattice
allowing non-radiative relaxation to occur. The charge-transfer state has been shown to be more
common at low energy levels for elements with high electron affinity (Knappe, 2013). The likelihood
of process c) to occur is dependent on the temperature and position of the three parabolas (Knappe,
2013).

Figure 10 Three possible non-radiative relaxation processes (Knappe, 2013)

The temperature dependency of phosphors is related to the competition between the radiative and
non-radiative relaxation described in the previous paragraph. Binder (2019) mentioned that it is
essentially this competition that is responsible for the temperature dependent behaviour of the
phosphors. In contrast to fluorescence, the prolonged decay times for the phosphorescence enables
interactions between the excited activator and the surrounding to take place (Khalid & Kontis, 2008).
This allows the surroundings to have an impact on the emission, which can be thermally driven (Khalid
& Kontis, 2008). Binder (2019) specified that the emission of a photon is generally not affected by
temperature. Instead, it is the increased likelihood of non-radiative relaxation with increased
temperature that steers the competition between the two processes (Binder, 2019). For a more
detailed review of the temperature dependency, the reader is referred to the literature, for example
Knappe (2013) or Chepyga (2018).
As the basics of thermographic phosphors has been reviewed, the focus in this section shifts towards
different approaches utilizing the thermal sensitivity of the phosphors. As Khalid & Kontis (2008)
presented, there are several different measurement approaches with thermographic phosphors.
Figure 11 shows a map of different measurement modes available for thermographic phosphors. From
Figure 11 it can be understood that the measurement approaches are divided into three subgroups
containing two major techniques per group. The first group, spectral intensity, represents different
techniques where changes in the emission intensity is the measured objective for deriving
temperatures. The temperature dependent competition between the radiative and non-radiative
relaxation process results in a lower emission intensity for increased temperatures. As Khalid & Kontis
(2008) presented, this can be utilized by measuring the intensity with CCD cameras generating a 2D
resolved temperature. This approach has a great spatial potential with the 2D possibilities, but is also

18

affected by a number of disadvantages leading to large errors. Another method, with higher precision,
is the intensity ratio technique. This method utilizes the ratio between two emission bands from the
same phosphor (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). This method is one of the most used techniques utilized by
several researchers, for example Neal, et al. (2013) or Mendieta, et al. (2018). The intensity ratio
technique will be reviewed in more detail in section 2.3.2 as it might be an interesting option for the
present thesis work.
The second subgroup, seen in Figure 11, described by Khalid & Kontis (2008), is called temporal since
it involves neither intensity decay time or rise time. The intensity decay time method is based on the
higher likelihood of non-radiative relaxations with increased temperature resulting in a faster intensity
decay. Intensity decay time method is commonly used in phosphor thermometry where a high
accuracy is achievable. This method will be further discussed in chapter 2.3.3 as it may be an
interesting option for the present thesis work. Allison, et al. (2005) pointed out that earlier studies had
shown that also the rise time is dependent on temperature and very sensitive to the doping
concentrations of the activators in the host lattice. In addition to the intensity decay time
measurements, Allison, et al. (2005) suggest that the rise time can be utilized to broaden the
temperature sensitive spectra.
The third category, called spectral, is based on the fact that the absorption and emission wavelengths
may vary (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). The first one, emission line shift and line width analysis, is based on
the fact that the intensity maxima of the emission wavelength is changing slightly with temperature
(Allison, 1997). Gross, et al. (1989) suggested that the temperature is affecting the host lattice in such
a way that the luminescence centre starts to vibrate causing a change in the crystal which results in a
wider emission line width. Another possibility is the thermal expansion causing a shift in emission
spectra (Gross, et al., 1989). Even if the temperature will have an effect on the emission spectra and
shifting it towards shorter wavelengths, the shift will be in order of 3nm for a temperature change of
1000K ,making it rather insensitive and hard to utilize for measurement applications (Khalid & Kontis,
2008).

Figure 11 Different temperature measurement approaches (Khalid & Kontis, 2008)

19

Another approach in the spectral category is the emission line shift and line width analysis seen in
Figure 11. This method is utilizing the change in absorption as a function of temperature. Khalid &
Kontis (2008) gave an example where a phosphor has a low rate of absorption at room temperature
and is then increased as the temperature is increasing. Allison (1997) explained that the increased
absorption of the phosphor is due to the charge-transfer band shifting towards longer wavelengths. A
shift of 30 nm per 323 K is to be expected (Allison, 1997). The method has been investigated by several
researchers, for more information the reader is referred to Allison (1997) or Khalid & Kontis (2008).
As previously mentioned, some of these measurement methods have been frequently used in internal
combustion engine applications. The intensity ratio method and the decay time method have been
widely applied in combustion engine research for example by Knappe, (2013), Abou Nada (2016) or
Binder (2019). Therefore, the intensity ratio method and the decay time method will be reviewed in
more detail in the next sections.

2.3.2 Intensity Ratio Method
As mentioned in the previous section, the intensity ratio method is based on changes in emission
bands for a given phosphor. Figure 12 shows a schematic of a phosphor having different intensity
peaks at two characteristic wavelengths (Knappe, 2013). The ratio of the intensity at these
characteristic wavelengths has been shown to change with temperature. In Figure 12, three
temperatures are indicated by different colours, where the blue line, T 1, represents the lowest
temperature. Since it may be challenging to measure the peak intensity at a specific wavelength, a pair
of optical filters is applied to allow photons of a specific wavelength to pass the filter (Binder, 2019).
Thus, the intensity ratio, R, can be calculated according to the following equation
𝑅=

∫𝐹𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑟1 𝐼(𝜆)𝑑𝜆
∫𝐹𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑟2 𝐼(𝜆)𝑑𝜆

(4)

where the intensity has been integrated over the filter bandwith (Binder, 2019). A more
comprehensive mathematical expression and description related to post-processing the results can be
found from Lindén (2012) or Knappe (2013).

Figure 12 Characteristic emission lines for a phosphor utilized in the intensity ratio method, where the ratio of
the intensity changes as a function of temperature (Knappe, 2013)

A typical optical set-up for measurement systems utilizing the intensity ratio technique is shown
in Figure 13. Apart from the measurement object coated with a suitable phosphor, the set-up requires
an excitation source, expanding optics (1), a beam splitter (2) and two cameras with suitable filters

20

(Binder, 2019). The excitation source provides a sufficient amount of energy at a wavelength that can
be absorbed by the phosphor, usually in the UV region (Binder, 2019). A more detailed discussion
about excitation sources can be found in section 2.3.6. As the intensity ratio technique often is used
in a 2D application, the laser beam is expanded through a lens with a negative focal length (Binder,
2019). The phosphorescence signal passes a beam splitter to ensure that both cameras capture the
same area of interest (Binder, 2019). Khalid & Kontis (2008) discussed different measurement set-ups
and their pros and cons. For instance, the importance of aligning the cameras at the same area of
interest (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). As mentioned earlier, both cameras are equipped with bandpass
filters chosen according to the characteristics of the phosphor material. The resulting images are then
divided by each other according to equation (4), pixel by pixel resulting in a 2D temperature map of
the area measured (Lindén, 2012).
Binder (2019) mentions the 2D possibilities as one the most significant advantage of the intensity ratio
technique. Abou Nada (2016) also points out that the great spatial resolution is a clear advantage of
the intensity method. The intensity method is also compatible with fast exposure times, allowing
decent temporal resolution of fast events, such as diesel combustion (Binder, 2019). Fuhrmann, et al.
(2013) did a comprehensive comparison study of the intensity ratio method and the decay time
method, concluding that the decay time method is inferior in all aspects concerning sensitivity,
accuracy, and precision. For a more detailed discussion of the processes affecting the accuracy and
precision of the intensity ratio method, the reader is referred to the literature Collins, et al. (1998),
Heyes, et al. (2006) or Fuhrmann, et al. (2013).

Figure 13 Example of a 2D intensity ratio measurement set-up (Binder, 2019)

In addition to the optical measurement set-up, there is also a need to calibrate the system compared
to a known set of temperatures (Knappe, 2013). Usually, the calibration is carried out in a furnace with
optical access, where a test piece coated with the phosphor is measured by the optical set-up
described in the previous paragraph (Binder, 2019). The test piece contains drillings for
thermocouples, which are used as a reference to obtain a temperature for the measured intensity
ratio (Abou Nada, 2016). One way of conducting the calibration is to heat the oven and test the piece
to the maximum temperature. While the oven is cooling down again, the temperature is measured by
both thermocouples and the thermographic phosphors according to a predefined frequency yielding
a set of calibration data (Knappe, 2013).

2.3.3 Decay Time Method
The decay time method is based on a temperature-dependent intensity decay in the emitted light, as
described in section 2.3.1. The general principle of the intensity decay as a function of time is shown

21

in Figure 14. From the previous discussion in section 2.3.1, it is clear that there are two competing
processes affecting the decay time. The temperature-dependent non-radiative relaxation process
overtakes the radiative as the temperature increases, as Figure 14 shows (Knappe, 2013). As the decay
time of a phosphor lies between several milliseconds to a few nanoseconds, there is an opportunity
to get a great temporal resolution from the measured data by using phosphors with as short decay
times as possible (Binder, 2019). It is also a challenge to measure the phosphorescence decay fast
enough to get an excellent temporal resolution on the decay curve (Binder, 2019). Usually, the decay
times are too short for a decent temporal resolution by a highspeed camera (Binder, 2019). On the
other hand, there are also cases where 2D detectors have been utilized with the intensity decay
method (Fuhrmann, et al., 2013; Abou Nada, 2016). To be able to measure the fast decay times,
detectors called photomultiplier tubes, PMT, has been widely used in applications involving the
lifetime decay method (Binder, 2019). The PMT, among other options, will be presented in more detail
in section 2.3.5.

Figure 14 Intensity decay as a function of time, increased temperature will lead to a faster decay due to the
non-radiative relaxation overtaking the radiative relaxation process (Knappe, 2013)

As earlier discussed, excitation by a short laser pulse will rise a large number of luminescence centres
to a virtual state. The rate of the electrons returning to the ground state can be described by the
following expressions
𝑑𝑁
𝑑𝑇

= 𝜆𝑁

(5)

where the solution forms an exponential function
𝑁(𝑡) = 𝑁0 𝑒 −𝜆𝑡

(6)

N(t) is the number of electrons left in the excited state (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). N0 denotes the number
of electrons at the initial state (t = 0), and λ represents the rate of decay (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). The
decay time, τ, of the luminescence centres follows the equation
𝜏=

1
𝜆

(7)

where the decay is constant, λ, also can be expressed by the help of the sum of the rate of the nonradiative and radiative relaxation (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). Khalid & Kontis (2008) points out that this
relation is only valid with the assumption that there is no impurities nor interactions between

22

activators or host material. The expression can then be rewritten as
𝜏=

1

(8)

𝑘𝑟 +𝑘𝑛𝑟

where kr denotes the rate constant of radiative relaxation, and knr stands for the rate constant of nonradiative relaxation (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). The probability for radiative relaxation and non-radiative
relaxation can for a given temperature be calculated as
𝑃𝑟 =

𝑘𝑟

(9)

𝑘𝑟 +𝑘𝑛𝑟

𝑃𝑛𝑟 =

𝑘𝑛𝑟
𝑘𝑟 +𝑘𝑛𝑟

(10)

where knr is sensitive to the temperature, especially after the quenching temperature, and kr is
insensitive to temperature and will remain as a constant (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). If the temperature is
increased, the knr will increase leading to a higher probability of non-radiative relaxation, Pnr, and a
lower probability of radiative relaxation, Pr. By assuming that the phosphorescence intensity is
proportional to electron population, the decay time can be represented by
𝑡

𝐼(𝑡) = 𝐼0 𝑒 −𝜏

(11)

where τ is the decay constant, and I0 is the intensity at the initial stage (t=0) (Khalid & Kontis, 2008).
The lifetime decay method is compared to other phosphorescence methods, which are dependent on
intensity, a very stable way of measuring, since it is very sensitive and much less affected by
background noise, which enables the possibility to measure temperature through a burning diesel
flame, for instance (Binder, 2019). There are, however, some disadvantages also. One of the biggest
downsides is the poor spatial resolution if a PMT is used and the difficulties to apply the same method
as a 2D measurement (Binder, 2019). There are several challenges related to accuracy and precision.
Many of them can be considered in advance and partly avoided if the operator is aware of them.
Therefore, there is a need to review learnings from present research to avoid unnecessary sources of
error. This discussion will be covered by section 2.3.6.

Figure 15 Example of a general set-up of the 1D approach with the intensity decay time method (Binder,
2019)

23

A general 1D measurement set-up utilizing a PMT can be seen in Figure 15 (Binder, 2019). The
excitation beam is pointed onto the coated surface, and a phosphorescence signal is emitted. The
detection system consists of a focusing lens (1), a PMT with filters (2) and an oscilloscope (3) (Binder,
2019). The output signal of the PMT, captured by the oscilloscope, will show an electric signal as a
function of time. In order to extract the decay time with a corresponding characteristic temperature,
there is a need to process the signal (Binder, 2019). In the previous paragraph, it was mentioned that
the intensity decay follows the mono-exponential expression given by equation (11). In reality, this is
not entirely true, a multi-exponential function would resemble most of the phosphors in a more
realistic way (Binder, 2019). A multi-exponential function as the following expression in equation (12)
𝑡

−
𝐼(𝑡) = ∑𝑁
𝑛=1 𝐼0𝑛 𝑒 𝜏

(12)

has been proven to suffer from several disadvantages (Binder, 2019). However, as mono-exponential
functions also can be utilized for multi-exponential phosphors, it has become the standard approach
for phosphor thermometry (Lindén , 2012). There are a variety of different approaches for retrieving
the decay time, τ and choosing a suitable evaluation window for the measured data. Knappe (2013)
did a comprehensive study of different approaches. As this thesis focuses on utilizing the
thermographic phosphors from temperature measurement, the reader is referred to the literature for
a more detailed discussion by Brübach, et al. (2009), Lindén (2012) or Knappe (2013).
Once the intensity decay curve has been recovered from the raw data, calibration data needs to verify
the corresponding temperature. Essentially, the calibration procedure allows the decay times to be
translated into temperatures. The calibration is done in a similar fashion as described in the previous
section for the intensity ratio method. Binder (2019) motivates that the calibration should be done
after the measurements utilizing the same settings for the excitation source, PMT and method for
extracting the decay time.

2.3.4 Excitation source
The excitation energy needed for phosphor thermometry can be achieved in several ways, as
previously mentioned in section 2.3.1. Excitation could be done by utilizing electromagnetic radiation
in the UV range, for example, lasers or LED lights (Knappe, 2013). Other possibilities are by utilizing an
X-ray, particle beam or electrical current (Khalid & Kontis, 2008; Westphal, et al., 2019).
Electromagnetic radiation, usually lasers, has by far been the most used excitation source (Khalid &
Kontis, 2008; Knappe, 2013; Abou Nada, 2016; Binder, 2019). For this reason, this section will discuss
electromagnetic radiation as an excitation source in more detail.
As previously mentioned in section 2.3.1, there is a variety of measurement approaches that may be
utilized when applying thermographic phosphors. The characteristics of the excitation source, such as
continuous output, pulsed, energy levels, beam profiles etc. may depend on the choice of method. In
general, pulsed laser systems give a high energy peak with a short pulse duration, while continuous
lasers have a significantly lower power output (Knappe, 2013). The pulsed lasers are very well suited
for the intensity decay time method since it requires a short pulse to excite the phosphor (Khalid &
Kontis, 2008). One of the most used pulsed lasers is the Nd:YAG laser (Khalid & Kontis, 2008; Knappe,
2013; Abou Nada, 2016). Generally, these lasers have a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm, but this
can be changed by frequency doubling the wavelength inside a harmonic oscillator (Abou Nada, 2016).
This enables wavelengths of 532 nm, 355 nm, 266 nm, or 213 nm to be obtained (Abou Nada, 2016).
The repetition rate of high-power Nd:YAG lasers lays around 5 – 30 Hz for energy outputs of 700 –
1200 mJ per pulse at the fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm (Ekspla, 2021; Quantel Laser, 2021).

24

Nd:YAG lasers that operated with higher repletion rates, up to kHz, has a decreased pulse energy
around 10 mJ (Ekspla, 2021). Pulse width, beam profile and beam diameter vary depending on laser
manufacturer and model (Ekspla, 2021; Quantel Laser, 2021).
Another laser that can produce a pulsed excitation beam directly in the UV range is excimer lasers
(Knappe, 2013). The excimer is a gas laser consisting of a mixture of three gases, a noble gas, a halogen
and a bath gas, usually Ne or He (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). According to Khalid & Kontis (2008), these
lasers typically operates at 500 - 1000 Hz and produces 200 mJ energy pulses at wavelengths of 157351 nm. The excimer lasers have had a history of difficulties with pulse stability and performance, but
the situation appears to have improved during the past years (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). Despite the
advantages of getting a high-energy pulse directly in the UV range at a decent repetition rate, the
biggest drawback for the excimer laser is the rectangular beam profile making the optical set-up a lot
more difficult (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). Knappe (2013) also notes that the excimer laser has not been
commonly used for thermographic phosphors in the literature.
Continuous lasers are also considered as a suitable excitation source, particularly for intensity
measurements since they don’t require a pulsed excitation (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). The measurement
methods involving a continuous excitation enable temperature measure measurements to be
evaluated continuously, while the ones with a pulsed source in practice are limited to the repetition
rate of the excitation source. The biggest disadvantage with continuous lasers is the relatively low
power output (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). An example by Khalid & Kontis (2008) suggests that an Nd:YAG
laser pulse of 10 mJ during 10 ns at 266 nm would require a 1 MW continuous power output to match
the energy levels at the same wavelength. In general, continuous laser systems operates at much
lower power in the range of 500 mW for wavelengths in the blue region (Novanta, 2021). This is the
reason why many research projects utilizing the intensity measurement techniques still have a pulsed
excitation source, even if it limits the possible sampling rates (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). As the high
energy beam is expanded to cover a larger area and enable 2D measurements, the energy per area
will decrease drastically.
Since lasers historically have been a quite costly excitation source, there has been an increased interest
to investigate LEDs operating in the UV range. Allison, et al. (1999) became the first one to use LEDs in
thermographic phosphor measurements. Later he continued doing research utilising LED as an
excitation source testing different phosphors (Allison, et al., 2002). Knappe (2013) discussed several
advantages of using LEDs as an excitation source. Among these, the ease of use, flexibility to use in
continuous mode, as well as pulsed and broader emission wavelengths that would enhance absorption
for some phosphors could be mentioned explicitly. Typically, the power levels from an LED lie around
3W (Knappe, 2013). Essentially the power output is the biggest drawback prohibiting a wider use of
LEDs also at higher temperature levels in phosphor thermometry applications (Knappe, 2013). Allison,
et al. (2012) predicts that this will change as the LED technique is rapidly going forward.
The wavelength needed to excite the phosphor varies depending on the choice of phosphor. In
literature Nd:YAG lasers using a frequency tripled or quadrupled wavelengths of 355 nm and 266 nm
are maybe the most used wavelengths for excitation (Knappe, 2013; Binder, 2019). Phosphor selection
will be covered by section 2.3.7. In the previous discussion presenting different excitation sources, the
energy levels have been a parameter to compare different systems. The beam diameter varies
between 4 mm to 12 mm in various research projects, utilizing the intensity decay time method in the
literature (Knappe, 2013; Binder, 2019). As the beam diameter varies, there is a need to be careful
when comparing the pulse energies in different set-ups. Instead, the pulse energy per area or energy
density can be considered. During the past year, it seems that the energy levels have been decreasing.

25

Abou Nada, et al. (2013) used 8.8 mJ/cm2 with a beam diameter of 12 mm, Binder (2019) reported
energy levels of 5.3 mJ/cm2 and Feuk, et al. (2021) had used an energy density of 1.6 mJ/cm2. Binder,
et al. (2020) suggested that the energy level never should excide 10 mJ/cm2.
When directing a laser beam onto the surface of interest, the material or phosphor will absorb the
energy, and consequently, the temperature will increase due to the non-radiative relaxations (Knappe,
2013). Therefore, there is a trade-off between signal strength and laser-induced heating to be judged
by anyone using thermographic phosphors. Light can either be reflected or transmitted, assuming a
surface reflectivity, R < 1, some part of the light will be transferred from one medium to another.
Assuming that the second medium is a phosphor coating, the energy resulting in heat due to laser
excitation can be estimated utilizing the following expression
𝑓ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑡 ≈ (1 − 𝑅) ∙ (1 −

𝜆1
𝜆2

∙ 𝑞)

(13)

where λ1 yields the excitation wavelengths and λ2 is the stokes shifted photons emitted through the
phosphorescence (Knappe, 2013). Additionally, a factor called the quantum yield, q, describes the
share of photons absorbed at λ1 that is emitted by λ2. By using approximate values from literature
Knappe (2013) concluded that some 70 % of the excitation energy might be converted into heat in the
phosphor coating. Following equation (13), the energy heating the phosphor coating can be minimised
either by choosing a phosphor with a small stokes shift or choosing a phosphor with a high quantum
yield. Especially a higher quantum yield would be beneficial since it will result in a stronger
phosphorescence signal and decrease the heating effect. A more detailed discussion on phosphor
selection can be found in section 2.3.7.

Figure 16 Optical heating of a phosphor coated calibration disc with respect to time (Abou Nada, et al., 2013)

Abou Nada, et al. (2013) investigated the effects of laser-induced heating by exposing a phosphorcoated on a calibration plate to a variety of excitation energies from a 10 Hz pulsed laser source at 355
nm. The calibration disc was coated with a thermographic phosphor. Figure 16 shows a graph
containing three solid lines of different thicknesses. The thinnest blue line represents excitation energy
of 1 mJ (Abou Nada, et al., 2013). The medium orange line represents excitation energy of 5 mJ, and
the thickest red line shows the temperature increase when excitation energy of 12 mJ is used. The
respective dashed lines represent a calculated value assuming receiving medium to be a black body.

26

The conclusions from this test verify that the temperature of the measurement point will be increasing
with an increased pulse energy and time (Abou Nada, et al., 2013). The authors conclude that the most
significant way of prohibiting optical heating is to reduce the energy pulse from the excitation source.
By looking at the heating effect presented in Figure 1 it can be considered to have minor effects on
the precision compared to other effects discussed in section 2.3.6.

2.3.5 Detection system
Previous chapters have presented the general working principle for thermographic phosphors and
excitation source needed to generate a phosphorescence signal. This section will review the
characteristics of the detector and equipment needed to capture the phosphorescence signal
generated from the phosphor and convert it to a signal that can be analyzed. As the decay time method
has been chosen for the measurements in this thesis, this section will focus on point detection.
Therefore, detection systems for intensity methods or other 2D techniques will not be covered in this
section. A detailed description of detection for intensity methods can be found in the literature, for
example (Knappe, 2013). The choice of method has been motivated through the present literature
review and will be discussed in more detail in chapter 3.1.1. In chapter 2.3.3, it became clear that many
present researchers utilize photo multiplier tubes (PMTs) in the detection systems for thermographic
phosphors. This section will review the working principle of the PMT and a few alternative detectors.
The present chapter will also mention other main components in the detector system and review the
connection of the detector to an oscilloscope.
A PMT is a vacuumed tube containing a photocathode, focusing electrode, a set of dynodes and an
anode (Abou Nada, 2016). A PMT detector with its main components and general functional principle
can be seen in Figure 17. Incoming photons that pass through the input window to the PMT hit a
photocathode (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., 2017). The incoming photons will excite the electrons in
the photocathode, and if the photoelectron has enough energy, it will be ejected into the vacuum
behind the photocathode (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., 2017). The material and design of the
photocathode will result in enhanced sensitivity for different wavelengths and quantum efficiencies
(Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., 2017). The photoelectron is then accelerated over the focusing electrode
onto the first dynode, where it releases multiple secondary electrons (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K.,
2017). Electron multiplication is repeated over a series of dynodes before the stream of electrons
eventually reach the anode (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., 2017). The series of dynodes can be
described as an amplifier where the current of electrons reaching the dynode can be used to measure
the decay time of the phosphorescence signal as a function of time with the help of an oscilloscope
(Knappe, 2013). The gain in signal strength over the dynodes can be controlled by adjusting the control
voltage of the PMT (Binder, 2019).

Figure 17 Main components of a PMT detector (Abou Nada, 2016)

27

PMTs have a high repetition rate in the range of 10 kHz (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K, 2021).
Additionally, some PMTs have a time gate option allowing them to activate the measurements from a
given trigger signal (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K, 2021). The time gate is achieved by controlling the
voltage to the dynodes (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., 2017). This does not mechanically protect the
photocathode from overexposure to light, but it can be operated at a high speed, about 100 ns and
protects the measurements from saturation effects (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., 2017; 2021).
Another version of the PMT is the micro-channel plate (MCP) PMT. The MCP-PMT has the same
functionality as the earlier presented PMT, but the dynode chain has been replaced with a plate
containing micro-channels (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., 2017). The size of the channels is about 6 –
20 µm diameter and are made of glass tubes (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., 2017). When the
photoelectron reaches the wall of a microchannel, it will start the multiplication process like the
dynode in the previously described PMT operation. As Figure 18 shows, there is an electrical field
applied across the micro-channels accelerating the electrons in the multiplication process
(Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., 2017). Both Knappe (2013) and Abou Nada (2016) refers to the MPCPMT as being faster compared to an ordinary PMT. This is because of the shortened distance the
electrons are multiplied over (Knappe, 2013). Hamamatsu Photonics K. K. (2017) also mentioned 2D
possibilities as one of the advantages of the MCP-PMT. However, it remains unclear if this is a feature
that can be utilized for upgrading the intensity decay measurements to achieve 2D resolution. The
main advantage of using a MCP-PMT or PMT is their fast response time and great sensitivity capable
of detecting even single photons (Knappe, 2013). The PMT detectors are very fragile instrument that
is easily damaged by vibrations and shocks. It is also sensitive to overexposure of light, which may lead
to saturation and permanent damages to the photocathode. A detailed discussion of the basic working
principle of PMT can be found in (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., 2017).

Figure 18 Main components of an MCP-PMT (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., 2017)

Except for PMTs, photodiodes are an option to detect the phosphorescence signal. Photodiodes
convert light into an electric signal. Similarly to a solar cell, a photodiode is a semiconductor device
containing a PN-junction. Knappe (2013) explains that a photodiode has a negative n-doped side and
a positive p-doped side. When a photon hits the photodiode, an electron-hole pair will be created if
the energy of the photon is greater than the energy gap of the semiconductor material.
Upon light exposure, electrons accelerate towards the n-side and the holes towards the p-side
(Knappe, 2013). In contrast to the solar cell or the photovoltaic cell, a photodiode has a reverse bias
voltage applied to it to increase the depletion zone and accelerate the electrons and holes to their
respective side (Knappe, 2013).

28

A special variant of the photodiode is the avalanche photodiode (APD). The difference between an
ADP and a normal photodiode is that the ADP has the capability of multiplying the electron-hole pairs,
resulting in an amplified signal (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K, 2020). As the electron-hole pairs are
accelerated towards their respective side, the reversed bias voltage will increase the kinetic energy
resulting in the electron-hole pairs colliding into to crystal lattice of the junction. The collision will
cause ionization where new electron-hole pairs are generated. The newly formed electron-hole pairs
will also be accelerated by the high bias voltage and repeat the process leading to a cascade of events
where new electron-hole pairs are formed. A schematic of the avalanche multiplication can be seen
in Figure 19. By increasing the reversed bias voltage, the gain of the ADP can be controlled (Knappe,
2013). Abou Nada (2016) explains that the APD has a gain of 10 – 1000 and light sensitivity from UVrange to IR-range. Knappe (2013) adds that the main advantages of the APD are its stability and robust
design compared to PMTs. The main disadvantage with APD, when compared to PMTs, is their rather
small detection area and low gain, which cannot be compensated with the high quantum efficiency
they possess (Knappe, 2013).

Figure 19 Schematic describing the working principle of an avalanche photodiode (Knappe, 2013)

As earlier shown in Figure 15, the main components in the point detection system are a focusing lens,
a PMT and an oscilloscope. Moreover, many researchers use phosphor specific optical filters, a
mechanical shutter, and time-gated PMT to prevent unwanted wavelengths from penetrating the
detection system and affecting the measurements (Abou Nada, et al., 2013; Abou Nada, 2016; Binder,
et al., 2020). Bandpass filters with a transmission in the emission region for chosen phosphor are
maybe the most used protection (Binder, et al., 2020; Feuk, et al., 2021). In some cases, a short-pass
filter and long-pass filter may be added in series to avoid interference from other wavelengths than
those emitted from the phosphor (Binder, et al., 2020). Factors affecting the accuracy and precision
as well as action to avoid interference will be discussed in more detail in the following section, 2.3.6.
Phosphor selection strategies will be presented in section 2.3.7.
Except for a detector, possible optical filters and mechanical shutters, there is a need to review the
output signal from the detector and the instrument reading the signal. From Hamamatsu Photonics K.
K. (2017), the output of a PMT is a current with a maximum of 100 µA. Since most of the instruments
used to read the PMT output signal is designed for measuring a voltage, the signal needs to be
converted (Knappe, 2013). A current-to-voltage conversion can be achieved in several ways a number
of approaches have been discussed in detail in the literature (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., 2017). In
Photomultiplier tubes-basics and applications by Hamamatsu Photonics (2017), there are some special
recommendations for the detection of ultrafast light pulses. To be able to transit the signal output
with speed and accuracy, it is recommended to use a coaxial cable with 50-ohm resistance combined
with a matching termination resistance at the signal receiver end (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., 2017).
As the PMTs for these applications usually have a 50-ohm resistance integrated, there is no need for
a matching resistor at the PMT end. Without a resistor matching, there is a risk of having excess energy

29

at the output end reflected back towards the PMT, causing a ringing effect in the cable. If a too high
termination resistance is chosen, it results in a decreased voltage at the last dynode to the anode on
the PMT, resulting in decreased output linearity (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., 2017). A typical
resistance matching coupling can be seen in Figure 20.

Figure 20 Typical resistance matching to avoid ringing in the cable (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., 2017)

Knappe (2013) noted that the rise time of a PMT is less than 1 ns suggesting that most of the signal
distortion is taking place in the connections after the PMT. Due to this, Knappe (2013) investigated
the effect of applying different termination resistances on the oscilloscope for several different cable
lengths. In Figure 21, the response speed is shown as a function of cable length for three different
load resistance at the oscilloscope end. The red triangles correspond to the resistance of 5000-ohm,
blue circles 500-ohm and the black squares is a 50-ohm load. The learnings from this example suggest
that a 50-ohm matching resistance together combined with as short a cable length as possible yields
the optimum measurement conditions for fast measurements like phosphor decay times. These
learnings agree very well with the suggestions in the manual by Hamamatsu Photonics K. K. (2017). A
more detailed explanation, examples and calculations can be found from (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K.,
2017; Knappe, 2013).

Figure 21 Detection line response time as a function of cable length for three different load resistances
(Knappe, 2013)

By using a low load resistance to ensure a fast response, another potential issue arises. As the max
output anode current for a PMT is in order of 100 µA, this correlates to a maximum output voltage of
5 mV when the signal is converted according to Ohms law (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K, 2021). 5 mV is
a very low voltage to accurately resolve in an oscilloscope as their minimum voltage resolution
typically lies in the range of 1 mV/div (Tektronix, 2012). Despite this maximum output current limiting
measurements, a lot of the measurements in the literature is reporting signal-strengths of several
hundred millivolts (Binder, et al., 2020; Feuk, et al., 2021). The signal levels and gain adjustment has

30

been an object of several investigations with topics mainly related to possible non-linearities
introduced by exceeding recommended signal levels (Knappe, et al., 2012a; 2012b; Abou Nada, et al.,
2016). The conclusion made by Abou Nada, et al. (2016) suggested that it would be beneficial to use
the PMT outside the recommended control voltages of minimum 0.4 V and instead use lower voltages
close to 0.2 V which, for instance, Binder, et al. (2020) utilized. Recent studies by Feuk, et al. (2021)
suggests that the PMT should be operated according to the given range specified by the manufacturers
to avoid non-linearities. Instead of decreasing the gain of the PMT to reduce the output signal, it can
be controlled by, for instance, using optical density filters or reducing the laser energy even though it
has some disadvantages (Binder, et al., 2020).

2.3.6 Accuracy and Precision
Despite all advantages of thermographic phosphors, there are a few challenges that might have an
impact on the measurements when applying the method to diesel combustion. Previously, in chapter
2.1, the process of diesel combustion was presented on a general level. From this discussion, it is clear
that conditions inside an internal combustion engine with a luminous burning diesel flame present,
yield extreme conditions to perform accurate and precise temperature measurements. Previous work
using thermographic phosphors in internal combustion engines has successfully been carried out, for
example, by (Husberg, et al., 2005; Binder, et al., 2017; 2019). However, (Binder, et al., 2020) pointed
out that especially the high amounts of soot in a diesel engine will have a negative effect on the
measurements in contrast to, for instance, a direct-injected spark-ignited engine. Abou Nada, et al.
(2016) investigated the effect of lubricant oil on thermographic phosphor, concluding that there might
be a strong dependence for some phosphors. Other investigations have been targeting pressure levels,
temperatures, high oxygen partial pressures and the combustion as an environment (Feist, et al., 2003;
Jovanic´, et al., 2008; Yu, et al., 2010; Yáñez-Gonzáleza, et al., 2015). A recent paper by Binder, et al.
(2020) was targeted to fill in the knowledge gaps in the effect of the harsh conditions of a diesel engine
on the thermographic phosphor measurements. As noted initially, there is a lot of potential error
sources when applying thermographic phosphors in an internal combustion engine operated on diesel.
Therefore, this section will present challenges with thermographic phosphors and discuss suggestions
on how to overcome and improve measurements with respect to accuracy and precision.
A quiescent burning diffusion flame, shown in Figure 1, characterise a typical flame found in large
marine engines. These flames have a strong luminescence output that covers a broad spectrum. The
emittance spectrum of a burning n-heptane flame earlier shown in Figure 3 suggests that wavelengths
above 450 nm can be expected in a diesel engine. Based on this Binder, et al. (2020) argued that the
intensity methods are much more sensitive to background noise as they have two different spectral
bands that might be affected differently. The decay time method is not affected in the same way as
only a single spectral band is being used (Binder, et al., 2020). However, Kashdan & Bruneaux (2011)
discovered that the rapid change of background emission would have an impact when analysing the
decay time. The choice of phosphor will be important when trying to minimise the effect of the
background. By choosing a phosphor that emits at shorter wavelengths and have relatively short decay
time, would be beneficial when trying to reduce the influence of a rapidly changing background and
the presence of luminous flames acting as a blackbody (Binder, et al., 2020). A more detailed discussion
about phosphor selection can be found in section 2.3.7. Worth mentioning is also the approach of
having two PMTs measuring the events, one equipped with optical filters favouring the
phosphorescence signal to pass and one to measure the background (Kashdan & Bruneaux, 2011). The
idea is to subtract the background from the phosphorescence signal to improve the analysis (Kashdan
& Bruneaux, 2011).

31

Binder, et al. (2020) investigated the effect of soot luminosity by applying a non-premixed acetylene
flame in the calibration set-up. By keeping a constant temperature and laser pulse energy, the effect
of soot luminosity could be investigated by altering the equipment mounted on the detector rack
(Binder, et al., 2020). A motorized aperture and mechanical shutter were used to alter the solid angle
and exposure before receiving the decay signal from the phosphor (Binder, et al., 2020). Additionally,
the different optical filters were also used to improve the measurement set-up (Binder, et al., 2020).
The spectrum of the acetylene flame and phosphorescence signal was initially measured, concluding
that the phosphorescence signal is clearly stronger compared to the acetylene flame (Binder, et al.,
2020). The measured effect of soot luminosity on the output signal can be seen in Figure 22 for a
variety of cases. The red and blue line in both comparison (a) and (b) part of Figure 22 shows the
measurement output for different openings of the aperture without a sooty flame (Binder, et al.,
2020).
When the flame is turned on, black line, a decrease in the output voltage can be observed in (a) and a
longer decay in comparison (b) when the aperture is 50 % open or more (Binder, et al., 2020). Even
though a short pass filter, purple line, is added to the detector rack, it doesn’t improve the situation
that much (Binder, 2019). Additionally, a mechanical shutter is added to the detector rack reducing
the exposure of the photocathode to the light (Binder, et al., 2020). As seen from Figure 22, the
mechanical shutter improved the situation, yellow line, yielding a more similar output as the
calibration set-up did (Binder, et al., 2020). It was speculated that the constant exposure of luminous
sooty flame led to saturation effects either on the photocathode or in the dynode chain leading to a
decreased sensitivity for incoming photons (Binder, 2019). Additionally, Binder, et al. (2020) did some
tests varying the exposure by using different shutter timings. It was concluded that an exposure time
shorter than 7 ms would produce consistent and constant values (Binder, et al., 2020). A more detailed
presentation and discussion can be found from (Binder, 2019; Binder, et al., 2020).

Figure 22 Soot luminosity effects on the measurements (Binder, et al., 2020)

As there is much soot generated during diesel combustion, there is also a possibility that the produced
soot will absorb the excitation energy from the laser or emitted phosphorescence signal (Binder,

32

2019). A measurement technique called laser-induced incandescence utilizes the energy absorption
phenomena that results in an afterglow for the study of soot formation (Crua, et al., 2003). Worth
noting that laser-induced incandescence often requires laser excitation energies between 400 – 600
mJ/cm2 while laser-induced phosphorescence lays at a maximum of 10 mJ/cm 2 as previously
mentioned in section 2.3.4 (Crua, et al., 2003; Lilik, et al., 2015). The high laser fluences needed to be
combined with short decay timescales suggests that laser-induced incandescence is of minor concern
in applications using thermographic phosphors (Binder, 2019). Even though laser-induced
incandescence is highly unlikely, there is still a possibility that the excitation energy will be
extinguished, and the phosphorescence signal will be trapped by the high amounts of soot (Binder,
2019). The same kind of signal trapping and laser extinction will take place when any particle is
interfering in the optical pathway, for example, window fouling (Binder, et al., 2020).
To investigate the extinction and trapping effects Binder, et al. (2020) used a modified calibration setup where a laser beam splitter or motorised iris was applied to simulate extinction or signal trapping.
As a reference, signal outputs from previous engine tests were used to mimic actual engine conditions
(Binder, et al., 2020). More details of the engine test can be found from (Binder, et al., 2019a; 2019b)
The outcome of the test seen in Figure 23, were (a) shows the measured data, (b) shows the error at
different temperatures and (c) compares the standard deviation of the measurements (Binder, 2019).
According to (b), a significant error can be seen at lower temperatures in particular (Binder, et al.,
2020). Even though the measured data seen in (a) follows the same shape, Binder (2019) argued that
the error decreases as the phosphor’s sensitivity to temperature increases. Despite an increased
temperature sensitivity, the standard deviation comparison in (c) clearly shows an increased deviation
in all regions where either signal trapping or laser extinction occurs (Binder, 2019). Binder (2019)
concluded that the effects of laser extinction and signal trapping would be strongly influenced by the
choice of phosphor, detector, and its settings. The results presented can be considered as indicative
results. A more detailed assessment of the subject can be read in (Binder, 2019; Binder, et al., 2020).

Figure 23 Effect of signal trapping and laser extinction on measurement accuracy and precision (Binder, 2019)

Apart from previously discussed effects on accuracy and precision, there is a chance that the elevated

33

temperatures will have an impact on the phosphor leading to changed characteristics. Knappe (2013)
called these phenomena thermal history effects and presented three different subcategories of
processes that might occur. The first category, chemical reactions, is generally only possible for
dopants, since the ceramic is chemically inert (Knappe, 2013). Doped activators, for example,
europium, has been shown to change oxidation state through a redox reaction (Knappe, 2013). Due
to this, the characteristics of phosphor BaMg2Al16O27:Eu is changed upon extended exposure to
temperatures higher than 770 K (Knappe, 2013). Therefore, special care needs to be taken when using
this phosphor at temperatures above 770 K. A more detailed study on the thermal effects of
BaMg2Al16O27:Eu can be found from (Bizarri & Moine, 2005). Another possibility of redox reactions is
reactions with chemically active components of the gas mixture exposed to the phosphor (Knappe,
2013). The second subgroup is called diffusion, which refers to ions diffusing into the binder or
substrate as a result of high temperatures above 900 K (Knappe, 2013). The last subgroup is called
annealing, which refers to a slow process at high temperatures resulting in a permanently changed
microstructure of the material (Knappe, 2013). Some phosphors are known to suffer from thermal
history effects. Therefore, its common practice to perform a curing process in elevated temperatures
prior to measurements (Knappe, 2013). Thermal history effects are relatively easy to test since they
can be tested by performing calibration both when reference temperature is increased as well as when
it decreased (Knappe, 2013). Another way to check the phosphor stability is to coat an engine
component and perform calibration both prior to engine testing as well as afterwards. Binder, et al.
(2020) performed a similar test on a set of valves to investigate the phosphor stability in the very harsh
conditions of an internal combustion engine. The outline from this investigation showed that there
might be a significant impact of the engine conditions on the temperature measurements, especially
when the temperature is outside the sensitive region of the phosphor (Binder, et al., 2020). The
mechanisms affecting the decay time remained unknown (Binder, et al., 2020).
So far, this section has mainly discussed the effects of the in-cylinder conditions on accuracy and
precision. However, as thermographic phosphors, in fact, are a semi invasive measurement technique,
as earlier presented in section 2.2.2, there will be a temperature gradient over the phosphor coating
affecting the measurements. The effect of coating thickness was carefully studied by Knappe, et al.
(2011) and Knappe, et al. (2013) inside an optical engine working in HCCI mode. The outcome of these
studies suggested that a layer thickness greater than 20 µm will have an insulating effect leading to
higher temperatures on the surface (Knappe, et al., 2013). (Binder, 2019) pointed out that the HCCI
mode of combustion yields a much more homogeneous heat transfer compared to an engine
operating in diesel mode. A 1D simulation of unsteady heat transfer in an otto engine by Atakan &
Roskosch (2013) suggests that a coating thickness of 10 µm will be significant. A thickness infinitely
thin will instead have an impact on the signal to noise ratio resulting in a relatively weak signal.
Therefore, the thickness needs to be carefully considered or preferably accounted for in a heat transfer
model (Binder, 2019). A detailed discussion followed by numerical examples and correlation to engine
testing by Knappe (2013) concluded that coating thickness is the single most important parameter for
the operator to control to avoid biased temperature readings. For more discussions regarding the
impact of coating thickness, generation depth of phosphorescence etc., the reader is referred to
references, for instance (Knappe, 2013). Section 2.3.8 will discuss different bonding techniques.
Pressure effects and oxygen quenching has been, as initially stated, an object of interest in several
research studies. In general, these effects have been shown to be negligible at pressure levels below
1kbar (Knappe, 2013). However, there is a group of europium doped phosphors that have shown some
influence of increased oxygen partial pressures (Binder, 2019). As shown in this chapter, there is a lot
of potential error sources that may affect accuracy and precision. Therefore, it is recommended to

34

review the setup thoroughly and carefully consider the detector rack, operation parameters, choice
of phosphor and calibration procedure to minimize the potential impact on the results. The general
approach in the literature has been to focus and isolate particular error sources and include them in
the calibration setup to investigate the impact on the measurements in comparison to a reference
measurement (Abou Nada, 2016; Binder, 2019a; 2019b).
The key takeaways from this section, summarized in a list.
• Phosphor emittance wavelengths in the blue region are likely to interfere with the emission
spectrum of the flame
• Soot luminosity effects might become a significant problem with combustion durations
longer than 7 ms
• Effects of signal trapping and laser extinction can be reduced in the sensitive region for the
phosphor, by choice of phosphor, detector, and its settings
• Coating thickness should be as thin as possible to minimize insulation effects, while not so
thin that the signal to noise ratio decreases

2.3.7 Phosphor selection
As noted in the previous chapters, one of the keys to successful measurements by thermographic
phosphors is already determined when the choice of phosphor is made. To be able to choose the
correct phosphor, the operator needs to know quite a lot about the conditions where the
measurements will take place, but also some knowledge about different phosphors and their
characteristics is required. The aim of this chapter is to review a few phosphors and their
characteristics, such as absorption wavelength, emission wavelength and sensitive range. The chapter
will mainly consider phosphors and factors suitable for the decay time method, but some phosphors
mentioned are suitable also for the intensity method. Based on the literature, there is also several
suggestions or requirements that can be taken into consideration when choosing phosphor.
Discussions in sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.3, clarifies the basic principle of thermographic phosphors and
the decay time method. Figure 14 indicates how a typical phosphor decay signal would look like when
visualising the output signal from the PMT. In Figure 24 obtained from Abou Nada (2016), the
characteristic feature of the decay time method is correlated to a typical diagram describing the
relation between decay time and temperature after performing a calibration. The right side of Figure
24 describes a temperature-sensitive region, where the decay time change rapidly as a function of
temperature (Abou Nada, 2016). The quenching temperature marks the breaking point where the
decay time of a particular phosphor enters the sensitive region (Abou Nada, 2016). Different
phosphors will show increased sensitivity to temperature in different regions (Abou Nada, 2016). The
characteristic decay time will also vary with respect to the chosen phosphor and will vary between
several milliseconds down to a few nanoseconds. Choosing a phosphor with high enough sensitivity is
maybe the most crucial for maintaining a good precision and accuracy of the measurements (Binder,
2019). Binder (2019) defined the sensitivity, Sτ, according to the following expression

𝑆𝜏 = −

𝛿𝜏
𝛿𝑇

𝜏

∙ 100%

(14)

where the τ, denotes the decay time and T, the temperature (Binder, 2019). In order to reach
satisfactory accuracy and precision the sensitivity should be larger than 0.6 %K-1 (Binder, et al., 2020).

35

Figure 24 A general illustration of decay time and correlating temperature (Abou Nada, 2016)

Binder (2019) defined five criteria’s for choosing a suitable phosphor for the intended measurements.
These were primarily based on previous experience. According to these, the phosphor was chosen so
that the emitted wavelengths would be shorter than the expected emission from the luminous diesel
flame earlier shown in Figure 3. The chosen phosphor should also be stable in the intended test
conditions and have a high quantum yield to ensure a strong phosphorescence signal in relation to
excitation (Binder, 2019). The decay time should be kept quite short, below 1 µs, to reduce the effect
of the rapidly changing background in the combustion chamber (Binder, et al., 2020). A temporal
resolution of 1 CAD in the engine of interest is approximately what is desirable (Binder, et al., 2020).
For an engine running at 750 rpm, the corresponding time window would then be around 220 µs.
Binder (2019) argued that the evaluation window for the decay time, τ, should be 3.5 times shorter
than the targeting temporal resolution, which means that the decay time should be shorter than 60
µs for the engine in the example above. In other words, keeping the background noise constant with
respect to the decay time yield much shorter decay times compared to the ones related to engine
speed. In contrast to these criteria, for example, Husberg, et al. (2005) used phosphors with decay
times clearly higher than 1 µs and emittance above 600 nm rather than around 450 nm as suggested
by Binder (2019).
In literature, there is a lot of different phosphors that have been evaluated for thermographic
measurements in a variety of applications. Following this section, some of them will be presented to
highlight the importance of making a well-considered choice. One of the most used phosphors with a
wide temperature sensitivity range is magnesium fluorogermanate doped with manganese
(Mg3FGeO6:Mn) (Aldén, et al., 2011). The characteristic emission spectra upon excitation by 355 nm
and temperature calibration curve can be seen in Figure 25 (Abou Nada, 2016). As seen from Figure
25, Mg3FGeO6:Mn has two emission bands, one at 631 and another at 657 nm. Aldén, et al. (2011)
stated that the emission bands are thermally coupled through the Boltzmann distribution, meaning
that these two emission bands also can be utilized for the intensity ratio technique earlier discussed
in this thesis. In general, Mg3FGeO6:Mn can be excited by a light from the entire UV-spectra (Knappe,
2013). The sensitive region of Mg3FGeO6:Mn lays between 700 K – 1050 K, where the decay time
changes from 10-3 s to 10-7 s (Aldén, et al., 2011). A more detailed description of Mg3FGeO6:Mn can be
found from Aldén, et al. (2011), Knappe (2013) or Abou Nada (2016). Examples of research where
Mg3FGeO6:Mn have been used can be found from Husberg, et al. (2005) or Feuk, et al. (2021).

36

Figure 25 Characteristic emission spectra and temperature calibration curve for Mg3FGeO6:Mn by excitation of
355 nm (Abou Nada, 2016)

The zinc sulphide with silver doping (ZnS:Ag) has a broad emission spectrum in the blue wavelengths
region, with a centre of 450 nm (Aldén, et al., 2011). ZnS:Ag can be successfully excited by 355 nm and
emits a strong luminescent signal sensitive to temperatures in the 400 – 875 K, which can be seen
from Figure 26 (Abou Nada, 2016). Aldén, et al. (2011) also commented that ZnS:Ag shows a spectral
shift that is dependent on the temperature. However, it is not large enough to enable temperature
measurements based on that. The characteristic temperature decay time for ZnS:Ag is very short and
can be in the order of 10-8 s close to the upper-temperature limit. Abou Nada, et al. (2016) found that
lubrication oil will have a negative impact on temperature measurements with ZnS:Ag. ZnS:Ag seems
to be an attractive blue phosphor with a short decay time, indicating good suitability for combustion
research application. It has been used in a variety of research, for example, by (Binder, 2019). A more
detailed discussion of the phosphor characteristics can be found in Särner, et al. (2008), Aldén, et al.
(2011) or Abou Nada (2016).

Figure 26 Characteristic emission spectra and temperature calibration curve for ZnS:Ag by excitation of 355 nm
(Abou Nada, 2016)

Barium magnesium aluminate doped with europium, BaMg 2Al16O27:Eu, is commonly referred to as
BAM. Similarly, to the previously mentioned phosphor, BAM also exhibits emission in the blue region
upon excitation at 355nm (Aldén, et al., 2011). As seen in Figure 27, BAM has a peak emittance at 448
nm and a sensitive temperature range between 700 K and 1150 K (Aldén, et al., 2011). As the emission

37

band changes and shifts towards the blue region as a function of temperature, the two-colour
wavelength-ratio approach can also be utilized with this phosphor (Knappe, 2013). Särner, et al. (2008)
argued that BAM, with its overall short decay times with stability and emission in the blue region, is
very well suited for combustion measurements. As previously mentioned, in section 2.3.6, it has been
found that phosphors doped with europium suffer from degradation when exposed to high
temperatures. From the thesis made by (Abou Nada, 2016) it seems that the degradation mechanism
is not easy to overcome. There has been a lot of interest shown in this phosphor and discussions in,
for example, Särner, et al. (2008), Aldén, et al. (2011) or Knappe (2013).

Figure 27 Characteristic emission spectra and temperature calibration curve for BaMg2Al16O27: Eu by excitation
of 355 nm (Abou Nada, 2016)

Except for the examples introduced in this chapter, there is a lot of different phosphors available on
the market with different characteristics. From the literature, there are several sources reviewing
different options, including dopants etc. (Särner, et al., 2008; Aldén, et al., 2011; Knappe, 2013; Abou
Nada, 2016; Binder, 2019). In Figure 28 obtained from Särner, et al., (2008), several phosphors have
been revised and plotted with respect to temperature. Some of the phosphors are suitable for the
decay method, and some are suitable for the intensity ratio method. As seen from Figure 28Figure

26, there are different phosphor options covering a considerable temperature span, especially in the
lower regions below 800 K. At high temperatures, the selection narrows out, and characteristic decay
times are either quite low or rather high. Similar trends can be seen from other literature sources such
as Abou Nada (2016) or Binder (2019). Learnings from this chapter yield that there is a need to know
the conditions quite well to choose a suitable phosphor. The intention of this section reviewing
different phosphors and general characteristics is to give guidance for the choice of phosphor for the
intended measurements. The measurement set-up used will be discussed and motivated later in the
thesis. See section 3.1.2.
The key takeaways from this section, summarized in a list.
• Phosphor decay times to be kept shorter than 1 µs, to reduce background effects
• Selected phosphor should be sensitive in the measurement region and emit a strong
luminescence signal upon excitation
• Phosphor selection crucial, some phosphors are sensitive to lube oil, other transforms
permanently upon exposure to certain temperatures

2.3.8 Coating techniques
As previously noted in section 2.3.5, the thickness of the phosphor layer can have an impact on the
temperature measurements as it acts as a thermal barrier. The present chapter will review different
bonding techniques and discuss practical aspects arising from the literature. In order to get a wellworking phosphor coating, it should be durable to high temperatures and have no impact on the
absorption and emittance (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). (Knappe, 2013) also gave some rules of thumb to
sandblast and clean the measurement surface with acetone prior to coating to increase the
adhesiveness of it and avoid oil films to interfere (Knappe, 2013).

39

Khalid & Kontis (2008) categorised different bonding methods into three groups. The first one,
chemical bonding, mainly refers to mixing the phosphor powder with an adhesive prior to coating the
slurry on the surface of interest. One of the most common ways in the literature has been to spray it
on the surface with an airbrush, as this ensures a thin homogeneous layer that can be applied fairly
easy on large areas (Knappe, 2013; Binder, 2019; Feuk, et al., 2021). However, it is also possible to
apply the coating slurry with a paintbrush, but this generally results in an inhomogeneous coating layer
thicker compared to an airbrush (Knappe, 2013). Practical experience conclude that it is advised to
sandblast and clean the surface with acetone prior to coating to increase the adhesiveness of it and
avoid oil films to interfere (Knappe, 2013). Furthermore, the phosphor powder can be dissolved in
ethanol before mixing with the binder agent to increase the homogeneity (Knappe, 2013).
Additionally, some practical hints from Knappe (2013) suggest the use of a hot air gun to warm up the
surface of interest to evaporate the solvent alcohol and dry the coating. The ratio between phosphor
powder and binder agent does not seem to be critical and usually varies between researchers. As
Knappe (2013) mentions, these are usually obtained by experience from empirical tests and are
around 1:20 or 1:32 with respect to mass.
The challenge with this technique is to find suitable binders that do not interact with the
phosphorescence. The binder needs to be transparent both to excitation wavelengths and emittance
wavelengths (Knappe, 2013). The binder agent also has to be stable in high temperatures and
pressures, which in practice limits the selection (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). A magnesium aluminium
silicate-based binder called HPC from ZYP coatings has been frequently used by Knappe (2013), Binder
(2019) and Feuk, et al. (2021). The HPC is a soft binder that dries in 20 minutes at room temperature
and can withstand elevated temperatures up to 1700 K (Knappe, 2013). More interesting binders can
be found from Khalid & Kontis (2008), as they discussed several different binders. The advantage of
using a binder to coat the phosphor is the ease of use and cheap tools to apply a relatively thin and
homogeneous layer on the surface of interest (Knappe, 2013). The disadvantage is mainly related to
the binder. As the binder does not contribute to the thermographic properties, it will, in the end, have
a negative effect on the phosphor compared to a case where only the phosphor is coated on the
surface (Knappe, 2013). Even though the layer thickness is relatively thin, some 10 µm is possible, it is
up to the skills of the operator to achieve a good homogeneity and thickness. A risk with too thick
coatings is that they can crack due to differences in thermal expansion between the binder and
substrate material (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). As an example, Allison, et al. (2001) found that nickel alloys
are challenging due to differences in thermal expansion, causing the paint to crack and flake off.
Except for the chemical bonding technique discussed in the previous section, there are other
techniques that have been discussed in the literature. The remaining categories by Khalid & Kontis
(2008) consist of a group called vapour deposition and one called plasma spray. There are several
different vapour techniques that condense the phosphor onto the surface of the substrate (Khalid &
Kontis, 2008). The advantage of the vapour deposition is that it results in a robust, pure phosphor layer
that is extremely thin, in order of 1 µm (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). The main disadvantages are the costly
equipment needed and expertise, as it is a rather complex way of coating the phosphor onto the
surface of interest (Knappe, 2013). Additionally, the coating areas might be very restricted (Khalid &
Kontis, 2008). Plasma spray or flame spray is a method where the phosphor powder is liquefied by an
electrical discharge and sprayed onto the surface of interest (Khalid & Kontis, 2008). This method
produces thicker layers compared to the vapour deposition method, but similarly to the vapour
method, the coating is purely phosphor and contains no binding agent (Khalid & Kontis, 2008).

MATERIAL AND LABORATORY TESTS

The focus of this chapter is to describe how the measurements have been set-up and tested in this
thesis. The first part of the chapter will describe the experimental set-up and how the learnings from
the literature review have been applied to increase the chances of successful and accurate
measurements. The second part will discuss the design of the measurement set-up to fit a W31 diesel
injector into the spray combustion chamber, including the shapes inserted in the chamber for the
measurements. The third part of the chapter presents the calibration procedure of the different
phosphors, both initially to learn how the equipment should be used and, after some iterations, the
final version that were used for the actual measurements. The last section in this chapter presents the
set-up that was used in the measurements.

3.1

Experimental set-up

This section is mainly focusing on the experimental set-up and the functional principle of the dedicated
test rig. The development of the Wärtsilä spray combustion chamber will be reviewed together with
its capabilities and suitability for the intended measurements in the first section. The first part will
discuss the choice of method and reason over the decisions made when building the measurement
set-up. The second part will present the dedicated test rig, its capabilities, and drawbacks for the
intended measurements.

3.1.1 Choice of method and experimental set-up
As mentioned in the introduction, the goal of this thesis is to provide validation data for improving the
CFD-modelling of diesel combustion. Since the outcome of this thesis will be used by the CFD team,
they can be seen as the customers of this project. In other words, good communication with the CFD
team is needed when choosing a method and designing the experimental set-up. The literature
section, chapter 2, started with a brief discussion of the characteristic diesel combustion, some
injection and combustion strategies ending with some comments about the different heat transfer
modes in an internal combustion engine. The outcome of this discussion yields that a reacting diesel
spray in a Wärtsilä W31 sized engine has a quiescent luminous flame that produces a lot of soot and
burns for a long time, about 11 ms. These learnings govern the choice of method and needed optical
equipment when evaluating different options.
Several temperature measurements techniques were presented and briefly discussed in the literature,
see chapter 2.2. The different methods were divided into a group of contact techniques and remote
techniques. Even though the easy use of the contact methods involving templug and thermal paint,
they are known to react slowly to temperature changes and only yield a maximum temperature
(Knappe, 2013; Binder, 2019). Therefore, the only feasible contact method to consider for surface
temperature measurement on in-cylinder surfaces is thermocouples. In the literature, one of the more
significant disadvantages of thermocouples is their thermal inertia, intrusive nature and difficulties to
install and measure on moving objects. However, if using a constant volume pre-combustion hot cell,
as described in section 3.1.2, it will be pretty easy to install multiple thermocouples. Despite the
advantages of thermocouples and their well-documented behaviour, their relatively slow response
time will not be enough to resolve the rapidly changing conditions during diesel combustion. Moving
over to remote techniques, pyrometers and thermographic phosphors generally do not need any more
considerable changes to the combustion chamber and enables a fast temperature response contrary

41

to thermocouples. In this thesis, pyrometry and phosphor thermography were discussed as options.
The pyrometry is well suited for measuring luminous sooty flames that acts similarly to a blackbody.
Measuring a surface with a sooty flame present, as the case with a marine diesel engine running at
high loads, will be challenging with the pyrometry. As the thermographic phosphors can resolve
temperatures with an excellent temporal resolution despite having a diesel flame present, they are an
interesting technique for these measurements. This discussion resulted in the thermographic
phosphors being considered as the most suitable method for the present studies involving surface
temperature measurements of in-cylinder components. An ultra-high-speed pyrometer described by
Sposito, et al., (2020) will be included in the measurement set-up for flame temperature
measurements. As the flame temperature is not the main subject of this thesis, the set-up and
measurement will not be reviewed in detail. However, results from initial testing may be helpful when
taking the measurements into use. As mentioned earlier, the readers are referred to Sposito, et al.,
(2020) for details regarding the pyrometer and to section 4.1 for a presentation of the initial tests
where the pyrometer results were handy.
The literature study, chapter 2, is mainly focusing on thermographic phosphors. There is a handful
options of different approaches that can be applied to utilize their temperature dependency. Among
these, the intensity ratio technique and decay time method are the most used methods in the
literature. Except for the general presentation, these methods were discussed in more detail in
sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3. The advantage of using the intensity ratio method is the 2D possibilities, but
as the accuracy, precision, and sensitivity have been shown to be superior for the decay time method,
it was decided in an early stage of the project to prioritize high accuracy and precision instead of 2D
measurements (Wärtsilä, 2021a).
The decay time method nor any other measurement techniques utilizing thermographic phosphors
has, to the author's knowledge, ever been used at Wärtsilä previously. Therefore, it was a need to
review the method and needed equipment in detail. From the general working principles of
thermography found in section 2.3.1, it was evident that an excitation source was needed to excite
the luminescence centres to an excited state. The excitation source commonly used were later
reviewed in detail in a separate section, 2.3.4. Following the discussion in the literature, a suitable
excitation source would be a laser with the option of emitting laser beams in the UV region of the
wavelength spectra. As the decay time method was chosen, the laser needs to be a pulsed version,
ideally with as high repetition rates as possible to enable several measurement points during a single
spray event. Furthermore, the dedicated test rig, presented in section 3.1.2, is in an industrial lab
environment where vibrations, dust etc. might become an issue.
A laser is a big investment, so in addition to the requirements for laser-induced phosphorescence,
some other requirements were considered. Finding a laser suitable for all applications is hard,
therefore, some compromises had to be made. The laser available for the measurements, seen
in Figure 29, is a double pulsed system consisting of two 10 Hz Nd:YAG lasers. As the lasers have a
repetition rate of 10 Hz, only one measurement point per spray can be captured. The laser has a beam
diameter of 9 mm and a characteristic wavelength of 1064 nm (Quantel Laser, 2021). The wavelength
can be changed by frequency multiplying, as discussed in 2.3.4, resulting in 532 nm, 355 nm, 266 nm
and 213 nm being available (Quantel Laser, 2021). As mentioned in the literature, the energy levels
need to be held relatively low to avoid optical heating and saturation effects. The energy of each laser
can be adjusted between fractions of 1 mJ to 850 mJ by adjusting the Q-switch delay. Additionally,
both lasers can be run independently as a single pulsed laser. To accurately determine the energy
levels emitted by the laser, it is needed to measure the pulse energy. This can be done by utilizing a
pyroelectric sensor. As this laser has a relatively large beam diameter, the spatial resolution will not

42

be ideal. To obtain precise temperature data from a point measurement, a smaller beam would be
desirable. In literature, a variety of beam sizes has been used between 4 mm and 12 mm (Knappe,
2013; Binder, 2019). The beam size can also be altered by building a Newtonian telescope as suggested
in Hecht (2017) or by using an aperture as Binder (2019). Another way of decreasing the spot size is to
use a stencil when coating the phosphor onto the substrate. However, this prohibits moving and
adjustment of test points during measurements. Adding more optics or decreasing test points by using
a stencil was considered as a potential error source at the time of initial testing and were therefore
left for future improvements.

measurement set-up

Before reviewing the detector, rack and components related to signal detection, there is a need to
discuss phosphor selection. Choosing a suitable phosphor may be the most challenging part when
designing a measurement set-up for thermographic phosphors. Section 2.3.6 and 2.3.7 in the literature
presented and discussed observations and research outcomes through the past years. Learnings from
these discussions suggest that the operator must know the conditions the phosphor will be exposed
to choose a suitable phosphor. For instance, temperature levels, lubrication oil entrainment and
characteristics of used phosphor will affect the choice of phosphors. Similarly to Binder (2019), several
criteria were considered. As the characteristic diesel combustion in a large medium-speed engine is
rather long and produces a massive amount of light and soot, the phosphors considered needs to
produce a strong luminescence signal. Additionally, the phosphor should emit wavelengths shorter
than 500 nm to avoid wavelengths emitted by the diesel combustion (Binder, 2019). Maybe the most
crucial requirement in a case where an intense diesel flame is burnt is a decay time shorter than 1 µs
to reduce the effect of blackbody radiation (Binder, et al., 2020). Temperature intervals of interest
were discussed together with the simulation team and resulted in a temperature range of interest
between 600 K and 900 K (Wärtsilä, 2021a).
During a discussion with Richter, et al. (2021), four different phosphors were chosen for the intended
measurements. The first one, Mg3FGeO6:Mn, was chosen since it is a well-known phosphor stable in
combustion environments. As shown in section 2.3.7, Mg3FGeO6:Mn has a broad sensitivity range and
long decay times, staring from 1 ms. Due to the emission peaks above 500 nm and long decays, it is
not optimal for intended measurements. However, if the signal is strong enough, it will provide a stable
measurement signal that either might be used for determining the temperature or as input to choose
a more suitable phosphor for the measurement conditions. Another phosphor considered is ZnS:Ag.
ZnS:Ag fits very well for the application when comparing the requirements previously discussed to the

43

information given in section 2.3.7. The disadvantage with ZnS:Ag is the sensitivity to lubrication oil and
quite short decay times, below 10 ns, at temperatures above 720 K. Short decays set requirements of
sample speed for the detection side, to resolve a decay signal below 10 ns, a sample rate of 2 Gs/s is
needed (DEWESoft, 2020). Another phosphor with similar characteristics as ZnS:Ag is YVO 4:Tm. The
last phosphor chosen as a candidate is BAM. Despite the disadvantage with a hysteresis, BAM is
suitable for quite high temperatures combined with an emission in the blue region and short decay
times. It is an interesting option. Phosphor coating was in this thesis done with a chemical bonding
technique where an adhesive is mixed with the phosphor and then sprayed with an airbrush on top of
the surface, as described in section 2.3.8. To summarise, the selection of phosphors can all effectively
be excited by a laser pulse of 355 nm and possesses characteristic wavelength peaks at 450 nm, 480
nm, or 660 nm. ZnS:Ag and YVO4:Tm are sensitive to temperatures between 500 – 750 K, while
Mg3FGeO6:Mn and BAM are sensitive to temperatures between 700 K and 1000 K.
The next part of the optical pathway is the detector rack. The main component on the rack is the PMT
which will convert the phosphorescence signal into an electrical signal that can be measured with an
oscilloscope. For measurements in this thesis, a gated PMT, Hamamatsu H11526-20-NF, has been
selected due to its fast response and sensitivity (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K, 2021). The gate option
will be reducing saturation effects on the measurements, as presented in section 2.3.5. As discussed
in the literature, there are several precautions to be considered to achieve the best possible accuracy
and precision. The estimated combustion duration for a Wärtsilä W31 sized marine diesel engine,
mentioned in section 2.1.1, is around 11 ms. The photocathode of the PMT is very sensitive and will
not be physically protected. Therefore, Binder, et al. (2020) suggested that a mechanical shutter
should be used to protect the photocathode from saturation if the combustion duration is longer than
7 ms. For this reason, a mechanical shutter has been added to the detection rack. Additionally, the
detection rack contains a focusing lens, focal length 100 mm, which will focus the emitted signal onto
the photocathode of the PMT. The main components of the detector rack can be seen in Figure 30.

Figure 30 Detector rack components; PMT, optical filters, mechanical shutter and focusing lens

44

So far, the components described will improve the signal strength and decrease saturation effects due
to overexposure and high light intensity. However, as the combustion process will emit a broad
spectrum of different wavelengths and the phosphorescence has a particular emission wavelength,
there is a need to filter the optical signal to avoid interference with the measurements from other
wavelengths. For this purpose, a combination of bandpass filters, long pass and short pass filters can
be combined to restrict the transmission of other wavelengths than the ones emitted by the phosphor.
In Figure 30, the optical filter mounts can be seen between the PMT and mechanical shutter. The
protection rings were made to restrict any light from hitting the PMT photocathode unless they travel
through the optical pathway. The choice of filters depends on the characteristic wavelength of the
phosphor used.
The dotted lines in Figure 31 describe the transmission of light through a variety of optical filters and
combinations of these. The red and blue lines represent a short pass filter and a long pass filter. The
short-pass filter will allow short wavelengths to pass through, and after the characteristic cut off
wavelength of 532 nm, it will block longer wavelengths, mainly from the burning diesel spray. A long
pass filter works the other way around and will block shorter wavelengths up to 405 nm and allow
longer wavelengths through. The long-pass filter was mainly chosen to reduce laser reflections to pass
through. The bandpass filter, shown with a black line in Figure 31, has a transmission band of 20 nm
with a centre at 448 nm, which is close to the emittance wavelength for BAM and ZnS:Ag. The solid
lines in Figure 31 correspond to the optical density of the same filters as discussed above. Optical
density, OD, can be obtained from the transmission data by applying the following expression
1

𝑂𝐷 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔 ( )

(14)

𝑇

where, T, is the transmission in decimal form (Thorlabs, 2021). Using the OD to compare filters is
efficient in the blocking regions, as seen in Figure 31. Despite the transmission being close to 0 %,
there are apparent differences. On the other hand, in regions where transmission is close to 100 %,
the OD number is not showing any differences.

The filters can be mounted in series to achieve good blocking bands and still retain the transmission
band of the bandpass filter. Figure 32 shows two different combinations utilizing the individual filters
previously shown in Figure 31. The bandpass filter was left for comparison to the most
straightforward case using just one individual filter. The orange line, combination 1, represents a series
of filters containing one bandpass filter, one long-pass filter and one short pass filter. It can be
observed that the transmission at the selected band, around 450 nm, is reduced compared to a single
bandpass filter. On the other hand, the OD number in the block bands have been doubled compared
to the bandpass filter. In the second combination, shown in green, a second bandpass filter has been
applied. Even though there is a second bandpass filter, the transmission band is kept constant, while
the OD numbers for the blocking bands is notably increased.

The last part of the detection line is an oscilloscope. Special care was taken when choosing a cable
between the detector rack and the oscilloscope. According to the literature, section 2.3.5, there is a
need to choose a 50-ohm coaxial cable to match the termination resistance of the oscilloscope and
the inbuilt resistance on the PMT side. Furthermore, Knappe (2013) recommended keeping the cable
as short as possible. In practice, this means that the oscilloscope needs to be positioned close to the
detector rack instead of the control room 20 m away. The oscilloscope used has a remote control
option enabling the oscilloscope to be physical as close as possible to the detector rack while it still
could be controlled from the control room (Tektronix, 2012).

3.1.2 Dedicated Test Rig
As the phosphor thermometry method requires optical access to the combustion chamber, the
selection of possible test rigs or engines narrows down. From previous chapters, for instance 2.3.6, it
is clear that the harsh conditions inside an internal combustion engine yield challenging conditions to
measure. For example, the exposure to lubrication oils and the continuous exposure to heat cycles
increase the chances of significant errors in the temperature measurements. This discussion suggests

46

that the use of an optical spray combustion chamber would be convenient in as the environment inside
the chamber is similar to the ones in the engine and provides excellent optical access as well as
restricts the interference of lubrication oil and large numbers of combustion cycles.
Optical spray combustion chambers have been utilized, with increased interest since the early 1980s,
to study in-cylinder phenomena in more detail (Oren, et al., 1984). In the literature, a handful of
concepts have been evaluated and built, giving slightly different functionalities, advantages and
disadvantages (Baert, et al., 2009). For example, an optical engine is a design that resembles a real
engine the most, but it suffers from limited and restricted optical access to the combustion chamber.
A constant volume hot cell or constant pressure flow chamber has the potential for excellent optical
access, but clearly, the combustion chamber is a step away from actual engine conditions with internal
flows, a moving piston etc. In the end, the choosing chamber concept is a trade-off between optical
accessibility and similarity to an actual engine situation.
The optical spray combustion chamber at Wärtsilä, seen in Figure 33, was built by a team of students
that was supported by Wärtsilä personnel. The optical spray combustion chamber built at Wärtsilä is
a constant volume pre-combustion hot cell type of test rig. The spray chamber can either be operated
in cold conditions combined with non-reactive conditions or in hot conditions with either reactive or
non-reactive conditions. In cold conditions, the chamber is pressurized by high-pressure air to an
engine-related density. In hot conditions, a pre-combustion event of a carefully calculated gas-mixture
elevates the temperature and pressure like the ones in an engine. This is referred to as reactive
conditions as a fuel injection at this point would self-ignite and burn similar to a characteristic
quiescent diesel flame, previously described in section 2.1.1. When operating the chamber in hot, nonreactive conditions, the gas-mixture for the pre-combustion must be calculated so that the oxygen is
consumed by the pre-combustion event. In this case, the pressure and temperature level will be like
the ones in an internal combustion engine, but with no oxygen. These conditions are essential when
aiming for the study of evaporation.

Figure 33 Wärtsilä Optical Spray Combustion Chamber, hydraulic gas exchange valves and insulation for hot
conditions

47

The chamber consists of a cubically shaped frame to which a variety of modules can be attached. The
standard set-up includes a gas-exchange adapter, an injector adapter, and a minimum number of
windows, according to need. The rest of the sides have a steel dummy installed. In Figure 33, the
injector is mounted upside-down underneath the chamber body. The hydraulic gas exchange valves,
together with exhaust pipes and gas pipes, have been placed on the backside of the chamber mainly
for a practical reason. In general, the chamber is robust, flexible and can withstand high pressures to
mimic cylinder conditions in both hot and cold environments.

Figure 34 A Typical natural chemiluminescence visualization of a burning diesel spray captured at engine
relevant conditions, generated by a pre-combustion event in the Optical Spray Combustion Chamber at Wärtsilä

Figure 34 shows one of the first natural chemiluminescence visualizations captured by a high-speed
camera in the spray combustion chamber where the hot reactive conditions were created through a
pre-combustion event. The right side of Figure 34 shows the pressure trace from the chamber during
the combustion cycle. As seen from the pressure trace, which increases from zero to a predefined
pressure level as the chamber is filled with different gases, forming an ignitable gas mixture. The rapid
pressure increase seen in Figure 34 is when the gas mixture burns and raises the temperature and
pressure to levels relevant for the selected measurement point. When the pre-combustion event has
ended, the pressure and temperature start to decrease due to heat transfer to the surroundings. At
some point, the pressure reaches the intended measurement point, whereby a signal is given to the
injector, which will start the fuel injection. The diesel combustion seen in Figure 34 is marked by the
vertical line in the graph on the right side of the picture. The present thesis, together with the work by
Nyberg (2022), utilizes this process to reproduce the events in the cylinder.

3.2

CAD design and measurement preparation

To enable temperature measurements in engine-relevant conditions for a W31 sized engine inside the
optical spray combustion chamber, there is a need to design components holding the injector.
Furthermore, components representing in-cylinder shapes or relevant surfaces and cases improve the

48

simulation work, which yields the goal of this thesis. This chapter will mainly focus on the discussion
and decisions made to raise the quality of the measurement output with respect to the intended CFD
simulations. The design of the injector adapter plate, thimble etc. has been excluded from this thesis
and will not be discussed in detail. Some notes will also be included about the needed design for the
heat transfer sensors applied in the same measurement as a part of the thesis work by Nyberg (2022).
Additionally, this chapter will discuss the optical access needed to conduct optical measurements
utilizing thermographic phosphors and trigger management needed to control the timing of the
measurements.

3.2.1 Optical Access & CAD models
The optical spray combustion chamber, located at Vaskiluoto engine laboratory, is based on modular
design. It is easy to design and include special features, particularly inside the combustion chamber.
The base plate for the injector adapter with needed connections etc. existed prior to and is shown
in Figure 35. The injector adapter design is optimized for visualizations of one or two sprays. The rest
of the sprays are captured by a thimble and will not take part in the measurements. To increase the
optical accessibility of the spray, the injector has been tilted. As seen from the CAD model in Figure
35, there are cable routing channels already existing in the adapter. These can be utilized for heat
transfer sensors.

Figure 35 An Injector adapter plate suitable for a standard W31 diesel injector

Initially, the target was to recreate the combustion chamber of a W31 engine as close as possible.
Therefore, different CAD models were generated to explore the possibilities of an optical spray
combustion chamber. Initially, detailed geometry of flame-plate and piston shapes were included to
preserve, for instance local hotspots, as mentioned by Cafari (2019). To ease the simulation work, it
was decided to simplify the geometry as much as possible and reduce the simulation complexity, which
otherwise would cause unnecessary uncertainties when simulating the same case (Wärtsilä, 2021a).
To optimize the measurement set-up with respect to CFD simulations, the focus changed from a setup corresponding to a simplified engine case to a case simplifying the CFD simulations. If the
simulations are not comparable with the measurement in the simplest possible case, they will not be
realistic when making the simulations more complex and adding engine-related geometries. This
discussion yields the primary motivation as to why the approach of measurement set-up drastically

49

changed direction. As the CFD models have been validated for a simple case, then the geometry can
gradually be made more complex and closer to an actual engine situation. A good starting point for
the evaluation of the surface temperatures and heat transfer from a reacting diesel spray by CFD
simulations would be similar to the ones described by Hiroshi, et al. (2018). The measurement set-up
inside the chamber changed from a complex piston shape, with multiple sprays, to a set-up where a
single spray is aimed perpendicularly to a flat plate, as seen in Figure 36. The plate will be
instrumented with a set of heat transfer sensors. Therefore, there is a need for drilled channels in the
plate, enabling cables to be connected to the sensors.

Figure 36 Plate set-up with a burning spray perpendicularly directed towards a plate

To evaluate the heat transfer, the material of the plate needs to be homogenous and well known with
respect to thermal properties. Therefore, special care was taken in the selection of material. Apart
from this, there are machining tolerances in the whole set-up. Due to this fact, the positioning of the
plate had to be made with some space for adjustment. The measurement will first evaluate the
alignment of a during a spray event on a painted plate and then accordingly align the instrumented
and phosphor-coated plate (Wärtsilä, 2021a). The initial idea was to utilize thermally sensitive paint
to get an initial understanding of the temperature levels. However, according to the discussion in
section 2.1.1, thermal paints require pretty long exposure times prior to a colour change. As a single
combustion event has been estimated to last for 11 ms combined, with quite long cycle times when
the testing is carried out in the spray combustion chamber, it was decided to paint the plate with
standard white colour paint and align it according to the soot marks produced when the burning spray
hits a relatively cold plate. Figure 37 shows two plates; the right one will be used for alignment, and
the left one will be instrumented with heat transfer sensors and coated with a phosphor coating. For
a more detailed discussion of the heat transfer sensors and their instrumentation, the reader is
referred to Nyberg (2022).

3.2.2 Trigger management and test cell layout
As the measurement set-up and needed CAD models had been clarified, the focus changed to the
general set-up in the test cell and planning of the measurements with respect to optical set-up and
synchronisation of all the equipment needed. Apart from measurements by thermographic phosphors
and heat transfer sensors, several measurement techniques will be added to provide more details on
the events inside the spray chamber. As most of the components on the spray chamber have been
designed internally, a CAD model of the whole test cell exists. Arranging a complex measurement setup with new equipment can be rather challenging, especially in a project involving a combined
experimental set-up.

Figure 38 Cell layout including preliminary sketches of the optical measurement set-up

By modelling the general set-up in the existing CAD model, it is easy to elaborate on different ideas.
In Figure 38, the test cell layout includes a spray chamber and an optical set-up for the instrumented
plate measurements. On the left side of the chamber, there are two high-speed cameras visualizing
the spray by natural chemiluminescence, hitting the plate from two different angles. One camera, a
colour high-speed camera, will be focusing on the section view of the plate, resolving the whole
combusting fuel spray. The second camera, a monochromic high-speed camera, will be mounted at an
angle and focus on the impingement point of the flame. The previously mentioned pyrometer will be
placed to the right of the chamber. Additionally, a spectrometer will be added to the right side to

51

evaluate the emitted wavelengths of the combustion event. The laser and PMT detector rack will be
positioned in front of the chamber. The laser beam can be adjusted with a set of beam steering devices
with suitable laser mirrors. The detector rack will be fastened to the aluminium frame around the
chamber as close as possible to the measurement plate located inside the chamber. As a rule of thumb,
the detector rack will be able to detect the laser-induced phosphorescence if the measurement spot
can visually be seen.
To clarify the optical set-up, components and connections needed, a sketch of the whole
measurement set-up was done. Figure 39 shows a detailed sketch of the needed equipment, including
the electrical connections. The left side in Figure 39 displays the needed power supplies, drivers, and
main components in the manager. The trigger parameters can be updated directly in the software,
where a BNC cable can be connected to the respective trigger input. The control computer in Figure
39 also represents the receiver end of multiple detection sources, such as high-speed cameras,
pyrometer, spectrometer, and heat transfer sensors, even though this has not been explicitly drawn
in Figure 39. The middle section of Figure 39 describes the excitation source and detection systems
used in this measurement set-up. The remaining section to the right in Figure 39 represents the
excitation signals and optical signals to be detected by the middle section. Additionally, the chamber
system, including all mechanical hardware, is represented by this group.

Calibration

The need for calibration and a calibration set-up resembling the measurement situation has been
mentioned in the literature part, for instance, in section 2.3.3. This chapter will describe the calibration

52

procedure and components needed for calibrating the thermographic phosphors. As measurements
utilizing thermographic phosphors is an advanced temperature measurement heavily depending on
phosphor selection, a calibration before the measurements were performed to map the available
phosphors. As it is recommended to perform the calibration with the same settings as the
measurements, there is also a need to re-do the calibration with the phosphor and settings used in
the measurements. However, an initial calibration will give an indication of the temperature levels
found in the measurements.

3.3.1 Calibration set-up
As the calibration needs to be performed, at controlled temperatures, in the same region as expected
from the measurements, there is a need for an oven with optical access and the possibility to attach
thermocouples to the intended measurement plate. The expected temperatures in the measurement
might be as high as 900 K, which indicates that a particular oven is needed. For the calibration, a special
plate was designed to be attached to the oven. The calibration plate was manufactured in the same
material as the measurement plate and included four installation points for thermocouples. The
thermocouples are needed to determine the temperature at any phosphorescence signal. Several
thermocouples are used to monitor temperature more accurately through an average value.
The calibration set-up for the initial calibration was installed in the test cell next to the spray chamber.
The laser and detection rack was kept at approximately the same distances as they would be later in
the measurements. The oven used for the initial calibration set-up was a forced convection oven, with
capabilities of a maximum temperature of 923 K. The oven had been customized with optical access
through a small window in the middle of the door to the oven. Figure 40 shows a picture with a
calibration measurement ongoing. The blue light, seen in the left part of Figure 40, is the
phosphorescence of 450 nm photons upon excitation by the 10 Hz pulsed laser at 355 nm. The right
part of Figure 40 shows the phosphor-coated calibration plate instrumented with a set of
thermocouples.

Figure 40 Initial calibration set-up where a phosphor emitting blue light were used, phosphor coated calibration
plate after calibration, can be seen to the right

53

The laser energy in the calibration set-up was kept at 1 – 1.5 mJ while the control voltage was kept at
0.4 V, as suggested by the literature. The initial calibration was done for ZnS:Ag, BAM and
Mg3FGeO6:Mn. The peak phosphorescence signal was initially considered very high, close to 1000 mV,
which indicates that a maximum output current from the PMT is in the range of 20 mA as the
termination resistance was kept at 50 ohms. It was suggested that the PMT limit could be seen more
as an average output maximum rather than a maximum for very short signal peaks. In general, it was
noted that the oven used in the calibration had a high heating rate but a relatively slow cooling rate.
Therefore, the measurements were done when the oven was heating the calibration plate at a heating
rate no higher than 3 K/min. Initially, the heating rate was kept too high, which caused fluctuations in
the measured decay time. Literature suggests a maximum heating rate of 4 K/min (Knappe, 2013).

Figure 41 Initial calibration measurement of Mg3FGeO6:Mn

The initial calibration curve, for Mg3FGeO6:Mn, in Figure 41, seems to agree with the calibration curves
shown in a variety of references. To get a quick idea of whether the decay times were realistic, the
oscilloscope was set to show the time between 80% and 5% of signal strength. As seen from Figure
41, it does not match the measurement points evaluated by a MATLAB script, but it appears to show
realistic values. As the decay times were analysed in MATLAB after the campaign had ended, the
preliminary results from the oscilloscope came in handy. According to Figure 41, there is an enhanced
temperature sensitivity at 700 K. A characteristic decay curve and measured decay curve can be seen
in Figure 42. The red line describes the measurement signal obtained from the oscilloscope. The green
line corresponds to an initially guessed value of the decay curve, while the blue one corresponds to
the real decay curve produced by the MATLAB script. The black point is the signal peak, and the blue
stars represent the start and end of the evaluation window. From Figure 42, it appears like the
calculated decay curve describes the measured decay signal within the evaluation window quite well.

54

Figure 42 Showing a typical phosphor decay curve for Mg3FGeO6:Mn

Similarly to the initial calibration with Mg 3FGeO6:Mn, calibration and comparison to the literature
were also made for the case with ZnS:Ag and BAM. Figure 43 shows a comparison for the initial
calibration for ZnS:Ag. It can be noted that there is a slight difference between the calibration curves
from the references. The initial decay times, evaluated from the oscilloscope, indicated similar times
as one of the literature sources. The analysed calibration points are clearly indicating shorter decay
times compared to the literature. Compared to the previously shown calibration curve, the precision
was much worse during the measurement of this phosphor, especially towards higher temperatures
where the decay time is shorter than 10 ns.

Figure 43 Showing initial calibration of ZnS:Ag compared to literature

By checking the raw data, seen in Figure 44, the poor precision at shorter decay times is because of
the too low sample rate. As mentioned in section 3.1.1, the sample rate needed to resolve a decay
curve shorter than 10 ns is greater than 2 GS/s. Due to the poor resolution of the decay curves above
650 K, the calculated decay time, seen in Figure 43, varies a lot. Additionally, it was noticed that the
choice of evaluation window used in MATLAB caused a significant change in decay time. However, by
adjusting the evaluation window slightly, the fitting curve error increased or decreased.

56

The initial calibration of BAM resulted in the graph seen in Figure 45. There is an apparent
disagreement between different literature sources for the calibration of BAM. As factors like laser
energy, dopant concentration, excitation wavelength and emission wavelength might be different in
different measurement set-ups, a gap as large as the one seen in Figure 45 is actually feasible. The
initial calibration performed appears to have reasonably precision, comparable to the initial
calibration of Mg3FGeO6:Mn previously discussed. Additionally, the shape of the curve appears to be
like the curves presented in the literature. However, the initial calibration curves obtained indicated
much longer decay times compared to corresponding tests by the literature. Additionally, at low
temperatures, the initial calibration curves seem to have a slightly parabolic shape, see Figure 46,
which indicates that there might be something wrong with the initial calibration curve.

Figure 45 Initial calibration of BAM compared to literature

A typical decay curve from the initial calibration of BAM can be seen in Figure 46. Here it can be noted
that the peak signal from the measurements are extremely high, close to 5 V. The shape of the decay
curve is also an indication of something abnormal affecting the measurements. Extremely high signal
strength will lead to saturation effects of the PMT, resulting in an error in the measured decay time.
Knappe, et al. (2012) investigated the saturation effects of both photocathode and dynodes as well as
space charge effects on the anode of the PMT. It was speculated that the output signal of the PMT
reaches a maximum as the peak signal is constant at 4.8V. The initial calibration could not be thrusted
as an indicator of the temperature for the measurements. Instead, the calibration had to be re-done
after the measurements, aiming to match the same signal output as received in the measurements on
the Chamber.

57

Figure 46 Typical decay curve from the initial calibration of BAM

3.3.2 Calibration of measurement systems
As the initial calibration was more of a first on hands experience with the phosphor, it was initially
planned that calibration should be performed after the experiments, utilizing the same parameters as
in the measurements. The initial calibration for the phosphor used, BAM, failed due to high signal
strengths and could initially not be used, even for an indication of the temperature level. The recalibration of the phosphor was done only for the phosphor used in the measurement.
The same hardware as in the previous calibration was also utilized here, with the difference that the
thermocouples had been calibrated. The thermocouple calibration was focused, particularly at the
temperatures of interest, i.e. a temperature above 650 K. As the previous calibration of BAM failed,
due to saturation effects and space charge effects. The phosphor signal was decreased to match the
signal strength from the measurement points obtained in the chamber. As seen in Figure 47,
a calibration was performed with the laser energy lowered to match the signal strengths from the
measurements. The calibration performed 19.11.2021 resulted in a more realistic calibration curve
shape.
The measurement points obtained from this measurement has poor precision. Therefore, another
calibration was done on 26.11.2021, where the output signal was reduced by increasing the distance
between the detector rack and coated plate in the oven. As seen from the second re-calibration curve
in Figure 47, the precision is much better, and the shape of the curve is like the ones in the literature.

58

It was speculated that the calibration curve from 19.11.2021, where the laser energy output was
adjusted, resulted in a varying laser pulse energy due to the long q-switch delay used. As the
calibration started at room temperature, and the signal strength was matched to the measurements
already at this point. As the non-radiative relaxations are favoured at a higher temperature, as
discussed in section 2.3.1, the intensity and, therefore, the corresponding signal strength is gradually
reduced. Therefore, there was a need to move the detector rack close to the plate to ensure a
corresponding signal strength in the same temperature regions as the measurements. However, this
resulted in a slight offset of the calibration curve at 710 K.

As Figure 47 indicates, the second calibration after the measurement was successful. An example of
the analysed decay curves can be seen in Figure 48. The peak signal is still high, 1.4 V, but as that also
was the case in the measurements, it is recommended to recreate the signal levels as close to the
measurements as possible. The evaluation window chosen for the measurements were between 0.7
and 0.15 of maximum signal strength. As seen in Figure 48, the fitted line matches the decay curve
quite well which can be seen from the root mean square deviation (NRMSD fit) and comparison to the
average value.

Measurements

This section will discuss and present the measurements done at the spray combustion chamber.
Despite thorough preparations with CAD models, measurement set-up schemes’ initial calibration
measurements etc., the practical world always tends to surprise. The first part will focus on
preparation and alignment, while the second part mainly will present the measurements by the
instrumented plate. Presentation of measurement points, chamber conditions, results and
assessment will be discussed in detail in chapters 4 and 5. This section is merely giving an
understanding of how the measurements and visualizations have been achieved.

3.4.1 Preparation, Alignment & Initial testing
As previously discussed, in section 3.2.1, it was decided to align the measurement systems, in
particular, the plate and impingement point of the spray, before attaching an instrumented plate.
Another motivation for this was also previous experience with the heat transfer sensor, being quite
fragile to the rather harsh conditions in the spray chamber. To achieve as good results as possible with
the instrumented plate, the painted plate was installed in the chamber for initial measurements. A
special flat plate, with no drillings for any sensors, had been prepared with a thin layer of white paint.
The set-up can be seen in Figure 49 when mounted in the chamber.

60

Figure 49 Painted plate set-up, mounted in the optical spray combustion chamber together with a standard
W31 diesel injector

For the painted plate or alignment set-up it was decided to utilize two high-speed cameras to visualize
the combustion event by natural chemiluminescence. The visual data provided by the cameras can be
used to look at the flame impingement on the plate. The colour camera was placed to visualize a
section view of the flame, while the monochromic camera was mounted to visualize the plate. I.e.
according to the CAD model shown in Figure 38. The cameras were both triggered by the TTL manager
built in the chamber automation. However, this was quite challenging as the colour camera, with an
extremely sensitive trigger, often were accidentally triggered by disturbances induced from the
operation of, e.g. solenoid valves on the spray chamber. Therefore, the trigger signal had to be filtered
to avoid disturbances setting of the trigger. A short-term solution was to use an oscilloscope to modify
the trigger signal sent to the colour camera. Later the oscilloscope was replaced by an output function
of the monochromic camera, allowing both cameras to start recording simultaneously.
The start point of the cameras was synchronized with the electrical signal sent to the fuel injector. An
important note is that the framerate of the cameras was not synchronized, which allows the cameras
to be used utilized with different frame rate settings. This is useful when the cameras are focused on
different positions, using different resolutions. In the present tests, the colour camera was initially set
to record with 40 kfps, while the monochromic camera was kept at 25 kfps. Additionally, the
pyrometer and spectrometer were included in the measurement set-up to provide data on the flame
temperature profile and emitted wavelengths. Both spectrometer and pyrometer were positioned on
the opposite side of the chamber, compared to the high-speed cameras. Both spectrometer and
pyrometer were connected to the TTL-trigger manager and synchronized with the signal starting
injection. The pyrometer was set to be triggered simultaneously as the injection signal was given, while
the spectrometer was offset to start after 2250 µs. The spectrometer was included in the alignment
measurements, as the influence of a burning diesel spray might interfere with the laser-induced
phosphorescence signal, which was previously discussed in 2.3.6.
Before starting the measurement, the day tank on the chamber was filled with light fuel oil, and the
fuel system, including the fuel injector, was drained from the air. As the systems were mechanically
ready for the measurement, the current profile to the injector and parameters for the measurement

61

point still had to be updated to the software before the set-up was ready to be used. Several
interesting test points at various load cases were chosen from test results produced by one of the
single-cylinder engines located at Vaskiluoto engine laboratory (Cafari, 2019). The initial target was to
conduct the measurements at 100% load, which would generate the highest thermal load case on the
in-cylinder components. However, as the intended case will not be to replicate the engine conditions
as good as possible, but when aiming to create as good a modelling case as possible, a high load case
is not necessarily the best choice. Additionally, initial testing with the heat transfer sensor suggested
that it would not survive for many combustion cycles at high pressures in the chamber (Nyberg, 2022).
For these reasons, a 59% equivalent load case was chosen for the measurements. The initial
measurements with a painted plate can also be a test run of the chamber systems, as this were the
first advanced measurement campaign performed with the chamber. Running the chamber for the
first time brought challenges finding suitable gas-mixture for the pre-combustion event, synchronizing
the measurement techniques by the TTL-trigger manager etc. The measurement set-up used in the
initial measurements can be viewed from Figure 50. Results from the alignment tests will be
presented in chapter 4.1 and discussed in chapter 5.1.

cameras, seen to left, a spectrometer and a pyrometer, seen to the right

3.4.2 Phosphor coated plate & HT measurements
By utilizing the knowledge from the literature chapter, combined with experience from the initial
calibration and measurements on the alignment plate discussed in section 5.1, the instrumented plate
was installed. The most significant change with the instrumented plate was the installation of the heat
transfer sensors, which were quite challenging as there were many cables to attach to the plate. At
this stage, it was also time to coat the phosphor on top of the measurement plate. As the initial
calibrations suggested, in section 3.3.1, that it would be hard to resolve ZnS:Ag at higher
temperatures, it was also decided to coat BAM on the plate. According to calibration curves in the
literature, BAM and ZnS:Ag would complement each other as they are sensitive to different
temperature regions. Additionally, the initial temperature estimate might be in the lower end as the
flame is aimed directly towards the plate, which would not be the case in an engine. Despite the
disadvantage of BAM used over 770 K, as previously mentioned in section 2.3.7, it is still a good option
for high-temperature application due to its short decay times and sensitivity. Discussions with Feuk
suggested that temperatures close to 1000 K could be feasible for BAM without notable interference
from the hysteresis. Furthermore, the use of an Optical Spray Combustion Chamber will reduce the

62

exposure time at very high temperatures.
Figure 51 shows the process of coating the instrumented plate with phosphors. After the
instrumentation of heat transfer sensors, the plate was cleaned with acetone prior to phosphor
coating. The phosphors were blended with the binder in a mass ratio of 1:20. To get a low viscous
blend to coat on the surface, with the help of an airbrush, the solution was diluted by acetone. Making
the phosphor blend and coating it on the surface was much following the procedure described by
(Knappe, 2013). The middle part in Figure 51 shows the plate after coating of BAM. Here, the Teflon
tape used to restrict the coating area is shown. The last picture in Figure 51 shows the plate when
ready. Both the coated phosphors were coated at the same distance from the centre of the plate. As
the flame pattern from the alignment measurements showed an asymmetric pattern, it is reasonable
to assume that the temperature would be similar at the same distance from the flame impingement
point. The initial estimate would be that the temperatures would be at the higher end of what is
expected. Therefore, the first measurement point is taken on top of the heat transfer sensor seen on
the BAM coated side of the plate.

Figure 51 Coating process of the instrumented plate. Two phosphors were chosen for the coating, ZnS:Ag and
BAM

The optical set-up used to achieve the measurements were the same as the ones used in the
calibration. The laser set-up can be seen to the left in Figure 52. The laser beam is pointed at the
phosphor-coated area with the help of the beam steering device with mirrors. The middle part
of Figure 52 represents the detector rack when mounted close to the Spray Combustion Chamber. For
the measurements on the Chamber, a second bandpass filter was added to increase the optical density
at unwanted wavelengths. The transmission and optical density of the filter set mounted in the
measurement are described by combination 2 in Figure 52. The last part of Figure 52 shows the setup after alignment. The blue colour seen in the picture is the phosphorescence signal at 450 nm from
BAM.

63

Figure 52 Optical set-up including excitation source, detector rack and assembly on the Spray Combustion
Chamber

Earlier, in section 3.2.2, the measurement set-up was discussed, and a conceptual CAD model, Figure
38, of the set-up was introduced. Figure 53 shows the measurement set-up used in the tests. Here,
the highspeed cameras were still located to the left of the Chamber while the pyrometer and
spectrometer were kept to the right of the Chamber. The measurement point of the pyrometer was
changed from close to the plate situation, up-streams, closer to the nozzle. Indifference to the
alignment measurements, the measurement set-up included the systems needed for measurements
with thermographic phosphors, as shown earlier. The laser was positioned a few meters away from
the Chamber to enable window cleaning and mechanical work to be done on the Chamber in between
the tests.

Figure 53 Final measurement set-up

64

Except for some minor adjustments and adding the instrumented plate to the measurement set-up,
the most significant change was the implementation of the TTL-trigger manager. The injection signal
was considered as a master signal, to which all other signals were synchronized or offset. The TTLtrigger manager allows up to 10 signals to be individually programmed with an offset to the master
signal and a duration. To be able to synchronize the events during the measurements, there is a need
to know the response characteristics of each piece of equipment used, especially the ones dependent
on each other. Figure 54 shows the characteristics of the most challenging instrument to synchronize,
the laser. According to this, the external trigger pulse must rise at a specific time before the laser pulse
is achieved. Additionally, the delay between external trigger pulse and laser pulse changes dependent
on the pulse energy of the laser. In the present set-up, the q-switch delay was kept constant at 155
µs, resulting in pulse energy around 1.5 mJ. As the phosphorescence signal is dependent on the timing
of the laser pulse, both gate and shutter must be adjusted to the laser. A timing diagram was done to
help synchronize the events needed for measuring the decay time from the thermographic phosphors.
The timing diagram can be seen in Appendix 1.

Figure 54 Example of a timing diagram for one of the components in the optical set-up, externally triggered
laser operation (Quantel, 2014)

For the first measurements, the timing was chosen so that the laser would give a pulse at 10.420 ms
aSoE. As the peak flame temperature was identified at 9.3 ms aSoE and an opening could be seen from
the visualizations at 10 ms aSoE. Therefore, the first tested timing of the LIP measurements will be
timed at 10.4ms aSoE with LFO as fuel. Later if needed, the timing of the test point can be adjusted to
improve the measurements. Changing fuel has also been considered as an option to decrease the
background noise from the signals.

RESULTS

This part of the thesis will present results and visualizations from the conducted tests. The target is to
focus on the results. Thus, no analyses or conclusions will be drawn in this section. The results and
conditions at which the points were recorded will be presented in this chapter. To review the
assessment of the results, the reader is referred to chapter 5.

4.1

Alignment measurements

The experimental set-up and targets with the testing were previously discussed in chapter 3.4.1. For
the 59 % equivalent load case, the fuel pressure was held constant at 1399 bar, while the injection
duration was 4575 µs, and the pressure at Start of Energization (SoE) was chosen to 88 bars. In the
corresponding single-cylinder test, the engine speed was kept at 720 rpm, which correlates to a speed
of 232 µs/CAD. Generation of appropriate pressure levels was done by a pre-combustion event, as
described earlier in section 3.2.1. To achieve 88 bars of pressure at SoE, a lean gas mixture, including
hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and air were used with an air to fuel ratio of 5. The initial measurements
ended after 20 successful injection events towards the painted plate, shown in Figure 43.

0.35 µs, resolution 630x608 and a frame speed of 40 kfps. The monochromatic camera focused on the
impingement point of the plate through a 180 mm macro lens. The monochromatic camera had an
exposure of 0.3 µs, a resolution of 768x768, aperture opening of F16 and a frame speed of 25 kfps, for
the visualizations seen in Figure 55.
Average Flame Temperature measured at 850 nm

Figure 56 Flame temperature measurement by pyrometer, measurement point seen to left and measurement
results to right

As noted in the measurement description, a pyrometer was included to provide information on the
flame temperature at different positions from the plate. Figure 56 shows the measurement point of
the pyrometer in the alignment measurement set-up. The relation of flame temperature and time can
be seen to the right in Figure 56. The trigger signal was sent at time zero, which marks SoE. The
pyrometer evaluates the temperature according to three wavelengths, 850 nm, 1050 nm, and 1300
nm, where 850 nm were considered to give the most accurate reading. Therefore, an average curve
of the measurement at 850 nm curve has been produced and is shown in Figure 56. A more extensive
report presenting more results and a discussion were performed together with National Physical
Laboratories (NPL) within the Dynamic Pressure and Temperature (DynPT-project), which the
pyrometer measurements were a part of (DynPT, 2021; Sutton, et al., 2021).
A spectrometer was also included in the alignment measurements. Figure 57 shows a normalized
averaged spectrogram obtained during the combustion of the diesel spray. The spectrometer was
triggered at 2250 µs aSoE and integrated the emitted wavelengths over 12 ms. The spectrogram
indicates the wavelengths emitted by the combustion of the light fuel oil (LFO), which was used in the
initial measurements.

Instrumented measurements

As noted in the initial measurements with a painted plate, there is a risk that there will be a strong,
varying background signal on the measurements with LFO. Additionally, the timing of the
measurement point will be of importance as an opening in the flame could be seen at a later stage of
the combustion event. This section will present the parameters at the timing when the measurements
were obtained as well as results from the different methods. In contrast to the previous chapter, the
present chapter will also include comments on how the measurement set-up was adjusted according
to learnings from the ongoing measurements. The initial set-up was presented and discussed in section
3.4.2, and a detailed assessment of the results will be presented in section 5.2. As the time for the
experimental test was running low, the target was to focus on one measurement point to get as good
results as possible. The measurement point considered was the same as previously tested with the
alignment plate, i.e. a 59 % load case on a W31 sized diesel engine. Figure 59 shows the noise from
the background.

of one of the heat transfer sensors, 15 mm, to the right of the centre point. The initial measurements
with the instrumented plate were done with LFO, similarly to the alignment measurements.

Figure 60 Natural Chemiluminescence visualization of a burning n-heptane spray hitting the alignment plate

With reference to the assessment of the alignment measurements, section 5.1, it was decided to
switch fuel to n-heptane to reduce the background noise. N-heptane was previously discussed in the
literature, is a commonly used surrogate for LFO or diesel fuels in research applications. The
advantages of using a surrogate fuel are that it is homogeneous, and its properties are well known. As
n-heptane also consists of shorter carbon chains compared to standard LFO, it can be seen as a
simplification of a real engine case. However, as this thesis strives to produce calibration data for the
validation of simulations, the change of fuel has been motivated. It is good to remember, though, to
capture a few cases utilizing the same fuel as the engine as a reference. Additionally, the measurement
point was moved from 10.54 ms to 10.93 ms in order to reduce the interference of the background.
Figure 60 shows natural chemiluminescence visualization data of a combusting n-heptane spray
hitting the instrumented plate simultaneously as the laser-induced phosphorescence measurements

70

were done. In these measurements, both highspeed cameras had a frame rate of 30 kfps. Additionally,
the exposure time of the colour camera had been set to a minimum, and the aperture was adjusted
to 50 % open. As seen from Figure 60, the pictures are no longer saturated.

As the previous spectrograms, captured during the alignment measurements, showed that the burning
LFO flame emitted light already at the same wavelengths as the phosphor. There was an interest to

71

compare the emitted spectra at similar timing as the phosphor measurements, with an integration
time as short as 5 µs. The spectrometer was triggered 32 µs before the laser pulse was given, meaning
that neighter the laser pulse nor the phosphorescence signal would be visible on the spectrogram. The
emission spectra shown in Figure 62 represents an average of the obtained measurements on the
instrumented plate.

Figure 63 Measured decay curves at three different occasions

Figure 63 shows the decay time with respect to the measurement point. The measurements were
obtained on three different occasions and with two different fuels. The data points from the 19th of
October were captured at 10.54 ms aSoE with LFO as fuel. Due to problems with the self-ignition of
the pre-combustion gas mixture and technical problems with the auxiliary systems, it was not possible
to complete the set of 10 sprays as planned. The measurements point on the 20th of October were
taken at the same conditions as the previous set. Here there were some difficulties with the trigger
system at the first two events resulting in no saved data. After the third measurement point, the
measurement point located on top of one of the heat transfer sensors was ripped off the plate. For
the measurements on the 21st of October, the fuel was changed to n-heptane, and the measurement
point was moved to a later timing, at 10.93 ms aSoE, to decrease the effect of the background on the
measurements. Additionally, the measurement point was moved to the centre of the plate. Due to
technical difficulties with the auxiliary systems, there was a longer break, 40 minutes, between test
points 6 and 7.

Figure 64 Temperature correlation between measured decay times and calibration points

To estimate the temperature at 10.93 ms aSoE, the measurement points 5 to 15, excluding point 7,
were averaged from 21.10.2021. The average decay time, including the standard deviation
represented as upper and lower limits in Figure 64. The average decay time corresponds to a
temperature of 880 K while the lover limit corresponds to a temperature of 850 K. As the maximum
temperature of the oven used in the calibration restricts the maximum temperature, the calibration
curve must be extrapolated to match the upper limit with a temperature, which indicates a
temperature of 940 K. The heat transfer to the wall, at the time measurement, can be approximated
by using equation (2) and (3). As a pyrometer was included in the measurements, the readings close
to the plate at the time of measurements can be used to calculate the radiative heat transfer, using
equation (3). As mentioned in 2.1.2, equation (3) expresses the ideal case where both bodies absorb
or reflect the thermal radiation perfectly. According to Sposito, et al. (2020), the pyrometer
measurement method relies on the flame behaving as a blackbody. Based on the agreement from the
measurements at different wavelengths, It was concluded that the luminous flame in the present tests
is very close to a black body (Sutton, et al., 2021). Therefore, it was assumed that the emissivity would
be pretty close to one.
The convective heat transfer is more challenging to calculate, as the heat transfer coefficient, h, is
unknown. To get an approximate value of the total heat transfer to the wall at the time of
measurement, the approximated values from the heat transfer sensor, by Nyberg (2022), were used
to identify the shares of thermal radiation corresponding to the total heat transfer. The total heat
transfer, approximated at 10.93 ms aSoE can be viewed in Figure 65, where different sensors mounted
at different locations have a slightly different shape. As the sensitivity of the heat transfer sensors was
changed during the instrumentation, the heat transfer readings were offset and could not be used. To
approximate the heat transfer, the sensitivity was re-calculated. In Figure 65, the sensors named
GHFS1 and GHFS2 was assumed to give the most realistic temperature reading. Initially, the
measurement point was positioned on top of GHFS5, and for the measurements 21.10.2021, the focus
point was moved to the centre of the plate, which would correspond to the curve by GHFS3. However,

73

even though the decay times were similar, as seen in Figure 63, GHSF3 is slightly offset compared to
GHSF5. Using GHSF3 as a reference for approximation of the heat transfer results in unrealistically high
peak temperatures. The radiative heat transfer from equation (3) was estimated to be 0.6 MWm -2. If
the radiative share is set to 15 %, the total heat transfer is 3.8 MWm-2, which would be the same as
indicated by sensor GHFS5 in Figure 65 at 10.93 ms aSoE. With the total heat transfer and radiative
share known, the connective share can be calculated and thus the heat transfer coefficient, h,
estimated. The heat transfer coefficient, h, would then be around 3500 Wm-2 K-1. A more detailed
assessment of the results can be red from section 5.2. For a more detailed discussion about the heat
transfer sensor, the reader is referred to the report by Nyberg (2022).

ASSESSMENT OF RESULTS

This part of the thesis assesses the results and discusses how the findings with the alignment plate
were implemented in the measurements with the instrumented plate.

5.1

Alignment measurements

Initially, the alignment measurement was considered, in section 3.3.1, to ensure that the reacting
spray would hit the centre of the instrumented plate and the centre of the heat transfer sensor.
Additionally, there was a need to better understand the challenging conditions during the spray
combustion event, in order to be able to choose phosphor and measurement points. The
measurement set-up included a variety of measurement techniques.
The high-speed cameras, focusing either on the side-view (colour camera), or at the impingement
point (monochromatic camera), visualize the spray combustion event. From the visualizations, it is
clear that the spray has ignited earlier than 3 ms aSoE. The point of ignition appears to be located
slightly downstream, but quite close to the nozzle. As the ignition has occurred, any fuel found
downstream of the spray ignites rapidly. The start of combustion (SoC), matches the corresponding
engine case quite well, when compared to the report by Cafari (2019). As the combustion event
produces a lot of light, the exposure time of the camera was adjusted to a minimum. Furthermore,
the aperture was set to the middle position. Thereafter, the full dynamic range of the camera could
be used for the visualizations. However, the initial tests were conducted with exposure times close to
minimum and a full opening of the aperture. The results indicated that the pictures were partly
saturated due to overexposure, as seen in Figure 55. While adjusting the exposure time, it was noticed
that the first sign of ignition changed and occurred later and later. It was believed that this was caused
by the adjustment of the exposure time rather than an actual feature of the fuel spray combustion.
This would also indicate that a precise point of ignition cannot be determined through these
measurements. Furthermore, it is good to keep in mind that the SoC is determined by the help of the
heat release curve in an engine while the frame speed combined with visual data yields the ignition
point in the present test. These methods are different, suggesting that they should not be compared
on a one-to-one basis.
In general, the natural chemiluminescence visualizations in colour verify the characteristics of a
quiescent burning diesel flame, previously described in section 2.1.1. As the injection ends, the flame
front travels towards the nozzle as the remaining fuel heats up, evaporates and ignites. The flame
hitting the plate forms a mushroom-shaped cloud bouncing back towards the injector. Despite end of
injection, the chemical reaction continues roughly 6 ms. From Figure 55 it seems that the plate is not
big enough as a part of the mushroom cloud gets stacked at the bottom of the plate. This might cause
locally higher temperatures. However, as the same case will be simulated by CFD, this was not
regarded as a major problem. Close to the thimble, or nozzle, there are also some chemical reactions
taking place. These could either be some bigger droplets remaining after the needle closing or some
leakages from the 9 sprays captured by the thimble. However, as the focus is on the events close to
the plate, any disturbances near the end of combustion will not affect the temperature
measurements.
The monochromic camera has been used to visualize combustion earlier e.g. in Figure 34, and was,
therefore, easier to tune with respect to shutter speed and aperture opening. The visualizations from

75

the monochromic camera provided detailed information about the events when the flame hits the
plate. The earlier mentioned mushroom-shaped flame in fact forms a flame resembling a shape of a
donut as the combustion event proceeds. The characteristics of the donut-shaped flame can be
described as a toroidal vortex rotating around an imaginary axis. The distance to the impingement
point, i.e. the radius of the toroidal vortex flame, is increasing by time. As the flame is very intense and
produces a lot of soot, it was speculated that it might be hard to obtain a good phosphorescence
signal. Effects of soot luminosity, laser extinction and signal trapping, described in section 2.3.6, might
be dominating. As the flame forms a growing toroidal vortex, a hole is formed close to the
impingement points. The opening might be a way to improve the measurement signal from the
thermographic phosphors if the timing of 10 ms aSoE, or later, is a suitable measurement point with
respect to the surface temperature.
The pyrometer, with a measurement point close to the centre of the plate as seen in Figure 56, shows
a rapid temperature increase at 4 ms aSoE. As the measurement point is quite close to the plate, the
pyrometer measurements maybe not be suitable when trying to determine the SoC accurately.
However, the pyrometer can provide a rough estimation of the combustion duration when combined
with the high-speed visualizations. In Figure 56, the combustion event occurred between 4 ms aSoE
and 13 ms aSoE. From the high-speed visualizations, it is known that ignition occurs slightly earlier.
These discussions yield that the duration of the combustion would be around 11 ms, which was
suggested by Heywood (2018), as discussed in section 2.1.1. As the pyrometer measures the
temperature on the surface of the flame, it will not be able to detect the toroidal vortex taking shape.
Additionally, from the shape of the curve, it can be noted that a peak temperature of 2150 K occurs at
9.3 ms aSoE. In the literature, the peak temperature varies between 2000 K and 2700 K depending on
the reference. In other words, the flame temperature measurement indicates a reasonable
temperature.
The spectrogram presented in Figure 57 indicates that the LFO combustion spectra starts already
below 400 nm. This is an interesting contrast to the n-heptane spectra starting around 480nm, as
previously presented in figure 3. This might become a problem in the measurements with
thermographic phosphors, as the phosphor was chosen with a specific wavelength shorter than the
spectra emitted by the combustion. As the integration time from the spectrometer was kept at 12
ms, starting about 2.25 ms aSoE, it captures the entire combustion. A measurement considering a
considerably shorter time step, in the order of microseconds, would be an interesting comparison to
the present measurements. Ideally, the measurements could be synchronized to the measurements
with thermographic phosphors to provide information relevant to the spectral background during the
measurements. Another option is to change fuel to n-heptane if the background becomes a problem.
Additionally, the LFO used in the initial tests caused heavy window fouling, which needed cleaning
every 20th combustion.
So far, the results discussed in this section have mainly concerned extra measurements that were
considered to provide useful information about the conditions in the chamber at point of injection.
The main target with the alignment measurements, however, was to verify the alignment of the
measurement plate and by this to increase the probability of getting the instrumented plate correctly
centred. The spray pattern shown in Figure 57 appears to be very symmetric and hitting the centre of
the plate. Additionally, the spray pattern and visual material from the high-speed cameras indicated
that the thimble, only allowing one spray to enter the chamber, works as intended and does not steer
the spray in any direction. However, a leakage was noticed after the combustion had ended. The fuel
captured inside the thimble is pressed out through the nozzle holes heading towards the plate and

76

through crevices behind the thimble. The fuel entering self-ignites and combusts inside the chamber.
This is not interfering with the measurements, but it is an unwanted feature and causes the window
to foul much faster. This could maybe be avoided by an earlier opening of the exhaust valve,
evacuating the hot gases.
The key takeaways from this section, summarized in a list.
• Combustion duration and process were as expected
• Pyrometer indicates a maximum temperature of 2150 K at 9.3 ms aSoE
• The combustion visualizations indicate an opening in the toroidal flame structure close to
the impingement point at 10 ms aSoE
• The soot marks on the alignment plate indicate that the spray is hitting in the centre of the
plate

5.2

Instrumented measurements

The instrumented plate was installed according to the same markings as the alignment plate, ensuring
that the spray impingement point would be on top of the heat transfer sensor located in the centrum
of the plate. Learnings from the previous alignment measurements yielded that the measurement
point should be timed at 10 – 11 ms aSoE. As the pyrometer was measuring the flame temperature, it
is still unknown at what timing the maximum temperature of the plate surface occurs. Furthermore,
it was unknown how the background noise would affect the measurement and what temperature
could be expected. Therefore, two phosphors were initially coated on top of the plate. This section
focuses on reviewing the measurement results in section 4.2.
The first measurement point with thermographic phosphors was taken on top of one of the heat
transfer sensors, using BAM as a phosphor. As seen from Figure 59, there was a clear difference on
the background noise form shot to shot. To find out the reason for the varying background, the
measurements were compared to the high-speed visualizations of the plate. From the visualizations,
it can be concluded that the varying background noise is caused by shot-to-shot variations of the
flame. This has been indicated in Figure 59, by including pictures at the time of phosphor
measurement. As the spectrogram in the alignment results indicated a broad spectrum interfering
with the wavelength emitted by the phosphor, it was decided to change fuel to n-heptane.
Visualizations of the combustion process in Figure 60, using n-heptane, indicate a similar behaviour as
the case with LFO, previously discussed in section 5.1. As the exposure time and aperture were
adjusted to enable use of the full dynamic range, the visualizations with n-heptane give a better view
of the reacting spray. As the aperture and exposure were decreased, it also harder to compare the
timing and point of ignition. Switching fuel to n-heptane also improved the situation with window
fouling. As noted from Figure 61, the cases with LFO caused the windows to rapidly foul, while the
case with n-heptane did not affect the windows nearly as much. As discussed in the literature (section
2.3.6) it is likely that the phosphor signal will be weaker due to signal trapping and extinction. As
Binder, et al. (2020) showed, signal trapping and laser extinction are likely to result in a shorter decay
time and thus suggest a higher temperature than reality. However, when the phosphor is used in its
sensitive region, the error introduced from signal trapping and laser extinction will be reduced. Except
for a temperature overestimation, the precision suffers from this phenomenon, leading to an
increased standard deviation of the measurement points. As the impact of signal trapping and laser
extinction is heavily depending on the detector, detector settings and phosphor used, the magnitude
of the errors introduced cannot be estimated on a general level.

77

Except for improved measurement quality with respect to accuracy and precision for the
thermographic phosphors, n-heptane or similar surrogate fuels can also be motivated to be used from
a simulation point of view. The advantage of utilizing a well-known fuel as surrogate is the reduced
complexity, of the fuel composition to be considered in the simulations. Additionally, the very broad
emission spectra from the luminous flame, previously shown in Figure 57, were an indication that the
emitted light from the combustion will interfere with the phosphorescence signal. Therefore, the
spectrometer was also included in the measurements with the instrumented plate. Interestingly, the
spectrum changes from the measurements on the alignment plate to an emission spectrum more
resembling the n-heptane emission spectrum, shown in Figure 3, when the trigger timing and
integration time were done at 30 µs prior to the LIP measurement. It provides more relevant
information about the conditions during the LIP measurements.
In both measurements with LFO and n-heptane on the instrumented plate, there is a distinct emission
peak at 590 nm. According to Gaydon (1974), the emission peak for sodium is close to the peak seen
in the spectrograms. The reason for the distinct emission peak remains unknown, but there were
speculations that adhesives or any sealings used on the instrumented plate might contain sodium.
Another possibility is that the fused silica windows could have some impurities resulting in
fluorescence at 590 nm. However, this is not likely. According to the fuel analysis of the used fuels,
the sodium content is below 1 mg/kg (Veritas Petroleum Services BV, 2020). Interestingly, the distinct
peak was found both with LFO and n-heptane during the measurements on the instrumented plate.
The peak was even stronger represented on the spectrogram from the n-heptane measurements.
However, it was speculated that the intensity from the LFO measurements was reduced for every shot,
due to heavily window fouling.
The measured decay time in the measurements can be seen in Figure 63 where they are plotted
against the combustion cycle number. The measurement points from 19th and 21st of October indicate
that the surface temperature is gradually increased as the number of combustion cycles increases.
After some four injected fuel sprays, the decay time stabilises around 100 ns. As the plate has the
same temperature as the pre-heated chamber body, around 373 K, it would be reasonable to believe
that the plate is gradually getting warmer as the number of combustion cycles are increasing. The time
between each test point was around 4 minutes, with the exception of test point number 7 on the 21st
of October, where a technical problem with the auxiliary systems caused a longer break. This would
allow the plate to cool down and therefore again indicate a longer decay time.
The indicated temperature of 880 K, in Figure 64, based on the average obtained in the measurements
performed 21.10.2021, are within the estimated range, presented in section 3.1.1. Even though the
measured temperature is within the limit, it might be worth noticing that they are at the higher end.
This might be explained by the fact that the measurement approach changed from an approach with
similarities to the engine in focus, to a simulation-oriented measurement. Therefore, it seems logical
that the wall temperature would be higher than expected, as the injection is aimed towards a plate.
As the measurement point was taken towards the end of injection, it is not clear when the wall
temperature reaches its maximum and how hot the max temp would be. However, as there were
some issues with the sensitivity scaling on the measurements with the heat transfer sensor, there was
a need to correct the scaling. The wall temperature measured by the thermographic phosphors was
utilized to re-scale the heat transfer readings. By assuming that the wall temperature follows the same
profile as the heat transfer, the maximum temperature would be around 950 K. The upper limit and
lower limit in Figure 64 suggested that the precision was relatively poor in the measurements. The

78

reason for this might be partly explained by the varying temperature of the plate. Except for variation
of the plate temperatures, it was previously noted that the signal levels of the thermographic
phosphors were quite high, resulting in a poor precision of the measurements. Also, the effect of the
varying background causing signal trapping and extinction might increase the standard deviation of
the measurements.
The heat transfer was also evaluated at the measurement point, based on the radiative and convective
heat transfer modes. It was assumed that the gas temperature is close to the one measured by the
pyrometer. The radiative mode is believed to be quite accurate, while the heat transfer coefficient
used for the convective mode is more challenging. In the end, the total heat transfer was calculated
by the help of the approximated heat transfer, measured by the heat transfer sensor. Instead of
comparing the heat transfer at the measurement, the heat transfer coefficient from the calculations
should be questioned. As mentioned in the literature, section 2.1.2, there has been a lot of efforts
done to find a model to predict the heat transfer and the heat transfer coefficient. One of the most
used models in engine applications is Woschni’s model. However, as the present work is a clear step
away from an engine case, the motivation to use the model and the accuracy of it should be
questioned. To calculate the heat transfer coefficient, knowledge about the heat transfer mechanisms
in the boundary layer near the wall needs to be evaluated. The Nusselt number, Reynold number and
Prandtl number are factors used to describe these mechanisms. Factors as piston speed, cylinder bore
in-cylinder flow velocities is not possible to translate to the present set-up. However, some
assumptions must be made to evaluate the heat transfer based on the measured temperatures.
A similar work has recently been done and reported by Mahmud, et al. (2020) and Mahmud, et al.
(2021). To identify the heat transfer coefficient, Mahmud, et al. (2020) discussed several options and
noted the challenge of describing characteristic length and in-cylinder flow velocities. However, these
factors were replaced by using flame velocity and distance between nozzle and wall. Earlier studies by
Kuboyama, et al. (2017) evaluated the heat transfer in a Rapid Compression Machine. In these studies,
similar challenges were discussed. From this discussion, it becomes evident that a more extensive
investigation of the mechanisms involving flow velocities are needed to accurately determine the heat
transfer coefficient. However, the results discussed by Mahmud, et al. (2020) suggest a heat transfer
below 10 MWm-2, which is aligned with the measurements performed in this thesis. Furthermore, the
estimated heat transfer coefficient, h, follows the heat transfer function and indicates a value below
5000 Wm-2 K-1 depending on test point and timing. In general, it was noted that a small hole combined
with a higher fuel pressure increases the maximum heat transfer while lower pressures combined with
larger orifice sizes result in a lower peak and a more evenly distributed heat transfer curve. Compared
to the results of Mahmud, et al. (2020), the outcome of the present work seems reasonable, both in
terms of temperatures, heat transfer and heat transfer coefficient. The assumption, suggesting a
radiative share of 15 %, is also reasonable when considering the test conditions with a luminous sooty
flame.
Kuboyama, et al. (2017) did a heat transfer study in an RCM. Their investigation is more engine relevant
and thus a step away from the work done in present work. However, the results yielded a higher heat
transfer, above 10 MW. Also, the heat transfer coefficient follows the same trend. Similarly to the
literature references discussed in the previous paragraph, a modified Woschni model was used to
obtain the results. Contrary to present work, the measurements in the RCM included multiple sprays,
instead of a single spray. The literature references have so far only considered standard models or
modified standard models to determine the heat transfer from a burning fuel spray to the wall. These
models have been developed and tuned for an internal combustion engine. As the present set-up

79

resembles the work by Virk (2015), it might be beneficial to consider the use of a similar approach. It
is maybe good to underline that measurements done by Virk (2015) have a much greater distance
compared with much lower gas velocities. Therefore, the heat transfer should not be compared to a
case with an injected fuel spray. The performed measurements will be used for validating and
calibrating CFD conjugate heat transfer models. From this work it will be possible to estimate the
different modes of heat transfer in a better way, the total heat transfer coefficient and the conditions
present in the spray chamber.
The key takeaways from this section, summarized in a list.
• Significant variations on the background from spray to spray were noted
• Measurement plate gets gradually heated up until it reaches thermal equilibrium
• Too strong phosphorescence signal strengths cause non linearities in the detector
• Temperature measurement resulted in a temperature between 850 K and 935 K, with an
average of 880 K
• Heat transfer were approximated to 3.8 MWm-2 at the measurement point
• Accuracy and precision can be improved based on the results in this thesis

DISCUSSION

The purpose of this thesis was to provide validation data for conjugate heat transfer CFD models,
predicting the thermal loading in a W31 sized internal combustion engine operating on diesel. The
measurements presented in this thesis include the use of thermographic phosphors, which is laser
based optical method suitable for measuring surface temperatures at a specific time in the harsh
conditions typically found inside the cylinder of an internal combustion engine. The temperature
measurement method is rather complex, and the operator must have appropriate knowledge about
both the temperature measurement method and the in-cylinder conditions. The author of this thesis
did not have any previous knowledge of either thermographic phosphors nor in-cylinder conditions.
The work in this thesis can be seen as an attempt to industrialize and implement relevant research
within the field to extract valuable data that can be utilized to improve and understand the heat
transfer inside an engine. The initial plan was to mimic the conditions inside an engine, as close as
possible, in an optical spray combustion chamber. The advantages of using an optical spray
combustion chamber for this purpose are the extensive control of the conditions inside the chamber,
optical accessibility, and the possibility to isolate the combustion process from any disturbances. As
the project went along, it became evident that it made sense to try to simplify the geometry as much
as possible to ensure that the level of complexity for a simulation would be as small as possible. This
is, of course, a big step away from an actual engine situation, but if the simplest possible case is not
matching the simulations, then a more complex one would not be better either. As the simulations
and models improve, added complexity can be implemented to gradually improve the models until
they match a realistic engine situation. Additionally, it is advised also to review the evaporation and
combustion models of fuel sprays, which in future can be studied experimentally in the spray chamber,
in order to improve the CFD models further.
The thesis started by reviewing relevant literature, designing components needed for the
measurements and building up the measurement set-up with needed equipment to carry out the
measurements. The initial calibration of the phosphors in the oven was the first hands-on experience
with the method. As the spray combustion chamber was built and commissioned simultaneously as
the measurement for this project was conducted, there were challenges with some parts of the
systems to get everything running and synchronized as intended. As the optical capabilities of the
chamber are excellent, there was a possibility to install other optical equipment such as multiple highspeed cameras and a spectrometer to provide additional information about the events in the chamber
during combustion. Later, it turned out to be very useful to have extra equipment to understand the
chamber's events better. Another instrument that became very handy was the pyrometer, by which it
is possible to measure the temperature of a luminous sooty flame, such as a diesel flame. The
pyrometer was included in a project called dynPT, to develop dynamic pressure and temperature
methods. The pyrometer was tested on the chamber together with the present thesis work.
As previously mentioned, there was a need to verify the alignment on the plate, and this was done by
inserting an empty, painted plate. After that, some measurements were done with the entire set-up,
excluding the LIP and HT measurements. The alignment measurements were the first experiences with
the challenging measurement conditions and the first campaign with reacting sprays in the newly built
Optical Spray Combustion Chamber at Wärtsilä. Therefore, the measurement was an essential
confirmation of the alignment and an opportunity to familiarize with the intended test points. The
outcome of the alignment sprays governed the choice of timing for the LIP test point, the position of
the test point and the choice of phosphor.

The instrumented plate was challenging to mount in the chamber, as much cabling was included. The
target was also to have a thermocouple mounted in the plate to tell the plate's temperature. However,
it was impossible to install the thermocouple after instrumenting the plate with the heat transfer
sensors with the present way of working. From the measurement results, it became evident that the
thermocouple inside the plate would have been helpful, as the plate's temperature was gradually
increasing until it reached thermal equilibrium. Some references have evaluated a similar case with a
spray hitting orthogonally towards a wall. Mahmud, et al. (2021) used a plate cooled with oil, which
would be one option to improve further the measurement set-up used in this thesis. The results from
the instrumented measurement resulted in a wall temperature and an estimation of the heat transfer.
However, the precision of the LIP measurements was relatively poor due to the high signal strength of
the measurement signal and possibly also signal trapping and extinction. To improve the precision of
the LIP measurement, the peak signal should be decreased to some 200 mV. This can be done relatively
easy by moving the detector rack further away from the chamber. The reason for the imprecise
measurements is the space charge effects and saturation caused by the bombardment of photons
onto the photocathode of the PMT. A reduced signal strength would also enable an increased
resolution in the oscilloscope. This would benefit the measurements of decay curves at short decay
times. As the calibration of the phosphors is one of the keys to getting precise results, a calibration
using the test component could be performed both before and after the measurements to verify that
the behaviour of the phosphor remains unchanged. Binder, et al. (2020) discussed the calibration
procedure suggesting multiple calibrations. In the present measurements, it was also noticed that the
temperatures were higher than the capabilities in the oven used for calibration.
Another essential part of the measurements utilizing thermographic phosphors is the post-processing
and analyses of the decay curves produced by the oscilloscope. Post processing of raw data requires
a consequent manner. All measurements and calibrations should be analyzed using the same method
and fitting window. These have been excluded from this thesis due to the extensive thesis work
already included. All results presented in this thesis have been analyzed by a MATLAB script provided
by Lund University. For the future implementation of thermographic phosphor measurements, it
would be suggested to further familiarise with the analysis.
As these measurements were the first experience with the LIP technique simultaneously taking the
chamber into use, there were multiple challenges with respect to triggering, timing, and operation of
the chamber. One interesting feature was the early ignition of the gas mixture fed into the chamber,
intended for the pre-combustion event. As the filling of the gases went along, it ignited on several
occasions when the laser continuously was pulsing. It was found that the laser pulse had enough
energy to ignite the gas mixture during the filling process. Most likely, there were some locally
favourable conditions during the gas filling passing the laser beam. It was also noted that the mixture
was no longer ignited by the laser as the filling process had been completed. Other similar examples
of learnings occurred every now and then during the measurement campaign. Therefore, it would be
good to repeat the tests with more test points and repetitions as the chamber operation in the hot
stage with the chamber has been developed and can be controlled in a more precise and repeatable
manner. As the measurement campaign was completed, the automation system controlling the
chamber was modified and improved.
To further improve the understanding of the heat transfer from a reacting fuel spray and provide
accurate validation data for the CFD modelling, there is a need to continue this project with a repeated
measurement campaign. The present work can be seen as an indication of the conditions inside the
chamber with a reactive spray present. As discussed in the previous section, the evaluation of the heat

82

transfer coefficient is challenging, especially as most of the literature is considering actual engine
conditions. Even though the focus in the literature has been to modify present models, it could be
worth considering other models not related to an internal combustion engine. However, when
comparing the results obtained in this thesis, it seems to agree with some examples of similar cases
found in the literature. To further improve heat transfer calculations and estimations of the heat
transfer coefficient, the experimental set-up should include a measurement of flame velocity at the
point of measurement.
As the conducted measurement should be used as validations data for CFD models, it could be
discussed to what extent it is motivated to calculate different dimensions, for example, heat transfer
and heat transfer coefficients. As the calculations often assume a mathematical model describing a
phenomenon, it could introduce an error in the calculated dimension. Instead, one could argue that
the measured raw data should be processed as little as possible and directly compared to the
simulations. As the measurement method, as well as the measurement conditions presented in this
thesis, are unknown for the operator, the results cannot be thrusted until they have been verified by
some rough calculations. Therefore, the reasoning about the heat transfer and the heat transfer
coefficient presented in this thesis can be seen as a way to indicate the validity of the results. In this
case, it seems that the obtained temperature is in the correct range.
In addition to the previously discussed improvements, it would be beneficial to confirm the
evaporation of the spray at non-reactive conditions. As the simplified noncomplex geometries have
been tested and simulated, a more complex geometry could be added, and temperature
measurement between the sprays could be a way forward. Different campaigns and simulations could
be repeated multiple times with increased complexity. Ultimately, the iterative nature of improving
simulations by experimental data could result in an engine with optical access to the combustion
chamber.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

In this thesis, a literature study of thermographic phosphors in applications on internal combustion
engines was conducted. The purpose of the thesis was to evaluate the heat transfer from a burning
diesel flame to the surrounding components by measuring the surface temperature. The outcome of
the thesis is validation data for calibration of conjugate heat transfer models. The measurements in
the thesis were performed in an optical spray combustion chamber with engine relevant conditions.
The outcome of the measurements can be concluded as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Maximum flame temperature of 2150 K at 9.3 ms aSoE
The combustion visualizations indicate an opening in the toroidal flame structure close to
the impingement point at 10 ms aSoE
Significant variations on the background from spray to spray were noted
Measurement plate gets gradually heated up until it reaches thermal equilibrium, thus
effecting the measurements
Too strong phosphorescence signal strengths cause non linearities and reduces the
precision
Choice of phosphor and signal detection are the most important features to succeed with
measurements by thermographic phosphors
Temperature measurement resulted in an average temperature of 880 K
Heat transfer were approximated to 3.8 MWm-2 at 10.93 ms aSoE

The measurements performed in the thesis has a good improvement potential. Therefore, following
recommendations can be considered for future tests:
•
•
•

Temperature measurement of the plate is needed, even cooling could be considered
As the oven is big enough, the calibration can be done both before and after measurements
using the same components
The present work was focusing on one operation point. The measurements could be
performed on at various load cases and positions to get a better understanding of the surface
temperature and thus the heat transfer from the reacting fuel spray

SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING

Evaluering av värmeöverföring från en brinnande bränslesprej i en
optisk förbränningskammare

Enligt en rapport av IPCC (2021) har utsläpp av växthusgaser orsakat en temperaturhöjning på 1,1 K
sedan den industriella revolutionen. Klimatförändringen har med andra ord redan börjat. För att
stabilisera temperaturökningen och förhindra en icke reversibel höjning av havsytan, bör utsläppen
drastiskt minska och övergången till förnybara bränslen accelerera (IPCC, 2021). För att påskynda
övergången till en högre andel förnybar energi i kraftproduktionen och utfasningen av fossila bränslen
inom sjöfarten behövs ytterligare utveckling av förbränningsmotorn. Forskning om motorer och
utvecklandet av dessa har traditionellt skett genom testkörning av multicylindriga motorer. För att
påskynda utveckling, validering och implementering av nya tekniker har trenden varit att allt mer
använda digitala verktyg för simulering och virtuell testning. För att exakt kunna simulera förhållanden
inuti en förbränningsmotor behövs valideringsdata, för att kalibrera t.ex. CFD-modeller. Syftet med
denna avhandling är att producera valideringsdata för konjugerade värmeöverföringsmodeller som
förutsäger den termiska belastningen på motorn och dess komponenter.
Litteraturundersökningen tar avstamp i definitionen av den klassiska förbränningsprocessen för en
kompressionsantänd förbränningsmotor. Vidare diskuteras värmeöverföring och värmeledning
utgående från dess definitioner. Några generella samband presenteras med exempel från tidigare
litteratur. I litteraturundersökningen ligger fokus främst på olika sätt att mäta yttemperaturer inuti en
förbränningsmotor, eller förhållanden som liknar dem i en förbränningsmotor. Olika metoder
diskuteras först på ett allmänt plan, för att sedan övergå i en beskrivning av termografiska fosforer.
Temperaturmätning med fosfortermometri är en avancerad laserbaserad yttemperaturmätningsmetod som kan appliceras i utmanande miljöer, såsom i en förbränningsmotor. Mätmetoden går ut
på att den temperaturkänsliga fosforn appliceras i ett tunt lager på den yta som ska mätas. Genom att
belysa fosforn med en ljuskälla absorberar fosforn fotonerna, varpå den fosforescerar, dvs. emitterar
ljus under en kort stund efter att ljuskällan har släckts. En termografisk fosfor består främst av ett
värdmaterial och en aktivator. Värdmaterialet är kemiskt stabilt och består ofta någon typ av keramiskt
material. Aktivatorn är dopad i små koncentrationer i värdmaterialet och består oftast av
transitionsmetaller eller lantanider. I vissa fall kan ytterligare orenheter och joner förekomma för att
stimulera fosforns egenskaper. Genom att använda en laser som ljuskälla kan man under väldigt kort
tid exitera fosforn, varpå den återgår till grundtillståndet genom att emittera fotoner.
Det finns en mängd olika termografiska fosforer, ursprungligen utvecklade för lampindustrin eller för
olika typer av skärmar och displayer. Således varierar temperaturkänsligheten för termografiska
fosforer. De vanligaste baserar sig på antingen en förkortad livstid på emissionen från fosforn eller på
spektrala skillnader i emissionen. Båda metoderna innefattar en kalibreringsmätning, för att kunna
relatera fosforns egenskaper till en temperatur. Kalibreringsmätningarna görs vanligen i en ugn där
temperaturen är känd. För detta arbete valdes metoden som baserar på emissionens förkortade livstid
eftersom denna har visats vara bäst gällande korrekthet och precision.

85

Eftersom huvudsyftet med arbetet är att generera valideringsdata för CFD-modeller är det motiverat
att förenkla mätupställningen så långt som möjligt. Detta ger enklare simulationsförhållanden för att
först verifiera grundläggande parametrar. Därför har en platta konstruerats, mot vilken en enda sprej
kommer att träffa vinkelrätt. Vartefter simuleringarna har validerats kan sedan mera komplexa
geometrier och flera sprejer inkluderas för att göra mätningarna mera lika motor förållanden.
Mätningarna utförs i en konstant volymoptisk sprejkammare. Kammaren saknar rörliga delar och
därför skapas gasförhållanden som är relevanta för en motor i kammaren med hjälp av en
förförbränning av en gasblandning. Kammaren har utvecklats för att kunna replikera
motorförhållanden inom ett brett spann sett till tryck och temperaturnivåer. I denna mätkampanj
kommer förhållanden som är relevanta för en Wärtsilä 31-motor att tillämpas.
Mätkampajen delades upp i två delar. I den inledande delen var syftet att granska linjering av sprej
mot mätplattan samt att lära känna mätförhållandena i kammaren. I mätuställningen ingick två
höghastighetskameror, fokuserade på olika områden av sprejen, en pyrometer för mätning av
flamtemperatur och en spektrometer. Resultaten från den inledande delen indikerade att sprejen
breder ut sig symmetriskt över plattan och träffar mittpunkten av plattan, vilket var förväntat.
Visulaiseringarna från höghastighetskamerorna indikerade att den sotande flamman emitterar ett
intensivt ljus, vilket kan orsaka störande bakgrundsljus vid mätning med termografiska fosforer.
Mätningarna med pyrometer gav en max temperatur kring 2150 K och indikerade att förbränningen
räcker ca 11 ms, precis som beräknat enligt litteraturen.
Utgående från informationen från den initiella mätningen på en målad platta installerades sedan en
instrumenterad platta, där både värmeöverföringssensorer och ett tunt lager med två olika fosforer
hade applicerats. Utgående från mätningarna med pyrometern placerades mätningen med fosforerna
initiellt kring 10 ms efter signal till injektorn. Bakgrundsljuset visade sig vara väldigt starkt och
varierade från sprej till sprej. Därför ljusterades tidpunkten för mätningen till närmare 1 ms efter signal
till injektorn. Från de tidigare testerna och enligt förslag från litteraturen byttes bränslet från lätt
brännolja till n-heptan. Att använda ett surrogatbränsle som n-heptan resulterar i mindre sot vilket
gör att fönstren till den optiska sprejkammaren hålls rena.
Resultaten från mätningarna med termografiska fosforer indikerade en yttemperatur kring 880 K vid
10,93 ms efter signalen till injektorn. Utgående från mätpunkterna från testerna kunde det
konstateras att plattan gradvis värms upp och når termisk jämvikt efter ca 4 mätpunkter.
Standardavvikelsen för mätningarna ger ett intervall på ca 100 K, vilket förefaller vara rätt stort. Detta
kan till viss del förklaras av att fosforescenssignalen var väldigt stark under mätningarna, vilket kan
leda till icke lineariteter i detektorutrustningen som använts. För att i framtiden förbättra mätningarna
borde alltså fosforescenssignalen till detektorn sänkas. Dessutom kunde temperaturen i mätplattan
övervakas, eller till och med kylas. Eftersom det finns möjlighet att kalibrera mätplattan både före och
efter mätningarna kunde detta lämpligen göras.
Efter evaluering av värmeöverföringen med hjälp av generella matematiska samband, litteratur om
liknande tester samt med hjälp av värmeöverföringssensorena, kunde det konstateras att de
uppmätta temperaturerna är trovärdiga. Värmeöverföringen till plattan ligger kring 3,8 MWm-2 varav
värmestrålningen skulle bidra med ca 15 %. Värmeöverföringskoefficienten ligger då kring 3500 MWm2 -1
K . För att göra nogrannare approximationer bör man känna till reynoldstal, Nusselttal och prandtltal.
Dessa involverar dock parametrar som flamhastighet, vilket inte mättes i denna kampanj.
