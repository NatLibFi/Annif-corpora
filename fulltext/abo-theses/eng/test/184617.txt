Abstract:
The COVID-19 pandemic changed the ways of working from working in the office to
working remotely from home. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs)
play a crucial role in ensuring the possibility of working remotely. In situations where
ICTs or digital solutions are forced on people, it can create stress and anxiety on them,
which is called technostress. Remote working conditions during the COVID-19
pandemic have been an ideal environment for technostress. Previous research has found
that during the pandemic women have been more likely to suffer from technostress
when working remotely than men. This study examines the reasons behind these
phenomena and how employees can be helped to cope with technostress.
The research was conducted by using qualitative research methods by interviewing eight
female knowledge workers from Finland. The results of this study indicate that there are
a variety of reasons behind the increased likelihood of technostress in remote working
such as organizational attitudes and measures towards remote working, home
environment, and personal skills and attitudes. The research results indicate that
technostress can be mitigated by various coping mechanisms such as reactive and active
measures can be taken. The results of this study also indicate that employees need
personal support to prevent and treat technostress. Concreate and practical
recommendations are made at the end of the research to help organizations support their
employees and to help employees to manage technostress and technostress creators.

1

INTRODUCTION

Since spring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major effect on the ways of
working. Knowledge workers especially have been forced to learn new ways of working.
These new ways of working have meant, in most cases, working separately from their
coworkers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the ways to ensure social distancing
was to vacate offices and move to working from home (Gabr, Soliman, Allam, & Raouf,
2021; Oksanen, Oksa, Savela, Mantere, Savolainen, & Kaakinen, 2021, p.01; Spagnoli,
Molino, Molinaro, Giancaspro, Manuti, & Ghislieri, 2020, p.01). This form of working
is called remote working and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) or
digital solutions are a vital part of it.
Remote working and ICT solutions have had a crucial role in ensuring business continuity
in organizations (Carillo, Cachat-Rosset, Marsan, Saba, & Klarsfeld, 2020, p.69; Gashi,
Kutllovci & Zhushi, 2021, p.372). According to Oksanen et al. (2021, p.03), 60% of the
Finnish workforce shifted from working in the office to working remotely after the start
of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is the highest rate of remote workers in Europe. For
the many employees, this was the first time they had to work outside the office as well as
the first time they had to rely on digital technologies to work with their coworkers. As the
pandemic and the remote working period have lasted for two years it can be said that they
have changed the ways of working most likely permanently. Not only have they changed
the way of working, but the trend of remote working has also enhanced the crucial role
of ICT in work-life (Carillo et al., 2020, p.69). The sudden change in the working
environment and new tools in addition to stress related to the global pandemic have been
sure stressors for employees.
One of the possible side effects of increased digitalization and remote working is
technostress. In their article, Oksanen et al. (2021, p.02) define technostress as stress
caused by the use of digital tools and/or demands to use digital tools. According to recent
studies (Estrada-Muñoz, Vega-Muñoz, Castillo, Müller-Pérez, & Boada-Grau, 2021,
p.10; Gabr et al., 2021; Penado Abilleira, Rodicio-García, Ríos-de Deus, & MosqueraGonzález, 2021, p.09; Spagnoli et al., 2020, p.06) women have been more prone to suffer
1

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

from technostress during the pandemic than men. Previous studies have claimed multiple
reasons for this ranging from higher levels of anxiety, more intensive emotional distress,
more negative perceptions towards technology, infrequent use of technologies, less
confidence with using technologies, and having to multitask between work and household
work (Gabr et al., 2021; Spagnoli et al., 2020, p.04).
This thesis studies the current phenomenon of remote working and the effects it has had
on female knowledge workers. The phenomenon is studied through technostress. Remote
working will most likely continue to be a normal part of knowledge workers’ lives in the
future, whether daily or mixed in a hybrid model dividing the workweek between the
office and remote days. Therefore, it is important to understand how remote working has
affected knowledge workers and especially female knowledge workers, who, according
to the studies, are more likely to suffer from technostress than their male counterparts.
Finding out how knowledge workers (especially females) can be helped to cope with
technostress is also important.

1.1 Overall aim of the thesis and research questions
This thesis explores how forced change to daily remote working has affected knowledge
workers in Finland and whether they have been suffering from technostress. Previous
studies (Estrada-Muñoz et al., 2021, p.10; Gabr et al., 2021; Penado Abilleira et al., 2021,
p.09; Spagnoli et al., 2020, p.06) have shown that women have been more likely to suffer
from technostress than men during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this research
concentrates especially on female knowledge workers.
The overall objective of the thesis is to study the conditions and factors, which lead to
technostress in female knowledge workers in remote work. This thesis studies the reasons
researchers have previously found to increase technostress on women, compared to men,
and it aims to investigate if similar patterns can be found among Finnish female
knowledge workers who work remotely. This research hypothesizes that women suffer
from technostress more often than men when working remotely due to the household
metawork, which often falls on them to be taken care of. Metawork according to Lehtinen
(2015), means invisible household work often related to information, such as keeping an
2

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

eye on children’s hobbies or taking care that children have the right size clothing
available. This kind of invisible work, which is required in daily life, often is a woman’s
responsibility in the family, while less often required metawork, such as mortgage
discussions or house repairs, is often a man’s responsibility (Lappalainen, 2015).
Therefore, metawork increases the daily workload on women and makes them more
vulnerable to stress.
For this research, three research questions have been defined to provide answers to the
overall objective:
1.

Which conditions and factors lead to technostress in female knowledge workers
when they work remotely?

2.

How do female knowledge workers cope with technostress?

3.

Which measures do female knowledge workers take to prevent technostress?

These research questions aim to understand the conditions and reasons in remote work,
which lead to stress in female knowledge workers. An additional purpose is to define how
technostress is perceived among female knowledge workers and what kind of measures
they take to prevent the occurrence of technostress. At the end of this thesis, proposals on
what female knowledge workers can do to prevent and ease technostress, and how
managers can support them to prevent and treat technostress are included.
The research questions are answered by using qualitative research methods such as
interviews as well as a theory-guided content analysis. The data were collected by
interviewing female knowledge workers from Finland who had been working remotely
full time for at least six months during the COVID-19 pandemic from spring 2020 to
autumn 2021. The final number of the interviews was determined during the data
collection phase.

1.2 Limitations
Limitations have been made to narrow the studied group and topic. Several limitations
have been made to be able to concentrate the study on a specific group and to study their
experiences. The study was conducted in Finland.
3

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

The group studied was limited to knowledge workers. According to the Cambridge
Dictionary (2019), a knowledge worker means “an employee whose job involves
developing and using knowledge rather than producing goods or services”. The same
definition and limitation are used in this thesis to define the target group. Knowledge
workers were chosen as knowledge work contains various jobs, which can be performed
remotely. The members of this group, hence, have been most likely to work remotely
during the COVID-19 pandemic for most of the period.
Additional limitations on the target group were also made according to gender. Women
were chosen as a target group for this research. This limitation was made as previous
research had indicated that female employees suffer from technostress when working
remotely more often than men. However, the reasons behind this phenomenon had been
left superficial and additional research was needed. In this study when using the term
gender or genders these refer to traditional two genders male and female.
This thesis studies a work-related technostress. Moreover, the study’s focus is on workrelated digital solutions and tools, and the correlation between these work-related digital
tools and technostress. Hence, social media and other digital solutions used in free time
and possible technostress caused by these are not part of this study.

1.3 Structure of the thesis
This thesis is comprised of seven chapters. The first chapter introduces the reader to the
topic and the aim of this study and describes the limitations and structure of the research.
The second chapter provides the theoretical framework on technostress and remote
working by presenting the literature found on these subjects and some concepts. The third
chapter presents methods used to conduct data collection and data analysis of this
research. In the fourth chapter, the empirical framework and data collection results are
reviewed. The fifth chapter presents the analysis and the interpretations of the collected
data. The discussions are presented in the sixth chapter. The final chapter, the seventh
chapter comprises of conclusions of this study, examines the reliability, validity and
limitations of this study, and presents reflections on what should be taken into
consideration in future research.

LITERATURE REVIEW

In this chapter theories and literature related to technostress and remote working are
explored. In the technostress chapter, technostress is explained as well as its
characteristics such as the symptoms. Often used concepts such as the conceptual model
of technostress and the model of coping for technostress are explained and the most
relevant literature on technostress and gender and technostress during the COVID-19
pandemic is reviewed. In the remote working chapter, we discuss what is remote working
and present its advantages and disadvantages. In these chapters, E-Work Life Scale and
work-family borders concepts and theories are explained and reviewed. The most relevant
literature about remote working and gender, and remote working during the COVID-19
pandemic are also presented. The final chapter in this part will review the literature about
technostress in remote working.

2.1 Technostress
ICTs have undoubtedly had a major positive impact on organizations during the past
decades. These digital solutions have helped organizations to grow, cut costs, and created
whole new businesses (Tarafdar, Tu, Ragu-Nathan & Ragu-Nathan, 2007, p.302).
According to Gabr et al. (2021), ICTs have also increased productivity, creativity, and
efficiency in organizations. At the same time, ICTs have made work more obsolete,
knowledge-intense, and collaborative (Ragu-Nathan, Tarafdar, Ragu-Nathan, & Tu,
2008, p.418).
While there is no question of the positive impacts of ICTs on organizations, Tarafdar et
al. (2007, p.302) indicate that researchers have found ICTs’ impact on an individual is
not as straightforward. ICTs have had a positive impact on individuals on a job level, for
instance, it has made many tasks easier and faster to perform or deleted some laborious
tasks altogether (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.418). However, as the ICTs have changed
the organization and employees’ tasks it has also disrupted organizational culture and
environment in the organizations (Gabr et al., 2021; Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.418).
This, according to Gabr et al. (2021), has become one of the main sources of stress to

5

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

employees. It has been led to due to the continuous changes to business processes,
employees’ tasks, and roles (Gabr et al., 2021).
It should be noted that ICTs have not only invaded people’s work time but free time as
well. Individuals are more connected than ever before, they are also constantly available
through smart devices, social media, communication applications, email, the internet, etc.
Work can easily follow them to their free time and private life to follow them to their
work time. Individuals are also required to have basic ICT skills to be able to cope in
society. More and more of the basic services in society are either performed digitally or
require the use of digital solutions for individuals to have access to the services. Increased
use of ICTs has therefore changed the fundamental nature of interaction in the workplace
and private lives (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.418).
Researchers have found that as individuals have had to adjust to the use of ICTs, and have
often been forced to do so, numerous negative side effects have been detected (RaguNathan et al., 2008, p.418; Tarafdar et al., 2007, p.302). In their article, Tarafdar et al.
(2007, p.302) mention that these side effects have usually been psychological such as
anxiety, a decrease of confidence, feelings of helplessness, and stress. Stress is an
individual’s cognitive response to their experience of not being able to meet the
expectations or demands of their environment (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.419; Tarafdar
et al., 2007, p.304). It can cause a decrease in productivity, lowered job satisfaction and
involvement, a decrease in performance, and it may affect an individual’s health and
quality of life (Gabr et al., 2021; Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.419; Tarafdar et al., 2007,
p.304).
In the article by Tarafdar et al. (2007, p.302) it is defined that when ICT, the use of ICTs,
or being forced to use ICT causes stress to an individual it means they have difficulties
of adjusting or coping with ICT and is, therefore, suffering from technostress.
Technostress refers to the stress-creating effects of technologies and is a problem of
adaptation (Tarafdar et al., 2007, p.304). The term technostress was first introduced in
1984 by Graig Broad (Ayyagari, Grover, & Purvis, 2011, p.832). The root problem of
technostress is the difficulty of adapting to technology and the changing requirements of
6

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

digital surroundings. Technostress can cause both physical and psychological symptoms
(Gabr et al., 2021).
Technostress can cause a variety of outcomes for individuals and organizations. Some of
the outcomes to individuals include dissatisfaction, loss of motivation, fatigue, anxiety,
frustration, demoralization, information fatigue, ineffectiveness, overwork, and decrease
in productivity (p.51; Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.418; Tarafdar et al., 2007, p.304;
Salanova, Llorens & Cifre, 2013, p.02). Technostress can cause a variety of negative
psychological experiences. These experiences have been called by Salanova et al. (2013,
p.02) as technostrains. Technostrains can manifest in an individual when they are
interacting with ICTs as high levels of anxiety, fatigue, skepticism, or inefficacy
(Salanova et al., 2013, p.02). Especially those whose job is not ICT intense have been
found to suffer significantly more from technostrains than those who have been used to
working with the ICTs (Salanova et al., 2013, p.13).
From the organizational standpoint, technostress may result in a decrease in commitment,
job satisfaction, and employee outcomes such as productivity. Technostress has also been
shown to increased employee turnover, absenteeism, work exhaustion, role conflict and
overload, and work-family conflict in organizations. (Atanasoff & Venable, 2017, p.328;
Ayyagari et al., 2011, p.832; D’Arcy, Gupta, Tarafdar & Turel, 2014, p.110; RaguNathan et al., 2008, p.417.) These pose a managerial challenge as employee turnover and
talent loss can increase the strains caused by technostress on other employees thus
creating a vicious cycle. Ayyagari et al. (2011, p.852) suggest as human capital is both
important and expensive to the organization, therefore, it should be taken care of and
helped by reducing the technostress creators in the organizational environment. It should
be also noted that when employees experience health problems, mental or physical, it
means there is a risk of prolonged sick leaves, which can become costly to the
organization in the long run.
In their articles, both D’Arcy et al. (2014) and Tarafdar, Cooper, & Stich (2019) argue
that technostress can also be utilized as a tool to mitigate negative aspects of increased
ICT use. Technical innovations such as spam filters and electronic assistants can ease the
7

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

harms of technostress (Tarafdar et al., 2019, p.11). D’Arcy et al. (2014, p.114) wrote that
technostress can help to steer focus from unproductive IT interactions to more productive
ones and help to innovate new ways of dealing with the stressors. Tarafdar et al. (2019,
p.12) call this a techno-eustress, which means positive stress. When individual
experiences techno-eustress they view the ICTs as an existing new challenge, which they
are motivated to overcome and leads to positive outcomes (Tarafdar et al., 2019, p.12).

2.1.1

Concepts and theories in technostress research

In this part, we examine two concepts and theories used in the technostress research
conceptual model of technostress and model of coping for technostress. First, we
introduce the conceptual model of technostress, which explains factors creating and
inhibiting technostress and what it can cause in the organizations. We also introduce the
techno-stressors, which complement the conceptual model and examine more closely the
situations leading to technostress.

Second, we introduce the model of coping for

technostress, which examines different kinds of coping mechanisms, behaviors, and skills
individuals use to cope with the effects of technostress.
2.1.1.1 Conceptual model of technostress
Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.421) created their conceptual model of technostress to
understand technostress its effects, and how it can be alleviated. As presented in Figure
01., this model includes six factors technostress creators, technostress inhibitors,
individual differences, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and continuance
commitment (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.421). Technostress creators are factors, which
increase the likelihood of technostress and inhibitors are factors, which reduce the
likelihood of it. According to Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.421), technostress creators have
a negative effect on an individual’s sense of job satisfaction. Technostress inhibitors,
however, have a positive effect on job satisfaction as well as organizational commitment
and continuance commitment. Thereafter, job satisfaction has a positive effect on
organizational commitment, which in turn has a positive effect on continuance
commitment.

Figure 01. Conceptual model of technostress (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008)
2.1.1.1.1 Technostress creators
Multiple reasons exist why ICTs create stress on individuals. ICTs are complex
technologies, which tend to evolve continuously making it difficult to keep up (RagNathan et al., 2008, p.422). As pointed out by Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.422), though
technologies have made some tasks obsolete or easier to handle it has created new
problems, which require more work from employees and have increased multitasking.
Therefore, technostress creators in the organizations are ICT-related stress creators or
situations, which emerge in the individual’s working environment (Pirkkalainen, Salo,
Tarafdar & Makkonen, 2019, p.1181). In the articles by Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, pp.421422) and Tarafdar et al. (2007, pp.304 -306), they have identified five situations and
factors in organizations as technostress creators: continual connectivity, various channels
of information inputs, the pressure of keeping up with the evolving technology, the
complexity of technologies, and multitasking.
According to Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.421), continual connectivity stems from
technology allowing people to be reached anywhere at any time. This can lead to feelings
of being on call constantly and increasing the inability to separate work and private lives
9

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

(Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.421; Tarafdar et al. (2007, pp.304-305). However, it is more
complicated than that. Not only are people more available than before there are also
various channels of communication making it demanding to keep up with it all. These
various channels not only make communication more demanding but also provide various
forms of information. Individuals are exposed to enormous amounts of information from
multiply channels and trying to keep up or use it all is simply impossible (Ragu-Nathan
et al., 2008, p.421). When information is available employees are expected to keep up
with it, which can create pressure, decrease performance, increase stress and cause
information fatigue (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.421; Tarafdar et al., 2007, p.306).
While ICT is constantly evolving so are the demands for employees’ skills of using the
latest technologies. As organizations are regularly updating or changing their systems it
is, therefore, a rule not an expectation in today’s working life. This phenomenon can,
according to Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.422) and Tarafdar et al. (2007, p.305), create
pressure, anxiety, fear, and stress for employees to try to keep up with the evolving
technology. Employees’ knowledge of ICT can quickly become obsolete if not
maintained regularly, which can create uncertainty amongst the employees (Ragu-Nathan
et al., 2008, p.422). If an employee cannot keep up with the demands, it can create fear
of not meeting the organization’s expectations and being replaced by a more capable
employee. Though employees would initially be excited about new technologies, the
constant changes and the need for learning and developing skills as well as fear of not
keeping up can create frustration and stress in employees (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008,
p.422; Tarafdar et al., 2007, p.305).
ICT solutions are not anymore just for the technical department. However, this does not
mean that complexity of these technologies or the technical environments has
significantly decreased due to this shift. The variety of applications used in organizations
has increased and ICT-related terminology has become part of daily conversations.
Employees with non-technical backgrounds have had to come in custom with both
complex technical capabilities and terminology (Tarafdar et al., 2007, pp.305-306). As
the ready-made software often, does not fit the existing business processes companyspecific customizations are required (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.422). According to
10

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.422), this often leads to an even more complex technical
environment where problems occur more often. This makes employees’ work and
adjustment to ICTs even more difficult and on top of all the problems, the documentation
might not include all the customizations so the employee has to rely on technical
personnel to help with even the most minor tasks (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.422).
Employees have found the complexity of technologies intimidating and it has made them
feel unsatisfied and unable to cope with everyday tasks (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008 p.422;
Tarafdar et al., 2007, pp.305-306).
ICT solutions allow employees to multitask, meaning to work at many different tasks
simultaneously. To a certain point, multitasking can be an effective way of working and
increase the productivity of the employee (Tarafdar et al., 2007, p.306). However,
according to Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.422) and Tarafdar et al. (2007, p.306), ICT can
blur and push the limits of multitasking. When multitasking is prolonged, it can become
an inefficient way of working when an employee is unable to finish their tasks while more
tasks are constantly streaming in. Prolonged multitasking can lead to stress, exhaustion,
burnout, increased tension, loss of feeling in control, decrease job satisfaction, and
lowered productivity (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.422; Tarafdar et al. (2007, p.306).
After researching on situations and factors, which create technostress Ragu-Nathan et al.
(2008, pp.425-427) and Tarafdar et al. (2007, pp.313-315) identified five technostress
creators, which they named “techno-overload”, “techno-invasion”, “techno-complexity”,
“techno-insecurity” and “techno-uncertainty”. These have often been called technostressors in the literature (Tarafdar et al., 2019). Stressors are factors in an individual’s
environment such as events or demands, which create stress on the individual (RaguNathan et al., 2008, p.419).
Techno-overload refers to a situation where ICTs are forcing employees to work faster
and longer (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.427; Tarafdar et al., 2007, p.315). Similarities
can be found from previously described technostress creators such as “multitasking” and
“various channels of information inputs”. As technology makes it possible for an
employee to be bombarded with multiply sources of information and requests interrupting
flows and making it difficult to focus on current activities (Tarafdar, Tu, Ragu-Nathan,
11

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

& Ragu-Nathan, 2011, p.116). These flows of messages can create pressure of having to
respond to everything as it arrives, which, according to Tarafdar et al. (2011, p.116), in
return can lead to anxiety and concentration problems. According to Ragu-Nathan et al.
(2008, p.430), it is a similar situation as role overload as both describe a situation where
an employee is subject to increased demands, which create stress. Tarafdar et al. (2011,
p.117) describe that in its essence techno-overload describes the situation of too much of
everything. Techno-overload can create a situation where information is not processed
correctly or where employees do not have time to use their brains to find innovative
solutions (Tarafdar et al., 2011, p.118).
Techno-invasion describes the invasive nature of the ICTs, which allow employees to be
available at any time and place and the feelings of pressure on the employees’ side to do
so (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.427; Tarafdar et al., 2007, p.315). A similar situation was
previously described as technostress creator “the continual connectivity”. According to
the articles by Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.427) and Tarafdar et al. (2007, p.315), technoinvasion can blur the borders between work and private lives as the work can follow to
the free time. At the same time, while these technologies create stress, they can be very
addictive as well. Resulting in employees being bound to these technologies in all areas
of their lives and being left feeling stressed and frustrated (Tarafdar et al., 2011, p.116).
According to Tarafdar et al. (2011, p.117), techno-invasion is best described as always
connected newer free of technologies.
Techno-complexity is a situation where the difficulty to understand complex ICTs makes
an employee feel like they are lacking the demanded skills and forces them to spend time
and effort to meet the demands (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.427; Tarafdar et al., 2007,
p.315). Previously described technostress creator “the complexity of technologies” is
similar to this. Organizations are under continuous pressure from competitors and
vendors to have the latest software and updates (Tarafdar et al., 2011, p.117). Updates
and new versions usually mean changes and therefore employees are in a continuous
learning curve, making it difficult for them to keep ahead of the game or even at the
required standard. According to Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.430), the situation during
this techno-stressor is similar to a task complexity as both refer to a situation where it is
12

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

difficult for an employee to understand the conditions they have to work in and they are
required to spend a lot of time to catch up. Tarafdar et al. (2011, p.117) describe technocomplexity simply as difficult to keep up or to understand. According to Tarafdar et al.
(2011, p.118), techno-complexity can create a situation where the inability to understand
the complexities of the technologies blocks them from finding new ways of performing
tasks or innovating. Techno-complexity also hinders productivity when employees have
to spend most of their time trying to understand what they are doing and increases the
likelihood of mistakes(Tarafdar et al., 2011, p.118).
Techno-insecurity describes a situation where an employee feels like ICTs or another
employee with better ICT skills will replace them (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.427;
Tarafdar et al., 2007, p.315). Similarities can be found with previously defined
technostress creators “the pressure of keeping up with the evolving technology”. As
younger generations, who have grown up with technologies available, are emerging into
the workforce the situation may feel threatening to older employees. These new
employees may have more enthusiastic attitudes toward changes and have a shorter
learning curve with the new technologies, which may make older employees feel insecure
and cynical creating stress and tension in the workplace (Tarafdar et al., 2011, p.117).
Evolving technologies as well can create insecurities in the employees. As the ICTs are
constantly evolving employees may start to feel like at some point their position and their
jobs in the organization become redundant. Simply, techno-insecurity is about
technologies and the current working environment making employees uncomfortable
(Tarafdar et al., 2011, p.117).
Techno-uncertainty describes the unsettling feelings on employees due to the continuous
changes in ICTs and having to keep up with it all (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.427;
Tarafdar et al., 2007, p.315). Similarities can be found with this techno-stressor and with
the previously described technostress creator “the pressure of keeping up with the
evolving technology”. Even the most enthusiastic employees may start at some point to
feel frustrated and anxious when their skills become obsolete quickly and they feel like
what they do or learn is never enough (Tarafdar et al., 2011, p.117). According to RaguNathan et al. (2008, p.430), it is similar to role ambiguity as both refer to a situation where
13

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

an employee is uncertain of the expectations towards them, which leads to feelings of
stress. Tarafdar et al. (2011, p.117) described techno-uncertainty as changes coming too
often and technologies are too unfamiliar to employees. Techno-uncertainty may result
in lowered productivity when employees are uncertain of making decisions in an ICT
environment and require support and reassurance from others (Tarafdar et al., 2011,
p.118).
2.1.1.1.2 Technostress inhibitors
As previously defined technostress inhibitors are factors, which alleviate the likelihood
of technostress. Inhibitors are usually organizations’ mechanisms or measures, which can
potentially reduce technostress on its employees (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.422).
Organizations can use many ways to help their employees to cope with the ICTs. RaguNathan et al., (2008, pp.422-423) mention in their article, for example, training,
availability of technical support, involving employees in IT projects, and frequent
communication.
Training especially is one of the most effective tools to decrease the likelihood of
technostress. According to Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.422), employees who have had
more training or whose training was considered high quality are more likely to have a
positive response to new ICT solutions than their counterparts with less training or with
poor quality training. Training can make employees better equipped and prepared for
upcoming changes and reduce the likelihood of future mistakes (Tarafdar et al., 2011,
p.118).
Availability of technical support is also important for employees to be able to create a
good relationship with the ICTs. Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.422) suggest that technical
support should be available to the employees to help with their problems, and employees
should early on be encouraged to learn the software by exploring its functionalities. When
technical support is easily accessible and responsive it can increase job productivity and
job satisfaction (Tarafdar et al., 2011, p.118).

14

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

Training and support together create an important mechanism for the organizations to
guide their employees through the change and reduce negative emotions related to it. In
their study, Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.427), named these technostress inhibitors
“literacy facilitation” and “technical support provision”. Literacy facilitation refers here
to a wider context than just training it refers to overall encouragement of ICT-related
knowledge sharing in the organization.
Involvement is a great way to reinforce employees’ relationships with the ICTs. Other
than technical employees, or as often referred to the end-users, should be involved in IT
projects already the very start (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.422). When end-users are
involved in the early phases of the IT project and can have an impact, according to RaguNathan et al. (2008, p.423) and Tarafdar et al. (2011 p.119), they create stronger
relationships with the new technologies and are thus less likely to feel anxiety or stress
when using it. Tarafdar et al. (2011, p.119) also indicate that when employees outside IT
are involved, they will more likely bring up new ideas and points of view increasing the
usefulness of the new systems.
Another way to involve employees is to communicate with them. Organizations should
understand that it is important to openly communicate with their employees about the
coming changes, what kinds of effects does it have, and what kinds of benefits and
opportunities these present to the employees (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.423). As it is
said there can never be too much communication. Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.423)
mention that communication can help employees to reduce stress, fear, and anxiety
related to changes. In their study, Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.427), combined these two
mechanisms, involvement, and communication, as one technostress inhibitor
“involvement facilitation”.
Additional technostress inhibitors have also been identified. Tarafdar et al. (2011, p.119)
identified “innovation support”, which refers to an organizational culture of encouraging
experimenting and learning. Encouraging employees to innovate with the technologies
can help them understand technologies better and make them less threatening to them
(Tarafdar et al., 2011, p.119). This kind of organizational environment allows new ideas,
15

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

risk-taking, making mistakes, and learning from them, alleviating further the possible
stress and fears caused by the ICTs.
In their article Tarafdar et al. (2019, p.25) present that ICT design could be used to tackle
technostress. When technologies have been designed so that they are user-friendly and
easy to use they can feel less threatening to the users and minimize techno-complexity
(Tarafdar et al., 2019, pp.25-26). Design features that create positive feelings, enhance
continual use, and strengthen the employee’s feeling of gaining benefits from using the
technologies inhibit technostress (Tarafdar et al., 2019, p.27). It should be noted that
design aspects should also take into consideration different kinds of users and consider
their differences and needs. Tarafdar et al. (2019, p.27) argue, that better-designed
technology can therefore increase employees’ skills and abilities, which in turn will
increase innovation and performance in the organizations.
Ioannou, Lycett, & Marshan, (2022) present in their study an additional technostress
inhibitor, which has rarely been taken into consideration previously, that is mindfulness
and IT mindfulness. Mindfulness means being present at the moment and being aware of
the occurring situation (Ioannou et al. 2022). IT mindfulness, on the other hand, is defined
in Ioannou et al.’s (2022) article as mindfulness, which occurs when an individual is
working with IT. This type of mindfulness has four dimensions understanding IT,
identifying the usefulness of IT, enthusiasm towards IT, and the ability to focus on the
present task (Ioannou et al., 2022). In their research, Ioannou et al. (2022) found that IT
mindfulness helped mitigate the negative effects of technostress and increased job
satisfaction and productivity. They (Ioannou et al., 2022) suggest that organizations
should consider offering IT mindfulness education to their employees and include it as
part of their organizational culture to help mitigate the negative effects of technostress.
After reviewing both the five techno-stressors and the six identified techno inhibitors the
conceptual model of technostress has been revised to include these main stressors and
inhibitors. Figure 02. presents the revised version of the conceptual model with these
inclusions.

16

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

Figure 02. Revised conceptual model of technostress
2.1.1.1.3 Job Satisfaction
Job satisfaction is a positive emotion towards one’s job resulting from the individual’s
experiences in the job (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.423). The conceptual model includes
this, according to Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.423), because it has been determined to be
affected by workplace-related stress, it is a vital part of stress studies and because it is
often used as an indicator of the success of ICT projects in the organizations. Therefore,
it is important to measure job satisfaction with technostress.
Technostress creators are likely to decrease job satisfaction, whereas technostress
inhibitors are likely to increase it (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.423). Technostress creators
may increase negative feelings towards work affecting job satisfaction. According to
Tarafdar et al. (2011, p.117), technostress creators in the employee’s work environment
can increase role overload and role conflict, which eventually negatively affect job
satisfaction. Role overload is a situation where an employee feels like there is too much
work or the work required in their role is too difficult (Tarafdar et al., 2011, p.117).
Whereas role conflict means the feelings of inconsistencies, these inconsistencies may be
about work extending to free time, changes in processes to what was familiar, or new
required skills may conflict with their existing ones (Tarafdar et al., 2011, pp.117-118).

17

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.423) wrote that technostress inhibitors can alleviate the
effects of technostress creators on job satisfaction. Technostress inhibitors such as
providing training, supporting, involving employees, communicating with the employees,
and culture of innovation in the organization have been known to alleviate change-related
stress on employees, and therefore increase job satisfaction (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008,
p.423; Tarafdar et al., pp.118-119).
2.1.1.1.4 Organizational and continuance commitment
Organization commitment and continuance commitment measure how involved an
employee is to the organization and how likely they are to stay in the organization (RaguNathan et al., 2008, p.423). These have been added to the conceptual model to inspect the
broader effects technostress has on the organizations in the long term (Ragu-Nathan et
al., 2008, p.423).
According to Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.423), organizational commitment is defined as
the strength, in which an employee can connect to the organization through its beliefs,
goals, and values. It has been found that the more satisfied an employee is in their job the
more committed they are to their organization (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.424).
Technostress creators, according to Tarafdar et al. (2011, p.118), are associated with
reduced organizational commitment as these make working in the organization
uncomfortable for the employees and make it harder for them to identify with the
organization’s goals and values. However, it is argued by Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008,
p.424), that technostress inhibitors have a positive impact on organizational commitment.
Continuance commitment on the other hand refers to the likelihood of an employee
staying in the organization. Continuance commitment is about how beneficial an
employee views staying in the organization or leaving the organization. Organizational
commitment has a positive impact on continuance commitment, hence the more
committed an employee is to the organization and its values the more likely they will
continue working there. It has also been argued that technostress inhibitors have a positive
impact on organizational commitment. (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.424.)

daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

2.1.1.1.5 Individual differences
Individual differences in the conceptual model of technostress present four kinds of
characteristics education, age, gender, and computer confidence. These four individual
differences can have both positive and negative effects on the likelihood of technostress.
According to Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.424), education especially has been a positive
influence in preventing strains of technostress. They (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.424)
argue that the more education an individual has the faster they become accustomed to the
new ICTs and less negative feelings do they express towards the ICTs. Age, however,
can work either to alleviate or increase technostress. These characteristics have more to
do with other individual factors. For example, more educated older professionals might
be more able to handle technostress than their younger less-educated counterparts. The
effects of gender on technostress will be discussed in a later chapter.
Computer confidence has been seen as one of the main alleviating factors for technostress
by reducing negative emotional exhaustion (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.424; Tarafdar et
al., 2011, p.119; Ma, Ollier-Malaterre & Lu, 2021, p.07). Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008,
p.424) present in their article, that computer confidence increases an individual’s ability
to use ICTs independently and independence lowers anxiety, fear, and stress related to
the ICTs. The same characteristic has also been presented as self-efficacy (Ma et al., 2021,
p.01; Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.424). Computer confidence or self-efficacy can increase
an employee’s trust in their skills and ability to handle new issues with ICTs, hence they
experience less technostress (Tarafdar et al., 2011, p.119). According to Ma et al. (2021,
p.03), those employees with high self-efficacy phase fewer negative emotions when
confronting techno-stressors than their counterparts with low self-efficacy. Ma et al.
(2021, p.03) argue that those individuals with lower self-efficacy have to spend more time
coping with techno-stressors. Computer confidence can be increased through training and
encouragement to experiment with the ICTs.
2.1.1.2 Model of coping for technostress
In their article, Tarafdar, Pirkkalainen, Salo, & Makkonen (2020, p.83) bring up that
employees have started increasingly to create their own coping mechanisms to decrease
19

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

the effects of technostress. Coping means cognitive and emotional behavior, which an
individual undertakes when they encounter stress-creating situations (Pirkkalainen et al.,
2019, p.1180). In their article, Pirkkalainen et al. (2019) created a technostress coping
model called “a model of proactive and reactive coping for technostress”. It introduces
coping mechanisms and behaviors, which help an employee to mitigate the risks of
technostress and what kinds of combinations of these mechanisms and behaviors are the
most useful. Their model is presented in Figure 03. In their model, Pirkkalainen et al.
(2019) argue that technostress creators, or techno-stressors, hurt IT-enabled productivity,
which proactive and reactive coping mechanisms can mitigate. According to Pirkkalainen
et al. (2019, p.1185), techno-stressors inhibit an employee’s resources from performing
IT-enabled tasks effectively compared to the prior situation and hence decrease their
productivity.

Figure 03. Model of proactive and reactive coping for technostress (Pirkkalainen et al.,
2019)
Coping mechanisms provide employees with skills to adapt to changes and how to
respond to them. According to Tarafdar et al. (2020, p.83), coping mechanisms can help
to alleviate the negative outcomes of technostress. Pirkkalainen et al. (2019, p.1183)
argue that technostress is an inevitable situation in the working life, which employees
need to prepare for and need to learn to cope with so they can mitigate the negative effects.
When a stressful situation occurs there are two ways, in which employees can react to it
either by using emotions or by using actions (Tarafdar et al., 2020, p.83). Pirkkalainen et
20

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

al. (2019, p.1182) claim that when an employee sees ICT as a threat, which they cannot
avoid they tend to rely on emotions rather than actions. According to Pirkkalainen et al.
(2019, p.1182), Combining emotion-based coping mechanisms with action-based coping
mechanisms is usual for employees. For example, when emotion like frustration or anger
is experienced due to a difficult task it might trigger an employee to seek help from their
coworkers to tackle the task. In their model, Pirkkalainen et al. (2019) used the terms
reactive and proactive to present these two types of coping behaviors.
Reactive coping is defined by Pirkkalainen et al. (2019, p.1180) as behavioral responses
to stressors and stressful situations. These could also be called emotion-based coping
mechanisms. As stressful situations might occur without a warning it is common for
individuals to use reactive coping mechanisms. It describes the individual’s spontaneous
first response to the stressful situation and is usually unavoidable. According to
Pirkkalainen et al. (2019, p.1184), reactive coping behaviors are used to minimize the
burden triggered by the stressors. These kinds of reactive coping mechanisms are, for
example, showing emotions, seeking help, and distancing from the situation (Pirkkalainen
et al., 2019, pp.1184-1185). In their model, Pirkkalainen et al. (2019, p.1187) chose
“distress venting” and “distance from IT” as the most effective reactive coping
mechanisms.
Distress venting refers to verbally expressing one’s emotions and it has been shown to
ease the frustration, tension, and stress when an individual can openly express their
feelings (Pirkkalainen et al. 2019, p.1187). Tarafdar et al. (2020, p.86) claim that venting
helps employees to mitigate the negative effects of technostress on their productivity and
be less affected by stress. Distance from IT means to remove oneself from a stresscreating situation or environment when feeling anxious creating brief relief from the
situation (Pirkkalainen et al., 2019, p.1187; Tarafdar et al., 2020, p.86). According to
Pirkkalainen et al. (2019, p.1187), distancing can help an employee to move their focus
from the stressor to more meaningful aspects like their work or how to deal with the
stressor in the future. Studies, such as Pirkkalainen et al. (2019, p.1181), show that
reactive coping behaviors are most effective when combined with proactive coping
behaviors and mechanisms. In fact, according to Pirkkalainen et al. (2019, p.1185),
21

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

reactive coping mechanisms alone have been associated with poor results in stress
management.
According to Pirkkalainen et al. (2019, p.1180) proactive coping means preventative
measures, which to deal with stressful situations and to use these situations as learning
and personal growth opportunities. Proactive coping mechanisms could also be called
action-based or problem-based coping mechanisms. These mechanisms are created
proactively when a potentially stressful situation is on the horizon (Pirkkalainen et al.,
2019, p.1184). Proactive coping includes two different kinds of behaviors identified by
Pirkkalainen et al. (2019, p.1184), which they use in their model: “positive
reinterpretation” and “IT control”.
Positive reinterpretation means discharging stressful situations through positive feelings
and seeking positive aspects from the situation (Pirkkalainen et al., 2019, p.1188). When
an employee has a positive attitude towards the ICTs or changes in general it can help
them to handle these stress creators better (Tarafdar et al., 2020, p.86). IT control coping
mechanism on the other hand is described by Pirkkalainen et al. (2019, p.1189) as an
individual’s impression of their skills and abilities or control over technostress-stressors.
IT control has two main aspects perceived capabilities and perceived autonomy.
Perceived capabilities refer to the perception of skills and abilities and perceived
autonomy refers to independence and control over the situation. Pirkkalainen et al. (2019,
p.1189) argue that the more capable the employee feels they are and more in control of
the situation they feel they are, the better they will react to the stressful situation.
According to Pirkkalainen et al. (2019, p.1185), proactive coping behaviors affect what
kind of reactive coping behaviors are used by the individual. Proactive coping
mechanisms have been seen to enhance the positive effects of reactive coping
(Pirkkalainen et al., 2019, p.1180). For example, when an individual has a perception of
autonomy over the stress creator, they are more likely to have control over the emotions
they express when the stress occurs. Proactive and reactive mechanisms can and should
be combined to better handle stressful situations (Pirkkalainen et al., 2019, p.1185). More
proactive coping mechanisms an employee has the better equipped they are to the
22

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

stressors and the more useful reactive coping mechanisms they will use in the situation
(Pirkkalainen et al., 2019, pp.1207).
Pirkkalainen et al. (2019, p.1208) suggest that organizations should actively support their
employees to learn more proactive coping skills and create awareness for techno-stressors
and how to identify them. It should be noted that there is no one right way of coping and
different kinds of combinations of coping behaviors can be more beneficial for one group
of employees but not for another. Therefore, according to Pirkkalainen et al. (2019,
p.1208), it is beneficial to educate the employees about possible coping mechanisms.
Managers should also support their employees to find the most suitable coping
mechanisms for them depending on their role and characteristics (Tarafdar et al., 2020,
p.87). Tarafdar et al. (2020, p.88) also suggest that organizations should have flexible IT
policies, such as the possibility to create their own working processes, which allow
employees to adapt their coping mechanisms to be most suitable and effective.
When considering the technostress coping model similarities can be found between it and
the conceptual model of technostress. For this reason, the following Figure 04. was
created to demonstrate the technostress and all of the factors, which can mitigate its
effects. Here we take into consideration that technostress creators have a negative effect
on both IT-enabled productivity and job satisfaction as productivity along the job
satisfaction are important measures of changes to the organizations. As found by Ioannou
et al. (2022) techno inhibitors can have a favorable effect on productivity this notion has
also been added to the enhanced conceptual model of technostress.

2.1.2

Technostress and gender

Literature on technostress seems to have varying opinions on, which gender is more prone
to suffer from technostress. Marchiori, Mainardes, & Rodrigues (2018, p.11) found that
several pieces of literature reports men being more prone to technostress than women,
whereas others reported contrary results and some even reported that gender did not play
any role. Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.424) for example argued that women are more prone
to suffer from technostress than men but their results contradicted their belief. They
believe that in their results this was because the majority of their subjects were men and
because the women in their study had more experience in working and therefore were
more capable of handling the possible techno-stressors (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008, p.429).
Marchiori et al. (2018, p.09) argue that the issue might be more complex than that and
that different genders are more prone to different aspects of technostress than others. It
should also be taken into consideration that many of the studies have been performed on
24

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

different occupations, hence it could explain the variation in the research outcomes as
occupations, education, and skill levels could affect the results.
In the technostress literature, women are viewed as having passive attitudes towards
technologies. Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008, p.424), for example, argue in their study that the
decision to use or not to use ICTs by women is based on how they believe they are
expected to decide in the organizations whereas by men it is based on their attitudes
towards the technology. According to Carlotto (2011, p.60), women are more likely to
view technologies as a threat, which they do not control. Furthermore, it is claimed that
women are less likely to use ICTs, have less confidence in using the ICTs, and are more
prone to have anxiety and fear towards them (Gabr et al., 2021; Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008,
p.424; Spagnoli et al., 2020, p.04). However, Carlotto (2011, p.58) argues that this could
be due to how differently men and women have been encouraged to use technologies and
how working with technologies has been viewed to be a masculine field. Interestingly
even though most research shows that women are less confident with technologies,
Pirkkalainen et al. (2011, p.1205) found in their study that when women use the ICTs,
they use them more productively than their male counterparts.
According to Carlotto (2011, p.54), women suffer from work-related stress more often
than men. They (Carlotto, 2011, p.54), also argue that women are more prone to use
reactive coping mechanisms whereas men are more likely to use proactive coping
mechanisms to alleviate stress. As previously reviewed reactive coping mechanisms
alone have a poor effect on alleviating stress. According to Carlotto (2011, p.60), men’s
coping mechanisms to technostress were more problem-oriented, which included
planning and being more active towards the stressor. However, women relied on
emotional coping mechanisms such as support from other people, denial, and distance
from the situation (Carlotto, 2011, p.60). In their article, La Torre, De Leonardis, &
Chiappetta, (2020, p.63) wrote that when suffering from technostress the consequences
of it on men are more often related to social issues such as isolation. This would indicate
that social coping mechanisms are in some terms beneficial as they protect from such
consequences.

25

daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

These differences in technostress coping mechanisms between the genders are explained
by Carlotto (2011, p.60) through how genders view the technologies. As women are more
likely to view then ICTs as something they cannot control, when a problem occurs, they
rely on emotional mechanisms as they do not believe they can handle the problem any
other way (Carlotto, 2011, p.60). This is a problem, which could be tackled by increasing
ICT-related training and computer confidence in women.
Recent studies done during the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that women are more
prone to suffer from technostress than men (Estrada-Muñoz et al., 2021, p.10; Gabr et al.,
2021; Penado Abilleira et al., 2021, p.09; Spagnoli et al., 2020, p.06) Spagnoli et al.
(2020, p.06). explain this by men being more involved with technologies and thus having
higher computer confidence than women. Gabr et al. (2021) suggest that higher levels of
technostress on women could be due to a higher amount of domestic responsibilities
creating more work-family conflict on women than on men. Penado Abilleira et al. (2021,
p.06) indicate that though women were more likely to suffer from technostress it did not
show in their job performance, hence there was no difference in job performance levels
between the genders in their study.
When viewing this aspect from a techno-stressor point of view it has been pointed out
that women are more likely to experience techno-complexity and techno-uncertainty
whereas men experience techno-overload and techno-invasion more often (Marchiori et
al., 2018, pp.09-10; Spagnoli et al., 2020, p.07). These results seem to support what has
been previously suggested about women feeling more insecure with technologies whereas
men are maybe even too involved with technologies. Marchiori et al. (2018, p.3) wrote
that men are more oriented towards external aspects of technologies for example utility
of the technologies whereas women tend to be more oriented toward internal aspects such
as ease of use. This point of view supports the differences in experiences with technostressors. When considering the techno-stressors aspects techno-overload and technoinvasion are external stressors while techno-complexity and techno-uncertainty are
internal stressors (Marchiori et al., 2018, pp.09-10). This view is further supported by
Atanasoff & Venable’s (2017, p.329) claim that men’s stress is more achievement or
accomplishment based whereas women’s is more interpersonal based.
26

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

Contrary to previous findings, La Torre et al. (2020, p.63) found in their study that women
experienced techno-overload and techno-invasion more often than men. Their (La Torre
et al., 2020, p.63) findings however support previous findings on women experiencing
more techno-complexity than men. It should be noted that La Torre’s findings have been
made during the COVID-19 pandemic, thus the increased experience of techno-overload
and techno-invasion by women could correlate with Gabr et al.’s (2021) claim that
women have more domestic responsibilities and experience more work-family conflict.
In their study, Carlotto (2011, p.57) found that women are more prone to suffering from
technostrains, especially anxiety, skepticism, and inefficiency when they encounter
technostress. Similar findings have been made in other studies as well. Other studies have
expressed women feeling more anxiety towards technologies, but contrary to the study
by Carlotto, they also expressed women suffering from technology-related fatigue more
often than men (Estrada-Muñoz et al., 2021, p.09; Gabr et al., 2021). As the contradicting
studies have been conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic these could further support
Gabr et al.’s (2021) claim about the higher rates of domestic responsibilities and workfamily conflict on women than men, increasing their workload and feelings of not enough
time. In the article by Gabr et al., (2021) higher levels of anxiety in women is explained
by men using technologies more, making their computer confidence higher than
women’s.
Though the results of the literature review on technostress and gender differences are
mixed. The results seem to indicate that the special circumstances that the COVID-19
pandemic and daily remote working have presented are affecting higher occurrences of
technostress on women compared to men. There seems to be an indication that men and
women experience technostress differently and are more likely to be affected by the
different techno-stressors (techno-overload and techno-invasion on men and technocomplexity and techno-uncertainty on women). The gender also seems to indicate the
existence of technostrains, where women were found to experience anxiety, skepticism,
and inefficiency more with fatigue in the rise since the start of the pandemic. Though the
experience of technostress is higher in women it does not seem to affect their job

27

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

performance indicating that coping mechanisms of women are effective from the
employer’s point of view.

2.1.3

Technostress during COVID-19

Since the start of the pandemic organizations have taken enormous digital leaps and
introduced new digital tools for working with their employees. According to Oksanen et
al. (2021, p.02), technostress is more likely to occur when new technologies are presented.
The situation has been made unique by the fact that immediate support has not been
available to the employees but they have had to encounter these changes while working
independently and remotely from their work communities. According to Riglea et al.
(2021, p.133), during the COVID-19 pandemic employees have been exposed to fewer
techno inhibitors and coping mechanisms, such as social interactions. It has been difficult
for the organizations to offer the technostress inhibitors such as training and technical
support traditionally when employees have been geographically spread out. Due to the
lack of such support people have had to use all of their mental resources into adapting to
the changing working environment during the COVID-19 pandemic (Riglea, Rus, &
Ratiu, 2021, p.124).
An example of one such digital leap, many organizations introduced digital
communication applications such as Microsoft Teams, Yammer, or Zoom during the
pandemic to help remote working. The usual face-to-face interactions with coworkers
were hence moved to digital form. These applications can be harnessed in organizations
to improve communication practices, knowledge sharing, and networking (Oksanen et
al., 2021, p.02). These applications can be used for both formal and informal
communication amongst the employees. Due to this nature, according to Oksanen et al.
(2021, p.02), these applications can increase the ability to combine work and private life
and enhance employees’ work engagement.
Though these communication applications offer several benefits and can improve
communication these can also be a source of technostress to some. Oksanen et al. (2021,
p.02) indicate that these applications allow an employee to be bombarded with constant
28

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

notifications and messages, and make an employee available around the clock. Their
(Oksanen et al., 2021, p.07) study also suggests that the more employees used these
communication applications the more likely they were to suffer from technostress. Thus,
these applications can create techno-overload and techno-invasion on users if these
negative effects are not mitigated. Shift to digital communication may also, according to
Oksanen et al. (2021, p.03), increase loneliness, fatigue, multitasking, and problems with
concentration. Thus, digital communication applications can make employees experience
techno-overload and techno-invasion leading to technostrains such as fatigue if these
negative effects are not mitigated with technostress inhibitors such as training or IT
mindfulness.
Oksanen et al. (2021, p.03, 08) found that technology intense remote working during the
COVID-19 pandemic increased the likelihood of technostress, due to factors such as
work-family conflict. Recent studies (Estrada-Muñoz et al., 2021, pp.09-10; Gabr et al.,
2021; Penado Abilleira et al., 2021, p.09) have also found that gender, age, and low
quality of ICT networks increased the likelihood of technostress during the pandemic.
According to Gabr et al. (2021), older adults’ technostress during the pandemic was due
to a lack of cognitive and physical skills, which indicated increased techno-overload and
techno-complexity. High hierarchy and authoritarian leadership were also found to
increase technostress during the pandemic (Spagnoli et al., 2020, p.06). This indicates
that in the organizations where employees were forced to continue with the old ways of
working in the new surroundings, hence inhibiting them from flexibility and autonomy
over their work, were more likely to suffer from technostress.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, employees have been forced to take more responsibility
for the technologies. They have encountered new kinds of stressful situations, which they
previously were not responsible for such as technology failures and network quality issues
(Ioannou et al., 2022). Due to the distance and working in a home environment outside
of their jurisdiction, it is difficult for an organization’s technical support to help
employees with these issues during the pandemic. Therefore employee’s responsibility is
increased. These problems can increase technostress on employees. Gabr et al. (2021)
found in their study that poor Wi-Fi quality significantly increased the likelihood of
29

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

technostress on employees. They (Gabr et al., 2021) further found that technostress was
increased on those employees living in rural areas. Rural areas in some countries can
mean that network infrastructure is not as advanced indicating poor internet connection
and increased likelihood of interruptions in connection, which disrupts employee’s
workday and workflow (Gabr et al., 2021).
Riglea et al. (2021, p.135) wrote in their article that during the COVID-19 pandemic
technostress has had a negative effect on employees’ well-being and it has intensified
work-family conflict. In their research, Molino, Ingusci, Signore, Manuti, Giancaspro,
Russo, Zito, & Cortese (2020, p.13) found that during the pandemic employees were more
likely to experience techno-invasion, techno-overload, and techno-complexity. This
finding together with findings by Oksanen et al. (2021, p.07) suggests that the working
conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic are ideal for technostress to prosper.
According to Riglea et al. (2021, p.135), these stressors also had a negative effect on
employees’ mental well-being. Riglea et al. (2021, p.133) further found that employees
who experienced techno-overload or techno-invasion during the COVID-19 pandemic
were more likely to look for a new job.
Molino et al. (2020, p.14) suggest that managers play a crucial role in mitigating the
occurrence of technostress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This can be done by
identifying techno-stressors in the organization, implementing techno inhibitors, and
adopting policies, that better fit the current working environment (Molino et al., 2020,
p.14). The importance of communication should not be forgotten as an important
managerial tool to mitigate technostress. The study by Zito, Ingusci, Cortese, Giancaspro,
Manuti, Molino, Signore & Russo (2021, p.14) found that communication especially
during this uncertain time is an important way to reduce the occurrence of technostress.
During the COVID-19 pandemic there are many other ways, which can be used to
mitigate technostress. For example, increasing employees’ technical skills, recognizing
employees’ differences, providing targeted support mechanisms, helping to maintain
work in working hours, as well as promoting well-being at work were suggested by
literature (Molino et al., 2020, p.14; Oksanen et al., 2021, p.08;). Training is especially
30

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

important, as Oksanen et al. (2021, p.08) found in their research that individuals with high
IT skills and computer confidence were better equipped to adjust to the digital leap during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Riglea et al. (2021, p.136) argue that technostress and its
negative outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic can also be mitigated by helping
employees to maintain work-family borders and decreasing work-family conflict. Last
but not least it is suggested by research (Molino et al., 2020, p.14; Riglea et al., 2021,
p.136) that psychological counseling should be made available by the organization to
their employees during these difficult times.

2.2 Remote working
Remote work, virtual work, teleworking, telecommuting, agile working. Many names
have been used to describe the phenomenon of using ICT solutions to work outside the
residence of the employer (Carillo et al., 2020, p.70; Grant, Wallace, Spurgeon,
Tramontano & Charalampous, 2019 p.17). In this study, the term remote working is used
as it is the most often used term in Finland when describing this form of working. Remote
working revolves around the idea that when employees perform their work it is more
important what they do and not where they do it. According to Raiborn & Butler (2009,
p.32), the original purpose of remote working was to reduce societal and environmental
problems related to such issues as energy, pollution, traffic, and waste of resources, for
example by remote workers not having to drive to work. In the research by Carillo et al.
(2020, p.69) it was mentioned that before the COVID-19 pandemic around 5% of
employees in the European Union practiced remote working regularly.
Before the pandemic offering remote working was seen as a strategic way to attain a
competitive advantage and a benefit to offer to the employees (Carillo et al., 2020, p.7071). It has several benefits for both the employee and the employer. From the employee’s
standpoint working from home allows cost-saving for example through not having to buy
gasoline, lunches, or work suitable attire as well as through a possibility to make
deductions from income taxes (Raiborn & Butler, 2009, p.33; Jacks, 2021, p.93).
Employees would also save time by not having to commute to work. Based on the
information from Eurostat (2020) in 2019 the average commute time in the EU is 25
minutes and 23 minutes in Finland. This constitutes 50-45 minutes spent commuting daily
31

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

and around 4 hours per week. Remote working also allows more flexibility for employees
to combine their work and family lives for example through being able to use different
forms or lengths of childcare or by using breaks to run private errands (Jacks, 2021, p.93;
Anderson & Kelliher, 2020, p.678).
Based on the research (Raiborn & Butler, 2009, pp.33-34; Anderson & Kelliher, 2020,
p.679) from an employer’s perspective there are also numerous benefits. Offering remote
working to their employees has been seen to increased job productivity, cost savings (for
example on utilities), increased employee attraction and retentions as well as increased
workforce stability (Raiborn & Butler, 2009, pp.33-34; Anderson & Kelliher, 2020,
p.679). In the article by Anderson & Kelliher (2020, p.679) it is noted that high
organizational commitment has also been linked to remote working and it has been
explained by increased trust and the feelings of gratitude and being in debt to the
employer.
The purpose of remote working has been to help employees to find a better balance
between work and private life (Carillo et al., 2020, p.71; Raiborn & Butler, 2009, p.33;
Grant et al., 2019 p.17). As written by Raiborn & Butler (2009, p.32) remote working
allows the flexibility of employees to work on assigned tasks with the freedom to choose
time, place, and pace by themselves. Subjects of the research by Sullivan & Lewis (2001,
p.133) listed several advantages of remote working in the work domain, from which the
most mentioned was increased independence and autonomy of work. Flexibility and
autonomy of work have been determined to increase job satisfaction (Raiborn & Butler,
2009, p.33; Grant et al., 2019, p.17).
However, one cannot discuss the positive effects of remote working without mentioning
the negatives as well. Many researchers (Carillo et al., 2020, p.70; Raiborn & Butler,
2009, p.35), have found that when working remotely employees tend to work longer hours
than at the office. As noted in the research by Raiborn & Butler (2009, p.35), while the
purpose of remote working has been to balance work and life it might create conflicts for
instance in situations where the remote worker does not have a dedicated quiet place to
work at home. According to Grant et al. (2019, pp.17-18) & Taser, Aydin, Torgaloz &
32

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

Rofcanin (2022, p.02), remote working has also been associated with for example poor
well-being, overload in digital communication, increased work intensification, and more
pressure towards the remote worker from the organization. These could affect employees’
effectiveness and performance (Taser et al., 2022, p.02).
As pointed out by Raiborn & Butler (2009, p.35) remote workers are also lacking the
support offered to office workers such as technical support. Remote workers are therefore
required to take more responsibility for their working conditions and possibilities of
working compared to their office working coworkers. From employers' perspective the
negative sides to remote working according to Raiborn & Butler (2009, pp.35-37), is loss
of control, raised concerns over data security, decreased efficiency of teamwork,
increased costs, and increased role of the IT department and devices.
When remote workers meet their coworkers face-to-face less often, they are lacking social
involvement and interactions resulting in social isolation and loneliness (Raiborn &
Butler, 2009, p.35; Grant et al., 2019, p.21). Taser et al. (2022, p.2) define loneliness in
the work context as a stressor to an individual, which occurs when they are isolated from
their work community. Social isolation, according to Golden, Veiga & Dino (2008,
p.1412), may make remote workers feel like they are not part of the community or not in
the loop of interactions. Golden et al. (2008, p.1412) define social or professional
isolation in their article, as a sense of being separated from others in a professional
context., which can occur when an individual’s needs for social interactions are not met
at work. According to the article by Taser et al. (2022, p.4.), the risk of feeling lonely in
remote working is especially high on employees whose work is complex and vague.
Golden et al. (2008, pp.1413-1414) define three risk factors, which increase the likelihood
of feeling socially isolated and lonely: extended remote working period, decreased
amount of face-to-face interactions, and inability to communicate with coworkers through
using digital communication tools.
Remote working may decrease the number of interactions between coworkers and result
in an inability to communicate, obtain support, share knowledge, and learn from others
(Taser et al., 2022, p.4). Social isolation and loneliness can have various effects on
33

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

employees. According to the research (Golden et al., 2008, p.1413; Taser et al., 2022,
p.4), when feeling socially isolated or lonely employees are less productive, less
confident, more likely to suffer from work-related anxiety, and their ability to absorb new
information or knowledge decreases. Based on the article by Golden et al. (2008, p.1413),
workers suffering from social isolation or loneliness are less committed to the
organization and more likely to change jobs. In their study Taser et al. (2022, p.7), found
that loneliness negatively affects employees’ capabilities of working remotely. To tackle
social isolation and loneliness organizations should improve their communication,
encourage proactive communication by managers, offer informal activities to all
employees, encourage knowledge sharing and encourage the use of digital
communication tools (Golden et al., 2008, p.1419; Taser et al., 2022, p.7).
Remote working is based on mutual trust between the employee and the employer. The
employer has to supervise the employee’s performance from a distance, so honesty is
required from the employee, therefore trusting relationship between these two parties is
essential for remote working to succeed and to be effective (Gashi et al., 2021, p.375;
Grant et al., 2019, p.20). Grant et al. (2019, p.18) wrote that having a trusting relationship
between the employee and the manager can increase employees’ self-management skills
and therefore improve their work-life balance. Communication is key to ensuring trust
between all parties (Gashi et al., 2021, p.375; Grant et al., 2019, p.20).
Several factors to ensure successful remote working is listed in the research by Gashi et
al. (2021, p.375), such factors are managerial support, communication, guidelines,
policies, and relevant training, which should be used to ensure success. Especially
organizational support has been found to increase remote workers’ job satisfaction and
well-being (Gashi et al., 2021, p.375). Grant et al. (2019, p.28) make a similar finding in
their research where they found that a supportive and trustful relationship between the
organization and the employee promotes employee’s self-claimed mental well-being and
vitality as well as the vitality of the organization.
Bussin & Swart-Opperman (2021, p.3) wrote that certain personality characteristics make
an employee suitable for remote work. According to Bussin & Swart-Opperman (2021,
34

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

p.3), employees who are most suitable for remote working are introverts and high
performers. They tend to need less of a connection with their coworkers and are practiceoriented and rely on set rules and guidelines instead of their feelings (Bussin & SwartOpperman, 2021, p.3). Bussin & Swart-Opperman (2021, p.3) argue that employees who
do not have these characteristics tend to become bored of remote working faster and might
start to develop negative emotions such as anxiety, frustration, loneliness, and feelings of
being misinterpreted.
However, characteristics alone do not make a good remote worker. Just because one
worker has all the needed characteristics to work remotely does not alone mean they will
succeed in remote working. Many skills for successful remote working can also be
learned, such as time- and self-management skills. Taser et al. (2022, p.2.) indicate that
when employees are supported by their organizations, they are better equipped to handle
possible stressors and negative emotions remote working might cause. Positive remote
working experiences are a key to ensuring well-being and success in remote working
(Taser et al., 2022, p.4).

2.2.1

Concepts and theories in remote working research

In this part, we examine two concepts and theories used in remote working research EWork Life (EWL) scale and the work-family border theory. First, we introduce EWL
Scale and how it can be used to assess the remote working experience. Second, we
introduce work-family border theory and how it examines the combination of these two
domains in individuals’ lives.
2.2.1.1 E-Work Life Scale
Grant et al. developed in their 2019 research paper an E-Work Life (EWL) Scale. EWL
Scale’s purpose is to assess the remote working experience through remote worker’s
abilities, perceptions, and skills in four areas: Effectiveness and productivity,
organizational trust, flexibility, and work-life balance (Grant et al., 2019, p.16). In Figure
05. this scale has been demonstrated. EWL is a unique scale, which takes into
consideration employees’ side to the remote working while also providing measures for
35

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

managing and supporting remote workers. This scale also presents the necessary skills
remote workers should have to ensure the success of their remote working.
E-Work Life Scale:
Effectiveness & productivity
Organizational trust
Flexibility
Work-life balance
Figure 05. E-Work Life Scale (Grant et al., 2019)
According to Grant et al. (2019, p.18), EWL Scale is meant to provide a holistic view of
remote working experience where all areas are as important and create value to the remote
worker. They (Grant et al., 2019, p.18) give an example of when a remote worker has a
trusting relationship with their supervisor it can increase their self-management skills,
which in return will increase their work-life balance and well-being at work. From an
organization’s perspective measuring remote working experience is important as it can
help increase productivity and ensure employee well-being (Grant et al., 2019, p.28).
Effectiveness and productivity in EWL Scale relate to remote worker’s abilities and skills
to perform their work and meet the organization’s targets remotely (Gashi et al., 2021,
p.375). Grant et al. (2019, pp.25-27) mention that in their scale there are four items, which
are used to measure remote working experience in this area:
-

“When working remotely I can concentrate better on my work tasks”

-

“Remote working makes me more effective to deliver against my key objectives
and deliverables”

-

“If I am interrupted by family/ other responsibilities while working remotely, I
still meet my manager's quality expectations”

-

“My overall job productivity has increased by my abilities to work remotely”

These items help to assess remote worker’s personal skills to ensure an effective and
productive remote working experience.

36

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

The second area of the EWL Scale is organizational trust, which Gashi et al. (2021, p.375)
define as remote worker’s perception of the support and trust they receive from their
organization. Grant et al. (2019, pp.25-27) measure this area with the help of three items:
-

“My organization provides training in remote working skills and behaviors”

-

“My organization trusts me to be effective in my role when I work remotely”

-

“I trust my organization to provide good remote working facilities to allow me to
work effectively”

These items assess remote worker’s views on their organization’s perceptions and
attitudes towards remote working and its remote workers. It notes that remote worker is
part of an organization, which can affect the remote working experience heavily.
The EWL Scale’s flexibility is defined by Gashi et al. (2021, p.375) as remote worker’s
perceptions of the flexibility they have over how and when they work while working
remotely. This area is divided by Grant et al. (2019, pp.25-27) into three measurable
items:
-

“My manager gives me total control over when and how I get my work completed
when working remotely”

-

“My work is so flexible I could easily take time off working remotely, if and when
I want to”

-

“My line manager allows me to flex my hours to meet my needs, providing all the
work is completed”

These items help to assess how flexible remote worker perceives their work and how
flexible they perceive their organization to be.
The last area of the EWL Scale is work-life balance. This refers to remote worker’s
ability to manage boundaries between their work and private lives (Gashi et al., 2021,
p.375). According to Grant et al. (2019, pp.25-27), this is the most extensive area, which
is measured using seven different items:
-

“My remote working takes up time that I would like to spend with family/friends
or on other non-work activities”

-

“When working remotely I often think about work-related problems outside my
normal working hours”
37

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

-

“I am happy with my work-life balance when working remotely”

-

“Constant access to work through remote working is very tiring”

-

“When remotely working from home I do know when to switch off/ put work
down so that I can rest”

-

“I feel that work demands are much higher when I am working remotely”

-

“My social life is poor when working remotely”

These items in the work-life balance area are to help assess remote worker’s abilities to
combine their work and private lives, to understand and set boundaries between these
two, and to shift from one area of life to another.
In Figure 06. EWL Scale areas are combined with all of the 17 items defined by Grant et
al. (2019, pp. 25-27). Gashi et al. (2021, p.380) tested how well the EWL Scale suites
for examining remote working experience while researching remote working in Kosovo
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gashi et al. (2021, p.380) reduced the number of items
on the scale from 17 to 13 and combined effectiveness & productivity, and organizational
trust areas. Gashi et al. (2021, p.380) argued that this was necessary as items from
organizational trust all related to remote workers’ effectiveness. In this research, these
two items were kept separate as there is a clear distinction between these two areas.
Effectiveness and productivity area relates to employee’s internal skills, which create
productivity while organizational trust is about external factors supporting remote
working and effectiveness.
Remote working experience is not only about employee’s skills and abilities but also
about the conditions the organization creates, which should not be forgotten. According
to Gashi et al. (2021, pp.380-381), EWL Scale was found to be an effective tool to
measure remote working experience. Gashi et al., (2021, p.381) further conclude that
EWL Scale is a very beneficial tool not only for employees but for managers and
organizations as well. This is because it can help an employee to identify areas in their
remote working abilities and habits, which need improvement, help managers to
understand their employees’ remote working abilities, and show improvement areas for
organization’s remote working attitudes, policies, strategies, and support systems to
increase productivity in remote working (Gashi et al. 2021, p.381).

2.2.1.2 Work-Family border theory
While EWL Scale was developed to measure remote working experience the work-family
border theory can be used to examine the outcomes of remote working in work-family

daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

balance. This theory was created by Clark for their article published in 2000. According
to Clark (2000, pp.750-751), this theory revolves around the idea that work and family
lives are separate from each other but they influence each other. People generally have
different kinds of roles at work and at home. At Work, they might be following orders
and not have to make any major decisions and in contrast at home, they are the main
decision-makers. Clark (2000, p.750) describes that the purpose of the work-family
border theory is to study how people balance between work and family by examining
ways they shift between these two areas and manage the borders between them.
Four important components in work-family border theory are: “domains”, “borders”,
“border-crossers”, and “border-keepers and domain members”. Clark (2000, p.753) calls
work and home as domains, meaning differing social situations, which have different
purposes in people’s lives and where different kinds of rules, behaviors, culture, and
thoughts apply. Clark (2000, p.756) defines borders as separators of the domains, which
define where domain-related aspects start and end. Border-crossers are defined by Clark
(2000, p.759) as an individual whose creation the specific domains are and who shifts
between the created domains. Finally, according to Clark (2000, p.761), border-keepers
and domain members are other people in the domains. Those people that define the
domain, like managers at work or spouses at home, are called border-keepers (Clark,
2000, p.761). Other people, who are part of a specific domain but do not define it per se,
according to Clark (2000, p.761), are called domain members.
Three different kinds of borders, which separate these domains are “physical”,
“temporal” and “psychological” (Clark, 2000, p.756). Physical borders are concrete
separators of the domains, such as locations or walls, these borders define where the
domain occurs (Clark, 2000. p.756). Temporal borders, according to Clark (2000, p.756),
mean set times related to the domain, such as working hours, and define when the domain
occurs. Psychological borders, on the other hand, are personal principles of the individual,
which direct the individual on how to act, behave or think in the domain (Clark, 2000,
p.756). In Figure 07. all of the components and their interdependencies, of the workfamily border theory are presented.

Figure 07. Work-Family border theory (Clark, 2000)
The borders in the work-family border theory are characterized according to their
permeability, flexibility, blending, and border strength (Clark, 2000, pp.756-758).
Permeability, according to Clark (2000, p.756), refers to an element’s ability of
interference and entrance from one domain to another. For example, work may interfere
with free time through an electronic device notifying of a new work email, or home may
interfere with work time when working from home family members may enter a home
office. Clark (2000, p.756) also notes that psychological factors, such as emotions,
attitudes, or ideas, can as well permeate from one domain to another.
According to Clark (2000, p.757), flexibility means domain borders’ ability to withdraw
or expand based on the needs or demands of another domain. For example, in remote
working physical borders of the work domain are flexible and allow work to be done at
another place than the office and the home domain’s borders are flexible when allowing
remote working from home. Then on the other hand, when the work domain allows
errands to be run during work hours temporal borders of the work domain are flexible.
Blending is defined by Clark (2000, p.757) as an occurrence of permeability and
flexibility of the domain borders. Blending is an area, which cannot be defined to belong
to ether domain like commuting from one domain to another, using experience from one
domain to another, or running a family business (Clark, 2000, p.757). Finally, the border
strength is referred to by Clark (2000, p.758) as a combination of the three
aforementioned characteristics. The strong borders, according to Clark (2000, p.758), are
41

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

those with very little permeability, flexibility, or blending and the weak borders are those
with high permeability, flexibility, and blending.
When there is an imbalance between work and family domains or one domain permeates
to another too much the situation is called work-family conflict. Based on the article by
Kinnunen, Feldt, Geurts, & Pulkkinen (2006, p.150) work-family conflict is highly
related to role pressures and role conflicts between the domains. According to Leung &
Zhang (2017, p.387), work-family conflict can occur because one domain interferes and
limits the individual’s performance in another domain. When one domain permeates
negatively over to another domain it is called interference, most often work-family
interference can be found but finding family-work interference is not uncommon
(Kinnunen et al., 2006, p.150). According to the research (Kinnunen et al., 2006, p.150;
Leung & Zhang, 2017, p.387), work-family conflict can lead to mental and physical
health problems of the employee. Work-family conflict has also been shown to indicate
decreased work-related well-being and job satisfaction (Kinnunen et al., 2006, p.150;
Leung & Zhang, 2017, p.387). According to Leung & Zhang (2017, pp.387-388), high
permeability and low flexibility, especially in the work domain, increase the risk of workfamily conflict, whereas high flexibility lowers the risk.
Clark (2000, pp.764-765) argues that to increase the work-family balance the domains
and the borders must be altered and cooperation between the domains is needed. These
especially apply to the work domain. The balance cannot only be achieved by changing
the permeability and the flexibility of the physical or the temporal borders of the domain
but requires changes in psychological borders, such as culture and attitudes, as well
(Clark, 2000, p.765). Clark (2000, p.765-766) suggests that if these changes in the
psychological borders cannot be made in the organization, then strong borders between
the domains should be kept.
Not only are the borders important in creating work-family balance but so are the people
within the domains. Clark (2000, p.766) emphasizes the importance of the border-keepers
and the relationships between the border-keepers and the border-crossers. The borderkeepers, such as managers, should support the border-crossers and help them to maintain
42

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

work-family balance by allowing, for example, additional flexibility when needed (Clark,
2000, p.766). Clark (2000, p.766 also suggests that work-family balance is easier to
maintain and control when the border-crossers have been assimilated to all of their
domains cultures and feel like important members of all of their domains and have created
bonds between other members in their domains.
Individuals can support the balance between their work and family domains by actively
participating in the domains and utilizing communication (Clark, 2000, p.766). Clark
(2000, p.766) suggests that the border-crossers make their border-keepers and domain
members aware of their situations to receive support from them. According to Clark
(2000, p.767), when the border-crossers actively participate in their domains they can
develop closer relationships with the other members of their domains and learn and
understand their responsibilities better. Through these actions the border-crossers can
make all of their domains part of their identity; hence, will find a better balance between
the domains.
Leung & Zhan (2017) tested the work-family border theory to examine how remote work,
especially work-related ICT use at home, affects the borders characteristics and workfamily balance. They (Leung & Zhan, 2017, p.393) found that remote working made the
borders between the work and family domains both flexible and permeable. Leung &
Zhan (2017, p.393) indicate that remote working has therefore both positive and negative
sides, where it can be liberating and invasive simultaneously.
Interestingly, Leung & Zhan (2017, p.393) found that remote working itself is not an
indicator of work-family conflict or technostress but the work domain’s borders’ low
flexibility and high permeability are. This supports Clark’s claims on the need for
organizations to change the flexibility of their psychological borders to increase their
employees’ work-family balance. When an organization allows its employees to work
remotely the physical borders of the work domain are flexible but there might still be old
attitudes and culture related to remote work, which makes remote working difficult for
its employees. According to the research by Leung & Zhan (2017, p.394), family support
and flexibility at work are the keys to maintaining work-family balance.

2.2.2

Remote working and gender

According to the article by Çoban (2022, p.242), before the pandemic women were
slightly more interested in working remotely than men. Several of the research claims
that the reason for this interest is because it is easier for women to fulfill their dual role
of a mother and an employee when working remotely from home (Sullivan & Lewis,
2001, p.133; Leung & Zhang, 2016, p.386). Though Sullivan & Lewis (2001, p.125)
mention this could be because women are more likely to report domestic issues to be the
reason of desire to work remotely than men and are more prone to put family before their
work.
In their study, Sullivan & Lewis (2000, p.133) found that there was a clear distinction
between the motivation of working remotely for men and women. Men were more likely
to start working remotely for work and individual reasons, whereas women were more
likely to do so due to domestic reasons (Sullivan & Lewis, 2000, p.133). Çoban (2020,
p.242, 252) indicates that even though women are active participants of the workforce the
main responsibility of the housework still is on them, or if the responsibilities have been
divided equally women take the final responsibility. This supports the claim that women
have the main responsibility of the metawork of the domestic issues.
Sullivan & Lewis (2001, p.124) present in their article the new opportunities for
flexibility model, in which remote working is presented as an option to add more women
to the workforce when childcare and work are easier to combine. These factors do seem
to be appealing to some women as the research by Sullivan & Lewis (2001, p.130)
showed that the primary motivation for women to choose remote working was to combine
work with family life. According to Sullivan & Lewis (2001, p.125), oftentimes remote
working was viewed as the only option for women to combine work and family lives.
This view could be cultural and might not apply to Finland where affordable daycare is
available to all families.
While remote working has been promoted as a way to equalize work-family balance many
studies have shown it to also reinforce typical gender roles (Çoban, 2020, p.243).
According to Çoban (2022, p.243), remote working can also reinforce the work-family
44

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

conflict on women especially if they have a parental role. This was supported by
Kinnunen et al. (2006, p.152) who wrote that having children under seven years old
increases the likely hood of work-family conflict on women.
In their article, Kinnunen et al. (2006, p.153) wrote that Finnish women working in higher
white-collar jobs were more likely to suffer from work-family conflict than their male
counterparts. Kinnunen et al. (2006, p.150) also wrote that when women suffered from
the work-family conflict it had a negative correlation to their well-being and job
satisfaction, whereas similar findings were not found in men.
Çoban (2022, p.243-245) argues that remote working broadens traditional roles and
responsibilities of a woman, in such ways as childcare, housework, gendered family
structures, and time use. Remote working, therefore, makes the home and work domains’
border’s more permeable and reinforces the gender stereotypes in both domains.
According to Sullivan & Lewis (2001, pp.124-125), the exploitation model views remote
working as a way to exploit women by isolating them and having to submit to the
demands of the family and the employer. Çoban (2022, p.253) argues that remote working
has a risk of making women’s contributions to the organizations invisible, therefore might
alienate them from the job market. Though there seem to be issues in gender roles while
remote working the exploitation model does not take into consideration the free will of
women or women without children working remotely who do not have the same domestic
responsibilities as women with children might have.
Çoban (2022, p.248) discovered that women prefer remote working because it makes
borders in both work and family domains more flexible requiring for example less
physical effort from them. However, studies have found that women used the time saved
when working remotely to take care of family matters instead of personal needs or
recovery (Anderson & Kelliher, 2020, p.680; Çoban, 2022, p.248).
Sullivan & Lewis (2001, p.127) wrote that remote working women experienced less
work-family interference. Sullivan & Lewis (2001, p.136) found in their research that
men reported more often about the interference of the work domain to the family domain,
45

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

whereas women reported more often about the interference of the family domain to the
work domain. Çoban (2022, p.252-253) also states that remote working creates workfamily conflict more likely on women than on men and that it is more difficult for women
to reach work-life balance. Sullivan & Lewis (2001, p.127) wrote that remote working
women reported the occurrence of role conflict more often than their office working
counterparts.
When discussing the advantages of remote working though both genders highlighted
similar work-related advantages there seemed to be differences in advantages related to
family (Sullivan & Lewis, 2001, p.133). According to the research by Sullivan & Lewis
(2001, pp.133-134), women reported that remote working helps them to fulfill their
domestic role, whereas men reported that remote working helps them to be more involved
in domestic matters and spend more time with their families. To conclude, women use
remote working to be better mothers and employees whereas are men use remote working
to save time and be able to be involved at home. Though these findings are over twenty
years old similar remarks can be found from Çoban’s (2022) article. Still, both of the
articles report the view of women with children and neglect to report other views such as
single household female employees’ reasons to work remotely.
Remote working habits also seem to differ between men and women. Sullivan & Lewis
(2001, p.136) reported that women with children are more likely to use the flexibility
offered by remote working to ensure work-family balance. Whereas men and women
without children were more likely to work longer and put in extra hours when working
remotely (Sullivan & Lewis, 2001, p.136). Women have also been reported to be more
likely to multitask with their domestic and work tasks during their work hours than men
(Sullivan & Lewis; 2001, p.138; Craig & Churchill, 2020, p.68).
2.2.3

Remote working during COVID-19

The shift from office working to remote working at the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic came quickly and unannounced. Despite organizations’ efforts to have
acceleratingly digitalized processes, the pandemic took everyone by surprise. This meant
that employees and organizations were unprepared for the sudden remote working
46

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

(Carillo et al., 2020, pp.69-71). It has been a drastic change, requiring organizations and
individuals across the fields to adjust to new ways of working without much preparation
or adjustment period (Carillo et al., 2020, pp.71-72; De, Pandey & Pal, 2020, p.1; Bussin
& Swart-Opperman, 2021, p.2; Taser et al., 2022, p.3). Not only were organizations
missing a proper technical environment to enable remote working, but they were also
missing organizational culture and managerial tools to support remote working (Carillo
et al., 2020, pp.69-71).
Remote working was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic not only to ensure
social distancing but most importantly to ensure business continuity. It has been
considered the most efficient way to do so, according to Carillo et al. (2020, p.71). In the
research by Jacks (2021, p.94) new daily remote working model has been mentioned to
increase employee productivity in organizations. It could therefore be argued that it has
met the expectations set to it to ensure business continuity. However, it should be noted
that this has been true for only those organizations where remote working is possible,
mostly organizations employing white-collar workers (Jacks, 2021, p.94).
When considering how does remote working before the pandemic differs from remote
working during the pandemic, one of the main differences, according to Carillo et al.
(2020, p.70), is flexibility. The flexibility is missing from both, the flexibility to choose
a working location and the flexibility to choose one’s working hours (Anderson &
Kelliher, 2020, p.678; Carillo et al., 2020, pp.70-72;). Due to lockdowns and travel
restrictions, it is a lot more difficult to work remotely from other locations than your
home. Working hours for remote working are now more or less the typical office hours
and require full-time attendance due to schedules of online meetings. The most obvious
difference between remote working before the pandemic and during the pandemic is the
flexibility to choose to or choose not to work remotely. According to Anderson & Kelliher
(2020, p.679), due to this reason employees feel less of the psychological benefits such
as a sense of autonomy when working remotely during the pandemic.
The uniqueness of the COVID-19 remote working conditions, compared to previous
remote working conditions, is related to the additional stress caused to employees by the
47

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

uncertainty of their health, safety, economic situation concerning the future of their
employment (Carillo et al., 2020, p.71; Bussin & Swart-Opperman, 2021, p.2). However,
it does not only limit to these.
As Jacks (2021, p.96) remarks remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic is a
shared experience, which every individual experiences in their own way due to situational
differences. Lockdown measures in some countries and closure of schools and daycare
centers meant some employees have had to juggle between taking care of their domestic
and work tasks simultaneously. Anderson & Kelliher (2020, p.678) indicate that all of a
sudden parents become teachers on top of their employee duties, having to multitask
between ensuring their children’s education and their work. These measures have
interfered with people’s daily routines and blurred the lines between work and family
lives (Gabr et al., 2021).
Additional problems and stressors on employees created by the sudden remote working
have been the inability to find suitable working space at home, lack of needed equipment,
and having to be responsible for the reliability of the internet connection (Anderson &
Kelliher, 2020, p.678). Though some elements of remote working during the COVID-19
pandemic have elevated employees’ stress levels others have reduced them. Craig &
Churchill (2020, p.76) report that time-related stress and pressure amongst the employees
have reduced during the pandemic due to saving time from commuting and taking
children to their activities as well as due to increased flexibility at work.
Carillo et al. (2020) studied French employees’ adjustment to remote working during the
COVID-19 pandemic. They (Carillo et al., 2020, p.78) found that one of the main
obstacles for adjustment to remote working was the lack of professional social
interactions, creating feelings of professional isolation. The COVID-19 has changed the
work culture. Coworkers are no longer concrete human beings but voices, pictures, and
videos on devices.
The serendipitous conversations with coworkers, informal conversations, personal
feedback, pre and post meeting small talk, and accidental encounters with coworkers from
48

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

different departments are all missing when people work by themselves at home. (Carillo
et al., 2020, p.78; Jacks, 2021, p.94). The organizations have tried to tackle this issue by
offering for example virtual “open door” hours where employees can reach out to their
managers or executives for discussion (Jacks, 2021, p.94). Carillo et al. (2020, p.80)
suggest that organizations should consider offering their employees personal support and
monitoring to help employees with the adjustment to remote work.
According to the research by Carillo et al. (2020, pp.78-79), remote working conditions
were found to be the second important factor for adjusting to remote work. The remote
working conditions here refer to both external working conditions such as working tools
and remote working environment, as well as internal conditions such as mental state, selfmanagement skills, and work-life balance skills. In their research, Carillo et al. (2020,
p.79) determined stress as one of the most important factors influencing adjustment to
remote work, especially in a crisis. According to Carillo et al. (2020, p.80), stress can
negatively affect a person’s capability to adapt to changing circumstances, and therefore
requires special attention from management to help them adapt. Having previous remote
working experience was found by Carillo et al. (2020, p.80) to have a positive influence
on adjusting to remote work. Overall, it is suggested by Carillo et al. (2020, p.80) that
time and experience are the best tools to adjust to remote work, employees become more
and more adjusted to remote working the longer they work remotely.
Carillo et al. (2020, p.71) found that during the COVID-19 pandemic it has become harder
for individuals to balance their work and family lives, increasing the chance of workfamily conflict. According to Craig & Churchill (2020, p.75), the COVID-19 has
disrupted the work patterns and increased the burden of domestic work on employees.
Craig & Churchill (2020, p.77) found that especially female employees have experienced
increased work-family conflict during the pandemic. In the study by Çoban (2022, p.249)
it was argued that during the COVID-19 pandemic the stereotypical domestic roles have
been reinforced and women have been distanced from their career and professional
identities. Çoban (2022, p.250) explains that this could be due to the unevenly divided
domestic workload during the pandemic, which was also discovered in the study. Due to

49

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

these reasons, women have found remote working to be highly inefficient during the
pandemic (Çoban, 2022, p.251).
However, these findings can be very cultural. Çoban’s study was conducted in Turkey
whereas Craig & Churchill conducted their study in Australia and found bit differing
results. Though Craig & Churchill (2020, p.75) had found that the amount of domestic
work on women had increased so had it on men and the gender gap had narrowed during
the pandemic. It should be still noted that women’s domestic work had increased
significantly more than men’s (Craig & Churchill, 2020, p.75). In conclusion, remote
working during the COVID-19 pandemic has deepened the work-family conflict on
women and made the family domain more permeable to the work domain. Gabir et al.
(2021) suggest that employees should try to be very strict with their working hours and
schedule and ensure to maintain the borders between their work and family lives.
Employees should also, if possible, try to arrange dedicated working space in their homes
to improve their working conditions and to dedicate a place for work (Gabr et al., 2021).
When it comes to general support most usually offered by the organizations, such as
training on how to remote working tools, Carillo et al. (2020, p.80) found that it did not
support employees’ adjustment to remote work. Though this does not mean that it is not
important for organizations to offer this kind of support in the future. These measures
might not affect adjusting to remote working but can ensure a healthy remote working
environment in the organization.
In fact, to ensure healthy remote working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic for
their employees, and to ensure the right kind of remote working skills, Gabr et al. (2021)
suggest that organizations should increase the amount of work skills training provided to
their employees and provide responsive IT support. As the circumstances during the
pandemic are very unique and new to all employees, a supportive atmosphere is also
needed. Gabr et al. (2021) therefore suggest that organizations should in addition to all
other supportive measures send motivational messages to their employees to inspire and
encourage them during these times.

50

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

Remote working during the pandemic has also had its weaknesses from the organizational
standpoint. Similar benefits and gains provided by remote working cannot be expected
by the organizations as the circumstances have changed the nature of remote working,
where remote working is not a chosen working form for the majority of the employees
(Anderson & Kelliher, 2020, p.681). For example, employees are not as committed to
their organization as they would be when choosing to work remotely (Anderson &
Kelliher, 2020, p.681). Organizations also have to battle with employees’ emotional
distress, the uncertainty of the available workforce, as well as financial struggles and
uncertainty of the sustainability of the business the slowing global trade, might cause
(Bussin & Swart-Opperman, 2021, p.2).
Organizations have also all of a sudden been geographically divided to several locations
not chosen by them. As Jacks (2021, p.94) highlights it is hard for organizations to ensure
proper infrastructure in the areas where their employees remote working areas. Therefore,
it is a lot more difficult for organizations to prepare for possible natural disasters or other
occurrences, which affect internet or power connections. Gabr et al. (2021) found in their
study that living in rural areas and having to deal with poor internet connection increased
the risk of mental distress and especially technostress on employees.
The pandemic and the introduction of technologies, and daily remote working for all
capable, have started to transform the organizations and the transformation will most
likely not stop to the pandemic but will continue in the future (Jacks, 2021, p.93).
Organizations need to prepare that there is no going back to “normal” as the nature of
work has already changed (Carillo et al.,2020, p.82). According to Carillo et al. (2020,
p.82), it is important that organizations will consider remote working in their future
business continuity plans and will reflect its constraints in both physical and virtual
environments.
After the national remote working recommendations are lifted organizations will most
likely face resistance from their employees not wanting to return to full-time office work.
De et al. (2020, p.4) suggest that organizations should be prepared to and understand that
resistance to change is a normal coping mechanism for people and therefore, focus their
51

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

energy on managing the change and supporting their employees through it. According to
Anderson & Kelliher (2020, p.681), organizations should focus on their duty to care for
their employees’ well-being and not make unnecessary changes to their remote working
guidelines and policies without evidence supporting it. Therefore, it is important to
understand that since the start of the pandemic remote working has become the norm
around the world and it simple is “just” work (Bussin & Swart-Opperman, 2021, p.3;
Jacks, 2021, p.93).

2.3 Technostress in remote working
Remote working is during the COVID-19 pandemic main form of working for a majority
of knowledge workers. Therefore, it is no wonder that academic research has studied this
phenomenon through its advantages, and disadvantages. According to Carillo et al. (2020,
p.70), the most recent research on remote working has been focusing on the stress aspect
of remote work, moreover technostress caused by remote working. This is because remote
working seems to be an ideal environment for technostress and to study technostress
(Carillo et al., 2020, p.70). As we have previously learned, remote working limits the
availability of organizational support and technostress inhibitors to the employee. This
requires more independence and IT skills from the employees to handle the new digital
tools related to working remotely. Hence employees are more vulnerable to the technostressors and their negative effects.
Many aspects of remote working can increase the likelihood of technostress in remote
work. In their article, De et al. (2020, p.2) suggest that remote working can increase
technostress through an employee having to be available at all times and an employee
having the feeling of being monitored while working remotely. Leung & Zhang (2017,
p.394) suggest in their article, that the more intense remote working is to an individual
the more likely they are to suffer from technostress. Gabr et al. (2021) note in their
research, that technostress in remote working is caused by both external and internal risk
factors, and the likelihood is affected by individual characteristics. In their (Gabr et al.,
2021) study, they found that the most significant risk factors, which cause technostress
were individual characteristics such as gender and age, and external factors such as the
quality of the internet connection.
52

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

Organizational attitudes, hierarchies, and policies can also affect the likelihood of
technostress in remote work. Spagnoli et al. (2021, p.06) found that in those organizations
where hierarchy concerning remote working was high employees were more likely to
suffer from technostress. Leung & Zhang (2017) studied this issue from the opposite
direction and had similar findings to Spagnoli et al. (2020). They (Leung & Zhang (2017,
p.394) found that in the organizations where policies related to remote working were
flexible their employees were less likely to suffer from technostress. Hence, employees
who are given the freedom and autonomy are more likely to find more suitable ways of
working and are better equipped to combine work and family lives, which mitigate the
risk of technostress.
Molino et al. (2020, p.13) found a significant correlation between remote working and
techno-stressors in their study. They (Molino et al., 2020, p.13) found that when working
remotely employees were exposed to techno-overload and techno-invasion. De et al.
(2020, p.02) suggest that factors such as having to constantly learn new technologies,
being constantly available, being in front of digital devices for hours, and increased
multitasking increase technostress in remote work. The factors described by De et al.
(2020) support Molino et al.’s (2020) findings as the mentioned factors are characteristics
of techno-overload and techno-invasion. Leung & Zhang (2017, p.394) further suggest
that the more permeable the work domain is the more likely are individuals to suffer from
techno-overload and techno-invasion, as the high permeability increases the intrusion of
work to their recovery time.
When work is done at home environment work-family borders are put to test and workfamily conflict is inevitable. Work-family conflict can both be a cause of technostress as
well as be a symptom of technostress. Molino et al. (2020, p.13) found in their study that
techno-stressors, especially techno-invasion, can increase work-family conflict in remote
work. These findings supported the view of technostress being the cause of work-family
conflict. Whereas Leung & Zhang (2017, p.394) found that work-family conflict is the
primary cause of techno-overload and techno-invasion. This would support the claim that
work-family conflict can also cause or be a source of technostress when combined with
the right kind of circumstances. Technostress and work-family conflict may also both be
53

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

negative effects of remote work. As Riglea et al. (2021 p.133) reported, those individuals
who experienced techno-invasion during the remote working also were more likely to
experience work-family conflict. They (Riglea et al., 2021, p.135) also found that when
an employee’s mental well-being is low, the more likely is techno-overload to affect them
and hence create more work-family conflict in remote work.
Remote working and technostress may have several consequences. Riglea et al. (2021,
p.135) found in their study that employees’ mental well-being had been negatively
affected by remote working and technostress. Studies (Oksanen et al., 2021, p.03) have
also reported findings of technostrains especially fatigue during remote work.
Technostress in remote working has also been linked to other psychological issues. Taser
et al. (2022, p.06) found that those employees who suffered from technostress were also
more likely to feel lonely and suffered from social isolation.
When considering the factors to help mitigate technostress in remote working previously
presented techno inhibitors would seem to be important remotely as well. Oksanen et al.
(2021, p.07) found that techno inhibitors and individual characteristics helped to mitigate
the occurrence of technostress during the shift to remote working. Employees with high
IT skills and computer confidence were less likely to suffer from technostress during
remote working (Oksanen et al., 2021, p.08). Technostress inhibitors do not seem to help
with just technostress but with other negative aspects of remote working as well. Oksanen
et al. (2021, p.08) found in their study that technostress inhibitors such as training and
increased computer confidence helped employees to manage work-family conflict better.
Though aspects of social support are limited during remote working employees can try to
utilize other kinds of coping mechanisms. Taser et al. (2022, p.6) found in their research
that employees who enjoyed working remotely were less likely to suffer from
technostress. This would suggest that these employees have positive attitudes towards the
ICTs and towards improving their IT skills. These are part of the positive interpretation
coping mechanism, which has been found by Tarafdar et al. (2020, p.86) to be one of the
coping mechanisms to technostress. The positive interpretation is one of the proactive

54

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

coping mechanisms, which have been found to be the most effective mechanisms to cope
with technostress and alleviate their negative effects.
Remote working seems to be an ideal environment to technostress as it limits many of the
techno inhibitors. This requires organizations to find new kinds of ways to support their
employees’ well-being at work and to consider the personal differences of their
employees.

RESEARCH METHODS

In this chapter, the research and data collection methods and the process used to conduct
this research are reviewed, furthermore, the reasons for choosing these methods are
explained. In this research, qualitative methods were used to study the technostress
phenomenon. Tarafdar et al. (2019, pp.11-12) argue that technostress is a process or
phenomenon, due to which it is not something that can be measured but something that
can be assessed through different kinds of aspects and variables. According to Adams,
Khan, & Raeside (2007, p.6), qualitative research uses data collection and analysis
methods to study a phenomenon by describing the experiences of the study subjects. For
these reasons, qualitative methods were viewed as the more suitable method to study
technostress.
Researchers (Gabr et al., 2021; Spagnoli et al., 2020) have recently studied technostress
on remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic mainly by using quantitative
methods and surveys. Hence, recent research has been lacking qualitative research, which
can better capture the experiences of individuals. Technostress is a personal experience,
which can be suffered from various reasons based on the person’s individual experiences
and conditions. For this reason, it is important to capture the experiences of remote
workers and to deepen the knowledge about technostress experiences. Adams et al. (2007,
p. 6) remark that qualitative methods offer diverse methods for capturing both the health
and well-being as well as the daily domestic and professional lives of the study subjects.

3.1 Data collection methods
Tuomi & Sarajärvi (2018) suggest that when studying a person’s behavior or intentions,
the most suitable method for data collection is through questions. The best way to
understand how a person is feeling or why they choose to behave in a specific manner
than by asking them directly (Tuomi & Sarajärvi, 2018). According to Adams et al. (2007,
p. 97), interviews provide qualitative data, which offers in-depth material to understand
subjects’ behavior and feelings. Tuomi & Sarajärvi (2018) remark that one of the benefits
of the interview is its flexibility. An interview provides the possibility to repeat or clarify
questions to the subject (Tuomi & Sarajärvi, 2018). Subjects are able to provide longer
56

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

and more in-depth answers even to simple questions, and questions can be asked in any
order if similar topics come up in the subject’s answers (Tuomi & Sarajärvi, 2018).
According to Tuomi & Sarajärvi (2018), an interview is a social event, it, therefore,
eliminates a feeling of being tested, which is usual to a survey, and relieves the subject of
having to answer in a specific way to provide the right answer. Tuomi & Sarajärvi (2018)
also indicate that an interview provides a possibility for the researcher to act not only as
a researcher but as an observer as well. The researcher can make observations about the
subject’s body language during their answer or from the tones, in which the answer was
given (Tuomi & Sarajärvi, 2018). An additional benefit of an interview, according to
Tuomi & Sarajärvi (2018), is the researcher’s ability to choose the subjects and ensure
that they fit the requirements of the study.
A semi-structured interview is an interview, which follows an agreed theme or path with
a set of predetermined questions, to which the interviewer may add additional questions
if clarification is required (Adams et al., 2007 p. 144; Tuomi & Sarajärvi, 2018). A semistructured interview may include both open and close-ended questions to provide both
factual data from the subject (for example basic information about the subject, age, level
of experience, or how many digital tools they use while working) and attitudinal data (for
example subject’s attitudes towards the researched subject, what they think about digital
tools) (McNeill & Chapman, 2005, p. 57). The purpose of semi-structured interviews,
according to Tuomi & Sarajärvi (2018), is most often to gather data to describe a specific
theme or phenomenon. For the reasons presented, interviews were chosen as the data
collection method, semi-structured interviews more specifically. Based on the
information found, semi-structured interviews were defined to be the most suitable
interviewing method to answer the defined research questions.
McNeill & Chapman (2005, p.19) remark that there should be a trusting relationship
between the researcher and the subjects studied. This relationship enables the researcher
to make true observations from subjects’ lives (McNeill & Chapman, 2005, p. 19). Adams
et al. (2007, p.148) indicate, that one of the key factors to be able to minimize errors and
biases is to know and understand subjects’ social context and motivate the subjects to

57

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

respond to the questions. In order to achieve this level of relationship, the subjects were
recruited from the researcher’s professional network.

3.1.1

Preparations for the data collection phase

At the beginning of this study, ten female knowledge workers working in different
positions in the private, public and third sector organizations in Finland were recruited.
In the end, eight interviews were conducted. This was due to unforeseeable circumstances
with two recruited subjects. However, after reviewing data collected from the eight
conducted interviews it was noticeable that saturation had already been reached. For this
reason, it was determined that there was no need to recruit more subjects. Hence eight
interviews were sufficient for the purpose of the research. According to Tuomi &
Sarajärvi (2018), saturation means a situation where subjects are not giving the researcher
new data and the data start to become repetitive. The subjects’ ages ranged from 31 to
56 years old to cover a wide range of views, capabilities, and conditions.
Interview questions (Appendix 1.) were formulated as mostly open-ended questions or if
the question was not open-ended it included an additional question to give the subject a
chance to specify. Interview questions were formulated around remote working and not
technostress to ensure the subjects felt like they were the experts of the discussion and it
was easy for them to discuss. Interview questions were related to subjects’ remote
working experiences before the pandemic and during the pandemic, the typical remote
workday of the subject, the attitudes in the organization towards the remote working,
what subjects missed from office work, number of digital tools subjects were using, how
they perceived them and whether the number of tools had increased during the pandemic.
Subjects were also asked, which measures they take to recover after the workday, whether
or not they had felt an increased need since the start of the pandemic to discuss work after
work hours.

3.1.2

The data collection phase

The interviews were conducted during December 2021 and January 2022. A pilot
interview was first conducted to test out the interview questions and see how long the
58

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

interviews would be. After the pilot interview, some interview questions were added and
defined to be better understood. In the beginning, there were ten interview questions but
after the pilot interview, there were thirteen. The results from the pilot interview were
used in this research such as the results from other interviews. According to Tuomi &
Sarajärvi (2018), the interview questions should be provided well in advance, in order to
obtain as much information out of the subjects as possible. Following this advice, the
interview questions were provided to the subjects approximately one week before the
interview. The subjects were also asked for their informed consent, about which a form
was sent to them prior to the interview. Informed consent form presented the subjects
their rights and assurance that all of the collected data from the interviews would be
anonymized and the subjects could not be identified from the research.
All eight interviews were conducted using the Zoom video conference application.
Before the Zoom calls, the subjects were asked to take a picture of their usual remote
working station. Seven of the subjects were able the send a picture from their workstation.
Out of eight interviews, six of the subjects felt comfortable, or technically possible for
them, to have their camera on during the interview. Therefore, it was possible to inspect
six of the subjects’ body language and micro-expressions during the interview. The
interviews lasted from 20 to 30 minutes. The interviews were recorded using the Zoom
application’s recording functionality. After each interview, the recordings were
transcribed using the Office365 Word online application.

3.1.3

The subjects

Eight subjects interviewed were between the ages of 31 to 56. The educational
background of the subjects was equally divided between a highly educated and those who
had vocational education. Exactly half of the subjects had a higher education background,
bachelor’s degree or higher, and half had a vocational education background. The subjects
represented different kinds of households from single households to adult households
with adult children not living at home. Almost half of the subjects represented a
household of two adults with no children. A quarter of the subjects represented a
household of two adults with children living at home. In addition, half of the subjects
mentioned that they had pets in the household as well.
59

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

All eight of the subjects worked in different organizations. The organizations, in which
the subjects worked, covered most of the sectors and sizes. The majority of the subjects
worked in a private sector organization but a public sector and a third sector were also
represented. The subjects were evenly representing all sizes of organizations from a
micro-organization to a large international organization, almost half of the subjects were
from a midsize organization.

3.2 Data analysis methods and phase
The process of analyzing the qualitative data, according to Ryan & Bernard (2003, p.85),
requires four steps: (1) finding themes, (2) choosing the most important themes, (3)
building hierarchies, and (4) linking discovered themes into a chosen theoretical
framework. Ryan & Bernard (2003, p.87) define a theme as “ a fundamental concept we
are trying to describe”. To follow the described analysis process thematic grouping and
theory-guided content analysis were chosen as the data analysis methods for this research.
Thematic grouping was chosen as a method, as it provides a good method to analyze and
group large data sets and helps to categorize various data. Theory-guided content analysis
was chosen as a method as it provides freedom to analyze the data as it is and gives it the
main focus while drawing similarities from the theoretical frameworks.
A thematic grouping, according to Juhila (2021), is a process of organizing the collected
data into themes, which will help a researcher to answer the predetermined research
questions. Saldaña (2011, p.108) states that the themes’ purpose is to summarize both the
apparent and the underlying data. A thematic grouping can be used as a part of the content
analysis process, where it takes place prior to content analysis to help organize the data
(Tuomi & Sarajärvi, 2018). Juhila (2021) wrote, that the themes created during the
grouping are not predefined but emerge during the grouping phase. Ryan & Bernard
(2003, p.88) say that the themes are drawn from the data as well as from the theoretical
frameworks studied prior to the analysis. These theory-based themes can be a theoretical
definition or for example defined characteristics of the studied phenomenon (Ryan &
Bernard, 2003, p.88). After recognizing the themes, they can be categorized or listed in
the main themes and the sub-themes (Saldaña, 2011, p.108). According to Juhila (2021),
60

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

it should be also noted that the themes are frequently emerging concepts from all of the
collected data and cannot be determined from a single interview data alone.
According to Tuomi & Sarajärvi (2019), a theory-guided analysis means an analysis
method where collected data are analyzed based on its content, after which themes from
theory are introduced as a guide to help the analysis and to guide the result in the right
direction. As the purpose of this research was to collect experiences and analyze those,
the theory-guided analysis seemed the most appropriate method of analysis. The theoryguided analysis gives room for the collected data to be examined and to be reflected or
compared against the theoretical framework. According to Tuomi & Sarajärvi (2019), the
meaning of the theory-guided analysis is not to test the theory but to show the meaning
of the data in the analysis and to bring up new ideas when comparing the theory and the
collected data. This notion of theory-guided analysis highlights the suitability of the
analysis method in this research as the current research of technostress does not include
enough theoretical framework about women and technostress.

The theory-guided

approach gives the researcher more freedom to choose how to collect the data and how
to interpret the studied phenomenon (Tuomi & Sarajärvi, 2018).
Thematic grouping was done by using the Office365 Excel application. Each of the
interview questions had its row, on which themes raising from the interview answers were
added. Each of the interview questions and the answers were analyzed one by one, by
writing down themes rising from each answer. After each answer had been analyzed the
number of the same themes were calculated and the most often occurring themes were
placed on the left of the row continuing so that the least occurring themes were on the
right side of the row. After each of the questions was analyzed, similar themes occurring
from all the questions were found. The main themes found will be discussed in chapter
five.

EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK

In this chapter, the collected empirical data will be reviewed and presented. The chapter
will create the empirical framework for this research. The review consists of six parts,
which view the data from different angles such as subjects’ personal experiences,
organization attitudes, digital tools, and recovery.
All of the subjects had daily remote working experience at least six months since March
2020. Most of the subjects had worked remotely nonstop since spring 2020. All of the
subjects worked remotely from their homes. Three of the subjects had a separate room in
their home, which they use for working only. Half of the subjects had a designated
workstation, which they used daily. This workstation included for example a desk, a dock,
and an additional monitor in addition to their laptops. The other half of the subjects were
using only their laptops to work and worked from different locations in their homes such
as over a kitchen table or a counter or from a sofa. All of the subjects’ main form of
working remotely is by using one or several digital applications and software to perform
their tasks and to communicate with their coworkers.
Almost all of the subjects had some kind of remote working experience before the
pandemic. Half of the subjects had worked remotely regularly before the pandemic, three
had occasional remote working experience and one had no previous remote working
experience. The subjects described that before the pandemic remote working was
reserved for those days, on which they worked on tasks, which required concertation.
The subjects also mention that before the pandemic they used remote working opportunity
if they had a sick child or a pet at home. Other reasons why the remote working
opportunity was used before the pandemic was to run errands during the workday or to
give flexibility for traveling. Many of the subjects mentioned that before the pandemic
remote working was seen as a perk.

4.1 Remote working experience during the pandemic
Though transferring to daily remote working came as a shock to many of the subjects, it
was often mentioned how easy it was after all and how surprisingly well tasks could be
62

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

done outside of the office. Some of the subjects remarked that it took some time to adapt
to daily remote working. The subjects found it especially difficult to adapt to the silence
of a home office and to find the right kind of routine for remote working.
Two of the subjects also mentioned that daily remote working had changed their working
rhythm. These subjects said that their workload is now much more uneven and work
comes in cycles, where on some days they have barely any work and on some, they have
too much work. Several of the subjects also mentioned that their workdays are now filled
with meetings and they have barely any time for their “actual work” as they describe it.
One of the subjects described the situation as follows: “Before remote working was
something special. You knew you could work efficiently that day and get things done. But
now remote working means I sit at home alone with headphones on jumping from meeting
to meeting the whole day”.
Almost all of the subjects had enjoyed working remotely and would wish to continue
working remotely at least a couple of days a week in the future. The subjects said that
they enjoyed remote working because it gives them more free time due to the reasons
such as not having to commute to work. What was most disliked about the remote
working between the subjects was the loneliness during remote working and the feeling
of being an outsider in the work community.
Most of the subjects mentioned that at the beginning of the daily remote working they
felt anxiety and pressure to show their work. The subjects were unsure their organization
could recognize their value and hard work when working remotely. As the knowledge
workers’ work is not always concrete or measurable, they felt there was pressure to leave
some kind of digital proof of their work. These feelings of pressure were described by
one of the subjects: “At the beginning, there was a pressure to give an impression of
working extra hard so no one would think that you were just slacking at home”. These
feelings of pressure were specially mentioned more than once by those whose
organization had previously had high bureaucracy related to remote working. One of the
subjects who had changed organizations after the COVID-19 pandemic started said she
was experiencing these same feelings of pressure again in the new organization. She said
63

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

the situation was now even more difficult as she did not know her coworkers and was still
learning about the job itself.
The same subjects, who reported their work had changed to be unevenly disturbed also
reported that at the beginning they felt anxiety and guilt for this unevenness. One subject
described her feelings as follows: “There are long times when I have a lot to do and then
long times when I have barely anything to do. In the beginning, I was all of a sudden lost
with myself and I felt bad about it. I was on my work computer but I was not working.”
The subjects said that these feelings have eased since the start of the daily remote working
thanks to the help of their coworkers and managers. They reported that discussing these
issues with their coworkers and finding out that others had similar problems and that
managers were okay about it helped.
When describing their usual remote working day almost half of the subjects mentioned
that they check their work emails almost immediately when they wake up. Half of the
subjects had some kind of daily routines, which they performed before starting their
workday but the other half performed these routines while working. Many of the subjects
said that their remote workday doesn’t differ from their typical workday at the office.
“Typical remote workday is pretty much the same as typical workday” as said by one of
the subjects. Some of the things that were mentioned by the subjects as a new addition to
workdays while working remotely are the different messaging channels, which they now
have to follow more intensely.
Some of the subjects remarked that their work is now more hectic and fuller than when
they worked in the office. Their calendars are filled with meetings and they have to start
their day earlier to be able to get other things done before the first meeting of the day
starts. For this reason, it was difficult for these subjects to have breaks during the day.
Other subjects also mentioned that having breaks was more of an effort than when
working from the office. One of the subjects described the current situation in the
following way: “You have to be a lot more mindful about your breaks when you work
from home. It is a lot easier to immerse yourself to work and focus on the task at hand
64

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

when you are alone.” Some of the subjects also said it was especially difficult to take a
break from their device, they said that previously breaks meant talking with someone or
walking somewhere to have a cup of coffee now it meant reading an online newspaper.
Lunch break, however, was something that all of the subjects seemed to value and said
they never forget to have. They also remarked that they ate lunch away from their work
devices.
Many of the subjects said that during remote working they are more mindful of the length
of their workday. Though remote working allowed them the flexibility to combine work
and home tasks many of them were keen on making sure the two domains were in balance.
Many of them mentioned that they try to ensure they do not work longer than the required
eight hours. “I am very strict when it comes to the length of my workday. But it goes both
ways, if I have some errands to run during my remote workday of course then I make sure
to work those hours in” as the circumstances were described by one of the subjects.

4.2 Remote working on the organizational level
The majority of the organizations, where the subjects worked, had a positive attitude
towards remote working. The employees were encouraged to work remotely and there
was no pressure to return to office work. However, many of the subjects said this was not
the case before the pandemic. Before the pandemic, many organizations had strict rules
and bureaucracy for remote work. Some of the examples the subjects gave of these were
having to explain what they were going to do during the remote workday and reporting
back what was accomplished during the remote workday. Some of the subjects also
mentioned that there used to be different kinds of rules for different employees and these
were based on what kind of attitudes and views their managers had for remote working.
Almost half of the subjects said their organization had already set rules for hybrid work
in the future, which they felt was a positive thing. Those subjects, where their
organizations had not set any rules, seemed to be most worried about the possibility to
work remotely in the future. When the subjects talked about their organizations’ attitudes
many of them seemed to be worried that the attitudes would change back to what it used
to be after general recommendations to work remotely are lifted. They seem to have
65

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

sensed this from what their managers had said and believed that the pressure to return to
office working was rising. Almost half of the subjects mentioned that since the pandemic
their organizations had downsized their office space. The subjects seemed to think this
was a sign remote working possibility would continue in the future.
The organizations where the subjects worked offered a variety of support for their
employees. Some of the organizations were more active in this department than others.
The usual support, which the subjects mentioned was the tools for working, such as
additional monitors, headphones, etc. One of the organizations offered money for their
employees to use to improve their work ergonomics at home for example to purchase a
desk or a chair. A couple of the organizations offered their employees the possibility to
obtain additional work ergonomic products such as footrests.
The organizations also offered webinars and self-training material, which were available
for a couple of the subjects. These were for example about learning to use the office
applications, about time- or self-management, or generally about well-being at remote
work. Some of the organizations also offered the usual technical support to ensure the
applications worked correctly from home. One of the subjects mentioned at the beginning
of the pandemic there was a dedicated team available to help them with any questions
related to learning their new remote tools and applications.
In some of the subjects’ organizations, informal activities for their employees were also
organized to keep up the company spirit. For example, some had organized virtual after
works like wine tasting or Christmas parties where all the employees were sent supplies
for the activity beforehand. One organization had an outdoor day where all employees
were encouraged to leave work things aside and go spend a day outside. These kinds of
informal activities were most often offered and organized by the midsize or the large
organizations.
Half of the subjects mentioned that they had got some form of personal support from their
manager. This could be as simple as video calls every once in a while, or organized group
virtual coffee breaks. Interestingly, this kind of personal support was something that was
66

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

most missed by the subjects. Some of the subjects had not been contacted once by their
manager to ask how they were doing since the daily remote working started in spring
2020.
Many of the subjects remarked that remote working was a more personal experience than
working from the office as everyone’s skills, personalities, and home situations differed
so much. One of the subjects was especially worried about the lack of personal support
for the employees: “I think managers should stop to discuss individually with all of their
employees and see how they are actually doing. It is a fact that not everyone is doing so
well by themselves and they should be offered personal support if not by the manager,
then by the work psychologist.” Especially at the beginning many of the subjects would
have hoped that their managers would have supported them with the transition to remote
work.
The organization-level actions were also hoped for by the subjects. Many of the subjects
hoped that their organizations would have offered more communal activities to help keep
up the coworking spirit. Both unformal, such as virtual coffee breaks, and formal
activities, meetings with cameras on, were wished. Some of the subjects also mentioned
the lack of remote working rules, especially concerning the meetings made their remote
workdays more difficult. They would have hopes for organization-level rules for example
for the length of the meetings and meeting free times to be able to have breaks during the
day and ease their workload.

4.3 Disadvantages of working remotely
Social interactions and coworkers were clear winners when discussing with the subjects
what was missed most from the office work. All of the subjects said they missed social
interactions and companions during their lunch breaks. Other themes, related to social
interactions, rising from their answers were spontaneous interactions and sparring with
their coworkers.
Most of the subjects said there was a lack of honest conversations with their coworkers
and they missed the easiness of “just asking” questions from their coworkers. They felt
67

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

like the meetings were now more formal than previously, as these did not include the pre
or post meeting discussions with coworkers. Many of the subjects said that the feeling of
being part of a work community had suffered during the daily remote working period.
These subjects mentioned it was a lot harder to know what the general atmosphere
amongst the coworkers was than previously.
The discussions about work with coworkers, according to the subjects, had decreased
significantly and especially the spontaneous discussions as well as complaining about
work with their coworkers. As these discussions were missing it was reported by many
of the subjects that dwelling on work issues had increased. Some of the subjects also
reported that these discussions had now transferred from work to home. These subjects
reported that they had noticed a rising need to discuss these issues with someone in person
and most often it was the spouse who they discussed with. Some reported that these
discussions about work were had in their free time if a spouse was not working remotely
as well.
The subjects reported that they had noticed in general that they talked about work-related
issues more often now during their free time. Some said they talked about work less now
during their free time since their spouse was also working remotely and therefore these
discussions could be had during work hours. Some of the subjects said they had noticed
that now if they saw their coworkers in their free time the discussions would more often
shift to work than before the pandemic. One of the subjects remarked, she felt like there
was less need to talk about work in her free time, as all of the social interactions with her
coworkers were missing the work did not bother her as much as before. Those subjects
who said contacting their coworkers was easy and they had a trusted coworker to turn to
seemed to have less need to discuss work in their free time.
Some of the subjects mentioned that they felt like the information flow had suffered
during the remote working period. According to these subjects, it was a lot harder for
them to know what was going on outside of their work team. Previously they had had a
good sense of the general state of the organization and its many teams but now they only
knew their team’s matters. This seemed to be an issue in small and midsize organizations
68

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

where general information channels were lacking or not used actively. One of the subjects
described the situation as follows “We have a small organization with two teams. Before
I knew in general what was going on in the organization and I was also interested in
knowing. Now it is a lot harder and I feel disconnected from the organization”. Many of
the subjects also felt that, due to personnel changes, it was harder to know who was
working for their organization and who were not or what coworkers’ tasks nowadays
were.

4.4 Remote working and digital tools
When discussing the digital tools one common application was mentioned by all of the
subjects, Microsoft’s Teams. For most of the subjects, the Teams was a common tool
already before the pandemic but a couple of subjects said they started using it only after
the daily remote working started. The subjects felt like they had been given a proper
induction to use the Teams and they were comfortable using it. The Teams was utilized
in a variety of different ways in the organizations. Some of the organizations used all of
its functionalities, such as workgroups, chats, and document sharing, but many seemed to
use it for virtual meetings and calls only. In fact, some of these subjects who said it was
used for meetings only seemed a bit ashamed they did not utilize the application more.
The chat functionality of the Teams especially was used and viewed in very different
ways amongst the subjects. Some of the subjects said they used it often to contact their
coworkers and felt like it was easy to do so. They even had informal conversations or
group chats. Then there were those subjects who did not feel comfortable using chats as
a means of informal communication. They mentioned that they did not feel comfortable
with the idea that their conversations would be available later on in writing and they
would rather just call their coworkers. This suspicion and negative attitude towards chats
can be well seen from one of the subject’s answers: “I don’t feel comfortable with these
digital channels because they leave a print. If I write something negative about our
organization to my coworker it leaves a print forever somewhere in the cloud for anyone
to see later and it can be traced back to me.”

daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

4.5 Recovering after the remote workday
According to almost all of the subjects, the best way to recover from work was by hiding
their work computer out of sight. Those subjects who had a separate home office reported
that they closed the door after their workday ended and did not use the room for other
purposes. One of the subjects described the distinction she had made with her home office
and the rest of her home as follows: “My home office allows me to feel like I am leaving
work and stepping into a whole other environment. Just like I would leave all my things
at the actual office I leave those things to my home office. When I step out of there that is
when my free time starts”.
Those subjects who did not have a separate office said they collected all of their work
tools and hid them out of sight after their workday ended. They said they would much
rather build their workstation every day than look at their work computer and have the
work follow them in their free time. One of the subjects said she felt like the benefits of
not having a permanent workstation overruled having a workstation: “Overall I always
try to hide my work stuff after I finish. I do not want to have a desk in my living room
although I know that for work ergonomic it would be smarter. But I do not want to have
a desk there in the middle of my apartment to remind me of work constantly. Out of sight
out of mind”. For those subjects who were not able to hide their work station, for example,
it was located in their living room or bedroom, said it was especially difficult to recover
from work. One of them reported that when she had her workstation in her bedroom it
disturbed her sleep.
The subjects had also found other ways to recover from work. The second most often
mentioned was regular exercise and spending time outdoors regularly. Making sure to not
work overtime was also mentioned by many of the subjects. Children and taking care of
them or their activities were mentioned as a guarantee to forget about work in their free
time. While many of the subjects said they were taking care of housework during their
workday they also mentioned these as something to help them to recover. Overall, the
subjects agreed that just simply keeping work time for work and free time for free time
and having something to look forward to or waiting for them after the workday was one
of the best ways to recover from work.

4.6 Conclusions
In conclusion, the general agreement between the subjects about remote working was that
they enjoyed the freedom and flexibility remote working had given them. Working
remotely was seen as an enormous benefit, which had helped the subjects to avoid getting
infected by the COVID-19. The subjects hoped that the possibility to work remotely
would continue in the future even though they would not wish to work remotely daily.
The subjects were worried about many issues, such as their and their coworkers’ physical
and mental health. Some of the subjects feared that the risk of burnout was greater in
remote working than in office working as it was a lot more difficult to obtain personal
help and the lack of social interactions meant they had to ponder about the issues more
by themselves.

ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS

In this chapter, we will analyze the presented empirical framework. When analyzing the
data collected from the interviews recurring themes could be identified. These most
recurring themes from the data are presented in this chapter and interpretations of the
found themes and other findings will be made.
During the analysis, themes were found, which indicate that remote working has been a
positive experience for most of the subjects. Such words as effectiveness, productivity,
enjoyment, and flexibility were often associated with remote working and remote
working experience by the subjects. The themes were found, which indicate that remote
working is lacking and has been a negative experience for some of the subjects. The
themes such as meeting overload, message flood, loneliness, lack of social interactions,
and lack of personal support. The last group of themes identified had to do with how
remote working had changed the nature of work or how the subjects had to act differently
now compared to the previous situation. These themes were cyclic and uneven workload,
need for mindfulness, and association of work to concreate objects.
Remote working has been, in the overall picture, enjoyed experience by the subjects,
which has offered flexibility to organize life and help to prevent from being infected by
the COVID-19. These had eased some of the stress related to the pandemic and decreased
time-related stress for those having to combine work and family lives. Remote working
has also offered the subjects a new effective and productive way of working, limiting the
usual office working interruptions and interferences. The subjects had enjoyed remote
working so much that all of them wished to incorporate remote working regularly in their
workweek in the future.
However, there were negatives as well. Many subjects felt like they had not received
enough support from their organizations during the remote working period. They also
reported feelings of being disconnected from their work communities. The subjects felt
like they were not kept in the loop of communication and were unaware of what was
going on in the organization. The subjects especially hoped to be better informed about
what was going on outside their work teams.
72

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

Lack of social interactions was also mentioned by several subjects as a negative aspect of
remote work. Loneliness could be detected especially from those subjects who lived
alone. Subjects most missed the face-to-face meeting with their coworkers from office
working and informal meetups during the workday such as lunch companion. They also
felt that unofficial small talk with coworkers and the chance to exchange ideas
spontaneously were an important part of working, which now was missing. Most of the
subjects seemed to feel like the lack of these social interactions had hindered their work.
The younger subjects used chats to fill this gap and the older subjects said that they often
called their coworkers.
Though, remote working had become a regular way of working it had also disrupted the
ways of working. As reported by subjects for many remote working had meant work day
was full of meetings, so much so that it made it difficult for them to get anything else
done during their workday. Some of the subjects also reported that their work had become
more cyclic, meaning that at times there was an overload of work and at times there was
so little work they felt redundant.
Subjects had also found that they needed to be more mindful during their workday. This
was to ensure that they take enough breaks or that they do not dwell on tasks too long.
This reported mindfulness or need for mindfulness seems to indicate that the subjects are
aware of the need to maintain their mental well-being while working remotely. Mental
well-being was something that the subjects seemed to be worried about. Many of the
subjects mentioned that they were worried about their coworkers’ well-being and that
their organizations had not offered enough personal support. They also agreed that remote
working was a very personal experience where there are no two alike.
The results show that work is associated by the subjects with objects or a room at home.
This means that the subjects feel that when they see a specific object like their work
device they start to think about work. Or when they are in their home office, they are in
work mode, and stepping out of that physical place means they switch off the work mode.
The subjects had found that they could best mitigate the stress caused by work by keeping

73

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

these objects or rooms out of sight as many of them reported that they hid their work
device after their workday or kept their home office’s door closed.
The interviewed women seem to have a good balance between work and family domains
and they felt like they had found ways for these domains to balance each other. Such a
way for example is keeping things associated with work out of sight. Their organizations
also seemed to have given them the flexibility to organize their own ways of working,
which in return had helped to keep the balance between the domains.
Especially at the beginning of the remote working period most of the subjects seemed to
be experiencing techno-insecurity and techno-uncertainty. This interpretation was made
from the subjects’ indication of feeling anxiety and pressure to show their work and being
unsure their organization could see how hard they worked. However, as the subjects
reported these feelings did not last very long, which could indicate that their confidence
grew over the remote working period. Techno-uncertainty was also detected on those
subjects, who reported that their work had become cyclic and uneven. They seemed
uncertain about this new trend and were wary of whether they would be needed in the
long run.
Techno-overload was evident especially thorough the overload of virtual meetings, which
made subjects feel like there was not enough time to do all their work or that they had to
extend their workday to be able to do their work. Techno-invasion was also detected from
the data as the subjects expressed the flood of virtual communication, which interrupted
their workflow and required mindfulness to keep their concentration at a needed task.
When work is primarily done at home it is also evident it invades one’s home domain.
The findings indicate that those subjects, who suffered from techno-overload were likely
to look for another job or had done so during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those
subjects’ answers indicated that they felt like they were not supported enough by their
organizations during the pandemic, which had lowered their job satisfaction and
encouraged them to find or start to look for other work opportunities

74

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

An interesting finding was made with the older subjects. These subjects had very skeptical
attitudes towards chats and digital forms of communication. This could indicate technouncertainty on their part. Here, age seemed to be the main indicator as these subjects had
very different kinds of educational backgrounds, which did not mitigate these
technostrains on the subjects. The older subjects also showed techno-insecurity
concerning their use of digital tools. These subjects seemed to feel ashamed of not
knowing how to use all the functions of the Teams and not utilizing it as much as they
could. To this techno-stressor though the educational background and computer
confidence mitigated this stressor as those older subjects with higher education did not
report similar feelings.
As the subjects reported their main coping mechanisms were mainly reactive and included
talking about their problems or distancing from the problems. Only a few of the subjects
mentioned proactive coping mechanisms. Those who did, mention that they tried learning
new ways to adapt their work better fit to remote work. This would indicate that they used
IT control coping mechanisms. Some of the subjects indicated that they wished their
organization would provide coping mechanisms such as agreeing on rules for meetings
and meeting free times in a calendar. This did not seem to be something they had control
over so they could not proactively do it themselves but understood that it was a way to
mitigate the stress and help to cope in remote work. These kinds of mechanisms could be
viewed as IT control coping mechanisms.
As the subjects mostly had very positive attitudes towards remote working and felt
enjoyment during remote working it could also be seen as a coping mechanism, which
mitigates risks of stress. These positive interpretations were mentioned by most of the
subjects. Subjects though did not seem to view this as a coping mechanism. Therefore, it
is possible that this is something they have started to develop over time and they are now
experiencing techno-eustress instead of technostress.
As mentioned by the subjects the most common support offered by their organizations
were training and technical support. Organizations also offered a variety of other kinds
of support such as informal after-work activities. Communication was also mentioned by
75

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

a couple of the subjects but many of the subjects felt like there was not enough
communication on their organization’s part. This seemed to be especially a problem in
smaller organizations, which as mentioned did not have active communication channels.
The subjects also indicated that having social support whether at home or work was an
important way to alleviate experiences of stress. Especially discussing their situations and
feelings about remote working made them realize they were not alone in the situation and
that their feelings were valid. They could also receive reassurance from their coworkers
or managers that their remote working methods were appropriate and that they were
valued employees.

DISCUSSION

As previous research has found the COVID-19 pandemic has posed a very special
environment for work. Remote working has become the standard form of working for
around two years now. The subjects of this study had been working remotely for over 18
months when they were interviewed. It could be said that at this point they had become
experts at it. The subjects had adapted well to this new form of daily work. Their
reflections on remote working were similarly to Jacks’ (2021) remarks, as subjects
viewed remote working after almost two years as “just” work

6.1 Remote working conditions and skills
When comparing the results to the revised EWL Scale in Figure 06. we can find that the
subjects seem to have good remote working conditions and experiences. The subjects
indicated that they felt like they were more productive when working from home and that
they could better handle the interruptions and could concentrate better. Which would
indicate that their remote working had improved their effectiveness and productivity.
From the organizational trust point of view, high hierarchy related to remote working
hindered their remote working conditions and made them feel more anxious about
showing their work. In those organizations, where attitudes were opposite, the subjects
were more confident and had shaken off the anxiousness to show their work faster. Many
of the organizations provided the subjects training to manage remote working and offered
work tools to improve their working facilities. These factors were appreciated by the
subjects and they felt like these factors had made their remote working smoother.
Flexibility was mentioned by the subjects in many different contexts, which were similar
to EWL Scale. The subjects felt like they had been given control to customize their work
to better suit their needs in the remote working environment. None of the subjects
mentioned that they did not have control over how they conducted their work. The
subjects also appreciated that they were able to combine work and home tasks and were
able to run errands during their workday if needed and work those hours later in the day.

77

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

When considering work-life balance through EWL Scale we further confirm that the
subjects have a good balance between work and family domains. None of the subjects
indicated that work interfered with their private lives. The subjects were also very firm
on making sure to keep their workday at eight hours and not to extend it if not necessary.
As they enjoyed working remotely, they also seemed to be happy about the balance it had
brought them.
However, the subjects reported that remote working had affected their professional social
life and that it was a lot harder to maintain an informal relationship with coworkers. This
lack of social interactions had led to some subjects dwelling on work issues more than
previously and talking about work during their free time. Some of the subjects also felt
that remote working demanded them a lot more due to the changing nature of their work
task. Overall, these aspects did not seem to affect the subjects’ overall view on their workfamily balance.

6.2 Remote working experience
The findings of the subjects’ remote working experience were very similar to the findings
in Carillo et al.’s (2020) study. Just like in their study the subjects also indicated that the
main obstacle for adjustment to remote working is the lack of social interactions. As
reported the subjects indicated that lack of social interactions had hindered their working
and they were most missing these from office working. As most of the subjects had
previous remote working experience to some extent and they seemed to have positive
attitudes towards remote working it supports the findings by Carillo et al. (2020) that
previous remote working experience helps adjustment to remote work.
Technical difficulties in remote working were also an indication of stress during remote
work. This supports Gabr et al.’s (2021) findings of poor network quality being an
indication of technostress. Though the majority of subjects had not encountered these
kinds of issues those who did, mentioned that it created momentary stress. These findings
also support Anderson & Kelliher’s (2020) findings that the inability to find suitable

78

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

working space at home, lack of needed equipment, and having to be responsible for the
reliability of the internet connection were stressors in remote work.

6.3 Impacts of gender on remote working experience
Though technical difficulties were a stressor on some of the subjects. The findings did
not support the claims made in the previous research (Gabr et al., 2021; Ragu-Nathan et
al., 2008; Spagnoli et al., 2020) that women are less likely to use ICTs, have less
confidence in using the ICTs, and are more prone to have anxiety and fear towards them.
The subjects, at the most part, seemed to be very comfortable with their work being more
digital and the use of the ICTs was not one of the problems of remote work. The problems
or weaknesses of remote working had more to do with how work was organized and how
digital tools were used.
The subjects’ answers also seem to support Çoban’s (2022) findings, that women prefer
remote working because it creates flexibility to combine work and family lives. Anderson
& Kelliher (2020) indicated that due to the remote working being forced on the employees
they feel less of the psychological benefits such as a sense of autonomy when working
remotely. This could not be detected in this study’s findings. The subjects seemed to feel
very in control of their remote work, they felt like they were able to modify their remote
working to their needs and that it gives them flexibility.
As predicted Finnish daycare system seems to mitigate the findings by Sullivan & Lewis
(2001) that women view remote working as the only option for women to combine work
and family lives. Before the pandemic, remote working had been a tool for the subjects
to combine work and family but it was not the only option. Those who had smaller
children were in daycare or school during the subjects’ workdays. Sullivan & Lewis
(2000) further claimed that women chose to work remotely due to domestic reasons. This
could not be supported by the findings of this study. The subjects told that before the
pandemic they chose to work remotely especially in those situations when they needed to
finish work tasks that required concentration. Domestic reasons were also mentioned but
not by the majority of the subjects.
79

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

In the studies by Sullivan & Lewis (2001) and Craig & Churchill (2020) women were
found to often multitask during remote work. Similar findings were made amongst the
subjects as well, as they reported that they often multitask with their domestic and work
tasks during their remote workday. The subjects indicated that remote working had given
them more free time and made arranging life a lot easier, which is a similar finding to
Craig and Churchill’s (2020) finding of decreased time-related stress during remote work.
The findings of this study do not support the previous findings (Craig & Churchill, 2020;
Gabir et al., 2021 ) about increased work-family conflict on women during remote work.
Though the majority of the subjects did not have small children, who are risk group of
this, those who did, did not indicate such experiences. The findings further do not support
the findings by Gabr et al. (2021) that women have more domestic responsibilities or
Çoban’s (2022) argument that the stereotypical domestic roles have been reinforced
during the pandemic. None of the subjects indicated nor did they emphasize their
domestic roles or responsibilities in other ways than multitasking housework during their
workday. Neither did the subjects indicate that they felt like remote working during the
pandemic had distanced them from their career and professional identities as claimed by
Çoban (2022).

6.4 Remote working and technostress
The findings support the findings made in the other recent research (La Torre et al., 2020;
Molino et al., 2020) about technostress in remote work. In those research, they had found
that techno-overload and techno-invasion had increased during remote work. To many of
the subjects, the digital communication applications were the source of these technostressors either in a form of meetings or constant messages. This finding supports the
findings made in the study by Oksanen et al. (2021) about digital communication
applications increasing the likelihood of technostress, as this could also be detected from
the subjects’ answers. The findings did not support the previous research (Marchiori et
al., 2018; Spagnoli et al., 2020) claiming that women are likely to experience technocomplexity and techno-uncertainty. Though the subjects had also experienced technoinsecurity and techno-uncertainty at the beginning of the remote work, these experiences
80

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

had eased after some time. This also supports Carillo et al. (2020) claim that time is the
best tool to adapt to changes and mitigate stressors.
The findings also support Leung & Zhang’s (2017) & Oksanen et al. (2021) findings of
the intensity of remote work. They had found that the more intense remote working is the
more likely remote workers are to suffer from technostress. Especially those of the
subjects whose remote workday was very full and intense showed signs of technostrains
such as anxiety and fatigue. They also indicated that they felt inefficient because of the
intensity of their remote work.
In Figure 04. techno-stressors were predicted to have negative effects on IT-enabled
productivity and job satisfaction. Though the findings could not be made about
productivity it is clear that remote working and techno-stressors had affected the job
satisfaction of the subjects. This finding supports the findings by Ragu-Nathan et al.
(2008). Those subjects who did not show signs of techno-stress seemed to be more
satisfied with working remotely than those who did show signs of technostress.
The decreased job satisfaction had affected the subjects such as Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008)
predicted. The findings of this study support the claim by Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008) that
techno-stressors and decreased job satisfaction affect continuance commitment. As
found, those of the subjects, who had experienced techno-overload and techno-invasion
the most during their remote working had also changed their employer during the
pandemic. Many of the subjects also indicated that they were looking for a new job at the
time of the interview. This would support Anderson & Kelliher’s (2020) findings that
employees are not as committed to their organization when forced to work remotely as
they would be when choosing to work remotely. This could be due to their remote
working conditions or organizational attitudes and culture. As continuance commitment
was not the focus of this study more precise answers cannot be given.

6.5 Coping and mitigation of technostress
When considering the coping mechanisms used by the subjects the findings support
Carlotto’s (2011) findings that women tend to use reactive and emotion-based coping
81

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

mechanisms to mitigate technostress. The subjects especially mentioned distress venting
and distance from IT as their main ways to mitigate their technostress. Several of them
also mentioned that they tried to learn time- and self-management skills and tried different
ways to modify their work to better suit remote work. These indicate that some actively
also practiced proactive coping mechanisms such as IT control and more specifically
perceived capability. The majority of the subjects also had a positive attitude towards
remote work, which indicates a positive reinterpretation coping mechanism was also
used.
In Figure 04. it was predicted that coping mechanisms would mitigate the effects of
techno-stressors on IT-enabled productivity. The findings of this study could not find the
effects of reactive coping mechanisms on productivity. However, the findings do show
that proactive mechanisms do seem to have a positive effect on productivity. Especially
IT control measures seem to increase the productivity of the subjects. The findings of this
study seem to indicate that coping mechanisms could also have a positive effect on job
satisfaction, which had not been noted in previous research. Especially positive
reinterpretation and perceived autonomy seemed to indicate that the subject had a high
job satisfaction rate.
The supportive atmosphere, just like Gabir et al. (2021) had found, seemed to indicate in
the results that the subjects were more likely to like remote working and it indicated better
adjustment to remote work, which mitigated other risk factors for technostress such as
age. For example, the older subjects who had lower education had received technical
support or training from their organizations had adjusted to remote working well, and felt
like they were able to handle the stressors better. Hence, this had mitigated especially
techno-complexity on the older subjects, which Gabir et al. (2020) had found to be a
significant stressor with older employees. Supportive atmosphere indicated that the
organization offered some forms of techno inhibitors to their employees.
As pointed out by Jacks (2021) remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic is a
shared experience that everyone experiences differently. Though there were similarities
in the subjects’ answers they all represented a unique point of view and had different
82

daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

kinds of circumstances. The subjects felt like this had not been understood well enough
in the organizations and the wrong kind of support was offered. The answers gathered
from the subjects support the views made in the reviewed literature (Carillo et al., 2020;
Molino et al., 2020; Riglea et al., 2021) that in remote working personal support is needed
and psychological counseling should be available.
As suggested by Molino et al. (2020) managers play a crucial role in mitigating the
occurrence of technostress during the COVID-19 pandemic the findings of this study also
found this to be true. The findings indicate that there was not enough managerial support
offered to the subjects. Some managers had neglected their responsibilities for their
employees altogether and had not contacted them during the whole remote working
period.

6.6 Key findings and recommendations
The findings provided answers to all of the research questions of this study. When
considering the RQ1 “Which conditions and factors lead to technostress in female
knowledge workers when they work remotely?” there were clear indications that high
bureaucracy was the main indicator of the increased likelihood of remote work. In those
organizations where bureaucracy was high there usually was a need for an employee to
prove their work, which increased anxiety on employees and the feelings of technoinsecurity and techno-uncertainty in remote work. This was due to employees being
unsure they could prove their work. The uneven workload in remote working was also an
indicator of the increased likelihood of technostress and increased techno-uncertainty.
Workday full of meetings and message floods from different channels also indicated
experiences of techno-overload and techno-invasion. Seeing the reminders of work, such
as work devices or office, increased the likelihood of experiencing techno-invasion. Lack
of computer confidence indicated the increased likelihood to experience technoinsecurity and techno-uncertainty. The lack of interruption, such as technical difficulty,
in working conditions, was also a momentary technostress creator.
The findings indicated to the RQ2 “How do female knowledge workers cope with
technostress?” that the female knowledge workers tend to rely on reactive coping
83

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

mechanisms such as distress venting and distancing from IT. Proactive coping
mechanisms such as positive interpretation and IT controls were also detected.
When considering the RQ3 “Which measures do female knowledge workers take to
prevent technostress?” several different kinds of prevention methods were used. Timeand self-management tools were mentioned as a way to understand remote working better
and to modify work to better fit remote working. Flexibility was an important prevention
tool. Keeping those factors, which are associated with work was also an important way
to prevent techno-invasion. Social interactions and discussing the situation with
coworkers also had an important role in preventing technostress.
The findings support the suggestions made by Molino et al. (2020) and Oksanen et al.
(2021) that organizations should increase employees’ technical skills, recognize
employees’ differences, provide targeted support mechanisms, help their employees to
maintain work in working hours, and promote ways to ensure well-being at work such as
mindfulness. Therefore, it is recommended that organizations take these measures to
mitigate the risks of technostress on their employees. Furthermore, it is recommended
that managers should pay more attention to their employees and offer them more personal
support. Further, it is recommended that organizations should keep the hierarchy for
remote working low and offer their employees, flexible working models, to combine
remote and office working throughout the workweek. Organizations should also not
forget to listen to their employees when making these decisions.

CONCLUSIONS

This study researched the concepts of technostress and remote work. It can be concluded
that remote working has many factors, which are favorable to technostress. Technooverload and techno-invasion especially seem to be the main techno-stressors during
remote work. However, technostress can be mitigated by organizations taking an active
role in offering a wide range of support. Especially personal support is important to ensure
the well-being of the employees.
Through the research, we were able to find answers to the research questions on the
factors leading to technostress on women such as high hierarchy, meeting overload, low
organizational support system, and interference in working conditions. We also found
that women find emotional reactive coping mechanisms to be most useful for coping with
technostress and try to prevent technostress by improving their skills and adapting their
work to better suit the current work environment. The hypothesis of women being more
prone to technostress due to their domestic metawork was supported by the literature but
not by the findings.
Overall, the subjects had well-adjusted to work remotely and to the daily remote working
and they wished to continue working remotely at least for some part of their workweek.
During the COVID-19 pandemic enforced daily remote working the subjects have been
exposed to especially techno-overload and techno-invasion. The findings also support the
claim that women tend to use reactive coping mechanisms to cope with techno-stressors.
The subjects had found a good balance between work and home domains and had overall
enjoyed their remote working experience. This is further supported by the conformity of
their experiences with the EWL Scale. The data also supports that techno inhibitors are
important for ensuring a good remote working experience and preventing technostress.

7.1 Reliability and validity
As the subject sample was narrow it is difficult to examine the reliability and validity of
these findings. It should also be considered that the purpose of this research was to collect
85

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

experiences using qualitative methods to gain more insight into the technostress
phenomenon in the remote working environment. For this reason, the results are reliable
and valid to the point that these widely explore the experiences of the subjects. Reliability
and validity are also supported by the fact that it was possible to find similarities with
other research. The research was conducted using good scientific manners and the process
has been openly reviewed in the chapters. These manners also support the reliability and
validity of this research.

7.2 Limitations
The sample of this research was quite narrow and presented subjects in various age groups
and households. Therefore, it is difficult to determine, which are the factors, which cause
technostress solely on women, and which are affected by the living situations of the
subjects. As it was found by Spagnoli et al. (2021) organizational rules and policies affect
employees suffering from technostress. In this study, all the subjects were also working
for different organizations. Hence, it was not possible to examine whether or not
organizational policies affected subjects without having other subjects from the same
organization.
Subjects of this study had been working remotely for over 18 months and had found their
coping mechanisms. As time has passed it is possible that many of them are not suffering
from distress anymore but it has evolved to eustress. As this was not the focus of the study
it was ignored in the analysis.

7.3 Future research
In the future, more research is needed on the effects of daily remote working on
employees’ mental health. More longitudinal studies and diary-based studies are needed
on the effects of daily remote working on knowledge workers. As the subjects of this
study had already been working remotely for over 18 months they had already gotten
used to working remotely and created coping mechanisms. Therefore, research focusing

86

I. Kivimäki Female remote workers’ technostress - Finnish female knowledge workers’ experiences of
daily remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic

on techno eustress in daily remote working could be a beneficial addition to technostress
and remote working research.
Special focuses could be on employees in different kinds of households. As it was found
in this research single people seemed to suffer more from technostress due to social
isolation. However, this observation should be verified in future studies and possibly by
doing a cross-sectional study within one organization. Relation between technostress and
social isolation could also be studied further.
Other factors resulting in technostress should also be researched more. It would also be
interesting to learn how much influence does IT system design has on the creation of
technostress. As IT systems and their logic are more often designed by men it would be
especially interesting to learn if these affect women suffering more technostress than men.
