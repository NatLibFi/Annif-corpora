Title of Work: Like I am the kind of a bad mom who wanted to go back to work and he is the most
fantastic dad who wants to stay at home - A Qualitative Study on How Common Attitudes About
Motherhood Affect Mothers’ Well-being in the Finnish Society.
Supervisor: Jan Svanberg
Abstract:
The Finnish society is often described as a society where gender equality is on a high level.
However, through these kinds of assumptions, the problems regarding, for example, gender
equality and parenting often remain hidden. Social exclusion is a process of being unable to fully
participate in the society. This thesis seeks to answer the question what characterizes Finnish
mothers’ experiences of social exclusion and how possible negative attitudes affect mothers’ wellbeing in the Finnish society. By using social exclusion theory, this thesis seeks to shed light on
how mothers in Finland are in a less beneficial position in, for example, the labor market and how
the gender pay gap creates a loop where mothers find it difficult to escape their excluded position,
as they are usually the parent who takes the majority of the parental leave. Moreover, the male
breadwinner attitude in Finnish society still exists.
The methodology used for the thesis is narrative methodology and analysis. Five Finnish mothers
have been interviewed for the thesis and the main focus has been on their experiences regarding
the labor market, gender equality and attitudes about motherhood. This thesis highlights some core
issues regarding motherhood and gender equality in Finland. These core issues reside in labor
market attitudes, work division in relationships and the male breadwinner attitude in general. The
major argument in this thesis is that mothers are discriminated against in the labor market and
common attitudes regarding gender equality and motherhood establish feelings of frustration and
sadness in the mothers. The gender pay gap in Finland creates a loop where women take most of
the parental leave and are, therefore, left behind in salary development. Moreover, the attitude
persistent today is that women have the main responsibility for the children and for taking care of
the home. Traditional gender roles are still persistent in the Finnish society.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
From time to time, there is a lot of discussion in the media and by authorities that the birthrate has
decreased in the Finnish society. In, for example, Hellstrand, Nisén and Myrskylä’s article “All-time
low period fertily in Finland: Demographic drivers, tempo effects, and cohort implications” (2020),
the reasons for the decrease have been investigated. In their research, the authors learned that even
though Finland is considered a country where gender equality is on an advanced level, it does not
contribute to an increased birthrate. Mothers in Finland still do most of the domestic work and the
group, not wanting children or wanting only one child, has grown. The decrease in the birthrate has
been high in all age groups. (Hellstrand, Nisén, Myrskylä, 2020). According to Statistics Finland
(2020), the number of children born in 2019 was so low that the last time the birthrate was as low
was in 1868 during the year of famine and at the end of the 1830s (Statistics Finland, 2020).
Moreover, the media demonstrate this phenomenon in a large scale. In an article about how Finland
became the country of low fertility, published in The Finnish Medical Journal, Anna Rotkirch, the
head researcher at The Family Federation of Finland also explains that the group of childless adults
is growing in Finland, and the reasons lie in experiences of uncertainty and responsibility, which have
to do with financial and mental responsibility (Rotkirch, 2020). According to Statistics Finland
(2021), the birthrate increased in 2020 (Statistics Finland, 2021). Birthrate in Finland is also often
discussed the media. In an article about the birthrate and how the Finnish age distribution is balanced
only due to immigration, the journalist Jesse Kuparinen (2021) explains that according to research,
no conclusion can be drawn from this minor increase and the birthrate has been low for so long that
no increase can compensate for the past decrease. (Kuparinen, 2021). As I have presented, the
birthrate is a repeated topic in publications by authorities and the media.

The United Nations (2016) defines social exclusion in the following way:
“Although there is no universally agreed definition or benchmark for social exclusion, lack of
participation in society is at the heart of nearly all definitions put forth by scholars,
government bodies, non-governmental organizations and others… Overall, social exclusion
describes a state in which individuals are unable to participate fully in economic, social,
political and cultural life, as well as the process leading to and sustaining such a state.” (United
Nations, 2016:18).

I became a mother in November 2019 and mamma is the best title I have ever had in my life. I am
not as tired as I assumed I would be and I do not feel as socially excluded, as I feared I would. Due
to how motherhood is discussed, I thought it would be more difficult. The lack of participation that
is mentioned in the UN definition of social exclusion was at the core of creating my feelings of
uncertainty. Even if I did not feel as socially excluded as I feared I would, I noticed that I socialize
mostly with other mothers, and I need to regularly speak to my mother friends about my feelings. I
have minimized contact to those who I have felt I have not gotten any support from. I feel like I have
been lucky to have been able to make these kinds of changes in my social circle and have needed the
support of my family to be able to do so. I understand that this is not an option to everyone.
My motivation to write about this topic is, that as a new mother myself, I noticed how everyone
around me seemed to have an opinion on how I should raise my child and be a mother, regardless of
if they had children or not. People seem to have strong opinions, sometimes even stronger opinions,
if they are not parents themselves. What hurt me the most, especially with a newborn, was the sayings
and opinions of the people close to our family. For example, how I should feed my child was
something people felt the need to let me know their opinion on. In my opinion breastfeeding is
something extremely personal, and does not involve anyone else except the mother and the child.
Sometimes the non-stop commenting even felt like it was done on purpose to hurt my feelings. This
feeling changed as my child grew and I became more confident as a mother.
On one hand there are these opinions floating around in the society, but on the other hand I have met
very little hostile behavior from strangers. I feel that I have mostly been greeted with politeness and
have been offered and gotten help. I also feel that there is a change going on in the society regarding
motherhood and social exclusion. I feel that the negative image could be shifting. However, now with
social media, I feel that the mother role is still today formed to fit capitalism as social media exist
only for capitalist reasons in the end.
I am curious if other mothers that are or are not socially excluded share my thoughts and feelings. In
my thesis I will be looking at how mothers are treated in the Finnish society. I have interviewed
mothers about their experiences on if, how, when and where they have experienced social exclusion
and how that has made them feel. My hypothesis is the following:

5

Mothers that are otherwise socially active members of the society are also affected negatively
of the discussion and criticism that floats around regarding motherhood.
An example of this is, for example, how a working mother can be regarded as selfish and not willing
to spend time with her children.
The aim with my thesis is to raise awareness about motherhood and the attitudes surrounding it and
how it affects mothers negatively in Finland. The aim is to create a better discourse around mothers
and motherhood in Finland. In my experience, becoming a parent is stressful as it is and I feel that a
new mother would need nothing but support in her new role. I feel that there is pressure from both
the social circle and the healthcare.
1.2. Research question
Finnish mothers experience different forms of social exclusion. These may range from labor market
discrimination to feelings of loneliness. These experiences are often not adequately discussed in
research. My research question is:
What characteristics are there to Finnish mothers’ experiences of social exclusion and how
do possible negative attitudes regarding motherhood affect mothers’ wellbeing in the Finnish
society?
I am interested in the feelings that the mothers’ experiences bring, because I believe that through that,
we can come closer to the main reasons for social exclusion and why mothers experience it. Ben
Highmore (2017) discuss the meaning of feelings in the formation of culture in his book Cultural
Feelings: Mood, Meditation and Cultural Politics. He says the following:
“As a modest claim, I want to suggest that moods and feelings are an important aspect of the
world, and that we need to take account of them. More immodestly, I want to claim that unless
we attend to moods and feelings we are not engaging in the sociality of social and cultural
enquiry. How the world feels to us, and how it has felt to us, is the phenomenal form of the
social: this quality is the sense of promise and defeat, of opportunities found and lost, of ease
and disquiet, of vibrancy and dourness.” (Higmore, 2017: 12)
Like Highmore (2017) claims, feelings are central to understanding the social life. I have chosen to
focus on the feelings because feelings color the everyday life of mothers and children. If mothers feel
6

anxious about something, it can shadow the journey of motherhood. The society should support
instead of create uncertainty in anyone’s life that are in vulnerable situations.
1.3.Previous research
Berg (2008) has studied motherhood as cultural expectations, in her doctoral thesis Motherhood as
cultural expectations, that she has written for Väestöliitto, the Family Federation of Finland. She has
analyzed motherhood from the perspective of professionals versus from the perspective of the media
and she has then compared these two. I have gotten familiar with her work and will use her thesis as
a ground to my research regarding the history of motherhood. Although her research is from 2008, I
still find it relatable.
Metsämäki (2018) discusses public breastfeeding in her Master’s thesis “Man känner sig kanske ännu
mer som en kvinna efter att man har fått amma två barn” Makt, materialitet och performativ
kvinnlighet i intervjuer om offentlig amning. (Metsämäki. 2018). In her thesis she has interviewed
mothers about public breastfeeding and the feelings it brings to the mothers. She discusses, for
example, how mothers who do not breastfeed can be viewed as irresponsible and selfish parents.
Metsämäki (2018) claims that norms form breastfeeding trends and how mothers breastfeed publicly
is guided by the norms. According to Metsämäki (2018) mothers still want to breastfeed discreetly in
public and this is due to the surrounding people and the situation they are in. The male gaze is a key
element in how and where mothers can and will breastfeed. Mothers also want to be polite and not
draw attention towards themselves while breastfeeding in public. Metsämäki (2018) continues that
women have internalized the male gaze as something that makes the breast erotic and objectifies
women. The mothers Metsämäki (2018) interviewed considered that breastfeeding a baby was more
comfortable than breastfeeding a toddler in public. The other citizens opinions about breastfeeding in
public therefor made the rules for breastfeeding. It was clear in Metsämäkis’ (2018) research, that
public breastfeeding brought anxiety to mothers who breastfed their children. (Metsämäki. 2018).
What Metsämäki (2018) writes, can also be seen in my interviews, as in the participants changed their
behavior sometimes to fit society’s expectations. One participant said out front that she did not go to
public places that much because taking her breast out in public brought her anxiety.
Ennab Vogel (2020) has studied momshaming in Sweden in her thesis Mom shaming- an
anthropological study of shame related to motherhood. Ennab Vogel (2020) brings light to the
polarized views of different types of mother stereotypes and how the current discussion regarding
7

motherhood, is very conflicted. The different arenas where motherhood is discussed, for example,
social media and health care, have changed the discussion norms around motherhood. In her research
she showed that mom shaming is a phenomenon in Sweden and it creates different groups of mothers
whose views are conflicted. Mom shaming can criticize mothers and create, for example, behavior
and values regarding motherhood. Ennab Vogel (2020) points out that her research showed that it is
mothers who shame other mothers and mothers avoid situations where they can be shamed. Mothers
can be afraid of being shamed and that can change their behavior. (Ennab Vogel, 2020). This is
important regarding my thesis. The mothers I interviewed for my thesis talked about how motherhood
and the first year with the baby is a vulnerable time and much of the comment’s regarding their
motherhood has brought negative feelings. I also recognize myself that I avoided places where I could
face shame during my first year of being a mother.
Laney, Lewis Hall, Anderson and Willingham (2015) have studied changes that motherhood bring to
womens’ identity in their study Becoming a Mother: The Influence of Motherhood on Women’s
Identity Development. They discuss, for example, how mothers’ experience ideals when they do not
reach the ideals of motherhood and how the feelings are constantly in their lives. (Laney, Lewis Hall,
Anderson & Willingham, 2015). This relates to Berg’s (2008) research and how the motherhood ideal
is set really high and not reachable in reality. (Berg, 2008).
Mulcahy, Parry and Glover have studied mothers’ playgroups in their article Play-group politics: a
crtitical social capital exploration of exclusion and conformity in mothers’ groups (2009). They
interviewed mothers in mothers’ groups and found out that the groups can function as support for
mothers but they can also exclude. (Mulcahy, Parry & Glover, 2009). This article relates to all the
research presented above and how mothers behave socially with children and what kind of feelings it
can create. It is an important article regarding my thesis because it brings light to how motherhood is
created in social settings and how support groups can bring negative feelings into the day-to-day lives
of mothers even though the main point of them is to support.
Bergs’ (2008) research is the latest research on the expectations on mothers and motherhood in
Finland. My thesis brings a newer viewpoint to the topic in the Finnish society. I also look at the topic
through using social exclusion theory as a lens.

2. METHODOLOGY
2.1.Method
In his book Kvalitativ forskning från start till mål,(2013) (Qualitative research from the beginning
to the end), Robert Yin explains that what characterizes qualitative research is that it is a way to study
human life in real settings. Qualitative research presents participants’ opinions and thoughts and
shows the way people live their lives. Qualitative research makes space to explain human social
behavior and intends to refer to many different sources of information instead of relying on only one.
In qualitative research, the main point might be to find a way to tell the participants’ opinions and
thoughts. (Yin, 2013). Within the context of qualitative research, I will be using a narrative research
methodology and analyze the data using narrative analysis. Narratives are the stories people tell about
their experiences. Narrative data are often collected through interviews and then analyzed. (Bold,
2012)
Clandinin (2013) argues that narrative methodology has been used more since the early 1990s to
study experience within the social sciences. Clandinin (2013) discusses narrative inquiry as the
narrative methodology and observes that other methodologies, such as phenomenology, use
narratives too. However, narrative inquiry is a separate methodology and includes, besides the
individual experience of the participant, the cultural and social aspect and the context in which the
participant lives. (Clandinin, 2013, Pheonix, 2008). I have chosen narrative methodology particularly
for this reason. Through seeing the cultural and social aspect of motherhood in the Finnish context
my research question is best answered.
According to McAlpine (2016), the narrative method has been used in social science to learn how
people understand their own lives through their experiences. Within the narrative method, there are
different points of view a researcher can use. (McAlpine, 2016). I will use a sociocultural point of
view in my thesis. The sociocultural point of view examines common narratives that people use to
make sense of their own experiences. During the analysis, the researcher finds commonalities in the
data to explain cultural narratives. The ethical issue with narratives is the risk that the researcher adds
a meaning to the narrative data that was not there in the narratives told by the participants. (McAlpine,
2016). I have found commonalities in the data that I collected through the interviews. I understand
that there is a risk for adding meaning to the story told by the participants in the analysis process.
However, I believe that I have succeeded in retelling the story of the participants as it was told by
9

them. By being mindful of the risks in analyzing narrative data, this research approach can be
considered reliable. I have analyzed the data using thematic approach which includes that the
researcher tries to find themes in the narratives (Bold, 2012). The themes are labor market and
motherhood, gender equality and parenting and attitudes and motherhood.
I have chosen to use interviews as a data collection tool. I interviewed five mothers about their
experiences of how they have been treated in society after having become mothers. In the interviews,
I focused on possible discrimination and how that has made them feel. I focused on their views and
experiences of motherhood and how they have been treated by others in society. I wanted to know
how the mothers react to possible negative attitudes and if that has made them avoid certain situations.
The interviews were held through FaceTime or WhatAapp video call, and the audio was recorded
with MacBook recorder. The interviews, audio and transcripts, are archived at Cultura, the Archive
of Cultural Research at Åbo Akademi University. The interviews were held between January and
February 2021. The interview floated freely and discussion was fruitful. I am certain that I had good
rapport with the participants and they could express freely and honestly how they felt about the topic.
I knew all of them from before and they know I am a mother myself and have opinions about the
inequalities that becoming a mother has brought to my life as a woman. The participants remain
anonymous and the data are archived according to ethical research practice. The participants will be
presented in the following table. I have changed the names of the participants to protect their
anonymity:

the two younger children are aged 5 and 7. Felicia is a mother of a toddler. She is married and a
student. She has worked in the service field. Cassandra is a mother of a baby. She works in a male
dominant field and is career driven. Her husband works in the same field as she does.
2.2.Research design
In my thesis, I have divided the theoretical framework into two separate chapters. In the first one,
chapter three with the heading Social Exclusion, I will first present the different definitions of social
exclusion and what the term social exclusion includes. Then I will discuss social exclusion
specifically in a Finnish context and after that present research on motherhood and social exclusion.
In the fourth chapter, Motherhood, I will first review the history of motherhood and then motherhood
today. At the end of the chapter, I will present research on attitudes and motherhood. After the theory
I will move on to empirical findings. The fourth chapter, Empirical findings and analysis, has three
themes: labor market, gender equality and attitudes. I will here present and analyze the data I collected
through my interviews and group the data according to the themes. In the empirical findings and
analysis chapter, I will analyze my data mirroring them to the theories I have presented in chapter
three and four. I will end my thesis with a discussion and some concluding thoughts. In this section,
I will also present what further research I argue that should be conducted on this theme.
2.3.Limitations
The mothers who participated in the interviews are quite a homogenic group. They all live in urban
areas in Finland. They are all middle-class, white, have at least a Bachelor’s degree from a Finnish
university and are active in the labor market. Differences in family structures can be found. However,
I interviewed no, for example, non-white, undocumented or Muslim women who, already prior to
being mothers, are socially excluded in the Finnish society. I have also not interviewed any same-sex
couple or single parent in that sense that they would have sole custody of their children and be
responsible of their children alone. I think that research on different groups experiences of
motherhood are important and should be focused on more. Unfortunately, I have not been able to do
so in my own thesis, due to many factors of which covid-19 has had the strongest impact.
11

The participants are mothers from my social circle, from a similar background as mine. I also asked
only participants who I knew were able to be interviewed in English, since the language of the thesis
is English, although I normally would speak Finnish or Swedish with them. This too has limited
possible participants. Due to covid-19, I have not been able to use, for example, a focus group in a
mothers’ group, since the group activities have been limited due to social distancing. I also asked
about the effects of covid-19 in my interviews, even though the thesis is not about that topic. I am
aware of the possible effects of the virus and the limitations it has brought on mothers’ social wellbeing, specifically at this time.
Bold (2012) states that:
“The purpose of analysis in qualitative research is to enquire deeply into the meaning of
different situations and different people's understandings of the world. It often takes place
with small numbers of participants, in a particular context, and for a specific purpose related
to a change in practice or an improvement in social conditions. It cannot usually be
generalised, yet when small research projects are shared others have similar experiences and
stories to tell. Thus it is valid and reliable, in the sense that it is purposeful for the context in
which it took place and it has significance for others in similar contexts and places.” (Bold,
2012: 121-122)

This thesis is not generalizable to the wider society, since I have only interviewed five mothers and
they have spoken about their personal experiences. As Bold (2012) states, I still think it is valid and
purposeful, because I show how women who are otherwise full members of the Finnish society, and
are not excluded from, for example, the labor market, experience feelings of social exclusion due to
becoming mothers.
Mathieson, Popay, Enoch, Escorel, Hernandez, Johnston and Rispel present social exclusion history
and theory in their literature review Social Exclusion Meaning, measurement and experience and
links to health inequalities (2008). Trends in social exclusion can be studied through global and
regional measures. However, qualitative research is limited. Both quantitative and qualitative
research is needed in the study of social exclusion. Through using both methods, we can learn about
the changes in history and current events regarding social exclusion. (Mathieson, Popay, Enoch,
Escorel, Hernandez, Johnston & Rispel, 2008). In my thesis I will use only a qualitative approach due
to the fact that my research question is best answered through using a qualitative method.

3. SOCIAL EXCLUSION
Social exclusion is a good lens through which motherhood in Finland can be understood. In my thesis,
I specify that the problems that come with motherhood are specific and the context in my thesis is
specific, in other words, motherhood in Finland. The term is useful when discussing social exclusion
regarding motherhood in a western country, because motherhood has changed through the years and
has gone through many breaking points. de Haan (1999) defines social exclusion as follows:
“ social exclusion is (or should be) a theoretical concept, a lens through which people look at
reality, and not reality itself. (de Haan, 1999:5)
This means that it is a lens used for examining social inequalities in societies. This said, it should be
stressed that the experiences of social exclusion the participants in my thesis expressed are their
experiences of their reality as mothers in Finland.
3.1.Social exclusion as a theoretical lens
Mathieson et al. (2008) present social exclusion history and theory in their literature review Social
Exclusion Meaning, measurement and experience and links to health inequalities (2008). The term
social exclusion was first introduced in France and spread to Western Europe from there. Social
exclusion as a term is argued to be better than the term poverty, because it has been easier to accept
and it is more flexible. The problem with the term is that it might hide how people in some areas live
under extreme poverty. Social exclusion as a term, might also be used to stigmatize and make it seem
like the poor are responsible of their own destiny. However, while making the limitation of the term
visible, it is, useful when discussing exclusion, as long as the context is presented. (Mathieson et
al.,2008)
Muddiman, in his paper “Theories of Social Exclusion and The Public Library” (1999), explains that
social exclusion is a multidimensional term that goes further from poverty to including not having
power or having access to services, and being culturally and educationally excluded,. (Muddiman,
1999). Silver (2007) discusses how social exclusion is a process and not a product of a condition in
her article “The processes of social exclusion: the dynamics of an evolving concept”. Because it is a
process, I argue that narrative analysis is the right method to use in my thesis, as it analyses the stories
the participants told about their experiences as mothers [see Chapter 2, Narrative analysis]. Silver
(2007) argues that social exclusion is a problematic term to discuss and fight, because it is difficult
13

to measure. As for poverty, there are thresholds that can be crossed, in other words, limits that state
what is poverty and what is not poverty. In this way poverty is easier to measure, but social exclusion
does not know these thresholds (Silver, 2007).
The term social exclusion is multidimensional and intertwined with where it is used. It cannot be
fought with guaranteeing material wealth for a person who is marginalized, but also has to do with a
person being met with honor and respect. Silver (2007) clarifies that social inclusion is having the
material goods guaranteed but nonetheless important is having guaranteed social relationships and
health. Isolation can lead to not having social support when it is needed. (Silver, 2007). Mathieson et
al. (2008) continue that social exclusion has had many meanings and the different meanings have
changed over time. Social exclusion has been a so-called umbrella term that has included everything
from processes of exclusion to people who are involved in the processes. However, researchers have
agreed that social exclusion is a multidimensional term, and it is used for economic, social and, for
example, political purposes. Social exclusion is relational and the term brings light on inequalities in
power relations in societies. People who are outside the mainstream social systems in societies are at
focus when discussing social exclusion. Groups can also be excluded. (Mathieson, et al., 2008) These
groups can, for example, be mothers.
Mathieson et al. (2008) discuss that the term social exclusion is used to expose the processes of
exclusion that stigmatizes, for example, the poor. Due to the term being multidimensional, it can also
expose the multiple processes which exclude. A person can be excluded because they belong to
multiple groups that are excluded. Exclusion can happen due to, for example, gender, religion or
social class. (Mathieson, et al., 2008) Mathieson et al. (2008) explain that the term is useful when
building policies to reduce, for example, exclusion and inequalities. The causes and consequences of
social exclusion are many and they vary. (Mathieson et al., 2008).
Mathieson et al. (2008) continue that social exclusion is maintained by when societies fail to see how
inequalities in power dynamics and the agency of marginalized groups are linked together. This is
why relational exclusion and the processes of it should be studied. Relational social exclusion means
that it looks at people’s relationships and problems within the relationships regarding power,
participation and social integration. It is also a way to look at social exclusion through the inequalities
in relationships due to power. By focusing on the relational perspective, societies would bring
attention to inequalities, that are caused by unequal power relationships. Social exclusion should
always be seen from a relational perspective. This way we can avoid stigmatizing groups and find the

14

potential of groups to resist exclusion. The term social exclusion can bring attention to diversity, and
in this way, it can be relevant from a global perspective. The level of exclusion varies depending on,
for example, region and time. The unequal power relationships are at the center in the study of social
exclusion. (Mathieson, et al, 2008)
The relational perspective of social exclusion has been studied in, for example, Ellis-Sloans and
Tamplins (2019) article Teenage Mothers and Social Isolation: The Role of Friendship as Protection
against Relational Exclusion. They present that people experience relational exclusion when they do
not have relationships or social support. They studied how relationships affected young mothers’
experiences of isolation and they present that teenage mothers often lost friends due to their
pregnancies but could gain new friendships with other teenage mothers, through their shared
experiences. Young parents can also feel stigmatized and social support from peer can have a
normalizing effect on their experiences. Mother friends are important to all mothers regardless of age.
Social policies, with relational social exclusion in the center should be used to fight exclusion. (EllisSloan & Tamplin, 2019).
Giddens and Sutton (2017) come to the same conclusions and define social exclusion, in their book
Sociology in the following way: Social exclusion refers to ways in which individuals may become cut
off from full participation in the wider society. (Giddens, Anthony & Sutton, Philip W, 2017: 543).
They also present that when discussing social exclusion, we need to consider the opposite of social
exclusion, which according to them is inclusion. Individuals can be excluded from the wider society
for various reasons. Why some individuals are socially excluded can be shaped both by the society
around the individual and by their own choices. There is a broad selection of factors that can cause
that everyone does not have the same opportunities as their peers. (Giddens & Sutton, 2017).
Further on, Giddens and Sutton (2017) presents a division of different kinds of social exclusion. They
list exclusion from social relations as one and explain, for example, how being in the labor market
brings social relations and being outside the labor force can cause exclusion. They also bring attention
to the fact that retired people make the largest group of people who are outside the labor force. Other
groups are, for example, those who do domestic work. Being outside the labor market increases the
risk for social exclusion but does not exclusively cause it. Being unable to meet family and friends in
everyday settings are forms of exclusion. Social exclusion in everyday life can be, for example, being
isolated or not having anyone to talk to when going through life changes. (Giddens & Sutton, 2017).
This relational aspect of social exclusion is important when discussing motherhood. It is not only the
15

fact that mothers are outside of the labor market that cause social exclusion but also the possible
decrease in social contacts during maternity- and parental leave.
Levitas (1996) presents that the term social exclusion was born from the need to describe poverty and
its’ consequences, in her article The concept of social exclusion and the new Durkheimian hegemony.
Social exclusion was compared with labor market integration. Levitas (1996) argues that the term
social exclusion hides the inequalities between those who do paid work. Moreover, the term social
exclusion does not put value on unpaid work. The fundamental social inequalities cannot be seen
using the term social exclusion (Levitas, 2008). Levitas (2008) continues, that the term underclass
was used before the birth of the term social exclusion, and according to Stuart Hall, the problem with
the term underclass is, that it only makes two groups visible, underclass and the rest. No variation
was seen in the group that was not underclass. This division made it possible to hide inequalities in
the majority class. Levitas argues, that social exclusion works the same way in hiding the inequalities
as the term underclass. (Levitas, 2008).
Levitas (2008) argues that as the term social exclusion was created to discuss the consequences of
poverty, it has failed to do so as it does not include unpaid work which is usually done by women.
Working population are all drawn under the same line and the term social exclusion hides the
differences between workers. Levitas (2008) points out that the full integration of women into the
labor market would need men to take more responsibility in caring for the home and children. In
1994, European Social Policy made a link between unemployment and social exclusion. Social
exclusion has been a core issue in the European Union for a long time. Levitas (2008) article presents
that exclusion is multi-dimensional and do not only include poverty. She discusses the problematic
way of linking social exclusion and unemployment together. It hides other reasons for social
exclusion. (Levitas, 2008).
3.2. Previous research on social exclusion in Finland
Virtanen (2003) presents Social exclusion in Finland in his Report on Social Exclusion in Finland
(2003). The report analyzes the first National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion. He
discusses how the trend in Finland is that services are provided for everyone, for-example, childcare,
instead of targeting benefits for the excluded, Finland has tried to secure benefits for everyone.
Virtanen (2003) quotes a working group in his text that says the following:

16

“The Nordic welfare model reinforces social cohesion. The aim of a welfare society is to
protect and uphold the fundamental rights of its people and reduce inequalities. The idea is to
improve equality and well-being so that everyone can live a dignified and secure life and
improve their own skills and talents at the different stages of their life. Equality must be
promoted so that people receive equal treatment regardless of their gender, age, domicile,
disability or ethnic background. Support for equal opportunities allied to social welfare and
health care services and income security for all prevents poverty and exclusion. Exclusion
may be due to unemployment, lack of education, illness or housing conditions, and combating
it requires active measures in all these areas. Social policy also includes the provision of care
for those who cannot fend for themselves or demand their own rights. Social protection should
be universal, covering both those who are managing well and those who are struggling to
make ends meet. This also tends to improve general acceptance of social protection and its
financing options. The aim is to keep income differences small and combat poverty.”
(Virtanen, 2003:22).

Equal treatment is central to a welfare country such as Finland. However, even though Finland has
these aims to reduce inequalities, it has not succeeded to do so in many fields. Motherhood and gender
equality are one of these fields that the government has not succeeded to do so, even though it is
written in reports such as this by Virtanen (2003), almost 20 years ago.
One example of social exclusion in Finland is ethnic profiling. Keskinen, Alemanji, Himanen,
Kivijärvi, Osazee, Pöyhölä and Rousku (2018) have studied ethnic profiling in their article The
Stopped- Ethnic profiling in Finland (2018). Ethnic profiling is, for example, authority demanding to
see identity due to a person’s race. Keskinen et al. (2018) showed in their research that ethnic profiling
is present in day-to-day life of people who belong to racialized minorities. The stoppes were mostly
not positive encounters and it damaged their trust in authorities. (Keskinen, Alemanji, Himanen,
Kivijärvi, Osazee, Pöyhölä & Rousku, 2018).
There is also something called Finnish exceptionalism, which brings awareness towards the unspoken
racism and gender inequality that is very present in Finland. In Complying with Colonialism: Gender,
Race and Ethnicity in the Nordic region, the authors question statements of how the Nordic countries
are often viewed as nations with developed welfare, democracy and economic competitiveness with
insignificant ties to colonialism. Postcolonial Nordic feminism is a branch of feminism that studies
racism and gender inequalities in the Nordic region. Postcolonial Nordic feminisms main points are,
that denying, for example, gendered racism leads to a false analysis. (Mulinari, Keskinen, Irni &
Tuori, 2009).

17

In Alemanji’s study Is there such a thing…? A study of antiracism education in Finland (2016), he
argues that it is not popular to discuss racism in Finland. He analyzes racism through Finnish
exceptionalism, coloniality of power, whiteness theory and denial of racism. In Finland, there is a
belief about being best in education and, for example, gender equality. Exceptionalism then gives an
idea of superiority and creates a so-called selective amnesia. Immigrants do not have the same
claimed quality. Exceptionalism in Finland is used to ignore non-white population. Hierarchies are
maintained this way and exceptionalism creates barriers. Finland having selective amnesia about
racism and colonialism means, that people think that these concepts do not exist in Finland. The
colonized are seen as inferior and this affects whose knowledge has value. Finland has benefitted
from colonialism and Finland and the treatment of Saami can be seen as internal colonialism. In
Finland, white Finns can see themselves as racially neutral as if there was no category “white”.
(Alemanji, 2016). This is one example of social exclusion in Finland and of Finnish exceptionalism.
Keskinen, Stoltz and Mulinari (2020) discuss in their book Feminisms in the Nordic Region:
Neoliberalism, Nationalsim and Decolonial Critique, how Nordic welfare states have favored some
groups and therefor created exclusion of others. As the Nordic states deny racism (Keskinen, Stoltz
& Mulinari, 2020), and for, example Finland claims to be the best regarding gender equality
(Alemanji, 2016) as a product, migrant women are marginalized. Intersectionality is key to research
privilege and inequalities in the Nordics. (Stoltz, 2020).
Degni, Suominen, El Ansari, Vehviläinen-Julkunen and Essen (2013) has conducted research on
Somali-born immigrant women and their experiences of maternity care services in Finland in their
article Reproductive and maternity health care services in Finland: perceptions and experiences of
Somali-born immigrant women. The participants in their study were satisfied with the service they
got on a large scale. However, problems with communication and some unfriendly attitudes of health
care providers existed. (Degni, Suominen, El Ansari, Vehviläinen-Julkunen & Essen, 2013). In
Wikbergs, Erikssons and Bondas (2012) article Intercultural Caring From the Perspectives of
Immigrant New Mothers, about Finnish maternity culture, they concluded that if there are problems
in communication, the immigrant mothers had an increased risk for being discriminated against and
being isolated. (Wikberg, Eriksson & Bondas, 2012). These are examples of how Finnish
exceptionalism creates exclusion in Finland regarding motherhood. As Finland is being viewed as an
equal country regarding gender and race, these kinds of problems are often hidden.

18

3.3.Motherhood and social exclusion
Byvelds and Jackson (2019) argues that having children and becoming a mother make women face
social exclusion. The key in fighting the fact that women feel socially excluded when having children,
would be to make them feel included in a community. Maternity leave and, for example, breastfeeding
can bring social exclusion to a mothers’ life. Mothers can also belong to other excluded groups
regarding, for example, sexuality or race. (Byvelds & Jackson, 2019.)
Gosling (2008) discuss womens experiences of social exclusion in her article ““I’ve Always
Managed,That’s What We Do”: Social Capital and Women’s Experiences of Social Exclusion”.
Gosling discusses how women use social capital to fight their exclusion. She presents Bordieus
definition on social capital: The sum of resources, actual or virtual, that accrue to an individual or a
group by virtue of possessing a durable network of more or less institutionalised relationships of
mutual acquaintance and recognition. (Gosling, 2008: 2). Gosling interviewed women for her article
and show that women who live under poverty use social capital to get by. Social capital has not helped
them break free from poverty but they have been able to get by while using networks and being active
members of their social networks. All women did not have access to community networks and were
sometimes excluded by other members of the communities. Gosling (2008) argues that the
responsibility for creating community networks has been on the women in the community. According
to Gosling, there needs to be research and policies need to be made to fight women’s poverty.
(Gosling, 2008).
Mulcahy, Diana C. and Glover have studied mothers’ playgroups in their article Play-group politics:
a critical social capital exploration of exclusion and conformity in mothers’ groups (2009). They
interviewed mothers in mothers’ groups and found out that the groups can function as support for
mothers but they can also exclude. They explain that social capital consist of who one person knows
and how one is able to use something the other person has. That something is, for example, material
resources or power. The concept of social capital has been critiqued because more weight should be
on studying the people’s experiences who get left outside. Social capital should be including studies
of women who do emotional labor, but it has been focusing on topics that are, for example, sexless.
(Mulcany, Parry & Glover, 2009).
Mulcany, Parry and Glover (2009) found out that gender roles are reproduced in mothers’ groups. In
general, the mothers’ groups functioned as support, however, not all mothers had the possibility to
19

attend. The mothers who attended were similar to each other, in other words, married and middle to
upper middle class. The story the mothers told cannot be generalized on all mothers. The groups
brought anxiety to mothers if they did something different from the norm of the group regarding
motherhood. Groups can also shape the roles of fathers. Mothers in the groups often speak ill about
the father for not taking care of the children in a similar way that the mothers do. Therefor it
contributes to creating the father’s role on a larger scale in the society, as the father is presented as
the incompetent parent. If the roles in a family do not follow the norm, in other words, a father would
be home with children while mother is the breadwinner, mothers in the study felt uncomfortable with
the idea of a stay at home father. One trend is also that women did not let father’s parent (Mulcany,
Parry & Glover, 2009).
Mulcany, Parry and Glover (2009) continue by presenting research that argues that fathers should
take more space in parenting and mothers should give them the space to do so. It would be important
that women would not contribute to maintaining the traditional parenting roles by language they use
about their partner. (Mulcany, Parry & Glover, 2009).
Mulcany, Parry and Glover (2009) continue that mothers’ groups are not only support for the mothers’
but also supports the whole families. When mothers get support, they can better care for the family.
Mothers’ groups do the work for the society as well. The society does not have to provide support
when the mothers do the work for them by taking care of each other. Mulcany, Parry and Glover
(2009) continue that mothers’ groups should be researched more, to be able to break the traditional
gender roles and to support mothers who often feel anxiety regarding motherhood and the
responsibility it brings. (Mulcany, Parry & Glover, 2009). My thesis is a contribute to the subject
because I bring light to how these inequalities regarding parenting still exist today in the Finnish
society.

4. MOTHERHOOD
4.1. History of motherhood
In her doctoral thesis Motherhood as Cultural Expectations (2008), Berg has studied how motherhood
is created by professionals working with family care and the media. She presents research showing
that when people have started to idealize motherhood is when the term was born. Motherhood is not
an old term and it was first only referred to when speaking of a biological mother. In the Finnish
language, it was first used in the middle of the 19th century, when the ideal family form was a nuclear
family. (Berg, 2008) Ulrike Zartler (2014) presents Parson and Bale’s conception of the nuclear
family in her article “How to Deal With Moral Tales: Constructions and Strategies of Single-Parent
Families” (2014). According to them, a nuclear family is:
“a legally married, heterosexual couple, residing with at least one (biological) child, with the
male adult acting as the primary income earner and the female adult being responsible for
caring for husband, household an children.” (Zartler, 2014: 605).
The western ideal mother and the birth of the term motherhood can be traced back to 1762, when
Jean Jacques Rousseau presented his theory about racing children. At that time, and in Rousseau’s
publication Émile, a woman was a wife and a mother, not a citizen. (Berg, 2008)
According to research presented by Giddens and Sutton (2017), the family has been seen as a form
of institution. After industrialization, the importance of the family shifted to concentrate on racing
children and socialization. In western countries, the nuclear family was the best fit for economic
purposes. All family forms were also measured through the nuclear and ideological family. Marxist
theories argue that the nuclear family was functional but their reasons lay in capitalism. Men were in
the public sphere and women were in the private sphere, in other words at home. Gender inequalities
grew and when women moved to paid employment, they still took care of family-related work on a
large scale. The class system is also still maintained by the family. Through the nuclear family, wealth
can be passed on from generation to generation. (Giddens & Sutton, 2017).
Berg (2008) shows that the motherhood ideal was created in the 19th century by capitalism,
industrialization and gender roles. Women were responsible for the home and men worked in the
public sphere. The division of the different roles of men and women existed due to the alleged natural
differences of the two genders. Motherhood was considered the natural life goal of a woman and it
21

was strongly controlled. As the middle class became stronger, Europe became filled with guides
related to childcare. At first, these guides concentrated on the physical needs of children and later the
psychological ideas became a part of the guides, too. Religion affected how these guides were
constructed. Mothers were also supposed to care for children through knowledge based on medicine.
The guides were detailed and deeply rooted. (Berg, 2008)
Berg (2008) writes that motherhood in Finland has been seen as a woman’s ultimate goal. Being able
to have children and caring for them in a heterosexual marriage where the man is the authority was
the norm in the 19th century. The physical care for children was the main focus at that time. These
roles were strongly impacted by politics, which gained from the norms. The nuclear family was
considered the right and only solution to a healthy increase in the birth-rate in Finland. Mothers that
did not fit the nuclear family norm were considered a threat. Mothers were categorized into good and
bad mothers regarding their class. Poverty was a sign of bad motherhood and a mother who was in
the labor market was considered bad. Poor women who came from the countryside were considered
unfit to raise children. (Berg, 2008)
Berg (2008) then explains that when, for example, abortion became legal, birth control available and
women moved to paid employment, the differences between different mothers became less important.
This happened during 1960-1970 in Finland. Motherhood and marriage were not linked to each other
anymore at this time and women could choose motherhood due to the new birth control options. There
was an increased knowledge in psychology in the middle of 20th century and by this, the importance
of economic status decreased when measuring good motherhood. A good mother was someone who
could assure a child’s healthy psychological development. Researchers argue that today’s mothers
are required to constantly reflect on their own motherhood. (Berg, 2008).
Berg (2008) continues some researchers argue, that between 1980-1990 is when motherhood became
conflicted. As motherhood no longer was a natural choice, for example, popular culture started
showing conflicted representations of motherhood. Berg (2008) presents Anthony Giddens theories
on how life has become complicated when people question the old traditional ways of life and at the
same time do not know how to act in the new. Research claims that when speaking about traditional
motherhood, people do not speak about a specific time-period, rather than of different, often
unwanted features in how to be a mother. The ideals of motherhood are said to be open for change
relatively slowly. (Berg, 2008).

22

Berg (2008) writes that during time, controlling a mothers’ behaviour has been a tool to try to solve
problems in societies. Depending on class and family status, women were treated differently
regarding motherhood. No effort was put to solve the working-class mothers’ problems and mothers
were divided into good and bad. Women were controlled through legislation; birth control was
forbidden and motherhood was women’s ultimate life goal. (Berg, 2008)
4.2.Motherhood today
Berg (2008) argues in her thesis Motherhood as cultural expectations, that motherhood is defined
and described in different fields of the society. These fields are, for example, political, professional
and religious and in these fields, motherhood is produced. Norms and standards for motherhood are
created in the different fields and through these, mothers evaluate their own motherhood and re-create
the norms. Motherhood has a societal responsibility to it, and it is therefore monitored by authorities.
Traditional norms regarding motherhood can be reshaped through the media. It is, for example,
important to study how the tensions between authorities and the picture of motherhood is painted in
the media, affect mothers’ wellbeing in Finland. It is required that mothers feel accepted by the
society they live in, in order for them to feel like good mothers. (Berg, 2008).
Berg (2008) presents feminist research that has shown that the ideal about motherhood has been set
so high, it is impossible for anyone to reach. Motherhood has been romanticized and become the
ultimate life goal for women. Berg (2008) presents the feministic phrase “oppressed by praising” and
it means how women have been oppressed by being tied to the children and home. The only good
way of being a woman was to take care of others. However, women did not have legal rights to their
children before the 20th century in Finland. (Berg, 2008)
Berg (2008) continues that the social institution of motherhood is well known globally. Motherhood
is linked with rules and laws depending on the cultural context and we have certain norms and
requirements regarding motherhood. Motherhood sets a meaning for women in general regardless of
if they have children or not. Motherhood, how we understand it, is created to serve patriarchy and
capitalism. This is the reason why we understand motherhood being a woman’s ultimate job. (Berg,
2008.)
Berg (2008) points out that institutionalized and personal motherhood are two separate things. This
means that the lived motherhood differs from what motherhood, with its rules and expectations, is as
23

an institution. However, conflicts may arise when they meet. Requirements on motherhood from a
cultural and societal perspective can cause a mother to see motherhood as something conflicted and
filled with problems. What we consider the behavior of a good mother is, can seem as if it has not
changed over the years. However, what we regard as a good mother has in reality gone through drastic
changes. Research shows that the history of the word motherhood has not had the same path as, for
example, family and the term childhood. Feminism has first studied motherhood through the actual
circumstances mothers live in then later looked at motherhood as a social construct and rather as a
choice than a destiny. (Berg, 2008).
Giddens and Sutton (2017) point out that feminists have conducted research on families through
looking at the experiences of women. Feminist research has divided the problem with unequal family
structures into three topics; economy, power relations and caring activities. Through these three
topics, research has shown that how the work is divided within the family, has to do with either
capitalism or patriarchy. In this way, the strong division of the private and public sphere has lived on.
The male breadwinner ideal still exists. (Giddens & Sutton, 2017).
The Social Insurance Institution of Finland, Kela, pays the social benefits during parental leave in
Finland (Kela, 2019). Maternity leave benefit in Finland today is approximately four months long,
and start approximately one month before the baby is born. (Kela, 2021a). After this, there is a
possibility for the parents to share the parental leave period, which is approximately six months long.
(Kela, 2021b) The father also has a nine weeks long fathers leave period, out of which he can use
three weeks during the mothers leave and six weeks after the parental leave period has ended. (Kela,
2020). After this, a person can still continue to take care of the child at home, until the child is threeyears-old. During this time, the parent can get child care benefit. (Kela, 2021c).
The new law that has been in process in the government would include that both parents would get
to have 160 days that they could take care of the child. The mother would also get 40 days leave
before the due date and parents could give 63 say out of their own days to the other parent. The
parental leave benefits could be held until the child is two-years-old. The new law will come in august
2022. (Kela, 2021d).
According to the Finnish institute for health and welfare, in 2019, women earned 16% less in average
than men did and women taking longer family leaves affects their wage increase. (Finnish institute
for health and welfare, 2021a). Further on, one fifth of the Finnish father’s do not take any parental
24

leave and out of the leave that is possible to share between the parents, only 11% of Finnish fathers
use it. After the parental leave benefits, parents can still take care of the children at home until the
children are three-years-old. Only 2% of the Finnish fathers use this possibility. Finnish fathers are
taking child care leaves radically less than the other Nordic countries. (Finnish institute for health and
welfare, 2021b).
Giddens and Sutton (2017) explain that women have now moved to paid employment, into the public
sphere. However, according to feminist research the majority of the household tasks are still the
women’s responsibility. Some research has looked into how household finances are organized in
families and seen some unequal power relations there. Moreover, women are responsible for most of
the caring activities in families, that also include emotional labor. (Giddens & Sutton, 2017).
4.3. Attitudes and motherhood
In Pettys, Fazios and Briñols (2012) Attitudes: Insights from the New Implicit Measures, the word
attitude is defined by using Hovland, Janis and Kelleys definition of it:
as “implicit responses” that were “sometimes unconscious” and were “oriented toward
approaching or avoiding a given object”. Attitudes were contrasted with opinions which were
“verbal answers that one covertly expresses to (oneself)”. These private opinions were further
distinguished from public opinions, which could be susceptible to social desirability motives.
(Petty, Brinol & Fazio, 2012:3)
In other words, attitudes can be seen as spontaneous opinions of an event or someone. People can
keep the true attitudes to themselves and public opinions can be affected by what is acceptable and
what is not. I am using this definition when discussing attitudes in my thesis.
Mother shaming can be tracked back to the Victorian era, where mothers who miscarried were blamed
for it. (Byvelds & Jackson. 2019). Harrison discusses miscarriage in her Chapter As If She Weren’t a
Mother at All: Narrating Blame and Isolation of Miscarrying Mothers in the Nineteenth Century and
Today, in the book Motherhood and Social Exclusion. This thought still exists today and this is why
miscarriage seldom is talked about. Even today, the medical terminology of miscarriage includes the
word abortion. The terminology can be considered offensive. During the Victorian era, female bodies
were covered, and pregnant women were locked inside the house when the pregnancy started
showing. Miscarriage was therefor never talked about. Experiencing miscarriage brings feeling of

25

guilt and isolation to mothers still today and this can be tracked back to the Victorian era. (Byvelds
& Jackson, 2019).
Feminist research on family structures has brought attention to how common and political ideals of
how a family should be are different from what they are in reality. Those who trust in the ideal family
do not like how diverse family structures have changed how we look at family life. Family forms
vary, and political debates are still somewhat tied to the normative ideals. Ideals that are portrayed in
the media and social policy are different from what family experiences actually are. Families have
changed as, for example, women moved to paid employment and by increased gender equality.
(Giddens & Sutton, 2017).
Sociologist Morgan suggest to use the term family practices when talking about all family related
activities. This term is helpful when discussing different family forms and trying to understand the
actual lived family life and why it has changed. Another useful term is family displays. This term
explains how people show others how they do family practices. Families use family displays to show
family members, other families and other people how they do family practices. An example of this,
is children’s healthy diet. Parents feed their children in the way, for example, healthy diet is shown
in the media, politics, advertisement and schools. Giddens and Sutton (2017) give an example of a
study made on how mothers in white middle class families prepared lunch boxes for their children.
The lunch boxes were much alike, even though mothers claimed they chose the content individually.
It was also the mothers’ responsibility to prepare the box. The research showed that the mothers did
not feel good about potential criticism they were opened to in this way. (Giddens & Sutton, 2017).
Morgan has talked about how some family practices are performed under pressure and how that can
only have a negative outcome for the person performing them. There is something called gendered
expectations, that make people choose, for example, to work full-time or do domestic work. In the
European Union, there is still a gender pay gap even though we have legislation that should be
controlling it. The common attitude has continued to be that work comes second to women and having
children comes first. This creates inequalities in the labor market and traditional attitudes of men
stand in the way of the change. Research show that before the pay gap is narrowed and women are
not as economically dependent on men as they still are now, doing housework will remain the
woman’s responsibility. Some sociologist says that heterosexual couples “fall back into gender”
where the man is the breadwinner, when they have children. (Giddens & Sutton, 2017:389).

26

Giddens & Sutton (2017) presents research that show how mothers are usually the parents that stays
at home after a child is born and live up to the traditional expectations. Society expects the mother to
enjoy her role. Men can get criticized if they take this role and it is more difficult for women to
advance in their careers. These gendered expectations live on, on a deeper level, even though
women’s opportunities to education and work have changed radically. (Giddens & Sutton, 2017.)
Berg (2008) explains how research regarding women and paid employment has focused mainly on
how motherhood has suffered from women becoming a part of the labor force. Women have an
opportunity to work. However, their position in the labor market is more insecure. Mothers also still
carry the main responsibility for caring for the children and the home. Some research claim that as
mothers have become more and more committed to the labor force, they also experience more
pressure on caring for the children. Women have the possibility to choose their own lifestyle.
However, at the same time they are pressured to find harmony in combining motherhood and paid
employment. (Berg, 2008).
Giddens and Sutton (2017) talk about interaction. Adults can be bullied and a person who is bullied
feels shame and guilt over what happened and wonder how they themselves are responsible of their
own abuse. Individuals form their own view of themselves through relationships and interaction with
other people. What kind of interaction we go through, shape our view of ourselves. Bullying is about
using power and it is a form of interaction. (Giddens & Sutton, 2017.)
Giddens and Sutton (2017) continue that through studying social day-to-day life and interaction, we
can learn. Daily routines form structures and big life changes affect and form the structures in a
person’s life. Due to social backgrounds, a person can view the same reality differently from other
people. Human interaction shapes the social reality. Our daily interaction is connected with social
institutions and sociologists have argued that when discussing identity, we should discuss social
identity, because our identity is formed by social interactions. Identities are both individual and
collective. Stigma can cause that an individual does not have the power to affect what identity is given
to them. Giddens & Sutton (2017) discuss the differences of primary and secondary identities, where
primary are formed early on in a person’s life and secondary identities are connected with our social
roles. Further on there is something called a collective identity which means that a person is a member
of a larger group of people and identify with the group. Daily interaction can change the structures
and peer groups play a significant role in the socialization processes. Socialization happens in
families, as a child, which is called primary socialization and also later in a person’s life, through the
27

surrounding society, which is called secondary socialization. Individuals themselves also form the
way they socialization process goes. Cultural skills are learned through the process. (Giddens &
Sutton, 2017)
Berg (2008) writes about expectations and how they form motherhood. Some research argues that
motherhood, as well as other roles are a social construct. We learn, consciously and unconsciously,
through cultural influences what motherhood should look like. There are expectations in the society
that guide mothers how to behave in a way that is seen as proper behaviour for a mother. The construct
and reality affect each other and mothers’ behaviour can change the discourse of motherhood. The
cultural expectations on motherhood can leave mothers alone with how they experience motherhood
and how they trust themselves. How a mothers’ identity is formed, is depending on these expectations.
(Berg, 2008)
Berg (2008) argues that the guidance for mothers offered by professionals is also used as a form of
social control due to the power relationship that is involved. Berg (2008) speaks about motherhood
as many different constructs that are in conflict with each other. She offers an example of an ideal
mother, who is relatively young but still experienced. The ideal mother should have a separate life
from family responsibilities, but still prioritize her family. These discourses are filled with
expectations, and mothers in reality are left alone in finding them. A mother can live up to the
expectations or risk being unaccepted (Berg, 2008).
Carden discuss how mothers carry the blame for children who do not behave according to what is
expected of them in her chapter Difficult Children, Blamable Mothers? A Historical Perspective
(2019). Blaming mothers for badly behaving children is noticeable in all social classes. This shows
also how the responsibility of racing well behaved children are on the mothers. (Byvelds & Jackson,
2019.)

5. EMPIRICAL FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS
This chapter is divided into three sections subtitled Labor market and motherhood, Gender equality
and parenting and Attitudes and motherhood. However, all the topics are intertwined. During the
interviews, I noticed how issues regarding the labor market constantly came under discussion. I argue
that this is because social exclusion of mothers in the labor market is easiest to grasp and name.
5.1.Labor market and motherhood
Motherhood is a process of high risk exclusion when, for example, labor market is discussed. All the
mothers I interviewed shared how they have been treated inappropriately in the labor market because
they are women and/ or mothers. When asked about what kind of attitudes they have met in the labor
market I recieved the following answers:
Well when I went back to work after being on maternity leave the second time, I started in
consulting, and actually when I met a potential client, who did not become a client luckily,
actually they even asked me like straight away that you know how can I work effectively,
because I have two small children. So sometimes you meet in the labor market really outdated
and horrible people who comment… on motherhood like in a really politically incorrect way.
Insensitive way, but I think, yeah, it is also maybe the ones that you remember, probably you
have more like positive comments from people but I do not know, as a, especially women if
you have like small children that I do not think the labor market has a very positive view on
you as a worker. Unfortunately -Inari
Inari’s experience shows that women are not and do not feel equal to their male peers in the labor
market after becoming mothers. This shows that the common attitude in the Finnish society is that
the women have the main responsibility for the children and also that women who work cannot give
a hundred percent to their work, because they are mothers and their focus is on the family. I continued
by asking why she thinks the labor market does not have a positive view of mothers, and she replied:
Because you are a risk, risk of being home with the sick children and risk of being a bad
worker because you do not sleep during the night. And you know... Prejudices. -Inari
Inari shows with her comment that mothers feel much pressure for caring for the children but also
that the common attitude is that fathers do not have to be home with sick children or stay up nights
with the children. Even if the reality would be that the father is on child sick leave equally, the

29

perception is that they are not, and therefore, are better workers. This is why I asked Inari if men get
the same treatment, and she replied:
I know they do not. Because of the society in Finland, that the mothers have the main
responsibility of the kids, and everybody thinks that. – Inari
This comment is supported by Carden’s (2019) statement that women are responsible for racing
children. Giddens and Sutton (2017) also discuss the male breadwinner mentality. Inari feels that
everybody thinks this way in the Finnish society and this is supported by her experiences as a mother
in the labor market.
Emilia, who is not working in the business field replied to the same question about attitudes in the
labor market in the following way:
I work as a social worker so we have a lot of women in the field. So, I do not get to like
compare men and women a lot at my work place. We had this one case actually that one of
my colleagues got discriminated when she got pregnant and they usually always renew the
contracts always one year at a time, then she got pregnant and did not get her like new one
year, they gave it to someone else so that was pretty shocking. That it actually happened also
at our work place. It was a big thing and she actually complained about it and in the end they
got to, she won the case and they paid her... And it was interesting because of all of our bosses
are also women, and there is a lot of women so, somehow you would think that it does not
happen there, but yet it happened so it is all learnt and in us as well. – Emilia
Emilia reveals a new shade of the problem “motherhood and the labor market”, by observing that it
is “in us as well”. By this she means that women carry these kinds of attitudes about motherhood as
well and women discriminate against women in the labor market. As she also revealed, her employer
acted against the law, while discriminating against a pregnant person and this is why they had to pay
her a settlement. Even though it is against the law I argue that this is a common problem in the labor
market.
Emmy who works in a school has met negative attitudes as well:
Yeah, well I think that in the school world there are a lot of women so, there are a lot of
mothers working there and I have never felt that it has somehow been an issue, like when I
have applied for jobs I do not think that it has ever been in a very important role. But, I do
sometimes think that for example daycare closes at a certain time and sometimes we have
some kind of meeting that would probably go on for longer and I have to leave because if I
am not there to pick up my kids they are going to take them to childcare, ha ha, I sometimes I

30

just have to leave earlier, of course sometimes I have to stay home when my kids are sick or
something like that and I think that there are people, I think that especially women who do
not have children, they respond to that, they think that it is unfair that someone has this
ridiculous reason, ha ha, to leave early and they never get to do it… And I think that for the
most part it is the, like, I feel very uncomfortable leaving too early because I feel like I am not
doing my job in the best way that I could possibly do it but then some days you just have to be
a little like have some mercy on yourself and just realize that this is the time, and the kids are
small for a very short period of time and this is just one phase and later on I am going to be
a different kind of worker hopefully. -Emmy
Emmy expresses feeling like a bad worker and feeling uncomfortable for not being able to contribute
fully to her work. This further shows what kind of pressure mothers are under in the labor market.
Mothers feel pressure for not being able to fully care for the children and pressure for not being able
to give everything to their work. Emmy’s reply also shows that she has had to consider and process
this deeply and felt bad about not being able to contribute fully to her work. As I continued by asking
Emmy if she thinks her husband experiences the same feelings or comments, she continued:
I honestly do not think that he does, usually when one of the kids get sick, I am the one who
stays at home, and sometimes we do have to negotiate because as a teacher if I have like an
exam or or someone is giving speeches or something like that I, I just sort of have to go to
work if there is a choice that he can stay and sometimes it’s kind of frustrating because then
he has something like one time there was, for example, he had this different day at work, they
were going to go I do not even remember they were going to do something fun, it was going
to be very refreshing for them, and then I actually had like a serious work day ahead of me, a
lot of speeches or something like that and I told him that he has to stay home and he was like
mad, ha ha, that he could not participate in that, in the fun... and also well in our family, he
works, he has to commute, he has to drive like 45 minutes to his work place and I, I work
closer so I am the one who takes the kids to daycare and picks them up so he never has this
issue that he would have to leave early or something like that so that is, I do not think that he
has ever had any comments about that. -Emmy
Emmy’s comments support Inari’s thought of how “everybody”, also often the fathers themselves,
think that it is the mothers’ job to take care of the children. This also shows that the attitude in the
labor market is that men do not have to make the same kinds of sacrifices regarding matching family
life and labor. Due to the fact that the male breadwinner attitude still exists, it is easier for fathers to
think that their work is more important and it is the mothers’ job to care for the private life, in other
words the children.
Regarding motherhood and negative attitudes in the labor market, even Felicia has had bad
experiences in her past while applying for jobs.

31

It is funny because my current occupation is XXXXX and we, we have really good gender
equality at work, we do not, we are on the same line, we have the same wage as the men in
our job, and in that sense and in that market it does not have a big, it is not a big deal. But
yeah, it is weird. But then when I think of my past, past jobs, I remember that I have been
asked about getting a family when I was like in my twenties, how I see my future and do I see
myself as a parent. And that is not right… I have heard quite many illegal things during my
past jobs. But it was not a thing then, nowadays you are more, you know your rights and you
know yourself and you are really confident. But I mean when you are in your twenties and
you want the job, you answer what they want to hear right. – Felicia
This is also illegal in Finland. Interviewers are not allowed to ask about possible future family plans.
When choosing an employee it is against the Equality Act that an employer discriminates against a
person due to pregnancy or something else that has to do with gender. (Finlex, 2021) However, this
is a problem in the labor market. Women are in a more vulnerable position when applying for jobs.
This also supports the idea and common attitude that women are responsible for the children. Women
are taught from a really young age that they have the main responsibility for the children and this
makes them also realize that it is a deal breaker in the labor market when applying for jobs.
When I asked Cassandra about how she has been treated in the labor market for being a mother and
a woman she replied:
Well not much about being a mother since the baby is so small. And well, I am actually going
to a new work, in one and a half months yeah, I got a new job ha ha so I resigned about two
or three weeks ago and I do not know how they think about if it has anything to do about me
being a mom or what, but let us see then, the new company I am going to is a Swedish, so I
am hoping they have a little bit more, well how would I say, processed equality plan. Cassandra
Cassandra did not have any experience of being a mother and being in the labor market yet, but as a
woman she explained that she had been questioned especially as she is working in a male-dominant
field.
Inari who works in the business field that I interviewed, was very open about the inequalities in their
relationship. When asked how political decisions could benefit mothers she wished that it was not an
option for the fathers to stay at home with children and she told me the following:
It would support it a lot because the men would realize how much work it is staying home
with small kids, and how much work there is at home and how boring it is and how horrible
it is sometimes and how fun it is actually to go to work where you get a nice salary and eat

32

your lunch and go to the toilet alone ha ha. We for instance did not, we divided all the costs
fifty-fifty, even though I was not working, with my ex-husband - Inari
This puts the mother at risk for social exclusion because the mother is responsible for her own
finances and when not working, they are not earning money. This is also a wider problem, because
women in general earn less than men and while not working and getting a social benefit, they have
even less money to manage with. Mothers are at risk of sliding into poverty.
When asking the participants how they divided work during parental leave, I learned that all families
had different arrangements, but mainly the responsibility for the children and household was put on
the mothers:
Parental leave time, well I was home for one year, with both of my kids, so they are two years
kind of apart, their births so, with my first born I was at home a little bit over one year, and
then I returned to work, and I worked for little bit less than one year, before our second child
was born. And as I said earlier that I am divorced, but I was married then with the father of
my kids. And, well domestically at home, we did not divide the household work so much. I
think even he would agree that I did most of, most of the work at home. -Inari
In the family of Inari, she was the only one on parental leave with both of their children and the
father did not take any parental leave at all. She also said that this inequality was one of the major
issues in their relationship that then ended in divorce. Emilia stated the following:
Well I stayed home for the whole two years and my partner was working. And yeah, we did
not, we did not discuss it so much because I was studying when I got pregnant, so I was going
back to school, not earning money, and he had his permanent job so I think we did not talk
about it so much but I think we both felt okay with it. When I was home with my son I did not
do a lot of housework, I think I just took care of our son, and then when my partner came
home we usually like went to the stores me or him or then made food together or I did not feel
like I had a lot of pressure to clean the house or cook food or anything like that when I was
at home and he was at work. But I feel like I did more of it, that was the case also before we
got a child. – Emilia
Emilia feels that both parents felt good about their arrangement. She also did not feel any pressure to
do other domestic work. Emmy said the both parents took the maximum leaves that are earmarked
for them and she took all the parental leave. About domestic work she explained the following:
Well for the first year I was home, with the both our younger children and while I was home
I did most of the cooking and cleaning and shopping and all that you know shopping for
groceries and stuff like that. And then when I went back to work um, well we sort of shared

33

some of the domestic work but um it has mostly been my task to, for example my husband does
not cook so I do all the cooking and grocery shopping and um, when they were smaller I think
that it was sort of like you can take the kids so that I can do hovering or whatever so so that
way I guess somehow it was shared, but I think that for the most part it is on my shoulders to
do the work - Emmy
Emmy feels that most of the work load is on her shoulders. This can create conflicts in relationships
and also create unnecessary pressure for mothers in the labor market. Women being responsible for
domestic work and the male breadwinner attitude can be seen in these kinds of arrangements. Felicia
discusses these conflicts in her reply to the same question.
I think I have been kind of like a, not tiger parenting but a tiger mom in that sense that I
wanted to take control of everything in the beginning, concerning domestic work, concerning
childcare everything. I wanted to have it all. And that is why we had these conflicts as I think
quite many new parents have. But when our son got a bit older, we somehow managed to
rearrange our roles in this family. And also then concerning labor market in this this moment
that we are in, that my husband gives me the time to study as much as I need and then he takes
care of our son and also domestic work. Although not in in the same amount that I do. But I
think it is, it is also because I want to take care of everything. I don’t let him take care of most
of the tours in our household – Felicia
Felicia also shared that she was at home for the nine months, mothers’ leave and parental leave, and
her husband took the maximum of the fathers’ leave. Cassandras reply is interesting, because she is
the only one that shared the parental leaves equally.
Well we had a long discussion even before trying to get pregnant and how we could, or would
divide our parental leaves, and for me it was very clear from the start, that a dad should have
equal right to spend time with their kid, and stay at home and since I knew that my husband
has been staying at home with his older kids, so I already knew that he is very willing to this
also with this youngest one. And that way I was checking the, how long all are all the leaves,
then which ones are like only for a mom and how long leave there is for dad and what is the
part that we could divide. And then we decided that we try to split it half. And now as we have
agreed, um, my husband will be stay at home dad in a few weeks when our baby is six months
old and I will stay at home having my yearly vacation for one month, so we are going to be
together for one month and then I am going back to work. And domestic work we share very
equally and most of the times, of course when I have been more at home, the better the baby
sleeps more I have also time to do some household chores here. But, I think as a person I am
very strict to my spouse that we share these things, despite of the work we are doing. It is like
no others work is more important than others, so we should also be equal at home. –
Cassandra
All except one family in my study have had the mother staying at home most of the time and the one
family who has divided the parental leaves evenly has had to do the research for it and make conscious

34

choices regarding it. In four out of five families, domestic work has mostly been done by the mothers.
The family who divides it evenly has done so out of a conscious choice.
As the participants in my research have shown, the majority of the mothers took the parental leaves,
which is one reason for the loop of gender pay gap and parental leaves to continue existing. As Levitas
(2008) observed, for women to be fully integrated into the labor market, the men need to take
responsibility at home. I argue that this has not happened in the Finnish society and it will not be
solved unless political action is taken to address the inequalities.
If being an active member in the labor market brings inclusion, mothers who are outside of it for their
maternity leave period are excluded. Regarding the definition of social exclusion, I argue that having
a child and being on maternity leave can cause short-term exclusion from the wider society. Mothers
in Finland use the most of the parental leave and are, for example, in a less beneficial position when
they do not earn money than they were before their maternity leave. In my research, it became clear
that this is an issue in the Finnish society, even though research shows that the Finnish society is often
presented as the most equal society in the public discourse. Finnish exceptionalism hides the problems
with motherhood and social exclusion.
As I have presented, Finnish mothers fall behind in salary development, as they take most of the
parental leaves. This was also the case with the mothers I interviewed. However, in my opinion, the
fault is not with the families. As Finnish women earn on average 16% less than men (Finnish Institute
of Health and Welfare. 2021), when families decide who will take the parental leave, it is usually
financially more profitable for the family, if the mother stays home. This creates a loop in my opinion.
The problem can also be seen in research. As Giddens and Sutton (2017) argue, the pay gap between
women and men should be narrowed down to be able to share domestic work more equally.
5.2. Gender equality and parenting
When I asked the participants about gender equality, they all agreed that there still is work to be done
in the field of gender equality regarding parenting in Finland. Inari had an example of how she was
treated after her children started daycare:
There is no gender equality in Finland being a parent, ha ha, I think. that society kind of
supports the division of work that we for example had, and well if you for instance compare

35

to Sweden, where most men also take parental leave and take lots of it. I think in Finland it is
still so uncommon that it is kind of not, or when I went to work when my first born and my
second born, no actually it even it was worse when we had my second born, he went to daycare
when he was under one year old, and he could not for instance walk yet… and I got all the
comments, that how can I you know put such a small baby to daycare, to public daycare even,
not like some family daycare, and my husband got none, even though I had already been home
with him for one year, and he did not want to. So, that is a little bit, or a lot unequal. He got
no negative comments, I got all the negative comments… that I was selfish and wanted to go
back to work. When actually it was that my husband did not want to stay at home at all. So,
that is why the child had to go to daycare. – Inari
This is a difficult problem regarding parenting in Finland. This further shows how the main attitude
is that the mother is responsible for the children and also the choices made regarding the children.
When the children go to daycare it is the mothers’ responsibility to decide when they start and if it is
“too early” according to the general attitudes, the mother is “selfish” and wants to go back to work.
I feel like in my case I thought that I wanted to be at home with my child and I felt that
breastfeeding was really important so it was kind of a really tight bond from the beginning,
because I was breastfeeding and then he was always sleeping next to me and I felt like I was
the number one parent at that time so of course it is not equal.… of course when the child
get’s older and when you separate and now we have fifty-fifty, um like we are taking care of
him equally. So, both of us has to do our part like 100% of it. So now I feel it is really equal.
I feel like I was doing more of it and more of the, like how do you call it, this, taking care of
like if a friend at the daycare is having a birthday party and you need to buy a present and
you need to buy new shoes and stuff like that that you have in your brain that needs to be
fixed. I feel like women carry a lot of that…. So, it is not equal, actually it is not equal now
also because I do that still, ha ha,, more than the father. -Emilia
Emilia still has more responsibility of their child even though they are co-parenting. When I asked
her how she feels about that she replied.
It is kind of mixed because I think we are so used to these gender roles, that we kind of feel
like we want to control everything, and so we want to be doing all those micro-managing
things, but I do not know if we really want to when we like look at it from a little bit like
further. I do not know I think it is a lot of it is learned and then we kind of accept it. - Emilia
Here we come back to Inari’s thought that society supports the unequal division of labor. Emilia
thinks of the division of responsibility and norms that kind of guide parents to do what they do. The
roles sit so tight in the structures of the society and it is interesting how slow the change is regarding
this. Felicia also talked earlier about wanting to be in charge of everything and how that brought
conflicts in their relationships.

36

Emmy thinks the following about gender equality and parenting in Finland:
Hmm, well if I ever have children again I would love to be a father, seems like a very easy
thing to do, ha ha. I do not know, because in my case, my husband is about ten years older
than me and I think that he has a very, kind of an old-fashioned way of thinking of what is the
mothers job and what is the fathers job and I know that his father does cook and he does a lot
of stuff… In the summer time my husband is the one who takes care of like cutting the grass
and taking care of whatever garden we have or whatever, but he does not really, in the winter
time when there is not a lot to do outside, of course he always shovels the snow but in the
house he does not have that many tasks that he really takes, of course he has always said and
I know it is true, that if I tell him that could you please hover, then yes he is going to do it, but
I have always felt that that is, cause I feel like I have to be some kind of a boss like I have to
be the one who says you do this and I do that and that is kind of tiring, it would be nicer if he
would just understand that he has to participate on his own without me saying about it. But,
yeah I think that, he has a very old fashioned like thinking about it and that is just the way it
has somehow like I somehow blame myself for not asking him more, ha ha. -Emmy
Inari, Emilia and Emmy all struggle with the same issue; it is expected of the mothers to be in charge.
This brings pressure in the mothers’ lives and support the division of domestic labor in families.
Regarding gender equality, Felicia thought the following:
Big topic. It is quite hard in the beginning because in my opinion and I mean physiologically
the mother is a key person to this newborn child, and you somehow live in a bubble with the
child, and you tend to forget everything outside the bubble and now when you ask me about
gender equality, I do not know if I have ever quite like processed this thought during these
years. But I mean, if I, if I look at my parents how they, or their gender equality during our
childhood, it was a very different, so I can see an improvement in that, in that sense that the
father has the chance to take a leave from work, and also do not know about other employees
but my husband’s work is really somehow positive towards fatherhood and um, which is kind
of rare I think, nowadays, as well but if I look back at my parents, I do not think my father
was for example, in the room with my mother during her second labor with my brother, it was
not a thing then. But nowadays you are more equal and, the father has the right to be there
and also, also at home taking care of the baby, so, in that sense, maybe there is more equality
in that sense but a hard question. -Felicia
Felicia is in the same line with Emilia who said that we are so used to these gender roles that there is
not much to do about it. Like Felicia said, there has been much of improvement in the fathers’ rights
to spend time with their children or be present during labor. The new law about parental leave in
Finland also makes the opportunities more equal as the parents will have the right to the same amount
of leaves. Also the more fathers take parental leave the more common it will become at work places
and the it will create a more positive atmosphere regarding fatherhood and parental leave. When
asking Cassandra if there is gender equality regarding parenting in Finland, she replied:

37

Absolutely not. Ha ha, like fathers have been seen like mommy’s little helpers no matter how
much or little they do with their kids or how independent they are or do they do their own
decisions or whatever but they are, every time like mom is in charge, and then dad is very
kind to help. And like it is not a hundred percent parenting, it is something they do like for
their own will and they could just be not doing it. Like that is never a choice to a mom, like
stop being a mom, like doing parenting. And nobody expects that. - Cassandra
Cassandra summarizes the issue with gender equality regarding parenting. Mothers are in charge and
it is expected of the mothers to make all choices regarding the children. This is what Inari talked
about when she went back to work and got comments on how she could have such a small child in
daycare. It was not seen as a choice they made as parents but a choice Inari made as a selfish mother.
Emilia talked about being in charge all the time and if women really want to do that or is it only
learned. Emmy talked about how they divide domestic work and how she is the one that says who do
what. I continued asking Cassandra how this makes her feel and she replied:
Annoyed, mostly. Yeah but I know, I know these attitudes are very old and sit very tight. And
only by the changes trying to be an example myself and whenever there is a chance I will
openly speak about our choice to share these parental leaves. -Cassandra
Cassandra who shares caring for children equally with her husband, is possibly able to do so because
they have shared the parental leave equally and the father has had to take the main responsibility of
the child during the baby year. This shows that political decisions can bring gender equality. At
current it still is optional for the fathers to take parental leave, and if they would do it more, it could
become more equal.
5.3.Attitudes and motherhood
Berg’s research is at the core to understanding why the roles sit so tight regarding having children
even in the contemporary Finnish society. The problems in the labor market, attitudes about
breastfeeding, women doing all the domestic work all come down to the history of motherhood and
it being so traditional. Discussing motherhood and pressure with the participants, they said:
You cannot always like, because things do not always go the way you want to, and the kids,
your own behavior towards the children is not always what you wish because you are tired
or busy or overloaded or something so… I think everybody wants the best for their kids and
sometimes you yourself cannot be your best cause you are a human being and not always
perfect so, um, but yes when it comes to your children then you would kind of want to be
always your best version of yourself and that is not nearly all the time possible. So. it is

38

frustrating sometimes I think there is a lot of pressure on mothers especially on parents in
general as well, but especially on mothers to kind of or women in general who are mothers
that you have to you know be perfect at work or perfect wife or girlfriend and perfect mother
and everything … and then take care of yourself really well which is practically impossible. Inari
Inari talks about the pressure of being a good mother and being a good worker. I think this is a
reoccurring theme in the interviews. Mothers are expected to be good workers and also have the main
responsibility for the children. Inari also expresses feelings of failure to meet with all the expectations
that are put on mothers. Emilia thinks about the attitudes in the following way:
Well, since I am not living in a traditional family, we are separated with my sons father, I feel
like I am a, I feel like I am a pretty regular mom, but also a little bit out of the box mom, and
maybe in a good way. I think I am pretty laid back, but also when it becomes stressful I can
be not so laid back, I have actually had a few comments, that say that I seem to be a great
mom, and doing like my own thing with my son and that it looks somehow maybe cozy or laid
back, or fun maybe. And that one colleague said that if she ever would be a mom she would
hope that she would be like me as a mom, so that was nice to hear. -Emilia
Emilia likes to do her own thing and not follow the norms that much. She also says it can be because
she is separated and that already is breaking the norm. Emmy thinks the following about being a
mother:
Well, um, I have been a mother for all of my adulthood, I, I had my first born when I was
seventeen so I have never been an adult without being a mother and it was a very lifechanging
experience to have a child, I think that for the first time in my life I truly understood what it
means to love someone so much that you are ready to do absolutely anything. And my kids
are the most important thing in my life, it does not stop me from having a career or having
other ambitions in life but when it comes down to, they are the most important thing … with
my oldest, people have said that my daughter is terrific and that I have done a good job with
her and with her we were, it was just the two of us for a very long time so I sort of take credit
for that, ha ha,I think that she has grown up to be a tremendous person and I love her to
pieces and I’m very proud of her and I think that somehow shows that I have not done
everything wrong that there are things that I have done right as a parent. -Emmy
Emmy’s experience shows that she has been stressing about doing motherhood right, and that is one
example of how stressful it is to be a mother in Finland. The society has huge expectations on mothers
and this is one way of it showing. Inari said being a mother is hard and Felicia is in the same line with
that thought. When asking about how it feels being a mother, Felicia replied:
The best job ever. And the hardest as well. It has given me so much. I have always wanted to
be a mother. It has been quite like I imagined it to be. I am a, how to say, I am a quite a
39

confident mother, I know what I believe in, and I know how I want my son to grow up, in
which kind of environment. I am really strict about that. And I also want to be a fun mom, like
everyone wants to be, and I hope I will succeed in that as well. I am not that strict, my husband
is more strict with our son. But I love being a mom. - Felicia
Motherhood has given very much to the mothers I interviewed in general. They speak about
motherhood in a mainly positive way and want the best for their children. Cassandra feels that being
a mother is naturally a part of being herself:
Motherhood is not like something I can differ from my person itself so it is just like become a
part of being me. It is not something separate or distant anymore like I thought when I was
pregnant, it maybe felt a little bit that way.. – Cassandra
Motherhood feels natural to Cassandra. Discussing attitudes I will start with Cassandra because she
and her husband shared the leaves equally. I asked if she had to convince the father to take parental
leave or if they had to convince anyone else:
Well the most easier it has been to ourselves, ha ha, but not that much for others. And I feel it
a little bit annoying that I have faced like tens of questions like how can I leave such a small
baby with their dad and how are they going to spend their days and am I sure about this since,
am I not willing to spend time with my baby. And every time I have to answer that the more
important than my will is also the father’s rights to spend time with the baby. And as a man
my husband has also faced a little bit wonders but they have only been positive like wow like
dad of the year, ha ha , and you are, you are very much praised to do this. Everyone is praising
him for being so wonderful dad who want to stay home like it would have been wonderful
from me to give him this opportunity. Like I am the kind of a bad mom who wanted to go back
to work and he is the most fantastic dad when he wants to stay at home. Like it would not be
our choice. -Cassandra
I think that Cassandra is at the core in understanding what is wrong in Finland regarding gender
equality, parenting and the labor market attitudes. Women are considered to be bad mothers when
they want to have a career and men are considered to be fantastic fathers when they want to stay home
with their children. Women get behind in the labor market and men win whatever they do. When
discussing possible judgement, the participants have gotten from the society, they shared the
following thoughts:
Maybe when someone heard that I had a one-year-old children or young children and I had
already come back to work, yes, some people commented on that. That I should be home
taking care of my children, and not at work. -Inari

40

Mothers in Finland feel much pressure to succeed in racing children as it is the mothers’ job to take
care of the children. The common attitude is also that mothers should enjoy being at home (Giddens
& Sutton, 2017). This had brought annoyance for, for example, Inari who thought that it should not
be a father own choice to take parental leave, and men would notice how, for example, nice it is to
go to work instead of staying at home. Here we step on other issues as, for example, Cassandra and
Inari both had had experiences and wonders of them not taking care of small children at home when
they went back to work. This shows that the traditional gender roles still exist. Cassandra met wonders
if she was not enjoying the time she spent with her baby. The fathers of Inari and Cassandras children
were not treated inappropriately regarding them taking or not taking care of their children at home.
Interviewing Cassandra about them sharing the leaves showed that men get positive feedback if they
take parental leave. This is different than Giddens and Suttons (2017) claim that men would get
criticism if they stay at home.
I continued by asking Inari how the commenting felt and she replied:
Maybe frustrated that we are actually live in the, well I had my first child in 2013, and the
second one in 2016, but in 2000 like year, we still have that kind of opinions. Or sad.
Frustrated and sad probably. And annoyed at the person who said it. -Inari
Inari wished the attitudes would change. Inari’s experience in the labor market can also be found in
Cassandras experience of “ Like I am the kind of a bad mom who wanted to go back to work” and
her getting questions about her not being willing to spend time with the baby.
When discussing interaction with the participants, Emilia started by replying:
I think when I got pregnant and had my child and when he was still a baby and younger my
interactions with other people… surrounded, or it was a lot about the child and being a
mother and diapers and breastfeeding and sleeping habits and everything like that but when
the child gets older it it becomes less less like määrittelevä (defining) for me the part of me
being a mother it is not in the focus like or all the time. Because then it was, it was something
I chose and I wanted to be first and foremost a mother. Now also, but also other things that I
feel passionate about. I feel like I have now more space to flex in between the being a mother
and being a woman and being a friend, and being a partner. -Emilia
Emilia says that with a baby a mother is mostly a mother but with an older child a mother has more
roles than just a mother. She continued by talking about judgement:

41

I think all of us have felt that kind of judgement or advice, mainly from my ex-partners mother,
mother-in-law was keen on giving advice. I think she would not call it judgement but I took it
as judgement a few times. But I think it also involves when you are new with the, like new with
motherhood, you take advice also like judgement. But sometimes people could just be quiet.
People tend to have a lot of opinions on how you should be a mother. And it is really so much
more than people expect of you when you are being a father. When I was a new mother, I
guess like because you are so new to everything and you are unsure about many things. I think
you listen to them more, or you give them more like weight, the comments, but I think, I think
also then I had this, kind of this feeling that somehow okay you can have your opinion but I
know what I am doing, most of the time. But when my son gets older I feel less paineita
(pressure). And when I am already like out of the ordinary that I do not have like this usual
family, so I think that I can do whatever I want. -Emilia
It is clear that a lot of the times, mothers are attacked with advice that feels like judgement. And with
a baby, it feels more important than it actually is. When discussing going to places with the children,
Emilia continued that:
I think I have avoided places for my own mental health and also for everyone elses sake, ha
ha, not going to places that I know my child would be bored and make a lot of noise and stuff
like that. But I am not sure if I would have wanted to go to those places but now when I say
this I am thinking is this also like something that society tells me to think, that I do not even
want to do those things.. well if it would be more okay to bring kids to different places then
maybe I would like it, if it would be more normal, I do not know. But I was using cloth diapers
and we are vegetarians and my child is still sleeping next to me and I was breastfeeding him
for two years, I think that I did a lot of these things and did not listen to people saying he
should be in his own bed or I should stop breastfeeding him, so I feel like a lot of things I did
not listen to, to other people’s opinions. I feel like people should just stop caring about what
other people do with their lives and with their parenting. I think parenting would need to be
seen as something, something really normal and like I do not know why it is so, why people
have a lot of opinions about it because it is so normal. A lot of people have children and
become parents why is it so, ha ha, I cannot find the word. Like why is it such a arka aihe
(sensitive subject), when it is so normal. -Emilia
Emilia questions her own choices of where she has taken her son and she the whole attitude about
parenting. This shows that there is that kind of bad attitudes regarding parenting that make mothers
feel anxiety over. Emmy speaks about loneliness:
In a certain way maybe, well of course when I was seventeen, and had a baby, I would not
even have anyone, like none of my friends had kids and then, um, when I went to study in the
university, most of my friends did not have kids and um well I guess it was for a very long time
kind of lonely in a way that, of course I had friends that, I became friends with people who
did not have kids and we did get to spend time, but I could not always participate because
sometimes I just had to stay home, I could not have my daughter to spend time somewhere
else all the time and then later on with the younger kids, I have for example this one friend
who has, who have the two kids and they have like they’ve been born like a week apart both

42

of them so we spent a lot of time on our maternity leave, and I think that it was, it was a
blessing because for the most part I was again very lonely... - Emmy
The experience of loneliness is in line with relational social exclusion. Not having peer or social
contacts brings feelings of loneliness and feelings of being socially excluded. Emmy also said it is
hard to combine life with children to the surrounding life. I continued by asking her if she thinks
fathers have the same kinds of problems:
With their friends.., I do not think it has been easy for him either. -Emmy
Emmy’s answer shows that even father’s experience difficulties in combining being with children
and living life to the fullest. Emmy felt that her husband also felt lonely. Of going to places with
children, Emmy said:
I do not think that they behave very well, and it is very stressful because I am always worried
that they are going to like drop something or mess something up. If I had to I would, I do not
think that I honestly do not care what other people think. We do and before this whole covid
thing, we did used to go to the restaurants every once in a while, and for the most part they
behaved pretty well in those, of course with a very small child, I did always feel that it was, a
little inconvenient because, well for example our son was a screamer, he screamed for hours,
I was not able to watch any domestic series because I needed subtitles so that I could follow
the story, so I think I avoided those situations quite some time. I think that and also, I
breastfeeded my children for quite some time so that was somehow I guess an issue. I used to
breastfeed at like public places but I never felt very good about it. It was not, well I mean who
wants to take out their boob in in front of everyone else and do that, so. Nowadays maybe they
have places where you can do that in a peaceful place and that is, that can encourage people
to go out but, truthfully when the kids were very small I think that I was so tired, that the idea
of going somewhere was just very stressful so I did not do that a lot. It was always a like total
mayhem to go somewhere and when you are really tired, you do not want that so.. -Emmy
Emmy talks about it being difficult to go to places with children because the children will not
necessarily behave well and according to the expectations of others and because of breastfeeding.
When asking Felicia to describe her interaction with people. Had it changed before and after she had
children, she explained the following:
No, I do not believe so. I might have gotten a bit lazy. And, maybe I am too confident to
somehow take people’s reactions in consideration and somehow, you just do not give a shit
anymore. To speak it out. As much as I did before, it was a huge part of my life always thinking
about what other people thought of me and my actions and everything but nowadays you
somehow let it go because you have this tiny human in your hands and that is what matters
the most and yeah. Small things do not bother me anymore. But otherwise I think I stayed
quite the same and my yeah my values are still the same. -Felicia
43

Felicia does not think that she thinks about what other people think. I continued by asking her if she
had gotten any judgements, opinions or advice and she replied:
I believe that I think so but the people who did or comment or say something, did not know
that they were kind of attacking me. Because when you are a mother, you tend to take
everything, even though I just said I do not give a shit, but concerning motherhood, and in the
beginning, you are quite vulnerable, so, I remember this one time we were, we had this baby
swimming classes, and then I put my son on the stool in the locker room, and then this old
lady came by, and then she started holding my child, and then she just said that I am just
holding you child so he does not fall off this chair, and for me it meant that I am a bad mother,
that somebody has to come and take care of my child because she thinks the child is going to
fall down from the chair and I was not observant enough to realize that. So, these are the
things you might take a bit hard on yourself, if somebody thinks you want to harm your child
in that sense. She judged me. And then the worst person to judge is your husband’s mother.
But as I said it is easier now, and I am in that stage that I do not give a shit anymore so. But
the first year is hard. You are trying to find yourself as a mother and then you are really
vulnerable. - Felicia
I continued by asking Felicia if she changed her behavior due to other people’s opinions and she
replied:
I have to say I have not changed my actions or my opinions because when my son was two
months, we did a tour in a Michelin star restaurant with my friends. We had five strollers, and
five under half-year-old babies and we went to have lunch in a Michelin star restaurant in
Helsinki City. And you should have seen the faces when we walked in. And we did it because
we could. We did not want to have a Michelin star lunch, we would have been fine with you
know a ten euro lunch somewhere in Helsinki but we wanted to do that because we have never
seen small children in fine restaurants. In Finland we are still in that stage that you have to
keep your children away from all public places until they can behave, but how can they
behave, if you never take them anywhere, so that was the point for that, and I have always
before the whole pandemic, XXXXX has been with me everywhere. Fine restaurants, he was
three months when we took our first trip, I did not if he cried or anything because that is
normal, children do cry. But if we do not ever take them places, they will never learn and
people will never learn. We still have attitudes towards children in our country. Don’t you
dare take that child to a restaurant, and it might be that if they cry, people think that they will
ruin their dinner, but I think people who are really wasted during dinners are really annoying
and ruins my, my perception of that so no, I have not changed my actions in any way I believe.
-Felicia
This goes in line with Emilia’s thought on how to normalize having children. Felicia did not feel she
had been excluded from happenings:

44

Certainly, but I mean they are events or happenings that I do not mind being excluded from,
I mean, everything that has to do with long dinners and, friend dinner or restaurant nights or,
or something to do with alcohol, might be excluded but I do not think, I do not like the word
in that sense excluded because I do not believe that I have been. -Felicia
The pressure mothers today experience can also be tracked down to, for example, how motherhood
was controlled before. Mothers were guided strongly by authorities and mothers should race the
children according to literature that was meant to control mothers. Still today, mothers are the ones
who feel anxiety if their children, for example, behave badly in public. This is one of the major results
in my study. Felicia talked about children not being welcome in the society, and also that how could
children learn to behave if they are never taken to any public places. The majority of the participants
felt that children that cried in public places were bothering others, hence the choices of going to places
caused pressure for the mothers. Research shows that mothers get the blame for badly behaving
children. (Byvelds & Jackson, 2019). Interaction shapes motherhood, and the interviews showed that
all mothers had been more or less criticized in some way in their day-to-day lives. If a mother is
bullied by someone or the society for making their own choices that differ from the collective identity,
it can cause anxiety and pressure. Interaction form people (Giddens & Sutton, 2017). And with this,
motherhood is also formed through interaction.
Emmy discusses important issues regarding motherhood and going to places with children. I argue
that her experiences are really common regarding feeling lonely, breastfeeding, father’s loneliness
and avoiding public places. Could this be fought by making parenting “normal” like Emilia
suggested? Would Emmy also feel comfortable to go places if it would be more normal. Emmy’s
experience and feeling about public breastfeeding can be an example of the problems with the
internalized male gaze.
When asking Cassandra about possibly changing her behavior, she replied:
Not really towards all the people, of course the covid situation has just been a real struggle
since we have not been anywhere, we have been stuck inside home. I was thinking about going
to some mom coffees and whatever baby groups but there have not been none. So, I have only
seen my few friends. But maybe my attitudes towards small children are more like calmer
now, since I understand better how hard it can be to keep the baby happy and quiet and for
example in the busses or whatever public transportation I have, it can be a really hard
situation for a mom if the baby just starts screaming, nothing will help so, I am more emphatic
and patient in those situations. - Cassandra

45

These thoughts go throughout the interviews and it somehow shows that children are actually not
welcome in the society because they do not behave according to society’s expectations. This at least
is the experience of the mothers and that way they might change their behavior to suit the expectations
by not going to places or, like Felicia, making a statement by going to a Michelin star restaurant with
babies.
I asked Cassandra about opinions, advice, judgement from someone regarding her being a mother
and she replied:
Well, no one has questioned it so straight from me, if I would not want to be at home. It is just
general wondering, like, it is not a normal situation. And it is like would it not be a fantastic
opportunity to spend a year at home. Okay maybe it would but I think it would be very wrong
to do for the dad. And also I just found out a few weeks ago that if mom wishes she can keep
all the parental leave days and nobody even asks from the dad if they want to have. Mom just
can apply all the days for herself, and that is it. So, it does not sound very equal to me. And
one case where I have got judgement about being a mom is when XXXX was, she was maybe
two weeks old. She was born with caesarian section so, I was in a little bit pain after she was
born, and it was maybe the second time when I was out with her pushing a stroller. She was
asleep at first but then she started crying and I had listened to a book with earphones when I
was walking, and the baby started screaming and I started shushing her, but still some women
came to me like hey, do you hear, your baby is crying, will you not do anything like you do
not hear her cry, you have those earphones like okay, I really do, are there that kind of
earphones even existing which would block a baby cry that well? It was like well thank you
for your kind words, I really hear my baby cry, I try to do my best to keep her quiet and happy.
-Cassandra
And on how it made her feel, she added:
Well I was like okay it has been two weeks since baby is born and I am already judged by
strangers, which never happened before. Like they already knew better than I do, what to do.
And that was a very stupid assumption like have they not ever tried these noise cancelling
earphones, they do not block noises like that. -Cassandra
Both Felicia and Cassandra has had comments from strangers about something they are doing with
their babies. This is very odd and does not happen in any other field in the society. It is somehow
okay to comment on mothers’ behavior. I asked Cassandra f she changed her behavior she replied:
Well the few times I have and I have been like in the shopping center or restaurant, there have
not been so many times, because of this situation, well, I have left the places if the baby has
been crying so much that other people are annoyed, or I feel that I am disturbing others.
Maybe that is one of the clear examples of how my behavior has changed. -Cassandra

46

Although she has changed her behavior because her child has been crying in public, she thinks that
children are welcome in the society:
Yeah, I have not faced any, any kind of intolerance in that way that made me feel like I am not
welcome somewhere with the baby. It is more that my assumptions about that people do not
want to hear babies screaming, since I remember very well how I felt before I had a baby of
my own. -Cassandra
Cassandra is sure that she will be excluded from situations and happening in the future because she
has children.
Children crying is a theme that goes through all the interviews regarding changing behaviour because
of children and children being welcome in the society. All mothers discussed this in some way except
Inari who said she had not changed her behaviour. This is in line with the research by Clarissa Carden,
who spoke about Women having the main responsibility of raising children, and therefor women are
to blame if children do not behave according to the norms.
Policies regarding motherhood are important, and I asked my participants how political decisions
could benefit mothers and gender equality regarding being a parent. All participants had ideas:
I do not think it should be a choice if the man stays home with the small kids because the
mother do not have a choice either. -Inari
So, I think there is some problem with the like normal family unit and expectations that the
society and the people in the family has of it. I think there needs to be some like, that there is
no other option, I do not know how to like fix the laws of like taking care of the child like
during parental leave and that the men get more involved and that the women let them be
more involved and that it’s somehow more equal from the beginning. Of course there is these
biological things that like breastfeeding and this in the beginning but then and somehow, and
the attitude that also the men like that it is, well of course the men have to, let go of something
to be more involved in the parenting and the woman can maybe gain something in the labor
market when they let go of being the managers at home so I think both needs to loose and also
get more of in exchange. -Emilia
Both Inari and Emilia support the idea that political decisions should be made so that the fathers
would have to take parental leaves. Emmy has a different idea of making the labor market more equal.
She says that:
There is a very simple solution to that, I think that the maternity leave money should be taken
from both the mother and the father, so with that we would bring tons of equality to women,
47

and I think that they have been talking about, they have to take the time like, you are going to
be home for six months and you are going to be home for six months, and I do not think that
that is going to work because, on the other hand we should be encouraging women to
breastfeed, and if we are telling them that you cannot stay home with the baby because the
father has to stay home with the baby, then we are stepping on other issues. And the best way
to bring, to make it even is that you take the money from the both of both. So that that would
be a very important thing. I do not understand why they have not already done this. This is a
very simple thing in my mind.- Emmy
When asked if political decisions are the ones who can make a difference, she added:
Yes, exactly, yes, and not the kind that that, splits the time, the kind that splits the money
because that is simple. And that would bring, that would actually help also all the women who
do not want to have children. This is not something that would only help the mothers, this
would actually bring people, because then it would make a difference, if you have a woman
and a man, applying for a job, you would not, I mean because the father might have to pay
for the father’s baby just as well so, that would make things even. -Emmy
Emmy’s suggestion would in fact make the labor market more equal, and help families to have more
opportunity to share the leaves. At least then, the question of which parent stays home with the child
would not be a financial issue.
People need to change their attitudes, labor market is a hard thing because, if you put your
child into daycare when they are nine months and the maternity leave, or is it parental leave
is over, everyone at work says that the child is too young to be in childcare, but then if you
stay home for two years, that is too long, although people say that the best place to be for a
child is home, but then if you take two years off work, I mean it is so hard to come back.
Depends on your work, I have a, in that, in that sense my work is really good for maternity
leaves, because it does not change that much. But I mean, in a hectic job, staying at home for
two years is too long. So it is a dilemma and it is, they say that it is, you have to stay at home
for a longer period of time but then if you do stay, it is also too long, so… it is a new thing in
Finland for fathers to stay at home. I think actually my husband is one of the, the rare people
or the rare fathers who did take advantage of the whole father leave. And I mean that is kind
of short, short period of time. But then for the fathers to stay at home for a longer period of
time, would be something really new. I mean, yeah but the attitudes, the attitudes should
change but how, I do not know. I do not know. People having more children. That is the
problem in Finland. - Felicia
Felicia brings out a new topic in the interviews regarding attitudes. Both Inari and Emilia think that
attitudes change after political decisions are made. Felicia thinks Finnish families should have more
children, and that would change the attitudes in the labor market too. Cassandra replies to the same
question in the following way:

48

Yeah, they would but only if the parental leaves could be shared more equal. I like these new
suggestions where there are months that you can, you can more freely share between parents.
I think that many many women think that like breast feeding is, is not possible if they are not
staying at home for a year. Well I am breast feeding and I am going to continue it despite I
am going back to work. So, I do not think that is really a problem. Most of the women all
around the world are breastfeeding their babies when they are working. So, it is a very rare
situation like globally that women could stay at home for this long. But I still respect those
views so I, I do not like the idea about forcing mothers back to work when their babies are
small but for more chances to share the leaves. - Cassandra
Cassandras points are interesting because she is the only one of the participants who shared the
parental leaves fifty-fifty with her husband. She thinks the choices should be voluntary but there
should be more options to share the leaves. Unlike Emmy, she thinks it is possible to share the leaves
and breastfeed.
As can be seen in my interviews, mothers think that political decisions need to be made to bring more
equality in parenting. It can, for instance be the kind that was suggested by the mothers I interviewed,
that forces the fathers to take parental leave, or the kind that splits the money. I argue, that parental
leave benefits cannot be voluntary for the fathers, because in that way, attitudes in the labor market
could shift into the day-to-day lives of the Finnish families. Moreover, Emmy’s suggestion of
dividing the costs of parental leave benefits between the parent’s employers is good regarding the
labor market and gender equality.
Cassandra who I interviewed was pregnant when the first wave of covid19 started. She described
herself feeling sad about her maternity leave while she was so isolated:
It has been a little bit sad since this, this baby is going to be my only one, we do not want
more children and since I have, I am this old, kind of, for a mom, I have had plenty of time to
think about it earlier like, if I had a baby, what would I do? And I had some expectations and
when I was pregnant there were not any support groups for anything, it was not enjoyable
“sit in the cafés for the last days before labor”, I have been stuck at home for so long and a
year ago when this covid situation started, when no one knew how bad it would be, I have
been extra careful, and I have been distant working, for all the time I have been at work so,
we are all getting very tired about this just staying at home and seeing each others faces. Well
maybe it was a good thing to spend, spend half a year home before getting this baby, at least
we know that we get along well enough, so we have not had any, any like a big troubles. And
since my maternity leave is kind of short, I would have enjoyed sitting in café’s, going to some
baby swimming or whatever, but now it have not happened. -Cassandra
This topic, the effects of covid19 on motherhood, will need further research in the future. Cassandra
has suffered from relational exclusion during her pregnancy and after having her child.

49

In the interviews I gave examples on different kinds of commenting mothers had had during the time
they had been mothers, and it not only shapes their own perception of them as mothers but also the
norms about motherhood are formed in this way. While the atmosphere, as can be seen in the
interviews, is so negative regarding motherhood, the image as a whole is negative. Like Felicia said:
You are trying to find yourself as a mother and then you are really vulnerable. – Felicia
Mothers also carry the responsibility for shaping these norms and the society in Finland does not
contribute in making it better for the mothers. However, the new legislation on parental leaves is an
improvement in my opinion, it does not necessarily bring more gender equality as it still is voluntary
for the fathers to take parental leave. I think also collective identity, as presented by Giddens & Sutton
(2017) forms the mother role more than any one family’s choices regarding gender equality. As it is
now, mothers are left alone in living up to the conflicted expectations that they face. Like Felicia
stated, labor market is hard, because whatever a mother does, it is wrong. If they stay at home for a
long time it is not good as they should have their own life and be a part of the labor market. However,
going back to work when being a mother of a small child, a mother faces much criticism for her
choices. This experience was clearly shown by Cassandra and Inari.

50

6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Due to the fact that the term social exclusion is multidimensional makes it is a perfect lens through
which motherhood in Finland can be viewed. As Mathieson et al. (2008) have argued, social
exclusion still exists because the societies do not react to unequal power relationships. (Mathieson et
al., 2008). This is an issue in the Finnish society regarding motherhood because, as can be seen in
my interviews, women who are socially active members of society, are discriminated against in the
labor market and take much of the responsibility regarding domestic work. Gender equality does not
exist and is hidden due to Finnish exceptionalism and the fact that Finland as a country wants to
market itself as being the best regarding gender equality. The results in my thesis say otherwise.
Besides being discriminated against in the labor market and being responsible for most of the
domestic work, mothers have to face inappropriate attitudes and opinions in their day-to-day lives.
While Levitas (2008) argued that the term social exclusion has failed to address unpaid work, I argue
that as long as the context is made clear, social exclusion can be used to discuss the problems with
motherhood in Finland. The term social exclusion can bring awareness to issues with gender equality
and labor market discrimination as long as the context is clear. Research has also shown that women
living in poverty can manage, by being members of community networks but do not escape being
socially excluded in this way. (Gosling, 2008). I argue that it clearly does not help that women create
their own mothers’ groups and discuss issues regarding motherhood and gender equality there,
because the issues are well known. Despite these groups, as can be seen in my results, nothing major
has really happened to, for example, narrow the gender pay gap or men taking more responsibility
regarding domestic work.
The National Action Plan against poverty and Social Exclusion has not succeeded regarding equal
treatment of, for example, mothers in the labor market. One reason for this is that Finnish
exceptionalism hides issues regarding gender equality in the Finnish society. I argue that the attitudes
about motherhood that still exist today can be tracked down to the history of motherhood and how
the ideal mother should be. The fact that the participants in my thesis had met terrible attitudes in the
labor market shows that there is still work to be done and actually the traditional gender roles have
not changed that much. As Giddens and Sutton (2017) showed, the ideal of the male breadwinner still
exists. This can be seen in the interviews as Inari, Emilia, Emmy and Felicia all took the most of the
parental leave and take care of most of the domestic and emotional work.

51

I want to also point out that four out of five of the mothers that I interviewed thought that they had
the main responsibility regarding domestic work and caring for children. When asking Inari if men
met the same kind of inappropriate treatment in the labor market as the women did, she replied:
I know they do not. Because of the society in Finland, that the mothers have the main
responsibility of the kids, and everybody thinks that. - Inari
I think this comment is good to describe the frustration that mothers today feel about having the main
responsibility. To solve these kinds of problems and to create more equality men need to take more
responsibility at home and the way to do this is by political decisions that support the narrowing of
the gender pay gap.
I want to highlight two comments regarding gender equality and parenting:
There is no gender equality in Finland being a parent, ha ha, I think. that society kind of
supports the division of work that we for example had- Inari
Absolutely not. Ha ha, like fathers have been seen like mommy’s little helpers no matter how
much or little they do with their kids or how independent they are or do they do their own
decisions or whatever but they are, every time like mom is in charge, and then dad is very
kind to help. And like it is not a hundred percent parenting.. -Cassandra
Inari and her ex-husband had traditional roles, in other words, Inari took care of most of the domestic
work and the children. Cassandra who had put much thought into being equal in parenting and made
conscious choices to succeed in it thought that the general attitude is that fathers are incompetent as
parents, as Mulcany, Parry and Glover (2009) also found in their study.
Mulcany, Parry and Glover (2009) also discussed how men should take more space in parenting and
how women should let them do so. (Mucany, Parry & Glover, 2009) The results of my study show
that the traditional attitudes about parenting can be tracked down to the history of motherhood, and
that makes it basically impossible for women to change these attitudes. The only ways to change the
attitudes are political decisions regarding parenting and gender equality.
I have shown in my research that traditional gender roles exist in the Finnish society. Regarding my
research question: What characteristics are there to Finnish mothers’ experiences of social exclusion
and how do possible negative attitudes regarding motherhood affect mothers’ well-being in the
Finnish society? I can say that I have shown that Finnish mothers experience social exclusion in the
52

labor market and by society’s judgement over them not necessarily living up to the traditional gender
roles. Attitudes in the labor market and attitudes about mothers having the main responsibility of
taking care of the children and domestic work still exist in the Finnish society. This does not bring
well-being to the mothers’ lives, quite the opposite. Political decisions should be made to narrow the
gender pay gap. Attitudes about motherhood change after these decisions are made.
The current trend seems to be that fathers in Finland who do take care of their children also receive
much praise for it, and they can create a better image of themselves while parenting. This result is not
in line with Giddens & Sutton (2017) who argued that fathers are criticized if they take the caringfor-children role in the family. I want to end by quoting Cassandra: Like I am the kind of a bad mom
who wanted to go back to work and he is the most fantastic dad when he wants to stay at home. This
is where the problem regarding equal parenting and attitudes lies.
While writing my thesis I found that future research should be conducted on at least two topics. The
1950s mothers were housewives and the 1980s mothers were the first mothers who were in the labor
market. Do the 80s mothers’ group think that the one and only accomplishment is to bring gender
equality, is being in the labor market and that they have reached it already? As a result of this, the
millennial mothers grow up with an illusion of gender equality, and when they have children the
illusion is broken. Does this lead to a) increased divorce rates b) families only having one child? Both
these groups are growing.
Future research should also be conducted on motherhood and covid19 in Finland. Being unable to
meet family and friends in everyday settings is a form of exclusion. Social exclusion in everyday life
can be, for example, being isolated or not having anyone to talk to when going through life changes.
(Giddens & Sutton, 2017). Cassandra was pregnant and on maternity leave when the first wave of
covid19 reached Finland. She described her feeling as sad for being isolated. Becoming a mother is
in my opinion one of the most major changes in a woman’s life. It is important to have a peer in this
situation. Especially during covid19, there have been little or none of the usual activities that are
organized for mothers. Mothers in otherwise vulnerable situations are especially at high risk of
becoming excluded from the society. The aftermath of covid19 is a very important theme for future
research and development of social policies. The relational social exclusion approach is key when
making new policies regarding the effects on motherhood that covid19 has had. Future research
should include this group’s experiences of motherhood. Moreover, it would be very important that

53

future research included the experiences of immigrant mothers in Finland and social exclusion.
Lastly, fathers’ experiences of gender-equal parenting should also be included in future research.

SUMMARY IN SWEDISH- SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING
I denna avhandling med titeln Jag är den typen av dålig mamma som ville gå tillbaka på jobb och
han är den mest fantastiska pappan som vill stanna hemma- en kvalitativ studie om hur allmänna
åsikter påverkar mödrars välmående i det finska samhället, diskuteras och problematiseras hur den
ofta gömda ojämlikheten mellan könen speglas in i vardagen av finländska familjer. Den sjunkande
nativiteten i Finland diskuteras ofta i finländska medier och av de finländska myndigheterna. Orsaker
är många, men attityder kan påverka detta fenomen. Finländska mödrar upplever olika former av
social exkludering, bland annat inom arbetsmarknaden. I denna avhandling svarar jag på frågan om
vad som är typiskt i finländska mödrars upplevelser av social exkludering och hur möjliga negativa
attityder gällande moderskap påverkar mödrars välmående i det finska samhället. Målet med
avhandlingen är att öka kännedom om detta ämne och att kunna bidra till en förbättring.
Jag har använt narrativ metod i avhandlingen och intervjuat fem finländska mödrar om deras
erfarenheter efter att de fått barn. Narrativ är de berättelser människor delar om sina erfarenheter
(Bold, 2012). Enligt Lynn McApline (2016) används den narrativa metoden i samhällsvetenskap till
att förstå hur människor uppfattar deras liv via deras erfarenheter. (McAlpine, 2016). Efter
intervjuerna har jag analyserat materialet under tre teman; arbetsmarknad och moderskap, jämlikhet
och föräldraskap samt attityder och moderskap. Intervjuerna hölls över videosamtal och är arkiverade
i Kulturvetenskapliga arkivet Cultura vid Åbo Akademi. Avhandlingens resultat är inte
generaliserbart i och med att deltagarna var så få och talade om sina egna erfarenheter. Deltagarna
som grupp var relativt homogen. Avhandlingen har två teorikapitel varav det första har rubriken
social exkludering och andra har rubriken moderskap. Efter teorikapitlen presenterar jag det material
som jag har samlat i samband med intervjuerna. Sedan analyseras materialet och jag avslutar
avhandlingen med en sammanfattning.
Förenta nationerna (2016) definierar social exkludering som ett fenomen där en person inte är en fullt
aktiv medlem i samhället. Det är ett tillstånd och en process där en person inte deltar fullt i det
kulturella, -sociala, - politiska eller ekonomiska livet i samhället. (United Nations, 2016). Anthony
Giddens och Filip E. Sutton (2017) delar upp social exkludering i olika sammanhang, det vill säga,
att man kan vara exkluderad från sociala relationer eller till exempel arbetsmarknaden. (Giddens &
Sutton, 2017). Ruth Levitas (2008) konstaterar att termen social exkludering inte har inkluderat
obetalt arbete som ofta görs av kvinnor. (Levitas, 2008). Jag påstår dock att social exkludering är en

55

bra utgångspunkt i diskussionen om moderskap ifall man klargör kontexten, det vill säga moderskap
i det finska samhället.
Mulcany, Parry och Glover (2009) diskuterar könsroller i mammagrupper och har kommit fram till
att könsrollerna reproduceras i dessa grupper. Mammagrupper är grupper som stöder mammor i deras
vardag, men alla mammor har ändå inte möjlighet att delta. I deras studie kom de fram till att
mammorna har känt ångest ifall de inte har agerat enligt gruppens förväntningar. Grupper formar
också om papparollen. (Mulcany, Parry & Glover, 2009). Berg (2008) klargör att bilden om den
ideala modern skapades för att stöda kapitalismen, industrialiseringen och könsrollerna. Män arbetade
och kvinnans jobb var att ta hand om hemmet och barnen. Bilden om den ideala modern kan inte nås
i verkligheten på grund av att ribban är så hög. (Berg, 2008). Tanken om den manliga försörjaren
existerar även idag. (Giddens & Sutton, 2017).
Folkpensionsanstalten i Finland betalar ut sociala förmåner till personer som bor i Finland. (Kela,
2019). En mamma kan få moderskapspenning i cirka fyra månader (Kela 2021a). Efter detta kan
föräldrarna dela på föräldrapenningen som kan fås i cirka sex månader. (Kela 2021b). Utöver detta,
har pappan nio veckors pappaledighet. (Kela 2020). En förälder har rätt att sköta barnet hemma tills
hen är tre år gammal. (Kela, 2021c). Den nya lagstiftningen om föräldraledigheter förbereds i
riksdagen. Enligt den nya lagstiftningen har föräldrar samma mängd föräldraledighetsdagar. (Kela,
2021d). Enligt Institutet för hälsa och välfärd (2021), tjänade kvinnor I medeltal 16% mindre än män.
Kvinnor blir efter i löneutvecklingen på grund av långa föräldraledigheter. (Finnish institute for health
and welfare 2021a). En femtedel av finska pappor höll inte alls föräldraledighet år 2019.
Föräldrapenningen som kan delas mellan föräldrarna användes av endast 11 % av papporna och
endast 2 %, av de föräldrar som tog hand om barnet hemma efter att föräldraledigheterna tagit slut,
var pappor. (Finnish intitute for health and welfare, 2021b).
Enligt Giddens & Sutton (2017), sköter kvinnorna majoriteten av allt hushållsarbete, även om de nu
arbetar också utanför hemmet. (Giddens & Sutton, 2017). Berg (2008) förklarar att forskning om
kvinnors förvärvsarbete mest har fokuserat på hur moderskap har lidit efter att de börjat arbeta utanför
hemmet. Mammor känner ökad stress över att ta hand om barnen när de börjat arbeta utanför hemmet.
(Berg, 2008). Carden (2019) påpekar att mammor i allmänhet beskylls ifall barnen beter sig dåligt.
Detta beror på att den allmänna attityden är att det är mammorna som ansvarar för barnuppfostran.
(Byvelds & Jackson, 2019).

I min avhandling har jag visat att de traditionella könsrollerna existerar även i dagens Finland. Jag
har svarat på min forskningsfråga, om vad som är typiskt i finska mödrars upplevelser av social
exkludering och hur möjliga negativa attityder gällande moderskap påverkar mödrars välmående i
det finska samhället. Finländska mödrar upplever social exkludering i till exempel arbetslivet och de
döms ifall de inte lever upp till de sociala förväntningarna. Attityderna på arbetsmarknaden och
uppfattningen att mammorna har huvudansvaret gällande barnen existerar även idag. Mödrarna lider
av detta tankesätt. Politiska beslut gällande föräldraledigheterna borde fattas för att minska skillnader
i lönen mellan könen. Attityder om föräldraskap ändras efter att politiska beslut har fattats.
