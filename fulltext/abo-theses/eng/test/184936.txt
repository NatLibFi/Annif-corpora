Abstract
During transportation of injectable depot materials, temperature variations might occur as
they are shipped globally in different climates. A systematic approach to study the effects of
temperature variations was therefore conducted. Furthermore, freezing and thawing cycles
were conducted on the depot material to study the effects of repeated freezing. The samples
might also be subjected to unwanted deformation at some point in their life cycle, which is
why the material was purposely deformed to conduct research on the effects of this action
on the material structure.
The objective of this thesis was to prepare these injectable depot materials containing silica
microparticles and a silica hydrogel and determine the impact of the temperature treatments
on the structure of the material. Depot samples were conditioned in room temperature,
fridge, freezer and in a heat chamber. The temperature treatments or the conditioning
parameters were chosen based on situations which could arise during transportation of the
injectable depots. A so-called Oscillatory-Rotational-Oscillatory (ORO) measurement was
also set up to study the ability of the material to recover after deformation. The effects of
the temperature treatments were studied by three methods: Firstly, a rheological
measurement to evaluate the rheological properties of the depot material after each
conditioning, secondly, a manual injectability study, which gave a qualitative insight into the
structure and behavior of the material upon injection after conditioning and, lastly, an
injection force measurement, which measured the load (N) or the force (N) that was required
for the material to be injected through the needle.
The results suggest that temperature has an effect on the material structure and quality. The
rheological measurements showed varied results but gave an overall indication of the
material properties before and after conditioning. The manual injectability study suggested
that the samples conditioned in the freezer lost some of the desired properties. The silica
gel-network structure was most severely impacted by the freezing conditions compared to
the other conditions. From the injection force measurement, it was also determined that the
freezer samples, generally, caused the most clogs or unevenness in injection force. Two
freezing and thawing cycles did not impact the structure significantly.

1 Introduction
Biomaterials have been recognized for many millennia and utilized to improve quality of life
and health of millions. In the twentieth century, however, biomaterials started gaining
increased recognition due to advances in technology, engineering and processing of
materials. The development and research of biobased materials has exponentially increased
as a result and biomaterial based medical solutions have become commercially accessible
(Agrawal, 2014). There are many types of biomaterials available for a variety of biomedical
applications, common applications for biomaterials include implants, drug-delivery systems
and tissue engineering.
Hydrogels are a type of biomaterial that is utilized in biomedical applications. They consist of
hydrophilic polymers in a network and can hold large amounts of water, by definition, a
minimum of 10 %. They are flexible due to their high-water content, comparable to natural
tissue. Hydrogels react to selected external chemical and physical stimuli, such as
temperature, pH, chemical compositions, electric fields, and causes a gel-sol phase transition
as a response. The response depends on the properties of the hydrogel. The reaction is
sometimes also reversible as the stimuli is removed (Bahram, Mohseni and Moghtader, 2016).
Nanoparticles (NPs) have also been added into the hydrogel to improve the qualities of the
hydrogel, for example improve mechanical properties or creating systems sensitive to
external stimuli. These systems can be utilized in drug-delivery applications, loading the NPs
with drugs. For example, pH or temperature sensitive nanogels can be engineered, and
therefore, be used for controlled drug delivery. The hydrogel or nanogel functions as a coat
to the NP carrying the drug and the nanogel also limits aggregation because of the steric
repulsions between the particles. Nanogels (hydrogel composites) can be prepared from
many chemical compounds including, naturally derived polymers, metals, clays and silica
(Dannert, Stokke and Dias, 2019).
In material development and engineering, research involves understanding the rheological
behavior of materials. Especially in the biotechnological industry and in medical research,
material behavior by rheological means helps develop relevant and adequate materials
(Barnes, Hutton and Walters, 1989).
In this work, rheology was used to determine properties, such as gel character and viscosity
of the materials and thereby study the changes in the material behavior. The rheological

measurements gave understanding to the structure of the injectable silica depot material,
which is a silica microparticle-silica hydrogel composite, and its behavior after different
temperature treatments. Furthermore, a rheological measurement was developed, using the
rheometer software, to deform the material and register the materials ability to recover from
the deformation.

2 Background
2.1 Biomedical biomaterials
Biomaterials are highly advanced materials that are at the forefront of developing advanced
materials for the purpose of treatment and diagnosis of diseases and, furthermore, for the
purpose of regeneration, function enhancement and replacement of human tissue (Gu,
2020). Developing advanced biomaterials and biomaterial applications is essential for the
health of the population and to ensure high quality of life, with basic sciences such as
chemistry, physics and biology but also medicine and engineering leading the development
in the field of biomaterials science (Ratner, 2013; Gu, 2020). Increasing demand for
biomaterials in medical and pharmaceutical industries is putting pressure on the
development of these materials and bioengineering, leading to a growing biomaterials
industry (Yousaf et al., 2020).
Biomaterials refers to materials that are derived from a biological source and/or are intended
for the purpose of human body therapy, and are in interaction with a biological environment
(Griffith, 2000; Hoffman, Schoen and Lemons, 2004). Both synthetically and naturally derived
polymers can be used as biomaterials in biomedical applications (Yousaf et al., 2020)
Synthetic polymers can be described as polymers which are manufactured artificially in a
laboratory, in other words, they are man-made polymers. Natural polymers on the other
hand occur naturally. Semisynthetic polymers are derived from polymers occurring naturally
but are chemically modified to their final form, e.g., rayon and chitosan (Shrivastava, 2018).
Naturally derived polymers have the ability to support cellular processes, such as migration,
proliferation and adhesion, which drives the utilization of them in drug delivery systems and
other medical devices. According to Yousaf et al. synthetically derived polymers are therefore
mainly limited due to their lack of biocompatibility, as they might contain impurities and
initiators impeding cell growth, giving leverage to naturally derived polymers as biomaterials
(Sionkowska, 2011; Yousaf et al., 2020). However, synthetic polymers have been described
as easier to utilize in biomedical applications and have higher chemical purity, therefore a
combination of synthetic and natural polymers are required to create compatible materials
with improved properties for the biomedical field (Sionkowska, 2011; Zainudin, Wong and
Hamdan, 2020). Enhanced mechanical and thermal stability are among some of the
properties that are better in synthetic polymers compared to natural polymers. Processing
natural polymers at high temperatures increases the risk of devastating their natural

structure (Sionkowska, 2011). Synthetically derived biomaterials include glass, ceramics, gels,
composites and polymers. Naturally derived biomaterials are extracted from animal or
human, bone, tissue, cartilage or skin (Fimea, 2020). Some examples of natural polymers
include collagen, elastin, chitin, which are from animals, and cellulose, pectin or starch from
plants (Sionkowska, 2011). Biocompatibility, biodegradation, non-antigenicity and costeffectiveness are key components in developing future biomaterials for biomedical
applications (Yousaf et al., 2020).
As biomaterials are in contact and interact, both chemically and physically, with living tissue
and organs, understanding their structure, function, and properties in relationship with the
human body is highly important (Park and Lakes, 2007). EN ISO 10993 is a standard within
the European Union, which regulates the requirements for biocompatibility of a biomaterial
(Fimea, 2020). All biomaterials that are in contact with biological systems will experience a
form of chronic inflammation, also known as a foreign body response, which can cause a
fibrous layer to form around and in the interface between the material and the tissue. This
response can sometimes even be preferable if the material needs anchoring, although this is
often avoided to reduce any risks of inflammation and to allow for easy potential removal of
the material afterwards (Griffith, 2000). After injection, an immediate inflammatory
response is triggered as a result of the trauma caused by the injection (Rahnfeld and Luciani,
2020). The three main factors that determine a successful use of biomaterials within living
tissue and organs are biocompatibility and their properties, health of the patient and the
proficiency of the doctor/surgeon who administers and monitors the treatment using a
biomaterial (Park and Lakes, 2007). It is also noteworthy that biomaterials are seldom utilized
on their own but rather in co-operation with a device or an implant (Ratner, 2013).
Biomaterials can be divided into a few categories; ceramics, metals, polymers, composites,
and natural materials (Ratner, 2013). The materials are categorized by the involved atoms
and the bonds between them, however, exceptions do exist (Carter and Norton, 2007). The
purpose and future host site of the biomaterial determines from which category the
biomaterial is chosen and with which parameters (Ratner, 2013).
Ceramics are classified as materials with mixed bonding, involving both ionic and covalent
bonding, even metallic at times. For example, nitrides, carbides and oxides are often ceramics
and even diamonds and graphite are classified as ceramics. Metals have delocalized electrons,
which hold together the atoms. Furthermore, the electrons overcome the repulsion among

the ion cores. Many of the properties characteristic to metals, such as electrical and thermal
conductivity, are due to these delocalized electrons. Their dense structure gives the material
its plastic deformation at room temperatures. Polymers, often interchangeable with plastics,
are covalently bonded macromolecules, consisting of many molecule units called mers.
Polymers are often organic and usually made up of carbon, hydrogen and some nonmetals,
for example chlorine and sulphur. Even though polymers and plastics are used
interchangeably, plastics often contain fillers and additives to reach preferred appearance
and properties. Composites consist of a mix of materials to achieve the preferred properties.
Ceramics can, for example, be utilized in composites as reinforcement (Carter and Norton,
2007) .
Natural biomaterials have become increasingly popular in biomaterial applications, as it has
been discovered that they mimic the function of the extracellular matrix (ECM) biologically
and mechanically in vivo for all tissue in the body (Brovold et al., 2018). Information about
the ECM can be found in the following article (Yue, 2014). Naturally derived biomaterials can
be categorized according to their origin. For example, gelatin, collagen and silk originate from
proteins, chitin, alginate and cellulose originate from polysaccharides and keratan sulphate,
hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate originate from glycosaminoglycans. These have
raised scientific interest in the biomedical engineering technologies due to their unique
characteristics, including biocompatibility and biodegradability (Brovold et al., 2018).

2.1.1 Silica as a biomaterial
Silica (SiO2, silicon dioxide) is a naturally found mineral derived from silicon (the earth crust’s
most abundant metal) and can be used as a nano- or microparticle in various applications
(Brinker and Scherer, 1990b). Its favoring in these applications is due to its biocompatibility,
porosity and surface modifiability. It is also because of this porous structure that silica has
been used for the encapsulation of active ingredients, DNA and drugs, including various
nanoparticles (Ratner, 2013). Furthermore, silica particles have been utilized over other
organic systems such as polymeric nanoparticles, micelles and liposomes as these exhibit
limitations regarding thermal and chemical stability. The immune system also expels these
systems rapidly. Silica particles can instead be used by encapsulating drugs within the
particles by spray drying in combination with sol-gel chemistry (Barbé et al., 2004).
Silica can be found in many different forms (crystalline and non-crystalline and further
divided into other subcategories) and can be further transformed via a variety of chemical

5

___________________________________________________________________________
reactions into different forms, such as xerogels, hydrogels and silica sols, to name a few
(Unger, 2014). The silica which is most commonly used in drug-delivery applications is noncrystalline or amorphous silica, as silica in this form provides better solubility, as supported
by many articles (Antonino et al., 2019; Le et al., 2019). In the case of gelling, a hydrogel can
be formed as colloidal particles crosslink to form a three-dimensional network, a so-called
silica hydrogel is formed (Unger, 2014).

2.1.2 Hydrogels
Hydrogels in general are widely popular and profoundly utilized, as they have high water
absorbance capacity, porosity and a consistency which is soft. This allows for the hydrogel to
be deformed and adapt to many different surfaces. Hydrogels can also be designed to
degrade and dissolve or stay chemically stable. Drugs or other microparticles are also easily
encapsulated within the tunable porous structure of the hydrogel matrix, which is why they
have been utilized for drug delivery systems (Lotfipour et al., 2019). Other applications for
hydrogels include tissue engineering, wound dressing, artificial muscles and contact lenses
(Lee and Bucknall, 2008). A driving force in the development of hydrogels has been the
interest in utilizing gels in situ as an alternative for surgical procedures as a less invasive
option (Griffith, 2000; McLemore, 2011).
Based on their cross-linking, hydrogels can be categorized into two groups, chemical and
physical hydrogels, depending on whether the network structure is reversible by any external
factors (Lee and Bucknall, 2008). A chemically cross-linked hydrogel has a permanent
junction, whereas a physically cross-linked hydrogel has a network consisting of transient
junctions existing due to entanglements, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic
interactions or other types of physical interactions (Ahmed, 2015). It is because of these
chemical and physical bonds that the hydrogel stays insoluble even though its threedimensional network swells upon contact with an aqueous medium. The diffusion behavior
of the aqueous solution into the hydrogel structure is the dictating factor of the swelling rate
(Lee and Bucknall, 2008). The swelling rate is also influenced by any external environmental
factors, where in extreme cases, phenomena such as phase transition or volume collapse
take place (Ahmed, 2015). Sometimes the swelling rate must be controlled to regulate
possible side effects, such as skin necrosis in tissue-expanding applications. In the swelling
process hydrogels, for example tissue expansion applications, are required to maintain a

certain level of their mechanical strength and physical reliability which are in compliance with
the requirements for the application (Lee and Bucknall, 2008).
There are both naturally and synthetically derived polymeric hydrogels. These hydrogels
decompose rapidly under certain biological conditions such as pH, microbes and enzymes.
To counteract the prompt decomposition, silica hydrogels can be utilized instead as they
exhibit advanced chemical, mechanical and thermal stability (Dolinina, Kraev and Parfenyuk,
2020).

2.1.3 Silica hydrogel
Silica hydrogel is one of the common forms of silica that are utilized in biomedical
applications. As mentioned earlier, silica hydrogel is a three-dimensional network of
aggregated or cross-linked colloidal silica particles which forms a gel consisting of mainly
water, hence the name, hydrogel (Unger, 2014; Ahmed, 2015). The water is meshed within
the crosslinked network of the hydrogel (Lee and Bucknall, 2008).
The surface properties of the silica are of great importance in the process of trying to
understand the behavior of the material in a multitude of different processes and its chemical
reactivity. The main surface groups in the silica particles, which need to be understood in the
manufacturing process of silica hydrogels, are the silanol groups (-Si-OH). The silanol groups
are the key components in the production of what will later become the gel or the hydrogel
(Unger, 2014). Furthermore, surface chemistry also effects the rheological behavior. By
adjusting the surface charge density or the ionic strength of e.g. silica NPs, rheological
behavior can be altered (Leong and Boger, 1990).

2.1.4 Biodegradation
It is critical for drug delivery systems to be able to preserve the drug while in storage but also
to have the ability to biodegrade upon injection into the reaction medium (Giovannini et al.,
2017). The terms biodegradation and bioerosion are interchangeable and lack clear
distinction. However, biodegradation is often used to describe the chemical deconstruction
processes of a material such as hydrolysis or oxidation. Bioerosion often refers more to the
changes in the physical properties such as size and shape or as an effect of either
biodegradation or dissolution. Biodegradable materials also have high requirements for
biocompatibility and their potential toxicity must be thoroughly investigated due to their
interactions with biological systems upon degradation. Research and studies of the

7

degradation mechanisms and degradation rate in vivo and reports on the toxicological effects
are of immense importance (Hoffman, Schoen and Lemons, 2004).

2.2 Drug delivery systems
Drug delivery is a broad concept including various forms of effective delivery of drugs for
therapeutic purposes, as well as techniques including the administration of pharmaceutical
compounds to humans or even animals (Nayak et al., 2018). Drug delivery focuses on
developing novel materials or carriers, often made up of predominantly lipids or polymers,
where common delivery methods can be either targeted, controlled or steady (Allen, 2004;
Nayak et al., 2018). The type of polymer used has an impact on many aspects of the carrier,
including biocompatibility, suitable encapsulated drugs or proteins, degradation and release
rate of the drug etc. (Champion, Katare and Mitragotri, 2007). Furthermore, compared to
conventional drugs that are “free”, drug delivery systems can provide better pharmacological
properties and function as continuous release systems by operating as a drug reservoir,
releasing therapeutic agents over days or months at a time (Allen, 2004; Champion, Katare
and Mitragotri, 2007). The encapsulation of drugs into carriers also protects the drug from
premature metabolism and degradation before its release. A sustained release over months
means that the administration frequency is reduced, patient adherence is increased, and the
therapeutic levels are maintained stable over longer time scales. The encapsulation of the
drug can be done through various methods. A few common ones are spray drying, drop break
up of a liquid stream and single or double emulsification. These methods can manufacture
spherical particles and provide control over the most basic parameters, such as particle
diameter, encapsulation efficacy as well as polydispersity but also some more advanced
parameters; drug compartmentalization and porosity (Champion, Katare and Mitragotri,
2007).
The administration of the drug using a drug delivery system can be done through multiple
dosage forms including tablets, pills, solutions, lotions, injectables, capsules, creams,
powders etc. and through many administration routes, such as nasal, skin, buccal and
mucosal membranes for the currently existing relevant technologies (Nayak et al., 2018). The
route of administration is ordered based on the drug, action site and the state of the disease,
whereas the choice of drug delivery system is based on a careful consideration between the
two contradicting factors, drug potency and encapsulation capacity (Nayak et al., 2018;
8

Ida Nygård l Åbo Akademi University
Master’s Thesis (Chem. Eng.)
___________________________________________________________________________
Rahnfeld and Luciani, 2020). With conventional oral drugs, there is little control over the drug
release. Drug delivery systems can be made to have specific release profiles ensuring
effective therapeutic effects and sufficient concentrations of the drug being released at the
target site (Nayak et al., 2018). Localized administrations are beneficial especially for cases
where the disease is only present in a small area, thus, leading to a small systemic drug
concentration but high localized drug concentration (Rahnfeld and Luciani, 2020). Drug
delivery systems also have an advantage compared to “free” drugs in that they have fewer
side-effects due to a more stable release of the drug, avoiding sudden peaks in the drug
concentration which are common for conventional drugs (Allen, 2004).
Drug delivery systems are being developed, particularly injectable biodegradable semi-solid
depots, as an alternative to some other drug delivery systems, which faze stability challenges
among other issues. The injectable depot solidifies in the body when injected through a
syringe (Hatefi and Amsden, 2002). The most widely used drug delivery system currently is
oral drug delivery (Nayak et al., 2018).
For a drug delivery system that is ideal a few aspects should be accounted for. The release
rate of the drug should be predetermined and stay within the therapeutic range during the
specified release range period. The site of administration should be as local as possible to the
site of the condition and the depot should undergo complete biodegradation which is parallel
to the predetermined release rate of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Lastly, the
matrix should not instigate any severe reactions at the injection site (Rahnfeld and Luciani,
2020).
Balancing the drug to carrier ratio requires careful consideration. A high carrier to drug ratio
can cause issues with biodegradation and carrier toxicity. A high drug to carrier ratio is less
alarming as drug potency is one of the more important factors for drugs utilizing the drug
delivery systems. Causes for concern are drug and carrier compatibility especially in the
manufacturing stages. Incorporating the drug into the carrier system requires that the drug
can withstand the procedure. Furthermore, the drug and carrier association is also a
determining factor in the length and the release rate of the drug. The drug stays inactive as
long as it is in association with the carrier, therefore, it can induce a reduced therapeutic
effect caused by an insufficient release rate (Allen, 2004).
It is the possibility to facilitate and integrate drug molecules of many sorts and tune the
specific parameters accordingly, that gives these drug delivery systems some commercial and

therapeutic advantages (Nayak et al., 2018). Biotechnology and drug development continue
to develop and advance, consequentially leading to more pharmaceutically active
compounds, demanding controlled and targeted drug delivery systems and, therefore, they
should be projected for the future (Hatefi and Amsden, 2002).

2.3 Sol-gel technique
The main purpose of the sol-gel technique is to prepare a sol from a monomer, which
consequently, progresses into a gel network consisting of metal-oxygen-metal bonds or
siloxane bonds. Sequentially a sol is defined as a colloid dispersed in a solvent, essentially
solid particles in a liquid (Brinker and Scherer, 1990b; Loy, 2003). The sol-gel technique is a
highly used technique, as it allows for great control over the processing parameters and
enables a wide range of possibilities for both chemical and physical characteristics.
Furthermore, the sol-gel technique is a relatively mild technique. The processing parameters
can be chosen and altered according to the preferred properties of the final product (Loy,
2003).
The chemical synthesis starts with the preparation of the colloid via a precursor, such as
tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), which is a metal alkoxide monomer that via the sol-gel
polymerization develops into a metal oxide gel (Loy, 2003). Metal alkoxides are readily
utilized as precursors as they react well with water (Brinker and Scherer, 1990). TEOS is one
of the most commonly used monomer precursors in sol-gel chemistry and undergoes
hydrolysis and condensation to form the final product, in the combination of water and
alcohol (Loy, 2003). The alcohol is utilized to form a miscible blend between water and the
hydrophobic monomer. However, in some cases, like when TEOS is utilized in the reaction,
no solvent is needed as TEOS produces adequate amounts of alcohol as a by-product when
hydrolyzed. The produced amount of alcohol is enough to homogenize the immiscible blend
(Brinker and Scherer, 1990b; Loy, 2003). Alkoxide groups (OR) react and are replaced with
hydroxyl groups (OH) in the hydrolyzation reactions, as seen in equation 1, whereas in the
condensation reaction, formed silanol groups (Si-OH) act as the reactive functionality
necessary to form siloxane bonds (Si-O-Si). The reaction also produces alcohol groups or
water as a by-product, as shown in equation 2 & 3. In order to hydrolyze the TEOS, catalysts
such as mineral acids (e.g. HCl) or bases (e.g.NH3) are also employed (Brinker and Scherer,

1990). As the hydrolysis and condensation reactions continue, the sol will eventually begin
to appear more viscous before ultimately forming a gel (Loy, 2003).

The primary reason for gelling is collisions between particles caused by dispersion forces. To
enhance these forces pH can be adjusted, as pH has a twofold effect on the gelling (Unger,
2014). There are three main pH regions in sol-gel science/polymerization that should be
noted, pH < 2, pH 2-7 and pH > 2. pH 2 can be seen as a boundary, as that is the point of zero
charge (PZC) and the isoelectric point (IEP), meaning the surface charge is zero and the silica
particles’ electrical mobility is zero respectively (Brinker and Scherer, 1990a). If the pH is
below 3, insufficient gelling occurs as a result of decreased condensation, which is
proportional to the concentration of hydroxyl groups present in the solution (Unger, 2014).
Between pH 2 and pH 6, the gelling time steadily decreases (Brinker and Scherer, 1990a). An
optimal gelling time can be obtained at pH 5, which is a result of the two following effects.
As the pH increases above 6, silica particles obtain more negative surface charges and, thus,
the collisions occurring between the particles decrease, which is linked to gelling, as
mentioned earlier (Unger, 2014). Furthermore, a maximized dissolution rate and silica
solubility can be obtained at pH 7, which is why this can be seen as a boundary. Particle
growth increases rapidly above pH 7, since the ionization of the compounds that are
condensed is more probable and, therefore, interparticle repulsion occurs. Hence, the
growth transpires without gelation or aggregation and instead mainly by adding monomer.
For aggregation or chaining to occur a salt must be present, otherwise the particles will be
mutually repulsive. To considerably reduce gelling time salt can also be added, as this reduces
the double layer thickness (Brinker and Scherer, 1990a).
Particle size is an important factor as well in the growth and growth rate of the particles.
Particle growth occurs when smaller particles dissolve and deposit on larger particles;

therefore, the particle growth rate is particle-size distribution dependent. For example, at
low pH, the solubility of silica is poor, smaller particles might still dissolve whereas particles
reaching 2-4 nm begin to rapidly decrease in solubility and the size-dependency decreases.
Above pH 7, the solubility and size-dependency are greater and the particle growth continues
with Ostwald ripening, which is a temperature-dependent particle growth mechanism where
higher temperature stimulates greater solubility and, therefore, produces larger particles
(Brinker and Scherer, 1990a).

2.4 Spray drying
Spray drying is a technology in the pharmaceutical and biomedical industry of converting a
liquid feed, solution, dispersion etc. into a dry substance, often in the form of granules, a
powder or agglomerates, with the possibility of encapsulating active pharmaceutical
ingredients (APIs) within the dried substance/particles (Liu, Chen and Selomulya, 2015;
Muhamad et al., 2017). The final form of the product is dependent on the equipment design,
input solution and the wanted end characteristics. A schematic representation of a spray
dryer can be found in Figure 1. The method is suitable for the drying of heat-sensitive
pharmaceutical ingredients, such as enzymes or proteins, as there is minimal loss in activity.
Spray drying has been used in the pharmaceutical industry since the 1940s and since the
1950s in the food industry, protecting oil flavors from degradation or oxidation (Muhamad
et al., 2017).

Figure 1. Schematic picture of a spray dryer and the spray drying process (Peng et al., 2017).
The liquid, for example, a sol prepared from the sol-gel technique, is fed into a hot stream of
gas, typically air, and then through a nozzle, atomizing the liquid before entering the drying
chamber. The nozzle or the atomizer, which converts the liquid to a spray, determines the
drop size (Jacobs, 2014). Often the particles end up being polydisperse due to their changing
drying profiles, as the droplets formed by the conventional atomizers tend to be different
sizes and have varied trajectories. However, methods have been developed to form
homogeneous microparticles that have the ability to encapsulate active ingredients and have
controlled release along with other application-specific properties/parameters (Liu, Chen
and Selomulya, 2015).
The feeding system can be designed/chosen according to the desired parameters and final
product, for example a batch reactor or a feed reactor, such as a continuous stirred tank
reactor (CSTR).

2.5 Chemical Reactors
Reactors can be divided into batch reactors and flow reactors. The continuous stirred tank
reactor and the plug flow reactor are included in this category of ideal flow reactors. In all
reactors, mixing plays an integral role, particularly the degree of mixing (Hayes and Mmbaga,
2012).

2.5.1 Batch reactor
A batch reactor operates by adding all reactants into one reactor tank, which is then emptied
as the reaction progresses. Therefore, batch reactors lack an inlet and an outlet flow stream,
as seen in Figure 2. Typically, small volumes are produced from expensive components, as
batch reactors are suited for small quantities. Pharmaceuticals are common products of the
batch reactor systems. The reactor tank can consist of a uniform component if the reactants
are thoroughly mixed, where the temperature and concentration are constant, or consist of
a non-uniform mixture with a variable temperature and concentration gradient if the mixing
is negligible (Hayes and Mmbaga, 2012). The concentration in a batch reactor changes as a
function of reaction time, but the pressure stays constant throughout the reactor (Tapio et
al., 2015).

Figure 2. Batch reactor.

2.5.2 Continuous stirred tank reactor
A continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), seen in Figure 3, also called backmixed or mixed
flow reactor, is based on a continuous output and input of the reacting materials into a mixing

14

___________________________________________________________________________
tank, removing and feeding the material simultaneously into the mixing tank, where the
material is completely mixed (Foutch and Johannes, 2003; Roberts, 2008). This means that
the effluent is identical with the material in the reacting tank. Along with the plug flow
reactor, the CSTR is the other ideal flow reactor type. One assumes that in an ideal CSTR both
temperature and concentration are identical throughout the reactor and operate at a steady
state, in other words, the mass flow rates in and out of the reactor are equal (Foutch and
Johannes, 2003). It is also noteworthy that the reaction velocity as a function of the volume
in steady state is continuous and relatively low. Furthermore, it is also assumed that the
mixing of the reactants is instant upon entering the mixing tank (Tapio et al., 2015). Some
disadvantages of the CSTR include requirements of larger volumes of reactor material, it
requires energy for agitation in the reactor which also imposes higher operating costs (Foutch
and Johannes, 2003). It is also possible to connect multiple CSTRs in series to increase the
performance of the system (Tapio et al., 2015).

2.6 Rheology and rheometry
Rheology is a term that was invented in Indiana at the Lafayette College by Professor
Bingham. The term means the study of flow and deformation of matter. It was Robert Hooke,
in 1678, that developed a theory about elasticity. He suggested that a spring will acquire the
same power as the tension it holds. He meant that “if you double the tension, you double
the extension”. This lays as the foundation of the theory of elasticity, a basic concept of
rheology. In 1687 Isaac Newton published the Principia in which he acknowledged liquids and
the “lack of slipperiness” that appears when a liquid is sheared. This phenomenon he was
talking about is what we call viscosity. Another way of describing viscosity is as the resistance
to flow or the internal friction within the liquid. Later, in the 1800s more advanced theories
about rheology were developed, such as the three-dimensional theory, today known as the
Newtonian viscous liquid. The laws of Newtonian liquids and Hookean solids stand as the
pillars of rheology. With time, more complex theories have been developed to be able to
describe a wide variety of materials and their rheological behaviors.
Rheology is integrated in many industries such as food technology, polymer processing and
pharmaceutical industry to describe and understand the flow processes of materials and
develop and improve material characteristics and solve engineering issues (Barnes, Hutton
and Walters, 1989; Tanner, 2000). Rheometry is any means of method or equipment used to
determine and measure rheological behavior. The most common concepts within rheology
include viscosity, viscoelasticity, elasticity, shear stress and shear rate.
Viscosity is the internal friction of a material causing resistance to flow. The resistance to flow
is determined by many factors including particle and molecule size, shape and orientation
(Mezger, Sprinz and Green, 2018). In order to be able to completely comprehend and
calculate viscosity, shear stress and shear rate are essential to know and understand. A socalled two-plates model, which is shown in Figure 4, is used to determine the two necessary
parameters to describe the flow behavior. A shear is applied to the material, which is located
between two plates, one of which is stationary and the other moving and, therefore, shearing
the material. The shear stress (t) is defined as the force (F) at which the plate is moving over
the shear area (A). Shear rate (g with dot above) is defined as the velocity (v) at which the
plate moves over the gap (h) or the distance between the plates (Mezger, Sprinz and Green,
2018).

Figure 4. Two plates model. V=velocity, h=distance between the plates, t=shear stress.
Bottom plate stays stationary and the upper plate moves in x direction at velocity v. (Saleh
and Rabie, 2011)

Materials can be categorized depending on the response to shear. If the viscosity decreases
as a response to an increasing shear rate, the material is called shear-thinning or
pseudoplastic. If the viscosity, however, increase as a response to the increasing shear rate,
the material is called shear-thickening or dilatant. Most materials behave like pseudoplastics,
but there are a few materials categorized as dilatant. Time also influences some materials.
This time dependency is called thixotropy. The definition is that while the material is shearthinning under stress, upon removal of the stress a gradual recovery of the material structure
can be observed (Barnes, Hutton and Walters, 1989).
An ideally elastic material follows Hooke’s Law for elasticity. When a load is applied to a
material, the deformation energy will be stored within the material and after the load is
removed, the ideally elastic material will revert to its original state before deformation, as all
stored energy in the material will be recovered (Mezger and Vincentz Network GmbH & Co.
KG, 2020). However, most materials, if not all materials, display both viscous and elastic
behavior, i.e., viscoelasticity. Furthermore, these can be divided into viscoelastic solids,
which exhibit more solid-like and rigid behavior at rest but under sufficiently large forces they
can show some deformation. Then there are viscoelastic fluids, which at rest exhibit liquidlike properties, but if put under a large and rapid force they can show elastic behavior
(Mezger, Sprinz and Green, 2018).

2.6.1 Rheological measurements
Rheological measurements can be carried out using rheometers or viscometers in
combination with different measuring geometries. The most common geometries include
cone and plate, plate-plate and concentric cylinders. Viscometers are much simpler than
17

Ida Nygård l Åbo Akademi University
Master’s Thesis (Chem. Eng.)
___________________________________________________________________________
rheometers and work by doing rotational tests under constant speed as a single value is
extracted. Viscosity is the only parameter able to be measured contrary to rheometers where
extensive rheological measurements and data can be performed and extracted. Furthermore,
shear tests can be conducted doing rotational and oscillatory measurements, the latter of
which will be discussed in the next chapter. Rotational tests can be conducted in two ways,
either with velocity (shear rate or rotational speed) as the preset, which is an operating mode
called controlled shear rate (CSR), or the preset being driving force (torque or shear stress),
an operating mode called controlled shear stress (CSS) (Mezger, Sprinz and Green, 2018).

2.6.2 Viscoelasticity and oscillatory tests
Most materials exhibit viscoelastic behavior. Viscoelastic materials exhibit a delayed
response when a load is applied and when it is removed (Mezger and Vincentz Network
GmbH & Co. KG, 2020). Oscillatory measurements can be conducted utilizing the two-plates
model mentioned earlier, only now the moving plate rotates back and forth, creating an
oscillatory movement. Oscillatory tests are often commissioned to gather information about
the viscoelastic behavior of a material. During oscillatory tests, the chosen (preset) oscillation
strain frequency and amplitude leads to a sinusoidal strain curve, which results in a sinusoidal
response curve of the stress. If the material is ideally elastic, no lag between these two curves
exists and therefore the phase shift is 0°. If the material is ideally viscous, however, the phase
shift would be 90°, as there would be a delay in response. These two behaviors are
represented in Figure 5. Viscoelastic materials would be defined anywhere between these,
having a phase shift anywhere between 0° and 90°, shown in Figure 6. Fluid-like materials are
between 45° and 90°, solid-like or gel-like materials are between 0° and 45° (Mezger, Sprinz
and Green, 2018).

behaviour. (TA Instruments, 2018)

viscoelastic behavior and the rheological parameters G*, G’, G’’ and tand . (TA Instruments,
2018)
When doing viscoelastic measurements, terms such as storage modulus, loss modulus and
complex shear modulus (G*) are used. Storage modulus (G’) represents the stored
deformation energy and the loss modulus (G’’) represents the dissipated deformation energy.
The dissipated energy is either lost to the surrounding environment as heat or consumed by
the process. This loss in energy means that the deformation of the material is irreversible
and, therefore, the material behaves like a viscous material. The energy that is consumed by
the process transpires as a result of the frictional forces between molecules or particles. The
storage modulus stores the energy applied by a load during deformation, and, as the load is
removed, the stored energy is utilized to restore the material partially or completely to its

___________________________________________________________________________
initial state. In conclusion, the storage modulus is the elastic behavior of the material and is
represented by G’, the loss modulus is the viscous behavior of the material and is represented
by G’’. The loss factor, tan d, is defined as:
tan d =

!’’

and, therefore, discloses the ratio between the viscoelastic deformation energy, the viscous
and elastic portions, respectively, of the material. If G’ dominates,
G’ > G’’ and tand < 1

(5)

it is an indication of an elastic material or gel character and if G’’ dominates,
G’’ > G’ and tand > 1

(6)

it indicates a viscous material. The point at which
tand = 1 or G’ = G’’

(7)

is the point known as the gel point or the sol gel transition point. For the rheological
determination of the gel point, G’, G’’ and tand are measured at constant amplitude within
the LVER, as a function of time or temperature. This is also the point at which the G’ and G’’
curves intercept on a diagram, the crossover point, which can be seen in Figure 7. The
transition from a viscous material into an elastic material transpires from this point forward.
(Mezger and Vincentz Network GmbH & Co. KG, 2020).

In Figure 8, the intercept between G’ and G’’ is the flow point, i.e., the point at which the
structure brakes down and the material starts to flow, the point at which G’=G’’ is equal to
the flow point (𝜏f). The material starts to flow after this crossover point. The yield point (𝜏y)
can be found at the limiting shear stress value for at the LVE region. The figure shows G’ and
G’’ as a function of deformation instead of time or temperature (Anton Paar, no date).

Figure 8. Amplitude sweep of a material. Modified from: (Anton Paar, no date)
Oscillatory tests are conducted within the linear viscoelastic range (LVER). The LVE range is
the range where no structural degradation occurs (Mezger and Vincentz Network GmbH &
Co. KG, 2020). The molecules have enough time to react and relax through the disturbance
on the structure, molecule entanglements and coils are left undisturbed (Aho, 2011). For the
LVER, a limiting value can be found at the point where structural degradation starts occurring
and irreversible destruction becomes prevalent (Mezger and Vincentz Network GmbH & Co.
KG, 2020). The material has therefore reached the non-linear region and the response of the
material depends on the magnitude, rate and kinematics of the deformation (Aho, 2011).
This point can be referred to as the yield stress or the yield point. The LVER can be determined
by performing an amplitude sweep and, in a shear strain vs G’ graph, can be noticed as a
plateau in the graph, as pictured in Figure 9A and 9B. As the plateau transgresses into a curve,
the yield point (𝛾L) has been reached. Going outside this range will ravage the viscoelastic
structure of the sample and make any destruction permanent (Mezger and Vincentz Network
GmbH & Co. KG, 2020). In Figure 9A, G’>G’’ in the LVE region, which means that the material
behaves like a viscoelastic solid. In Figure 9B, G’’>G’ in the LVE region and therefore behaves
like a viscoelastic liquid (Anton Paar, no date).

2.6.3 Oscillatory-rotational-oscillatory measurements
Many types of rheological measurements are available for specific applications. Depending
on the material a relevant measuring method should be chosen. One rheological test that
can be suited for some studies is the ORO (oscillation-rotation-oscillation) measurement. The
test consists of three steps. The first step is an oscillatory step at low shear rates, the second
step is a rotational measurement at high shear rates and the third step is another oscillatory
measurement at low shear rates, similarly to the first step. The oscillatory steps are done
within the LVE range. The first oscillatory step represents the material at rest, the last
oscillatory step represents the material’s ability to recover, the structure regeneration. These
oscillatory measurements are split by the rotational measurement to apply high shear on the
material to deconstruct the material (Anton Paar, 2022).

2.7 Needles and injectability
As many drugs are injectable, injectability needs to be evaluated to understand the
performance of the drug upon injection including expulsion and penetration forces,
ergonomics and selection of the needle and syringe. The injection can be self-administered
or administered by a caregiver, or it can be administered by a healthcare worker, which
means administration needs to be considered from a broader perspective. Patient comfort
falls into an important category in the development of injectable drugs, especially since selfadministered subcutaneous dosing is becoming increasingly common and has potential to
improve patient loyalty and devotion to a treatment plan. By decreasing the size of the
needle, in both length and gauge, and by optimizing the needle tip geometry, injection

22

Ida Nygård l Åbo Akademi University
Master’s Thesis (Chem. Eng.)
___________________________________________________________________________
comfort can be increased. Injectability is related to rheology, since high viscosity
formulations present more challenges and require optimization of the dosing materials. High
viscosity formulations indicate that higher expulsion forces are required to expel the material
from the syringes through the needle. Equation 8 shows the mathematical formula for the
theoretical expulsion force which is derived from the Hagen-Poiseuille Equation (Watt, Khatri
and Dibble, 2019)

𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒 (𝑁) =

!"#$%&$%
'&

(8)

It is apparent by looking at equation 8 that the inner diameter of the needle (𝑑! ) is the most
dominant factor determining the expulsion force, second most dominant is the inner
diameter of the syringe (𝐷"# ). The other parameters (dynamic viscosity of the solution (µ),
volumetric flow rate (Q) and needle length (L)) are all proportional and therefore less of a
determining factor of the force (Watt, Khatri and Dibble, 2019).
Typical sizes of needles for subcutaneous injections are 25G and 23G, as these are the most
well-adjusted in terms of injection force, which decreases as the needle gauge decreases,
and patient comfort. While decreasing the gauge, i.e., a larger outer needle diameter, means
that there is a reduction in injection force, it also means that patient discomfort is
compromised. Larger needle diameters or smaller gauges also mean an increased risk of leakback and potential tissue damage. Primarily, thinner needles are desired for their comfort.
Thin-wall needles provide a larger inner diameter allowing low injection forces while
maintaining a relatively thin needle with a smaller outer diameter. This has been proven to
provide lower injection forces compared to regular wall needles, although they have the
same outer diameter. Ultimately, smaller injection and total forces in the injection process
are desired. It can be obtained by increasing the size of the needle, but as that contradicts/is
not in compliance with patient comfort, thin-wall needles can be opted for as they have the
same outer diameter but also a larger inner diameter and, therefore, a lower injection force.
It has also been noticed how an increase in the needle gauge or decrease in wall thickness,
such as thin-wall needles, increases the glide force and therefore increases patient
perception upon injection. However, the improved glide force and patient comfort come at
a cost of risking needle bending. The actual injection force required to expel the material
from the syringe and through the needle is generally considered satisfactory if it is under 40
N, as this is the maximum force considered acceptable. However, most recommend that the
injection force should not exceed 20 N, as forces below that are considered clinically relevant

23

Master’s Thesis (Chem. Eng.)
___________________________________________________________________________
injection forces, particularly for autoinjectors or other comparable devices (Chen et al., 2017;
Watt, Khatri and Dibble, 2019). Injection can be done into air but to simulate in vivo injections
more accurately the injection should be done into tissue or liquid. PBS (phosphate-buffered
saline) could be used for example as the injection medium, since it has properties which
simulate osmolarity and physiological pH. Conducting ex vivo and in vitro experiments before
in vivo is nonetheless recommended (Chen et al., 2017).

2.7.1 Dissolution testing of pharmaceuticals and silica
Dissolution testing is a vital analytical method for testing of pharmaceutical products and
effectively a requirement for pharmaceuticals not categorized as a true solution. According
to the article by Gray and Rosanske, 2020, the US Pharmacopeial (USP) determines that
dissolution belongs to Category III and is defined as “An analytical method for the
determination of performance characteristics…” A dissolution test registers the quantity of
APIs released into a liquid in a liquid/solid interface. This process is done under standardized
conditions including flow rate, temperature, volume, agitation and media composition (Gray
and Rosanske, 2020). By conducting dissolution tests into a liquid medium, a release profile
for the API or APIs in the dosage form can be achieved, which is associated to the release of
the component into the body, and therefore, instituting the association between in vitro and
in vivo behavior (Liu et al., 2013; Gray and Rosanske, 2020). The efficacy and clinical effects
of the drug can be studied after the released drug makes itself available for absorption. (Gray
and Rosanske, 2020). Dissolution testing certifies the quality of the product (Liu et al., 2013).
The dissolution of silica is dependent on a line of parameters including pH, temperature, size
of the particle and the structure of silica, which indicates that the dissolution behavior of
silica can be controlled by changing any one of the parameters (Unger, 2014). In dissolution
testing sink conditions are considered. According to the European Pharmacopeia, in sink
condition is defined as a dissolution medium that is three to ten times greater than the
saturation volume, i.e., the maximum concentration of the sample is less than 1/3 of the
saturation solubility in the dissolution medium. If this condition is not true, the conditions
are non-sink (Liu et al., 2013).

3 Experimental
3.1 Materials and equipment
For this study, commonly used and available laboratory equipment was used to conduct and
prepare the experiments, including pipettes, pH-meters, stirrers, spatulas, magnetic stirrers
and containers of various sizes. Pipettes were provided by the manufacturer Sartorius, pHmeter by Mettler Toledo and pH-meter electrode by Hamilton. The syringes which contained
the depot and were used for this study were the Chirana 1 ml syringes equipped with a LuerLock tip and manufactured by Terumo. Needles used for the injection force measurement
and to study the injectability were the 25G (0.5 x 25 mm) regular wall needles by the
manufacturer BD for the placebos and the manufacturer HSW HENKE-JECT for the API
samples. The first number in the bracket represents the outside diameter of the needle and
the latter represents the length of the needle. The two main components needed to prepare
the silica composites, or depots, are silica microparticles and a hydrogel containing silica
nanoparticles.

3.1.1 Silica microparticles
The silica microparticles were prepared in the DelSiTech laboratory facilities for the purpose
of this study. Both placebo microparticles and API-containing microparticles were
manufactured. They were stored in the fridge in a plastic container until utilized for the
preparation of the silica hydrogel - silica microparticle composite, also called a depot. For the
microparticles, deionized water prepared with the MILLI-Q water (mq-H2O) purification
system from Merck Millipore, hydrochloric acid (HCl, 0.1 M) and tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS) as well as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were utilized. Both the HCl and the NaOH were
provided by the manufacturer Merck Millipore, however, some of the NaOH had been
modified at DelSiTech to a different concentration. The TEOS was provided by the
manufacturer Sigma Aldrich.
The API-containing microparticles were manufactured by a similar method as the placebo
microparticles, only using a different recipe. An API called Entecavir (ETV) was used, which is
an antiviral therapeutic ingredient used to treat an infected liver or in other words, hepatitis
B (HBV) (Fimea, 2021). Similarly to the placebo microparticles, hydrochloric acid (HCL, 0.1 M),
deionized water prepared with the MILLI-Q water purification system from Merck Millipore,
tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was utilized to prepare the API

25

Master’s Thesis (Chem. Eng.)
___________________________________________________________________________
microparticles. The reagents were provided by the same manufacturers as for the placebo
microparticles.

3.1.2 Silica composite containing silica hydrogel and silica microparticles.
The silica composite which is called a depot contains the silica microparticles (placebo or API)
manufactured with the spray drying technique and a silica hydrogel. This is also called a
hydrogel nanocomposite. For the silica hydrogel, which contains nanoparticles, 0.1 M HCl,
mq-H2O, and TEOS are needed. NaOH with two different concentrations is also utilized to
adjust the pH of the sol or the suspension. Syringes are then filled with the prepared depot
material. In total, three different formulas or depots were prepared which will be referred to
as Placebo 1, Placebo 2 and API depots in this thesis.

3.2 Methods
Mainly three methods were used to analyze and study the samples and the effects of the
temperature treatments. A rheological analysis using a rheometer, injectability analysis and
an injection force measurement was done. Three sets of samples were made, two sets of
placebo samples and one set of API samples. The two placebo samples differed from each
other in that they had a slight difference in pH and the conditioning of them was slightly
different. The one set of API samples had two different batches made due to issues in gelling
with the first batch. However, both batches were used for this study, using primarily the
second batch which had a higher pH and, therefore, gelled faster. Two replicates from the
second batch, with faster gelling, were used and one replicate from the first batch, to amass
a total of three replicates per analysis/measurement. It should be noted that the first batch
was set to stabilize for a period of approximately 2.5 (18-20 days) weeks before they could
be determined to be somewhat gelled. The second batch was set to stabilize for only a period
of 4-6 days, before being determined gelled and ready to use.

3.2.1 Sol-gel technique and spray drying
For this study, silica microparticles were manufactured by the spray drying technique in the
laboratory. The silica placebo microparticles were prepared from a silica sol of R3-50
character. The so-called R-value indicates the ratio between water and TEOS. The first value,
in this case R3, would therefore mean that TEOS is three times more abundant in the sol than

26

Master’s Thesis (Chem. Eng.)
___________________________________________________________________________
the water. In this instance, deionized water was used which was produced using the MILLI-Q
Academic water purifying system. The sol was then diluted with a dilutant, containing water
and NaOH, to form a sol with an R-value of 50. The contents of water in the sol are now 50
times more apparent than that of TEOS. 700 µl of NaOH was added to adjust the pH of the
microparticles, to approximately 5, to improve the gelling process of the depot. As the CSTR
system was used in this study, a separate container for the R3-sol and the dilutant (containing
mq-H2O and NaOH) was prepared in advance for the spray drying. Before the spray drying
could begin, the CSTR system had to be set up and pumps had to be calibrated to achieve a
state of equilibrium, where the in- and outgoing materials from the mixing tank were equal.
The setup consisted of two containers holding the respective reagents, one pump on either
side of the mixing tank, one providing the reactor tank with the reagents and the other
sucking out the material and leading it to the spray dryer through silicon tubes. A scale was
placed under the mixing tank to allow monitoring of the flow rate. The flow rate of the pump
controlling the outgoing material was adjusted as needed, to keep the system in an
equilibrium. A stirrer was also placed under the mixing tank to continuously mix the reagents.
The API containing microparticles were manufactured by first preparing a sol (colloidal
solution) containing mq-H20, HCl and TEOS. The diluent containing the API was manufactured
by mixing mq-H2O, NaOH and the API, in this case ETV. The API was weighed, transferred to
a large bottle and lastly the other two components (mq-H2O and NaOH) were added. The
solution was stirred with a magnetic stirrer until the API was dissolved and a homogeneous
mixture was obtained. The final pH of the solution was measured to justify the use of the
material for spray drying. A sample to measure the pH was taken before starting the spray
drying process by mixing the right ratio of the two reagents, sol and API-containing diluent.
The ratio was based on the flow rates of the reagents. While spray drying the API
microparticles the reagents were kept in an ice bath to prevent premature reactions and to
have as homogeneous a material as possible.
When spray drying is complete, microparticles are collected from the collector vessel and put
into a container to be weighed. After the silica microparticles are prepared and collected,
they are stored in the fridge in a plastic container until depot manufacturing. All recipes for
the material manufacturing can be found in Table 1.

3.2.2 Depot manufacturing
The manufacturing of the depot starts with the preparation of a silica sol of R400 character,
which the recipes for can be found in Table 2. Firstly, mq-H2O and HCl are pipetted into a
container containing a magnetic stirrer. TEOS is added last, as the reaction starts upon the
introduction of TEOS into the system. The sol is then stirred until a homogeneous solution is
formed and the hydrolysis finished. If phase separation can be observed, it is an indication of
a still partially unhydrolyzed TEOS. The sol should possess a pH above/near 2 to optimize the
gelling process. Sols possessing lower R-values would also feel warm to the touch, since the
reaction is exothermic. The R400 silica sol is less reactive due to less possible reaction sites,
as it contains less TEOS relative to water and hence does not feel warm to the touch. At this
point, NaOH was added to increase the pH of the sol and, in consequence, accelerate the
gelling process.

API-containing depots were manufactured in a similar manner. In the first batch of API depots,
NaOH was added to the suspension to increase the pH. A pH of approximately 5.4 was
achieved. Dissimilar to the first batch, NaOH was added both to the sol and the suspension
of the second batch of API depots. This was done to increase the pH to a satisfactory level.
The less concentrated NaOH was added to the sol and the more concentrated NaOH was
added to the suspension. A final pH of 5.8 was achieved for the suspension. Thorough mixing
was done until the desired pH was achieved.

3.2.3 Temperature treatments
The conditioning and processing of the depots were the main objective of this study to
acquire a greater understanding of the possible repercussions of the temperature treatments
on the depot material and its structure. This is valuable information to acquire as during the
transportation of the material sudden temperature changes can transpire. In the event of
accidental inaccurate storage conditions during the transportation journey and without any
information on the possible effects there is no guarantee of a high-quality product/material.

After the depots had been stabilized and formed a gel structure, the syringes filled with the
depot was placed into four different conditions to simulate possible situations and
temperature variations in the transportation cycle. Syringes were placed in room
temperature (RT), in fridge conditions (9 °C), freezer conditions (-26 °C) and into a heat
chamber (40 °C). The standard preserving conditions for the depots are fridge or room
temperature. Three replicates were made for each condition. The syringes were placed into
the respective conditions for different amounts of time to study the potential effects of
temperature variations on the silica-based depot. The following conditions were true for the
placebo samples. The RT sample was kept in static conditions in room temperature, from
manufacturing to analysis. The fridge sample was put into the fridge for 16 h after which it
was analyzed. The other fridge sample was subjected to two freezing and thawing cycles,
that is 16 h in the fridge, 8 h in RT, another 16 h in the fridge and then again 8 h in RT before
analyzing [(16 h in fridge + 8 h in RT) x 2]. The freezer sample was also placed in the freezer
for 16 h after which it was taken out into RT for 8 h before performing the analyses on the
sample. As with the fridge sample, a second set of freezer samples also underwent two
freezing and thawing cycles [(16 h in freezer + 8 h in RT) x 2]. The 40C samples were put into
a heat chamber (40 °C) for 4 h after which they were placed into RT for 4 h before undergoing
analysis.
The API containing depots were put under the same conditions but with slightly different
time parameters. The set times were not always possible due to long measurement running
times. The active formulation was in static RT conditions before analyzing, fridge samples
were 16 h in the fridge and taken out into RT at least 15 min before analyzing the samples.
Fridge (2 F-T) were conditioned for [(16 h in fridge + 8 h in RT) x 2], freezer samples were in
the freezer for 16 h + 8 h in RT, freezer (2F-T) were conditioned for [(16 h in freezer + 8 h in
RT) x 2]. Lastly the 40C samples were first conditioned for 4h in the heat chamber in 40 °C
and then taken out into RT for 4 h before analyzing. Again, worth mentioning that these are
approximate times as especially the rheological analysis was long and scheduling the
analyzing was proven to be difficult to do at the specific times predetermined. However, the
samples times in RT were the only parameter effected while the conditioning times in the
actual fridge, freezer and heat chamber were very accurate. An overview of all samples
Placebo 1, Placebo 2 and API containing depots, and their specific parameters and
temperature treatment profiles can be seen in Table 3.

3.2.4 Injection Force Measurement study and injectability
To investigate the quality of the sample, injection force measurements were done on all
samples. The study was done using a LLOYD Instruments LR30KPlus Materials Testing
Machine attached with a 250 N load cell, see Figure 10. The instrument can be used for
measuring an extensive range of material properties, including injectability. Other common
properties possible to measure using this equipment are tensile strength, elongation, and
flexibility. For this study, the instrument was used for an injection force measurement (IFM).

Figure 10. Schematic picture of the mechanical testing machine of the injectability (Chen et
al., 2017)
The instrument measures the force which is necessary to inject the depot out from the
needle. In this study, a 25G needle was used. The injection was done at a velocity of 60
mm/min and the machine extension was set to a limit of 13 mm, which equals around 228.4
µl injected from the syringe. The parameters were predetermined, and the limit set according
to the amount of material available in the syringes, including a safety margin to avoid the
plunger going through the syringe and damaging both equipment and syringe. As a result,
the load (N) or the injection force was obtained as a function of the machine extension, which
was later converted to the injected volume, V (μl) by using equation 9. This is the formula for
the volume of a cylinder. The injected volume represents a more accurate description of the
quantity of sample injected. The inner diameter of the syringes is 4.73 mm.

The injectability of the depots was studied by a qualitative manual injection method.
Approximately 150 µl per syringe was injected onto tissue paper. The injection was done
through a 25G RW (0.5 x 25 mm) needle and was evaluated based on observing the flow of
the depot material, consistency, and signs of phase separation. A satisfactory injectability
was identified by a steady flow, minimal water leaching (a sign of phase separation), no

clogging and, overall, a homogeneous material. The injection should be done steadily with
an evenly applied pressure and as consistently between the samples as possible.

3.2.5 Rheological measurements
Rheology is used as a method to understand and study the behavior of the depot and to
determine the effects of the temperature treatments done. The rheological measurements
were done using an Anton Paar MCR300 rheometer attached with an 8mm parallel plate
(PP8) measuring system and a measuring gap of 1.00 mm. Choosing a smaller measuring
system, or geometry as they are called, means that smaller amounts of sample is required,
and the torque applied to the sample is smaller. The rheometer was loaded with the samples
by injecting the depot through the luer lock tip onto the peltier plate. Frequency sweeps,
viscosity measurements and an ORO test was done amongst the samples. An overview of all
samples and their respective rheological measurements can be found in Table 4.

On the Placebo 1 samples a frequency sweep along with a viscosity measurement at a
temperature of 25 °C was done. The frequency sweep was done in the range from 0,1 Hz to
10 Hz and the shear strain was set at 0,1 %. The shear rate for the viscosity measurement
was 5 1/s to 400 1/s in the ramp up and a shear rate going from 400 1/s to 5 1/s in the ramp
down to gather data on the recovery of the sample. No ORO test was done to the Placebo 1
depots.
An Oscillatory-Rotational-Oscillatory (ORO) test was performed with the same rheometer
attached with the same bob (PP8) on the Placebo 2 and API depots. The temperature was set
at 25°C. The ORO test was built specifically for this study using the Anton Paar RheoPlus
Rheometer software, where all steps and individual parameters were predetermined. The
33

Ida Nygård l Åbo Akademi University
Master’s Thesis (Chem. Eng.)
___________________________________________________________________________
ORO test in this study has five steps, including the main three steps: high shear oscillation,
rotation, and the second high shear oscillation. This part of the test is the actual ORO
measurement, and the oscillation measurements are amplitude sweeps. The ORO test also
includes two low shear oscillation measurements, one before and one after the actual ORO
test, these are frequency sweeps. It should be noted that in this thesis the abbreviation ORO
is used to describe the following steps of the measurement: amplitude sweep, rotational
measurement and the second amplitude sweep (AS-R-AS). Frequency sweeps are also
oscillation measurements (“O”), which is why this should be clarified. One could even call the
test an OOROO test since it includes two oscillation measurements before the rotational
measurement and then followed by another two oscillation measurements. The most
accurate abbreviation could be FS-AS-R-AS-FS. The first and last oscillation measurement, the
frequency sweeps, are conducted within the LVER which simulates the material
structure/behavior at rest, whereas the oscillation measurements in the middle, the
amplitude sweeps, go beyond the LVER of the material and therefore acts in a destructive
manner on the material. In this study the measurement will, however, be referred to as the
ORO test and the other two oscillation measurements will be referred to as the frequency
sweep either before or after the ORO test. An overview with all the specific parameters of
the ORO test can be seen in Table 5.
The ORO test consisted of an amplitude sweep at high shear followed by a rotational
measurement and lastly another amplitude sweep at high shear strain. These steps were
made to destroy and deform the structure of the material as much as possible and afterwards
study if the structure of the material recovers and if it does, how well it recovers. The low
shear oscillation measurements, the frequency sweeps before and after the ORO, were done
to evaluate the structure of the material before and after high shear.

4 Results and discussion
The three different types of samples were measured and analyzed. The results gathered from
the analysis methods from the Placebo 1, Placebo 2 and API containing depots are presented
in this section. The API depots were made in two batches due to the first batch having an
inadequate pH value leading to a longer stabilization time. The first sample from that batch
was used after 18 days of stabilization/gelling compared to the 4 days of stabilization/gelling
of the second batch. The two placebos differed from each other in that they also had different
amounts of NaOH added and therefore dissimilar pH values. The Placebo 1 samples included
more NaOH but had also different rheological measurements and temperature treatment
profiles. The Placebo 2 samples had less NaOH added to try and make the material less stiff
compared to the Placebo 1 samples, but still obtain a gel-like material. Placebo 1 samples
were proven to be rather hard and therefore, in an attempt to potentially optimize the
analysis results, a less stiff material was desired for the Placebo 2 samples. The temperature
treatment profiles were also changed and optimized and some new conditions, including
freezing-thawing cycles were added to investigate the effects of repeated temperature
treatment cycles. The ORO test was also done on the Placebo 2 and API containing depots.
The Placebo 2 and API depots are mainly going to be studied and compared as their
parameters and analysis methods are more comparable.
In this study the frequently used abbreviation (2 F-T) stands for two freezing and thawing
cycles. In the case of the Fridge (2 F-T) samples it means that the sample has been two cycles
in the fridge before analyzing. RT stands for room temperature and 40C is used for the
samples which have been in the heat chamber at 40 degrees Celsius. All specific parameters
can be found in Table 3.

4.1 Manual Injectability
Studying the injectability of the samples is greatly important to warrant a depot which can
preserve its rheological behavior and other structural properties upon injection into the
administered injection site. Injectability was measured by a qualitative manual analysis which
can be problematic in the evaluation process of the sample quality since the results are
partially also dependent on the way of administration. The injection force measurement

36

Master’s Thesis (Chem. Eng.)
___________________________________________________________________________
gives more harmonized measurements and is used later to compliment the results from the
manual injectability and, furthermore, gives more objective results.
As per Table 6, the RT and fridge samples possess satisfactory injectability for all samples,
which can be identified by 1) a gel-like consistency 2) there is no noticeable clogging during
injection and 3) no signs of phase separation. It should be mentioned that the depots should
be gel-like and non-flowing at rest but upon injection, due to shearing through the needle,
the depot turns into a liquid-like flowing formula. This phenomenon is called shear-thinning
behavior or pseudoplasticity. After injection the depot becomes non-flowing and gel-like
again. Phase separation can be identified by excess water leaching and microparticle
aggregates, i.e., an inhomogeneous dispersion. Lack of or minimal water leaching is a sign of
no phase separation within the depot. The other samples, i.e., the Fridge + 4h RT, Freezer
and the 40C sample all presented signs of inconsistency among the samples and issues in
injectability. These issues included clogging followed by a burst, issues upon initial injection,
such as increased amounts of force required to inject the depot, an increased amount of
water leaching onto the tissue paper/petri dish or other signs of phase separation and
unhomogenized formulations. It is worth noting that inconsistencies amongst samples are
normal to some extent. Even the RT and fridge samples displayed disparities between
samples. Inconsistencies would most likely be more apparent in a larger sample group, as
expected. Ideally a formulation would be consistent between samples to ensure an even
quality of the samples but due to factors such as human error, these inconsistencies are
realistic and even unavoidable. Air bubbles might have remained or emerged in the syringes
in the filling process which has caused the structure to be broken down to a certain extent
by the moving air bubbles during the stabilization process. Insufficient mixing of the
microparticles and the sol, which creates the depot, could also influence the homogeneity of
the sample, and result in minor defects. Increasing the sampling group gives a more accurate
representation of the sample group quality, since a smaller sample group size is less forgiving
of errors and defaults.

Approximately 150 µl was injected through the needle per sample. All samples showed some
water leaking on the paper at which the samples were injected onto. This phenomenon is
normal, especially as the paper also absorbs some water from the gel. However, excess water
leaching should not occur.
The word watery in Table 6 requires some specifications. The sample most probably had
phase separation, which meant that some water leaching occurred and particles within the
sample had sedimented. As a result, the injected depot was less viscous throughout the
injection compared to, for example, the Fridge and RT sample. Less viscous referring to a
material that has a lower viscosity and flows easier. Gel-like materials are viscoelastic, not
flowing. Water leaching was especially noticeable since the depot, which was injected onto
paper, absorbed the water. Another way to describe it is that the depot “bled” water, which
was noticeable as water around the gel-like depot.

The freezer sample presented the most issues out of the samples which was anticipated. The
depot is a silica-silica composite formed from silica nanoparticles, silica microparticles and a
liquid, which is mostly water. As is commonly known, water expansion is a phenomenon that
happens upon freezing, which can cause the structural breakdown of the depot when it is
brought into room temperature again to defrost. As Patel, 2019, mentions in his article in
Chemical & Engineering News, a hydrogel becomes brittle and loses its elasticity when frozen
(Patel, 2019).
In this study the freezer conditioned depot was placed in room temperature conditions for
24h/8h depending on the sample or until defrosted, before analyzing the material. Analyzing
a frozen silica-silica composite would be established as rather difficult. The porous
microstructure of the hydrogel could be damaged when freezing the material and defeat the
purpose of storing and preserving the properties of the hydrogel as close to the state at which
it was when manufactured. Moreover, contrary to organic hydrogels, which swell, silicabased hydrogels do not swell. However, all hydrogels, including silica hydrogels, contain
water, which naturally expands during freezing. How well the hydrogel can handle the
specific conditions is reliant on the type of hydrogel and the specific parameters, moreover
it is impossible to determine whether all hydrogels would react in this manner.
Similarly, to the Placebo 1 samples, RT and Fridge samples showed the best injectability for
the Placebo 2 samples, shown in Table 7. Fridge (2 F-T) also possessed satisfactory
injectability, some small bubbles upon initial injection excluded. These were most likely due
to some air bubbles that had occurred in the manufacturing and filling stages of the syringes.
All freezer samples showed signs of phase separation. The Freezer (2 F-T) also appeared to
have problems with clogging. Clogging is likely due to the phase separation as it separates
the microparticles from the hydrogel and greatest aggregates, which end up clogging the
needle or that the viscoelastic properties of the depot are not homogeneous throughout the
material. The latter can explain clogging since larger aggregates concentrate due to shear
stress applied. One of the Freezer samples had a small initial clog that was followed by a burst.
Except this initial clog, the Freezer samples behaved more in a liquid-like manner and had
the consistency of that more than gel-like. As for the 40C samples, satisfactory injectability
could be observed for these for the most part. However, a small initial clog and some small
bursts did occur.

As a summary one could say that the Freezer and Freezer (2 F-T) indicated most difficulties
in the injectability and were most affected by the temperature treatment regarding
injectability. Visually the freezer samples also looked the least gel-like and did not hold their
structure upon injection as well as the other samples. All other samples, including the 40C
samples, did appear gel-like and held their structure upon injection through the needle.
The injectability of the API depots were studied similarly and with the same needle gauge
(25G). The depots were injected onto a petri dish. It should be noted that many samples were
unsuccessful in injecting the last > 100 µl of the sample. It looked as if the microparticles had
aggregated and was therefore left in the syringe unable to be injected. This issue could be
due to inadequate manufacturing practices or if the preparation of the depot took too long
and gelling started occurring prematurely before the syringes were filled or that the mixing

of the suspension was not thorough enough. The possibility that the composite hydrogel was
not entirely stable is another reason that could have caused this. However, usually this
phenomenon is noticed as plain water expelling first from the depot at injection, which did
not occur in these experiments. Another possibility is that the suspension (silica
microparticles, silica nanoparticles and the liquid (mainly water)) gelled to some extent in the
suspension-NaOH interface as the NaOH was added to adjust the pH. The suspension that
came in direct contact with NaOH was gelled, since NaOH was added directly to the
suspension and not to the sol.
All RT samples showed satisfactory injectability for most of the injection as it appears from
Table 8. Approximately 150 µl was successfully injected, leaving around 100 µl unsuccessfully
injected. The fridge samples also showed satisfactory injectability except one which had a
clog towards the end of the injection. The injection was successfully continued but only due
to unsatisfactory large forces applied, not clinically viable. The clog was possibly due to a
larger aggregate that had emerged in the manufacturing stages or because the composite
gel was not homogeneous enough and a part of the microparticles were aggregated during
the injection. It is also possible that the depot material separates upon injection which causes
the material to appear aggregated or phase separated although it is not. This could be an
explanation for the 0.1 ml that is left unsuccessfully injected in many of the samples.

4.2 Injection Force Measurement
Injection forces should be below 20 N to be clinically relevant and below 10 N for ideal
injections. It should be noted that the injections conducted in this study were injected into
air. To simulate in vivo injections more accurately the injection should be done into tissue or
liquid (Chen et al., 2017). In this study two different rounds of measurements on the placebo
samples with different parameters, and one set of measurements of the API containing
depots were conducted. By looking at Figure 11, which represents the Placebo 1 samples, it
can be identified that the RT sample requires the largest force in order to be injected through
the needle. The injection force stays between approx. 10 N and 16 N throughout the injection,
which is in the range for clinically relevant and acceptable forces but not ideal.
Both the Freezer and the heat chamber sample (40C) present peaks in the graph indicating a
lack of steady flow and clogging within the syringe. These can be signs of aggregation or
phase separation caused by the temperature treatments and have led to structural changes
in the depot. These could also be due to unsatisfactory manufacturing practices such as
unproper mixing of the dispersion before filling the syringes. The 40C sample has the lowest
injection force during most of the injection until, what one can assume is clogging occurs,
and shows up as peaks in the end of the injection. This could be an indication of phase
separation which has led to a less concentrated and more liquid-like segments of the material
to be injected out from the syringe first before coming across segments of aggregation or
sediments in the depot which causes the clogging. This same phenomenon can be observed
for the Freezer sample but with a smaller peak and therefore an assumption can be made
that the aggregation, or the clogging is not as severe as with the 40C sample.
The Fridge sample compared to the Fridge + 4h RT requires lower injection forces two thirds
of the injection, after which the Fridge sample requires larger injection forces. The impact of
a longer time in room temperature is inconclusive as more experiments should be conducted.
In this study the Fridge + 4h RT sample appears to be more solid-like as it requires larger
forces, however, the difference is only approx. 3 N. The Fridge sample has a steadier injection
force profile compared to the Fridge + 4h RT, which has an approx. 4 N drop in the load two
thirds of the way. It appears from this study that the Fridge depots have a structure, which is
more homogeneous than the Fridge + 4h RT depots.

The Placebo 2 samples, shown in Figure 12a, have a noticeably lower injection force
compared to the Placebo 1 samples. The difference is most likely a cause of the differences
in the pH of the silica-silica composites, which affects the gelling of the depots. The Placebo
1 depot had a pH of 6.3 and the Placebo 2 had a pH of 5.6. The depots appear to have very
similar injection forces and no peaks can be seen from the figure. This indicates smooth
injectability and homogeneous formulas of the depots.

To extinguish the results from Placebo 2 samples better and to view any possible differences
between the conditions, a graph with the same results but a scaled down y-axis (four times
smaller) is plotted in Figure 12b. The figure shows that the samples have a peak in the
beginning of the graph, similar to the Placebo 1 samples, but on a smaller scale. This peak in
the beginning of the injection could be a sign of the instrument trying to find a steady flow
or because of the depot structure. The injection force then decreases for all samples and
finds a steady flow state for a while. As the injection proceeds the injection force starts to
increase right before reaching 100 µl injected. The increase in the injection force steadies
some after a few more µl have been injected but proceeds to increase for the majority of the
measurement for most of the samples. Only the Freezer and Freezer (2 F-T) samples behave
differently. Their injection force decreases slightly towards the end of the injection but have
an even smaller increase again at the very end. It should be remembered that these
differences are minor compared to the Placebo 1 samples as the scale is different. The
Placebo 2 samples have a satisfactory injectability force as the load never surpasses 10 N,

As a conclusion one can say that the biggest challenges for the Placebo 1 samples were
observed in the Freezer and 40C samples. In the Placebo 1 samples the heat treated (40C)
sample did show some difficulties in the injection towards the end of the injection window,
most likely due to some phase separation. However, most samples did not indicate any major
difficulties, which was expected in particular with the Fridge and RT samples. Although all
Placebo 2 samples have very similar, almost identical injection forces, they appeared
different visually. In particular the samples that had been conditioned in the freezer proved
to have satisfactory injection forces, as the load stayed below 10 N, but were also the samples
that looked most different from the rest. Visually they appeared to be less gel-like and more
liquid-like in consistency upon injection with the injection force measurement equipment.
The API formulation proved to have the most issues in the injection force compared to the
placebos. In Figure 13 it can be noticed that all conditions experience some sort of peak in
the injection force. This can be an indication of many things, such as phase separation,
aggregation, poor manufacturing etc. or simply the behavior of the API-silica microparticles
in combination with the silica nanoparticles and liquid. Different surface chemistries between
the microparticles affects the rheology and therefore the injection of the depot. Surprising is
that even the RT and Fridge samples show some peaks, as these have shown satisfactory
results from the placebos.

In the side-by-side comparison, Figure 14, between Placebo 1, Placebo 2 and API depots, all
scaled the same, shows that Placebo 2 clearly has the least complications in the injectability.
Placebo 1 requires the most force to be injected and has also some clogs appearing during
the injection. The API formulation requires satisfactory injection forces for the most part but
has some clogs as well, specially the 40C sample in the middle of the injection and RT, Freezer
and Freezer (2 F-T) samples towards the end of the injection.

The results from the Placebo 1 samples are separated by conditioning in Figure 15, including
the standard deviations. Biggest standard deviations are in the RT and Fridge samples. One
sample in both conditions had significantly larger injection forces than the other two samples,
resulting in a larger average injection force. It is clear that the Freezer and 40C samples had
some clogs while the RT and both fridge samples did not.

By taking a closer look at the results from the Placebo 2 samples and by separating the
conditions and adding the standard deviations, to investigate the individual results from each
syringe, variations can be noted between the samples, although marginal. Judging by these
results one can see that all samples require low injection forces < 10 N. Almost surprisingly
similar results can be noted between the three replicate samples, as demonstrated by the
standard deviation. Both freezer samples show signs of small clogs as the more uneven and
bumpy graphs show in Figure 16D and 16E. The 40C samples appears to have had the
smoothest injection with the least bumps and most similar injections between the three
replicates, although very similar to the other results including RT and Fridge. The bumps in
the graphs indicate some type of aggregation or clog in the depot, which the reason for their

occurrence can be many, including manufacturing errors, effects of the temperature

In Figure 17, the separate results from the API formulation also show that the Freezer,
Freezer (2 F-T) and 40C sample have the biggest deviations between the replicates. This
indicates that there are the most variations between the samples from these conditions. The
Fridge (2 F-T) shows the best results since it has the smallest variations among the replicates
and also the least and smallest peaks. This indicates most homogeneous formulation and
least deviations between replicates. Fridge and RT show some peaks and variation among
replicates as well, but not to the same extent as the freezer and 40C samples.

4.2.1 The effects of freezing and thawing on the injection force
Freezing and thawing was conducted to study the possible effects of conditioning the sample
multiple times. The freezing and thawing cycles which were conducted indicated no
significant changes in the injection force of the depot compared to the depots conditioned
only once in the freezer, which can be seen in Figure 18 for the Placebo 2 samples and in
Figure 19 for the API depots. The placebos present ideal injection forces as they remain below
10 N throughout the injection. And there is practically no difference between one- and twotimes conditioned samples.

The API formulation on the other hand surpasses 10 N and even 20 N, but the differences
between Freezer and Freezer (2 F-T) samples are insignificant and therefore the conclusion
can be made that two freezing thawing cycles do not impact the injection force of the depot
more or less than compared to one cycle of freezing and thawing. However, with more cycles,
for example three, further effects could be studied but the chances of significant effects
would be small as two cycles already provides no signs of change in injection force.

4.3 Rheology
Rheology has a fundamental part in the performance of the hydrogel and therefore makes
the evaluation of rheology an important part of the analysis process. Rheological
measurement profiles vary depending on the material, the desired parameters and the end
application of the hydrogel. It should be noted that the shear strain in Figure 20 is 0,1%
whereas in Figure 22 and Figure 23, for the Placebo 2 and API depots, the shear strain was
set at 0,01%. In Figure 21, which represents a rotational measurement, the shear strain is not
constant. This rotational measurement was only performed on the Placebo 1 samples. The
shear strain is selected depending on the formulation and within the linear viscoelastic region
(LVER) of the material. The frequency sweeps are performed within the LVER. Within this
region the shear does not practically deform the material and the results obtained can be
comparable with other strains. Low strains can cause difficulties because it produces weak
signals and therefore make the results less reliable.
In Figure 20, the results of the Placebo 1 samples are presented. The figure shows the results
from the frequency sweep. The graph shows that minimal differences can be noticed
between the behaviors of the different samples. The loss factor remains below 0,1 and at
some frequencies even below 0,01 meaning that the material is extremely gel-like and rather
hard, since the loss factor for gel-like materials should be below 1 (tan δ < 1).

The Placebo 1 samples behave in a pseudoplastic manner or shear-thinning manner, which
can be seen in Figure 21, as their viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate. This behavior
is wanted for the depot material. At rest, i.e., in the syringe, the depot should be gel-like and
firm. Once it is injected through a needle and put under shear force, the shear-thinning
behavior ensures a smooth and easier injection into the injection site. Once it has been
administered and is again under rest it should stabilize in the site of injection and recover the
structure to become a firm gel again. The shear-thinning behavior makes the administration
of the depot easier and more pain free for the patient.

Figure 22 represents the results from the first frequency sweep (FS), part of the FS-ORO-FS,
measurement of the Placebo 2 samples. Again, it should be clarified that in this study the
ORO test refers to AS-R-AS and the frequency sweeps come before and after the ORO test,
FS-AS-R-AS-FS. The freezer conditioned samples have the lowest loss factor out of the
samples. G’ is also the lowest for the Freezer sample. This is in line with the results from the
injectability studies, which indicated that the material was more liquid-like than the other
conditioned samples. Surprising is that the 40C, Freezer (2 F-T) and Fridge sample all have
almost identical G’. This could be seen as surprising since the samples differed from each

Some interesting findings from Figure 23 and the API depot samples frequency sweep results,
first FS (within LVER) of the FS-AS-R-AS-FS measurement, include the difference in G’
between Fridge and Fridge (2 F-T) samples in contrast to the Freezer and Freezer (2 F-T)
samples that do not show as big of a difference between the samples. The Freezer samples
might have undergone a bigger structural change compared to the Fridge sample and
therefore does not show as big of a difference between the samples. Freezer (2 F-T) and
Fridge (2 F-T) are also very similar in G’, which is surprising considering the difference in their
consistency upon manual injection. The RT, Fridge and 40C samples all behaved similarly
regarding the G’. Somehow it can be surprising that the 40C samples had similar behavior as
it was expected that in 40C the structural and rheological properties of the samples would

decay. Overall, G’ increased, which means that a harder material occurred with increasing
angular frequency. The loss factor decreased for all samples and did not show any major
differences or irregularities. The Freezer (2 F-T) sample had, on average, the largest loss
factor across the angular frequency spectrum, indicating that it was the least gel-like of all
the gel-like materials.

At this stage it was noted that the rheological data from the first FS of the FS-ORO-FS
measurement, which is within the LVER, did not comply with the expectations nor do they
correlate to each other between Placebo 2 and API formulation. For example, the 40C sample
appears to have one of the highest G’ in the API formulation but the second lowest G’ among
the samples for the Placebo 2 depots. More surprising is knowing that for example, in the API
formulation, the 40C, Fridge and RT sample all possess almost identical G’, while Fridge (2 FT) and Freezer (2 F-T) also possess almost identical G’. This is especially surprising as they do
not look similar visually, which was noted upon loading the rheometer and in the injectability
study. It does appear that the freezer samples have some of the lowest G’, but their loss
factor are in the API samples one of the highest while in the Placebo 2 samples they have

55

Ida Nygård l Åbo Akademi University
Master’s Thesis (Chem. Eng.)
___________________________________________________________________________
some of the highest loss factor. Already at this stage it could be noted that the rheological
measurements give unpredictable results. However, it does show some guiding results across
the samples and can give a better overall understanding of the rheological behavior of the
samples.

4.3.1 Structure recovery of the depot after high deformation using FS-ORO-FS
The ORO measurement was initially done to try and simulate vibration during transportation.
Vibration simulation tests can be difficult to simulate but in this study the effects of radical
deformation were investigated instead since no conclusions about vibration and its effects
on the material can be done through the ORO test as the ORO test studies the materials
ability to recover after high shear. High shear strains during the amplitude sweeps were made
to obliterate the structure of the depot. The recovery of the structure was also possible to
study with this measurement as the amplitude sweep was done in reverse (100% … 0,01%)
after the first amplitude sweep and the rotational measurement. This gives information on
whether the depot can undergo harsh conditions and yet recover to its original state or at
minimum close to its original state. The recovery of the material after being subjected to
large deformation gives an indication whether the material is still operational. Especially in
the transportation of the depots, vibrations of a multitude of frequencies and amplitudes can
be employed on the material, which can have effects on the structure of the material and its
performance. The ORO test is not the most adequate representation of vibrations during
transportation, which carry a load in x-, y- and z-axis, however it represents the materials
ability to recover after high deformation or shear has been applied to it, i.e., the ORO test
applies large deformation forces on the material, whereas vibration is defined as according
to The Encyclopaedia Britannica “a periodic back and forth motion of the particles of an
elastic body or medium, commonly resulting when almost any physical system is displaced
from its equilibrium condition and allowed to respond to the forces that tend to restore
equilibrium.” (Britannica, 2020). Therefore, the ORO test was employed instead of a vibration
simulation test. The difference is that an amplitude sweep does not necessarily have a
periodic movement, as per definition a periodic movement is a motion that occurs in equal
time intervals repeatedly. The amplitude sweep done in this study is not perfectly periodic,
it does move almost periodically though since the time interval between data points range
between 12,36 s - 13,89 s. However, the back-and-forth motion is relevant, as the amplitude
sweep applies an oscillating back and forth motion at a constant frequency while increasing

56

Ida Nygård l Åbo Akademi University
Master’s Thesis (Chem. Eng.)
___________________________________________________________________________
the strain at certain time intervals. The rotational shear applied, however, is not periodical
nor oscillation movement.
The Placebo 2 and API depot samples were exposed to the FS-ORO-FS test. The figures show
the results of the frequency sweep before and after the ORO test or before and after
deformation of the sample. The FS after the ORO test depicts the recovery of the sample
when the frequency is constant. This FS is deployed instantly after the second amplitude
sweep (AS) is done and therefore the ORO (AS-R-AS) test is done. If and how fast the loss
factor and G’ recover is then measured. The amplitude for the FS measurements, both before
(Pre) and after (Post) shearing are 0,01%. The time points for the measurements are
approximately the same across all samples.
As per Figure 24, showing the storage modulus of the placebo sample before and after
shearing, an overall decrease in the G’ after shearing can be observed across the samples.
The Freezer and the Fridge (2 F-T) samples have a significantly lower G’ after shearing,
indicating a weaker material structure after shearing the samples. A drop in the G’ could
imply that the gel structure of the material has weakened as a result of the deformation from
the ORO test.

The loss factor of Placebo 2, shown in Figure 25, appears to have increased as a result of the
deformation. An increase in the loss factor implies, similarly to the results from the storage
modulus, that the gel structure has weakened. Two samples, Fridge and Fridge (2 F-T),
surpass tand=1 at low angular frequencies, meaning that on rheological terms they are not
considered gels anymore. The loss factor after shearing, shown as the dotted lines in the
graph, appear to have more volatile results. The loss factors before shearing stay more
constant, decreasing in a more linear manner. This indicates that the shearing or deformation
of the samples has resulted in the material structure inhabiting a less homogeneous
decomposition, a rearranging and breaking up of chemical and/or physical bonds within the
depot. The 40C sample has a similar loss factor before and after shearing.

Like the Placebo 2 samples, the API depots also had an overall decrease in the G’ after
shearing, as shown in Figure 26, apart from the Freezer sample, which contradictorily to the
rest of the samples had an increase in the G’. However, at high angular frequencies the G’
was also lower after shearing, although similar to before shearing. The Fridge sample had the
most drastic change in G’. This could be explained by the fact that the Fridge sample is
supposed to withhold the condition of the depot the best. In other words, the conditioning

of the sample does not result in breakdown or degradation of the material structure.
Therefore, upon shearing the samples, the destruction becomes the most prominent.

The loss factor of the Freezer (2 F-T) Post sample results in Figure 27 are based on two sample
instead of three. The results suggest a measuring error has occurred, during one of the
measurements, caused by the equipment or other errors, including slip effects. The loss
factor of said sample can be seen in Figure 28A. Figure 28B shows all three measurements of
the Freezer (2 F-T) samples, which reveals the measuring error next to the other two
measurements. The measuring error was therefore excluded from the average loss factor to
avoid putting forth misleading results.

4.3.2 Effects of freezing and thawing cycles on rheology
Freezing and thawing can occur during the transportation of a product. By accidental
circumstances the depots can be exposed to not just one freezing and thawing cycle but also
two or more. In this study the effects of one and two were studied, which can be seen in
Figure 29 and Figure 30. The effects of freezing and thawing on the rheology of the depot
samples show contradicting results. The Placebo 2 samples present an increase in the G’ and
an increase in the loss factor, as per Figure 29. However, the results from the API formulation
suggest a decrease in the G’ after the second freezing period contrary to the Placebo 2. But
similarly to the Placebo 2, the API showed an increase in the loss factor, which is shown in
Figure 30. This suggests that the rheological data might not give an accurate description of
the structure in this case. Perhaps the method is not sensitive enough or the differences
between the materials is merely small. The measurements are done within the LVER.

The results from the Placebo 2 samples suggest that two freezing-thawing cycles would
increase the stiffness of the depot and make it more gel-like, according to the G’. But become
less gel-like according to the loss factor as it increases upon further freezing-thawing cycles.
The API depots give similar results regarding the loss factor, a decrease in the gel-like
properties of the sample. As both loss factors for Placebo 1 and API depots suggest a less gellike material with further freezing-thawing cycles and the G’ of API depots suggest the same,

61

speculations regarding the accuracy of the G’ results from the Placebo 2 samples should
occur. However, for accurate representation of the gel-like behavior of a material, both G’
and loss modulus (G’’) has to be studied together. In this case the loss factor evaluates the
gel-like behavior better.

A few things should be taken into consideration about all rheological data. Firstly, the depot
is exposed to a shear force upon injection through the luer lock tip, which can homogenize
the depot and cause structural rearrangements within the material. Secondly, the geometry
also applies some shear to the sample before the measurement begins. The geometry pushes
down on the sample, which has been loaded onto the rheometer, and the applied force on
the sample could also affect the structural composition of the depots by interrupting the
molecular arrangements caused by the conditioning. These two factors could neutralize
some of the effects of the temperature treatments and therefore, the conditioning does not
cause significant structural changes regarding rheology. Concluding, the shear applied on the
sample, before it is analyzed with the rheometer, could counteract the molecular
displacements.

4.4 Discussion linking the results
In this section all the results from the different parts of the study will be discussed. Possible
correlations between the different measurements, or whether the measurements indicate
different results between the studied materials are pondered upon.
The Placebo 1 samples showed in the manual injectability study that the Fridge and RT
samples had the best injectability. Freezer sample had the most unsatisfactory injectability.
The other two conditions, Fridge + 4h RT and 40C where somewhat satisfactory. The IFM
results reinforce these findings for the most part. All samples had a injection force below 20
N, which is considered the limit for a satisfactory injectability. However, the manual
injectability found that the Freezer sample was watery and flowing compared to the other,
which were gel-like. According to the IFM results the 40C sample should be the most flowing
as it required the least force to be injected through a needle. This is contradictory to the
rheological results, which indicate that the 40C sample is more gel-like and “tough” as it has
the lowest loss factor according to the first FS, and highest viscosity and G’. The 40C and
Freezer samples where the only two conditions that showed signs of clogging in the IFM
results but that cannot be seen in the manual injectability results, as the only difficulties in
the manual injectability was small initial bursts or a watery/flowing property of the material.
Similarly to the Placebo 1 samples, the RT and Fridge Placebo 2 samples also showed
satisfactory results and the best manual injectability results. The Fridge (2 F-T) was also
satisfactory and the 40C sample was also satisfactory, some initial burst or clog aside. The
most difficulties were caused by the freezer samples, which had some phase separation that
most likely caused clogs and more liquid-like behavior. Although the manual injectability
study showed issues, the IFM results were excellent with injection forces below 10 N across
all samples. No signs of clogging could be detected from these results. Looking closer at the
IFM results in Figure 16 you can notice some bumps in the freezer samples compared to the
other samples, which have a very smooth injection profile. The rheological measurement
suggests somewhat similar results to the manual injectability results as the freezer samples
have some of the lowest loss factors but also the lowest G’, according to the first FS. This
could be due to the phase separation and aggregates in the material, which causes the
rheological results to show that the freezer samples are the “toughest” and most gel-like
according to the loss factor, as it picks up the aggregates in the material and registers the
material as more gel-like than the others. Although, the material according to the manual

63

Ida Nygård l Åbo Akademi University
Master’s Thesis (Chem. Eng.)
___________________________________________________________________________
injectability is the most flowing and more liquid-like as supposed to gel-like. The RT sample
appears to be the most gel-like and have the strongest viscoelastic properties according to
the rheological results, which is not apparent in the IFM results. It is difficult to conclude from
the manual injectability whether the RT sample was the most gel-like, although it did possess
satisfactory results and had gel-like behavior.
The API-formulation samples were done in two batches and had two different pH levels. This
should be accounted for. Overall, in the manual injectability study of these samples, most
were unable to inject the last 0.1 ml of the sample. Despite this, similarly to Placebo 1 and
Placebo 2, RT and fridge samples possessed satisfactory injectability. The freezer samples,
like before in the Placebo 1 and Placebo 2 samples, were troubled with phase separation,
more liquid-like formulas and initial bursts and clogs. The 40C sample had mixed results with
one of the three replicate samples showing no difficulties, one somewhat satisfactory and
one clogging halfway through the injection and showing signs of phase separation. This could
also be a result of the varied pH levels of the samples. Although the IFM results looked
satisfactory for the first half of the measurements, signs of clogging appeared for all samples
after the midway point. However, the fridge samples were the only samples, despite the
clogs, that had an injection force below 20 N throughout the measurement, which correlates
with the manual injectability results. The IFM results of the RT sample were satisfactory until
the end of the measurement, which is also true for the manual injectability of the samples.
The loss factor from the first FS before shearing also suggest that the RT sample is one of the
most gel-like of the samples.
According to all analysis methods and data, two freezing and thawing cycles of the samples
did not significantly affect the structure and properties of the materials. The IFM results
suggest almost no change in injection force and the manual injectability did not document
any significant differences either between the one-time freezer conditioned and the two
times freezer conditioned samples. The rheological measurements suggest the same,
although, more experiments should be done to verify this.

5 Conclusions
The main objectives with this thesis were to study the effects of temperature treatments on
the injectable silica-based depot material and study the material properties via three
different methods: manual injectability, injection force measurement and rheology. A study
specific rheological profile was also set up for the purpose of studying the material behavior
and ability to recover after being exposed to high amplitudes at constant frequency in the
means of high deformation amplitude sweeps. Three different materials were studied,
referred to as Placebo 1, Placebo 2 and API, i.e., two placebo formulas and one API containing
formula.
The manual injectability of all three materials suggested that the fridge and RT conditioned
samples had the best manual injectability. All the samples manifested satisfactory
injectability some small initial bursts aside. Placebo 1 had the most satisfactory injectability
and the least difficulties upon injection through a needle. The API formulation, however,
caused the most difficulties, as sedimented particles were left in the syringe after injection
for most of the sample. Meaning that the injection of the last 0.1 ml of the sample was
unsuccessful.
Injectability of the materials with the IFM imply that the Placebo 2 material had the most
satisfactory injection, since it required injection forces below 10 N and had the steadiest and
lowest injection forces throughout the measurement. Both Placebo 1 and API had difficulties,
especially with the 40C and freezer samples. The freezer samples, which were determined to
suffer from phase separation in the manual injectability study, appeared to have clogs as a
result from the phase separation. The API formulation also appeared to suffer from clogs of
various magnitude across all samples. Even the fridge and RT samples had signs of clogging
in the IFM results.
The rheological measurements concluded that the Placebo 1 material was shear-thinning,
which is a desired property for the injectable depot material. The rheological profile built for
the study, FS-AS-R-AS-FS, was used to evaluate the rheological properties, gel character and
the recovery abilities of the material. All materials were gel-like, where Placebo 1 was the
“toughest” gel according to the loss factor. The ability of the material to recover was then
studied with the ORO test (AS-R-AS). The last FS of the test registered the recovery of the
material after high deformation. As expected, all materials became weaker after the

65

___________________________________________________________________________
deformation (ORO test), but they were still able to recover its structure to some extent and
preserve their gel character. Only a few samples appeared to struggle more, such as the API
Freezer sample.
Lastly, the consequences of consequent cycles of freezing were studied. The freezer samples
were put one time in the freezer versus two times in the freezer, allowing the two times
cycled samples to defrost between freezing. No significant effects could be seen in the
material structure or behavior between the two conditions. Further testing should be done
for more accurate determination of the effects of multiple freezing-thawing cycles. The G’ of
the Placebo 2 and API formulation also did not comply between each other. However, the
loss factor of the two materials suggested that the material had become a weaker gel upon
further freezing, since the loss factor increased with the two times cycled samples.

6 Svensk Sammanfattning
Biomaterial är material som härstammar från naturligt förekommande resurser.
Användningen av dem inom läkemedelsindustrin har ökat under de senaste decennierna i
och med utvecklingen inom teknologi, ingenjörskunnande och tillverkningen av material.
Forskningen och utvecklingen har ökat exponentiellt allt eftersom de biomedicinska
produkterna har blivit mer kommersiellt tillgängliga. Materialen används inom
läkemedelsindustrin till bland annat vävnadsteknologin (eng. tissue engineering), implantat
och läkemedelsleveranssystem (eng. Drug-delivery systems). Hydrogeler hör till kategorin
biomaterial och är uppbyggda av ett nätverk av hydrofila polymerer. Nätverket kan hålla
rikliga mängder vatten och enligt definitionen minst 10 %. På grund av den höga vattenhalten
är de flexibla och kan jämföras med naturlig vävnad. Hydrogelerna reagerar på vissa externa
stimuli såsom pH, temperatur eller kemiska föreningar. För att utöka och förbättra
användningen av hydrogeler och deras känslighet kan nanopartiklar tilläggas. På detta sätt
kan kontrollerad läkemedelsleverans uppnås. Silica hydrogeler är ett exempel på en nanogel,
alltså gel som innehåller nanopartiklar också kallad hydrogelkomposit.
För att karaktärisera och analysera geler kan reologiska mätningar användas. Reologin, alltså
studiet av flöde och deformationen av materia, är en relevant del av analysprocessen av
många material inom bioteknologin och forskningen om läkemedel. Med hjälp av reologin
kan material utvecklas och tillverkas på det mest optimala sättet och en hög kvalitet på
produkterna försäkras.
Kiseldioxid är en naturligt förekommande mineral och det mest förekommande ämnet i
jordskorpan. Kiseldioxid används inom läkemedelsbranschen för medicinska applikationer
bland annat för dess biokompabilitet, porositet och dess modifierbara yta. Läkemedel, DNA
och aktiva föreningar kan kapslas in i kiseldioxid för att sedan användas som ett
läkemedelsleveranssystem. Speciellt kiseldioxidpartiklar har använts eftersom de har vissa
egenskaper som gör dem stabilare jämfört med t.ex. miceller, liposomer eller polymera
nanopartiklar. Genom att kombinera spraytorkning och sol-gel-tekniken kan aktiva ämnen
kapslas in i kiseldioxidpariklarna. Partiklarna kan ytterligare via en mängd olika kemiska
processer omvandlas till bland annat hydrogeler eller xerogeler. Kiseldioxidhydrogeler (eng.
silica hydrogel) är en av de vanligaste formerna av kiseldioxid som används i biomedicinska
tillämpningar. De är ett tredimensionellt nätverk som består av aggregerande eller
tvärbundna kolloidala kiseldioxidpariklar som bildar en gel som utgörs av huvudsakligen

vatten, därav namnet hydrogel. Hydrogeler som används aktivt inom biomedicin, t.ex. till
läkemedelsleverans, eftersom den porösa strukturen kan kapslas med aktiva substanser och
läkemedel. Dessutom kan hydrogeler anpassas och deformeras till många olika ytor pga. av
deras formbarhet, och även den kemiska stabiliteten kan kontrolleras.

kiseldioxidhydrogel transporteras globalt kan de utsättas för olika temperaturer. Generellt
förvaras materialen i kylskåp, vilket antas vara ett optimalt tillstånd för dem. Eftersom
information om materialets beteende i varierande temperaturer saknas gjordes detta
diplomarbete för att ta reda på hur materialet regerade på olika temperaturer. Dessutom
undersöktes det materialets förmåga att återhämta sig efter att det utsatts för hög skjuvning.
Materialets struktur, beteende samt kvalitativa beteende bestämdes med tre olika
analysmetoder: reologi, manuell injicering med en spruta samt genom mätning av
injektionskraften. En reometer användes för att mäta de reologiska egenskaperna. Ett
specifikt program hade byggts upp för detta arbete och kallades för FS-ORO-FS. Programmet
började med ett vanligt frekvenssvep för att mäta materialets gelegenskaper. Det följdes av
ett ORO-program (oscillation-rotation-oscillation). I detta fall stod ”O” för ett amplitudsvep.
Dess uppgift var att skjuva provet för att sedan kunna undersöka materialets
återhämtningsförmåga. Till sist gjordes ett likadant frekvenssvep som i början för att evaluera
materialet efter skjuvningen.
Tre olika material tillverkades och analyserades, Placebo 1, Placebo 2 och API. Två
placeboformuleringar och en formulering som innehöll ett aktivt ämne. Förhållandena som
proverna förvarades i var rumstemperatur, kylskåp, frys samt en värmekammare (40°C).
Dessutom undersöktes om upprepade frysningar hade en inverkan på materialen. Alltså
sattes en del prover i kylskåp och frys i två omgångar med förvaring/upptining i
rumstemperatur däremellan.
Den kunde konstateras av analyserna att rumstemperatur samt kylskåpsförvaring var de
mest optimala förvaringsförhållandena, som väntat. De frysbehandlade proverna uppvisade
minst tillfredsställande resultat, oavsett material. Dessa prover var minst gel-liknande och på
gränsen till flytande. Dessutom hade materialet aggregerat vilket syntes som tilltäppningar
vid injicering genom nål samt visuellt. Materialet var fasseparerat.
Placebo 2-materialet hade de mest tillfredsställande resultaten gällande injektionskraften,
vilket kunde förklaras med att dess pH var lägre än Placebo 1, vilket i sin tur ledde till att

68

Ida Nygård l Åbo Akademi University
Master’s Thesis (Chem. Eng.)
___________________________________________________________________________
Placebo 2 var mer flytande. API-materialet uppvisade en del problem i den manuella
injektionen eftersom de flesta prover misslyckades med att injicera hela provet.
Upprepad frysning verkade inte ha någon signifikant effekt på strukturen eller egenskaperna
på materialen, varken på den manuella injiceringen, injektionskraften eller reologin. Dock
borde fler försök och utvidgade experiment göras för att säkerställa dessa data.
