ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
When stepping into the working life after my bachelor studies, I had in the back of my
mind that I will apply for a master’s studies once I find a degree that complements well
my professional area. Finally, in 2018, I found the Master’s program in Governance of
Digitalization, and I felt that GoD was a good match for me. I did not regret my decision
even when I felt tired traveling between Helsinki and Turku, sometimes over three times
a week. Somehow, I motivated myself to push through the stressful periods. All in all, I
can say that during these three years I have learned new skills, networked with people,
and opened my mind to lifelong learning.
I want to thank my supervisors at Åbo Akademi and the case company for guiding me
through the thesis process, and above all, I am grateful to the case company for the
opportunity to examine the topic within the organization. The journey was educational
and helped me to grow professionally and academically. Finally, I want to express how
grateful I am for my family and friends being there for me when my free time was limited,
and I had little time for them because of studying and working at the same time. Your
support has been priceless.

Title: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container
Scenario - Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology
Supervisor: Shahrokh Nikou

Supervisor: Gunilla Widén

Abstract:
This thesis examines how to apply business process management (BPM) practices to drive
effective process optimization. Through BPM framework and tools used in Lean methodology,
the aim is to analyze critically what are the development needs of the feedstock supply
multimodal container process and how to align them with organizational strategic objectives.
Supply chain management is an essential component of a company’s journey to build sustainable
competitive capabilities. In order to achieve these capabilities, such as quality, flexibility, and
decreased costs, scholars have recognized that BPM plays an important role. Various studies have
found a positive correlation between business success and continuous process improvement.
Moreover, some state that only integrated and coordinated business processes can create value
throughout the supply chain. Thus, the theoretical foundation of this thesis lies in the areas of
SCM, BPM, and how digital technologies and increasing communication beyond organizational
boundaries can create value for the organization.
The methodology used to conduct the thesis is qualitative and research data was collected from
interviews and workshops. The qualitative method is mixed with quantitative data retrieved from
the case company’s internal reports. In addition, the thesis uses an integrated BPM framework
and Lean methodology to examine research questions holistically.
The findings of the thesis show that the integrated BPM framework can support an organization
in identifying the organizational components to drive the change and key resources needed for
the work. In addition, it can reveal a lack in some areas of the BPM framework that can cause a
pitfall when implementing changes and improvements to the process. However, the integrated
BPM framework does not define specific tools to identify and analyze the process. Meaning that
the framework needs to be complemented with other more concrete analyzing tools. Finally, the
thesis provides a comprehensive understanding of the container process and the surrounding
business environment, which works as the base for the process improvement proposal and
suggested development roadmap.

INTRODUCTION

Supply chain management (SCM) plays an essential role when companies aim for
building competitive capabilities, such as quality, delivery, flexibility, and decrease costs
(Oke et al., 2016). SCM is defined as a movement of critical resources of a company,
such as material, information, and money, and it includes planning, procurement,
production, sales, distribution, and logistics processes (Farahani et al., 2015, p. 21;
Plenert, 2007). This thesis focuses on examining the feedstock supply process under SCM
flow that is handled by container transportation. Therefore, it is important to address how
and why container-based trade has become a crucial part of the global supply chain
(Fransoo & Lee, 2013, p. 253). It has been estimated that container-based trade has
increased to be equivalent to two-thirds of the world trade by value (Neise, 2018, p. 16).
Container logistics comprises several parties, which can make the operations and
interaction between parties challenging (Fransoo & Lee, 2013, p. 253). Therefore, the
literature has stated that achieving a performance level that creates value container
transportation requires a well-designed operational network and technology selection to
support efficient container management (Neise, 2018, p. 27).
Numerous studies have been written about business process management (BPM) over the
years and it has been recognized that BPM plays a critical role in creating sustainable
competitive advantage (Giacosa et al., 2018, p. 1147; Payyazhi & Sikdar, 2014, p. 971).
Some studies have also noted a positive correlation between continuous process
management and business success (e.g., Payyazhi & Sikdar, 2014, p. 971). Reijers (2021)
notes in his study how only integrated and coordinated business processes can support
the creation of products and services to meet the needs of their customers. Therefore, to
deliver value to the customer, BPM requires integration and coordination of crossfunctional process phases, and not just focusing on a separate set of value-adding
processes (Payyazhi & Sikdar, 2014, p. 972). Other factors that the studies have found to
be the key elements of successful BPM are top management support, project champions,
communication, and cross-organizational cooperation. This is because the new business
process or process modification creates a change in the organization’s workflows, tasks,
structure, and relationships (Payyazhi & Sikdar, 2014, p. 972). Moreover, successful
1

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

BPM drives the development of the vision of the process and provides concepts, methods,
techniques, and tools for each phase of the process lifecycle (Payyazhi & Sikdar, 2014,
p. 972; Schönreiter, 2018, p. 332). The process lifecycle includes process discovery,
analysis, redesign, implementation, and monitoring and controlling (Schönreiter, 2018,
p. 332).
Lean is a methodology, which aims to eliminate waste in the processes (Carlborg et al.,
2013; Chiarini et al., 2018; Davis et al., 2020, p. 306; Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 7). How
Lean is seen today is a way of thinking and behaving and it follows key concepts such as
improving customer value, continual improvement in small steps, decreasing peaks and
throughs in production, reducing waste, involving everybody, developing people, and
focusing on the long-term goals (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 10). Thus, it drives the same
objectives as BPM, but with more concrete tools and techniques. Today, Lean is used in,
besides manufacturing, the sectors such as healthcare, process industries, small and
medium enterprises, aerospace, product development, and IT (Chiarini et al., 2018; Jain
et al., 2020). Therefore, can be stated that it is possible to implement Lean principles
much wider spectrum than it was originally designed for, and many organizations have
adopted Lean tools and techniques to explore ways of using time, money, talent, and
materials more efficiently in the organization (Chiarini et al., 2018; Jain et al., 2020;
Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 9). Through the BPM framework and the tools used in Lean
methodology, this thesis aims to analyze critically what the development needs of the
feedstock supply multimodal container process are, and how to align them with
organizational strategic objectives. Supply to pay process refers to a feedstock purchasing
process where raw material is obtained from the supplier to production purposes, and
multimodal-container process means logistical chain where two or more modes of
transportations are linked to the same container delivery. In addition, the aim is to analyze
how to strive more efficient process by applying digital technologies and increasing
communication beyond organizational boundaries.
Information and communication systems have changed the shipping industry similarly to
other industries, and new technologies have been taken into use (Neise, 2018, p. 78).
However, there are separate initiatives strived by the different actors in the container
2

chain, which do not always result in a coherent way of managing operational data and do
not support the information exchange between different actors (Neise, 2018, p.79). Thus,
more integrated ways of developing this landscape would be needed. Similarly, under the
BPM and SCM domain the scholars have discussed how information technology and new
innovations can support business process optimization (Giacosa et al., 2018; Liotine &
Pagano, 2020, p. 184.) Therefore, the ability to adapt new technology by the companies
has been a central dimension of the BPM journey, especially, the ability to integrate
internal and external processes into one flow (Giacosa et al., 2018). Additionally, from
the strategic perspective, technological development has risen to be one of the top
priorities of the management as today technology is seen as an enabler for growth and
more efficient processes (Liotine & Pagano, 2020, p. 188; Starita, 2021).

1.1

Company Introduction

This thesis uses a company to address the gaps in the literature specified above. The
organization is a European company working in an energy sector focusing on renewable
and circular economy solutions for road, sea, and air transportation. The core of the
business is to offer sustainable solutions to consumers and companies so that they can cut
down carbon emissions. The company is operating globally, and production is centralized
to three countries in Central Europe, Asia, and Nordics (Case company, 2021).

1.2

Objective and Aim

Container transport has stabilized its role as an integral part of the case company’s
feedstock supply to pay process and needs to be optimized together with other logistics
processes to support future growth. To sustain the objectives of the case company, this
thesis intends to align the targets of two ongoing projects together with operational needs
so that the development roadmap and ideal process flow can be structured for the
container process. To achieve the objectives, this thesis aims to answer the research
questions listed below. Through these key questions, the study suggests solutions to the
challenges explained in the chapter 2.1.3. The research questions are answered by

3

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

examining the case company data, interviewing people relevant to the process, and by
participating in project workshops.
The main research question is as follows:
-

Q1: Can ideal process design be achieved by utilizing BPM framework together
with Lean methodology?

Additionally, three supporting research questions are formed to answer the main question:
-

RQ1: What are the main development needs of the feedstock supply container
process to drive digitalization and operational excellence?

-

RQ2: What is the optimal application integration architecture to support container
logistics growth?

-

RQ3: How to align diverse targets of the internal projects to achieve a
standardized model for container process management?

Methodology used to conduct the thesis is qualitative and research data is collected from
interviews and workshops. The qualitative method is mixed with quantitative data
collected from the case company’s internal reports. The findings of the thesis, in the form
of a theoretical framework, are providing a comprehensive understanding of the container
process and surrounding business environment, which are the base for the process
improvement proposals and development roadmap.

1.3

Expected Results and Contribution

The main objective of this thesis is to align the goals of two internal projects and deliver
a clear roadmap of how the container process could be managed and developed in the
company’s application landscape by respecting the organization’s standardized models.
The scope of this thesis is limited only to the container process under the supply to pay
level one process.
Development projects for logistics and supply are both focusing on the bulk and non-bulk
processes containing vessels, trucks, barges, containers, and rail cars and thus due to the
4

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

size of the study, it was needed to delimit the scope just to one means of transportation
and its process under a logistic umbrella. Containers are only managed in the supply
context and therefore sales process is naturally excluded. However, the results of this
thesis are partly applicable and reusable for the other processes under supply to pay.
Moreover, depending on the trade terms, containers can be managed by the supplier or
the case company. This thesis' focus is on the containers managed by the case company.
Meaning that case company operations are selecting and booking the container carriers
and bearing the costs.
Additionally, roles and responsibilities are not part of this thesis meaning that different
teams taking part in the process are not examined in this context and are covered only for
demonstrating the role in charge. In other words, the detailed level definition of who
should be in responsible for specific process steps is left out from this study.

1.4

Structure of the Thesis

This paragraph is describing shortly how the thesis is structured and what are the main
sections and chapters. The first chapter of the thesis is providing a comprehensive
introduction to the topic under study. The second chapter explains thoroughly the
background and why the study was conducted. The third chapter of the paper will focus
on explaining in detail the theoretical framework of the topic and providing a
comprehensive understanding of the factors of the container supply process. The fourth
chapter is explaining which research methodology is used to conduct the study and why
it was chosen. The fifth chapter is presenting the results of the study and comprehensive
analysis in comparison with the theoretical framework. In the sixth chapter, the paper
focuses on reflecting the results and theoretical framework to the research questions
presented in chapter 1.3 and evaluating the overall research process. In the seventh and
final chapter conclusion is presented.

BACKGROUND

The case study company started a few years ago very extensive IT project where the aim
was to update the majority of the legacy system to web-based solutions and implement
new ERP system (Case Company, 2021). One of the development items that emerged
from the project during 2019 was multimodal container process automatization and
process development (Case Company, 2021). In detail, this meant moving from the bulk
delivery model to track each individual container and automating transaction data that
operations manually input to the systems (Case Company, 2021). The aim of this was to
build a capability to manage growing feedstock supply volumes in a more automated
manner without increasing headcount (Case Company, 2021). The improvements were
implemented to two locations in Europe and Asia was still left out of the scope (Case
Company, 2021).
System wise, recording each individual container means more transactions and data.
Therefore, the optimal way to achieve a more efficient end-to-end process (E2E) was seen
by developing a platform where containers are easily managed internally and by
integrating with third (3rd) parties, terminals, and logistics partners, via portals (Case
Company, 2021). The multimodal container process development focused mostly on the
logistics’ applications and therefore systems and processes related to e.g. contracts and
payments were moderately affected by the implemented changes (Case Company, 2021).
In more specifically, the scope of the project included the development of the company’s
internal operational process and applications where transactions are managed and
monitored (Case Company, 2021). Container’s sea and land logistics process was not in
the scope because that is handled by third parties (3rd) who are contracted by the case
study company or its subcontractors. However, they do contribute to the process by
sending input data via portals, email, or integration.
2.1.1

Current state

After the successful implementation of the Multimodal Container Process (MCP) in
October 2020, it has been operationally functioning for approximately one year. MCP has
not been yet implemented in any other location, thus there are two parallel internal
6

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

container processes in production. One in Europe and one in Asia. The As-Is application
landscape is the same but those are managed differently in these two process variations.
This is explained in more detail in section 2.2.
2.1.2

Ongoing Projects

Case company’s business has changed tremendously during the years and one of the core
business segments has created increasingly diverse and complex logistics needs to
support the growth of the feedstock supply sustainably (Case Company, 2021). As a
result of the growth, case company is exposed to new challenges such as complex global
transportation and terminal network requiring route optimization, different sizes of
parcels needing diverse modes of transport such as truck, rail, containers, and vessels,
and finally operations in several countries without having a unified way of working
(Case Company, 2021). Logistics is seen as an integral part of feedstock supply and
product sales to its customers, and with the potential to create a competitive advantage
to the business (Case Company, 2021). In order to manage these challenges, logistics
transformation was seen necessary, and program LEX was launched in 2021 to create
the standardized way of managing various operational needs, find the best-of-breed
technology to support the change sustainably, and drive automation to decrease the
manual workload (Case Company, 2021). The target of the LEX program is to
implement a new transportation management system and integrate it into the existing
processes and applications (Case Company, 2021). To achieve this goal, process
modification is needed and development of surrounding applications.
The second project studied in this thesis is called RED, which is a subproject in the LEX
program. Project RED is focusing on improving the current supply to pay process (S2P)
maturity so that it can correspond to the future growth of the business (Case Company,
2021). This is done by redesigning the ideal end-to-end (E2E) process with the aim of
reducing the overall process lead-time (Case Company, 2021). Achieving the targets
requires both process and system development. The reasons the project was seen
necessary are tightening competition of feedstock, a rapid growth of non-bulk deliveries
(truck, rail, and containers) that increases the number of invoices to be handled,
challenges to pay invoices in time, and risk of headcount growth due to manual process
7

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

steps (Case Company, 2021). The project aims to improve feedstock suppliers
experience with the case company by offering easy tools and ways of working with them,
decreasing the payment time to suppliers to win the competition of feedstock,
minimizing growth and cost of the internal headcount via automation, and finally
simplifying and improving the maturity of the process (Case Company, 2021).

In order to develop the container process to its optimal state, it needs to be aligned with
the targets and application landscape of these two projects. By examining the overall
S2P process, As-Is, and To-Be application overview and the needs of the operations, a
development roadmap can be established for the container process so that the process
will support the growth goals of the Case Company in standardized ways.
2.1.3

Current Challenges

One of the main challenges addressed in Figure 1 for container process logistics is that
there are no tools for container booking. This is done by the supplier and thus limits the
way of managing the visibility and costs of the logistics. There is no existing organization
with sufficient skills to execute planning and booking. Additionally, case company is
lacking transportation management tools to support these actions.

Figure 1. Multimodal Logistics Flow and Its Challenges (Case Company, 2021)
This is the reason why planning and booking of the transportation are outsourced to the
supplier and the discharge terminal. On the terminal operations side, handled by an
8

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

outsourced terminal operator, some challenges are that there is no real-time tank capacity
data available, no tools for quality planning, no process or tools to support container
demurrage, detention and damage claim handling and finally there is no sufficient
automation between case company and the terminal operator to exchange data (Case
Company, 2021).
Another process level challenge is that the container process is not unified in the case
company, but there are two parallel processes used simultaneously (Case Company,
2021). The one in Europe is called the Multimodal Container process, where containers
are tracked individually per each mode of transport, and the other one exists in Asia,
where containers are managed as bulk (Case Company, 2021). Meaning that all
containers under one delivery are handled as one batch and only vessel means of
transport is recorded to the system. Additionally, the E2E process lead time cannot
correspond to the growth of the business and processing the transactions in the internal
systems is not efficient enough to meet the needs of the S2P process (Case Company,
2021).

Figure 2. Ideal Feedstock S2P Process Improvement Targets (Case Company, 2021)
Figure 2 presents the ideal state where the S2P process should be by 2030, and this is only
achieved through extensive automation and process improvement. (Case Company,
2021). Besides the above-mentioned problem statements, the challenge why the study
9

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

needed to be conducted is to understand the optimal container process application
architecture when implementing a new transportation management system (TMS) and
how to adapt it to the S2P process growth needs.

2.2

Container As-Is Process

This section presents the As-Is container processes that are in use in the case company.
The physical container process does not vary much between the regions, but the way the
containers are handled in the systems have many differences between APAC and EMEA
regions. These differences are presented in the following paragraphs.
2.2.1

APAC Container As-Is Process

The container As-Is process is described in the following process flowchart presented in
Figure 3. This process is used in the APAC area.

Figure 3. APAC Container Process Flowchart
Step 1: Contract is created by the supply manager in the Contract management system
(CMS)
Step 2: Contract is interfaced to SAP
Step 3: Pricing team prices the contract if fixed price. Otherwise, CMS sends updated
prices
10

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

Step 4: Contract is reviewed and released by the Commercial Operations (Comm Ops)
Step 5: Comm Ops creates nomination which is a planning document for the delivery
Step 6: Containers are loaded into the container vessel
Step 7: Comm Ops receive notification of the loaded containers and supporting
documents, add information to a google sheet, and create ticketing in SAP for
actualized loading quantity. One ticket is created for the container batch. PO is
created automatically in SAP based on the ticket
Step 8: Supplier fills in a delivery form (DF) on the supplier portal (SP)
Step 9: Back Office (BO) checks received invoice, delivery form and matches PO to the
invoice. After DF and invoice are approved invoice is released for the payment
process. If DF is not approved, it is sent back to the supplier for correction
Step 10: Containers are received by the terminal and 3rd party container discharge
process will take place
Step 11: Terminal sends discharge information to Comm Ops by email. Comm Ops
adds the information to a google sheet and creates one discharge ticket for the whole
container batch in Terminal Inventory System (TIS). Ticket information is
interfaced to SAP automatically
Step 12: Supply Chain Compliance (SCC) reviews DF supply chain data and after
approval allocation data is sent to SAP. In the Allocation portal (AP) SCC allocates
criteria
Step 13: Final step of the process is automatic shipment closing
2.2.2

Multimodal Container As-Is Process

This section describes the Multimodal Container Process (MCP) that is used in EMEA
area. Figure 4 is a flowchart of the As-Is state.

Step 3: Contract is reviewed and released by the Commercial Operations (Comm Ops)
Step 4: Comm Ops creates nomination and sends the reference to the supplier and the
terminal
Step 5: Communication between Commercial Operations and Back Office (BO) teams
regarding service contract information. SAP haulier service and sea freight contracts
are created by the Back Office in SAP
Step 6: Containers are loaded into the container vessel
Step 7: Supplier fills in the Supplier Loading Spreadsheet with container batch
information on Google Drive. Supplier converts the Supplier Loading Spreadsheet
to CSV format and uploads it to SP delivery form
Step 8: Communication between Comm Ops and Back Office regarding SAP
nomination and Supplier Loading Spreadsheet readiness. Commercial Operations
nominates the Inspector to the containers and selects the discharge tank in TIS
Step 9: Back Office converts the Supplier Loading Spreadsheet into CSV format and
uploads it to TIS. Back Office monitors that information is interfaced from TIS into
SAP nomination. SAP ticketing creates purchase orders automatically in SAP. Each
container is ticketed individually

Step 10: Back Office checks received invoice, delivery form, and matches PO to the
invoice. After DF and invoice are approved invoice is released for the payment
process. If DF is not approved, it is sent back to the supplier for correction
Step 11: TIS unloads containers automatically in the system once the container vessel
Estimated date of arrival (ETA) to the container port realizes
Step 12: Carrier picks up the containers and records loaded quantity and time to Haulier
portal (HP). Actualized quantities are sent from the TIS Haulier portal to SAP
nomination together with events (timestamps)
Step 13: The carrier unloads the containers to the terminal premises and records the time
via the Haulier portal. Events are sent from HP to SAP nomination
Step 14: Terminal Workers carry out the discharge process and send discharge
transactions (tickets) to TIS via integration. TIS generates the discharge tickets and
sends those to SAP nomination. Each container is ticketed individually
Step 15: Supply Chain Compliance (SCC) reviews DF supply chain data and, after
approval allocation data is sent to SAP. In the Allocation portal (AP) SCC allocates
criteria
Step 16: Final step of the process is automatic shipment closing

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

In this chapter, the thesis focuses on discussing holistically the theory relevant to the
research area. First, the theory concentrates on BPM theory, which is the essential part of
the framework, and finally we need to understand the implications of technological
components when we are developing processes to meet the needs of a modern digital
business ecosystem.

3.1

Supply Chain Management

Today, the increasing competition is a driver for companies to improve their internal
operational processes as well to integrate their partners such as suppliers, terminals, and
logistics providers tighter to their supply chain network (Oke et al., 2016). The
cooperation with suppliers and other partners in the supply chain network is the enabler
for building competitive capabilities, such as quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost (Oke
et al., 2016). In order to succeed, this requires a well-coordinated flow of materials from
the supplier to the production site, and this can be achieved by integrating external
processes of different parties (Oke et al., 2016). A supply chain can be defined as a
movement of critical resources of the company: materials information and money
(Plenert, 2007). Buyukozkan and Gocer (2018) noted that “supply chains are series of
interconnected activities that involve the coordination, planning and controlling of
products and services between suppliers and customers” (p. 157). Supply chain
management includes planning, procurement of the materials, production, sales,
distribution, and logistics (Farahani et al., 2015, p. 21). The management of these flows
is conducted at strategic, tactical, and operational levels throughout the supply chain
(Farahani et al., 2015, p. 23). Figure 5 illustrates the supply chain cycle from raw material
to the customer and highlights the importance of the logistic process between the flows
of materials and goods.

Figure 5. Supply Chain Cycle
Figure 6 demonstrates the part of the supply chain, which is the focus of this thesis. This
is the process phase, where raw material is supplied for production purposes. The main
parties included in this process are supplier, customer, carriers, and the 3rd party terminal,
where feedstock is stored before transportation to the production site. Due to the growing
feedstock supply volumes and tightening, competition is essential for the case company
to find more efficient ways to manage the supply process. Business process management
actions are not solely to create value for the customer but also the feedstock supplier is
considered as a valuable contributor to the supply chain. In the case company’s field of
the industry, this is heavily emphasized because of tight competition of the feedstock in
the market. Therefore, supply to pay process is one of the core processes to be developed

15

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

to ensure quality in the production, leaner internal processes to decrease operational cost,
to offer high standard products, and to provide outstanding supplier experience.

Figure 6. Feedstock Supply (Case Company, 2021)
Ciccullo et al. (2020), state in their study that for supply chain management (SCM) to be
effective and efficient, organizations should apply more widely digital technologies to
enhance performance. When allowing information sharing beyond organization
boundaries, it can help companies to achieve better alignment with different actors in the
supply chain (Ciccullo et al., 2020, p. 1093). The next section focuses on explaining the
meaning of container logistics as a part of the supply chain.
3.1.1

Container Logistics in the Supply Chain

During the last decade, the expansion of container-based trade has increased from 50
million Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) to 180 million TEUs (Bouchery et al.,
2019, p. 1503). Moreover, nearly all intercontinental transport of goods and materials
takes place by the sea and a great part of it is containerized (Fransoo & Lee, 2013, p. 253).
World shipping council has evaluated that container shipping values over two-thirds of
world trade by value (Neise, 2018, p. 16). Due to the extensive increase in container trade,
various scholars have stated in their study that it has become a crucial part of the global
supply chain (Fransoo & Lee, 2013, p. 253). Approximately 80 percent of the cargo is
transported by sea freight (Neise, 2018, p. 11). Globalized markets and increased trading
between continents have been the driver of the rise in container volumes (Neise, 2018, p.
11). Benefits that containerization offers include standardization, ease of handling,
protection against damage, and security (Bouchery et al., 2019, p. 1504).
16

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

Container logistics involves several parties: shipper, logistics service provider, terminal
operator, ocean liner, and hinterland operators (Fransoo & Lee, 2013, p. 253). Thus, the
interaction between the parties can be occasionally challenging (Fransoo & Lee, 2013, p.
253). Shipper normally contracts a third-party (3rd) logistics service provider who acts as
a wholesaler of ocean vessel capacity (Fransoo & Lee, 2013, p. 254). The 3rd party
logistics service provider concludes a contract with ocean liner companies who handle
the maritime logistics (Fransoo & Lee, 2013, p. 254). The terminal operator is the party
who moves the containers between different modes of transport and between ocean
vessels (Fransoo & Lee, 2013, p. 255). Terminal operators are generally contracted by
the ocean liner company and occasionally the logistics service provider (Fransoo & Lee,
2013, p. 256).

Figure 7. Relationships Between Container Supply Chain Parties (Adapted from Fransoo
& Lee, 2013, p. 260)
Finally, terminal operations deal with the hinterland carrier that is contracted by the
shipper or buyer (Fransoo & Lee, 2013, p. 254). Costs of the transport are split between
the buyer and seller according to the trade agreement negotiated in the supply/sales
contract. Figure 7 illustrates the contractual relationships in the container supply chain.
When there are two lines present, it means that the trade agreement defines which party

17

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

will enter into a contract with the logistics service provider. Trade terms are explained in
more detail in section 3.1.3.
Challenges that are widely mentioned in the literature with container shipments from a
supply chain perspective are coordination issues across the whole container supply chain,
pricing and risk management in the supply chain, the competitive situation between ports,
carriers, and container terminals, and capacity management of the container supply
(Fransoo & Lee, 2013, p. 258).
3.1.2

Multimodal Transportation

Multimodal transportation began in the USA and Europe to support container transfer
between vessels and railcars with an aim of decreasing the loading and unloading time of
cargo, linking water and land networks together, and speeding up the raw material and
finished goods deliveries (Berry & Rondinelli, 2000, p. 400). As such, all four main
modes of transportation air, water, rail, and road were linked together in the container
supply chain (Berry & Rondinelli, 2000, p. 400). Therefore, multimodal transportation
process means interconnected logistics network, which involves several modes of
transportation and is ideally seamlessly interlinked and operated efficiently (Berry &
Rondinelli, 2000, p. 398). According to Machado et al. (2017), multimodal logistic
platforms offer flexibility and generate competitive advantage by interlinking logistic
systems and modes of transportations together. Additionally, Neise (2018), discusses how
multimodal network increases container logistics operational efficiency when
complexities are removed and the simplified process is not slowing down the shipping
process.
To this end, can be stated that interlinked container transportation has led to a revolution
in cargo logistics by connecting the different transportation chains (Neise, 2018, p. 27).
However, to work and to achieve the optimum level of performance, multimodal
transportation requires a well-designed network and technology to support container
management such as operations and tracking (Neise, 2018, p. 26). Technology has also
impacted the shipping business in such a way that obtained technologies such as
blockchain, digital twin, cloud computing and advanced data analytics have pushed it
18

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

rapidly towards a data-centric industry (Neise, 2018, p. 27). Figure 8 illustrates the core
actors in the interconnected container chain flow from the loading port to the final
destination. Container flow is in connection with hinterland logistics handled either by
truck, barge, or train and sea cargo. Inland terminal is not always part of the chain but can
be present in cases where intermediate storage is needed. The main actors in the process
are demonstrated under concepts cargo owner, shipping, service provider, and port.

Figure 8. Container Transportation Chain (Adapted from Neise, 2018, p. 32)
Figure 9 demonstrates an example of a multimodal transportation network: 1) supplier
collects feedstock and delivers the containers to the loading container port by truck 2)
containers are loaded to container vessel at the loading port 3) container vessel arrives at
the discharge port and terminal operator moves the containers to the waiting area 4) land
logistics carrier picks up the containers and delivers those to the final destination. What
is not presented in Figure 9 is the final phase of where the container is returned to the
container terminal by the land logistics carrier. Container transportation chain varies
greatly based on in which geographical location route is situated and what is the
corresponding infrastructure (Neise, 2018, p. 31). However, the maritime business is the
biggest user of containers (Neise, 2018, p. 31).

19

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

Figure 9. Multimodal Container Logistics Network Example
The benefits described by the studies that can be achieved by using multimodal
transportation networks are freight costs reduction by the ability to consolidate cargo and
optimize logistics, increased flexibility in the logistics flow, better delivery lead times,
and better ability to respond to unexpected challenges (Bouchery et al., 2019, p. 1503;
Machado et al., 2017, p. 289). However, successful management of the multimodal
logistic network to be effective requires established connections and partnerships
(Machado et al., 2017, p. 289). Moreover, as the biggest cost of container shipping comes
from inland transportation, from 40 to 80 percent, inland connections from the port should
be carefully designed (Neise, 2018, p. 72).
The downsides of container logistics described by Bouchery et al. (2019) in their paper
involve empty container movements that take place after cargo is unloaded in the final
destination. Once the container is empty, it needs to be repositioned and reloaded again
so that its logistic flow begins again (Bouchery et al., 2019, p. 1505). In case the empty
container is not returned to the container terminal in a timely manner shipping line will
charge detention fees from their contractual partner (Bouchery et al., 2019, p. 1505).
Together with the detention, the shipping line who owns the container can also charge
demurrage fees in case the container has not been picked up in time from the container
terminal (Bouchery et al., 2019, p. 1505). In order to keep the containers in rotation, such
fees are a motivator for the shipping line’s contracting parties to act promptly (Bouchery
et al., 2019, p. 1505). This however requires efficient operating models and an
understanding of lead times of each part of the multimodal transport chain.
3.1.3

ICT in Container Shipping

Information and communication systems have changed the shipping industry similarly to
other industries (Neise, 2018, p. 78). New technologies and systems have been taken into
20

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

use to manage better day-to-day activities (Neise, 2018, p. 78). Despite such
development, many ports are still working based on paper and another issue to address is
that many systems are developed separately by the ports (Neise, 2018, p. 79). Hence
systems might lack integrations with partners, resulting that information flow is
cumbersome between different parties unless you are part of various systems provided by
the ports (Neise, 2018, p. 79). Through their systems, ports intend to facilitate real-time
planning, link the maritime transport with hinterland partners, and receive tracking data
of the vessels (Neise, 2018, p. 79). In day-to-day operations, automation and robotics are
more utilized to lower operational costs by installing for example automated stacking
cranes (Neise, 2018, p. 80). Port community system gathers information about the cargo
and containers under one platform (Neise, 2018, p. 80). This platform acts as a central
hub for external parties to collect relevant information for their operational planning, such
as vessel estimated time of arrival and container movements (Neise, 2018, p. 80).
As well, inland terminals are developing their automation levels so that they can work
more efficiently and improve their competitiveness (Neise, 2018, p. 80). Terminal
operating system (TOS) controls the terminal movements, storage capacities, planning,
and decision making (Neise, 2018, p. 80). TOS is normally a standalone system but can
be integrated with other systems to monitor the flow more efficient manner (Neise, 2018,
p. 80). Although many development areas exist in the container ICT landscape, Liao and
Tseng (2015) discuss in their paper how different parties acting in the container supply
chain have started using technology to assist their communication between the partners
such as electronic document repositories, websites to provide transit times and freight
rates and real-time container tracking service. They also stated that the use of information
technology had a positive effect on shipping companies' costs and performance in the
market (Liao & Tseng, 2015, p. 85).
In this context, the rest of the actors in the chain such as the buyer, seller, and the carriers
should be also considered. It is relevant to emphasize that they all have their internal
operational systems, which are not necessarily integrated. When data is the key to making
more cost-effective decisions, it is essential to have interfaces between the different actors

21

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

in the supply chain. Thus, further development is needed to achieve the state-of-the-art
integration level with different actors.
3.1.4

Incoterms 2020

Incoterms are part of the terms of delivery that are agreed upon during contract
negotiation for the trade (Fransoo & Lee, 2013, p. 254; Logistiikan maailma, 2021)
Incoterms are a set of definitions of international trade customs, and there are eleven
definitions of the custom of trade which are abbreviated to three letters (Fransoo & Lee,
2013, p. 254; Logistiikan maailma, 2021). If buyer and seller decide to use the custom of
trade in the contract, this means that they follow delivery, division of costs, transfer of
risk, and other mutual obligation defined for the selected incoterm (Fransoo & Lee, 2013,
p. 254; Logistiikan maailma, 2021). Solely, the buyer and the seller are parties to the
contract of trade. Other parties as forwarding agents, carriers, and subcontractors, are
contracted either by the seller or buyer with a separate agreement (Fransoo & Lee, 2013,
p. 254; Logistiikan maailma, 2021).
The following Incoterms could be potentially used in the case company’s container
supply process: EXW, FCA, CPT, CIP, DAP, DPU, DDP, FAS, CFR (used with any
mode of transport) FOB, and CIF (used with sea and inland waterway transport)
(Logistiikan maailma, 2021; Neise, 2018, p. 34). Currently, mainly CFR, CIF, CPT, FAS,
FCA, and FOB are in use in the case company and are explained in more details below
(Case Company, 2021). The following figures and definitions of Incoterms 2020 are
retrieved from Logistiikan maailma (2021), which is a Finnish online source of logistic
information widely used by professionals.

Business Process Management

Reijers (2021) describes business process management (BPM) as a management idea
where the essence is to understand and develop an end-to-end (E2E) business process so
that the organization can perform better. In other words, BPM aims to support business
processes by using methods, techniques, and software to enact, control and analyze
organizational processes that involve people, organizations, applications, documents, and
other sources of information (Payyazhi & Sikdar, 2014, p. 973). This means that BPM
tries to understand and manage people, information, and technology dimensions (Reijers,
2021, p. 1). A business process can be defined by naming it as “a collection of activities
that takes one or more kinds of input and creates an output that is of value to the customer”
(Payyazhi & Sikdar, 2014, p. 972). In a conclusion can be said that BPM involves
organizational management, core value-creating processes, and functions such as IT
management. All these together define the operational and organizational structure of a
company (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 331).
There are several business process management frameworks that have been developed by
scholars (Malinova & Mendling, 2018, p. 7). Some of these are more concentrated on the
operational tasks and others are more focused on the strategic side (Malinova &
Mendling, 2018, p. 7). What Malinova and Mendling (2018), proposed in their study is
to utilize a framework that comprises both dimensions, strategy and operations. Thus
28

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

framework presented here includes a various range of elements that are often presented
alone in the BPM frameworks. (Malinova & Mendling, 2018, p. 7) The integrated BPM
framework presented in Figure 17 has three dimensions: contextual factors, BPM
infrastructure, and BPM lifecycle. The Integrated BPM framework is adopting the key
elements of the other frameworks presented in the literature (Malinova & Mendling,
2018, p. 7). The framework is used in this thesis to discover different elements acting in
the process and how these should be taken into consideration when building the
development roadmap for the process.

Figure 18 explains each activity dimension in-depth manner and offers a consolidated
insight into all eleven elements of the framework (Malinova & Mendling, 2018, p. 7).

Figure 18. Integrated BPM Framework Actions (Adapted from Malinova & Mendling,
2018, p. 9)
3.2.1

Business Process Harmonization

Another aspect that was studied by Schönreiter (2018) is process harmonization in the
merger and acquisitions context. Process harmonization or standardization concept means
“unification of business processes and the underlying actions with an organization”
(Schönreiter, 2018, p. 340). The main focus of process harmonization is the common
processes used globally (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 340). Meaning that the same value-creating
process should be harmonized across organizations (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 340). Some of
the negatively affecting factors of process harmonization are cultural differences,
conflicting interests of key players, and different operational processes (Schönreiter,
2018, p.340). In practice, process harmonization means standardization of business
processes and the ability to control and monitor such processes in several units and
locations (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 340).
30

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

Reasoning to drive standardized processes lies in the cost and performance targets and
decreased risk of process failures (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 332). Additionally, what
harmonization pushes forward in the organization are unified IT systems, standard
interfaces, advanced communication practices, easier knowledge sharing, performance
monitoring such as common key performance indicators (KPIs), and the ability to
outsource process capabilities more easily (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 332). When integrated
processes are used within a company, business units can share expenses and attain
economies of scale via common business process management and achieve cost
reductions (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 332). Quality improvements can be materialized through
decreased development expenses and lower administration effort in processes
(Schönreiter, 2018, p. 332). However, to sustain process latitude and flexibility,
standardization should not be taken too far (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 333). In case such
abilities would be lost in with the process, risk may be that all business requirements
cannot be met and competitive advantage is lost (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 333). Thus, correct
balance between standardization and process variation should be found (Schönreiter,
2018, p. 333).
3.2.2

BPM and Technological Layer

Giacosa et al. (2018), discuss in their study how IT-based tools and new technological
innovation can lead to business process optimization when adding these elements to the
organizational processes. In general, technological innovations strive to mold existing
business processes or create completely new ones (Giacosa et al., 2018, p. 1155). When
an organization is adopting new IT and business intelligence solutions such as cloud
computing, mobile, big data, and analytics, just to name a few, it can achieve better
efficiency and effectiveness in its business processes (Giacosa et al., 2018, p. 1155).
Therefore, technology adaptation is considered an important dimension in an
organization’s BPM journey (Giacosa et al., 2018, p. 1155). The factor that is heavily
highlighted when discussing the technological dimension in relation to effective BPM is
its ability to integrate internal and external processes into one flow. In addition, how value
chain can be enhanced by enabling innovation, and redesigning internal and external
processes (Giacosa et al., 2018, p. 1156). Smartly adapted IT tools are the enablers of
31

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

such development path due to their ability to map diverse business processes to manage
and create useful information for the decision-making process (Giacosa et al., 2018, p.
1157). However, when redesigning business processes, capability such as IT cannot be
overemphasized as effective BPM requires an understanding of the whole business
process and how that fits into the organizational IT system landscape (Payyazhi & Sikdar,
2014, p. 972).
3.2.3

Business Process Modeling and Implementation

Several business process modeling techniques have been developed to support process
mapping, analysis, and design (Payyazhi & Sikdar, 2014, p. 974). BPM is linked closely
to concepts such as quality management and management systems, and it is based on
frameworks like total quality management (TQM), business process re-engineering
(BPR), Lean, and Six Sigma (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 332). Therefore, similar tools and
techniques are discussed when any of the previous disciplines are examined more closely.
Problem-solving is supported with techniques like fishbone and Pareto diagram, for
process mapping generally used techniques are process flowchart, role activity diagram
and data flow diagram, process measurement can be done by using activity-based costing
method and statistical process control and process prototyping by using e.g. colored petri
nets (Payyazhi & Sikdar, 2014, p. 974). These previously mentioned tools and techniques
are just a few examples of existing possibilities, and section 3.2.1 is explained the Lean
methodology and the techniques relevant to this thesis.
In the business process implementation phase, the methodologies that have been proposed
in the literature are emphasizing strategy and goal setting, feasibility analysis, process
analysis, understanding of customer requirements, performance measurement, designing
improvements, prototyping, process mapping, and organizational change management
(Payyazhi & Sikdar, 2014, p. 973). The scholars have found that in order to successfully
implement business processes linkage between the business process and business strategy
needs to exist (Payyazhi & Sikdar, 2014, p. 973). Together with this, alignment is required
within relevant organizational elements acting in the process as there is always a business
unit or team that needs to adopt new ways of working (Payyazhi & Sikdar, 2014, p. 975).
The alignment process can be addressed as one of the main functions of organizational
32

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

change management (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 334). Change management can be described
as a “structured approach to transitioning individuals, teams, and organizations from a
current state to a desired future state” (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 334).
3.2.4

Lean Methodology

Lean is a method that aims to eliminate waste in the processes, and its origins lie in the
1930s Japan, where Taiichi Ohno from Toyota introduced Toyota production systems
(TPS) (Carlborg et al., 2013; Chiarini et al., 2018; Davis et al., 2020, p. 306; Janssen &
Loader, 2019, p. 7). TPS changed the focus from individual workers and machines to the
flow of the end-to-end process (Carlborg et al., 2013; Chiarini et al., 2018; Davis et al.,
2020, p. 306; Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 7). How Lean is seen today is a way of thinking
and behaving and it follows key concepts such as improving customer value, continual
improvement in small steps, decreasing peaks and throughs in production, reducing
waste, involving everybody, developing people, and focusing on the long-term goals
(Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 10). The reasons to drive towards Lean organization are the
ability to focus on customer value by adding more value to their products and services
while reducing waste and being more adaptable and agile (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p.
10). Another reason is that when continuously improving processes can offer greater
strategic value by improving the quality and faster delivery (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p.
10). This requires a heavy involvement of motivated people (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p.
10). This thesis utilizes some of the Lean principles and tools to identify waste in the
process and to suggest improvement actions.
Six Sigma is often correlated with Lean. However, what Janssen and Loader (2019) state
in their publication is that Six Sigma is a disciplined, data-driven approach that aims to
eliminate variation in the process and increase performance. Whereas Lean focuses on
establishing a flow of value by taking into consideration the behavior and attitude of the
people involved (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 10). Although, it is reasonable to point out
that Six Sigma and Lean do overlap and share some of the same tools and techniques
(Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 10). In addition, the idea of Lean is to empower the whole
organization and manage information so that it will not be possessed by one individual in
the team but rather shared as widely as possible, and together with this Lean ideology
33

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

embraces learning from mistakes (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 11). Meaning that mistakes
are seen more as a learning experience than just solely a negative and avoidable with all
costs situation (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 11).
Lean Principles
The key principles of Lean are defined as customer value, value stream, flow, pull, and
perfection. These are demonstrated in Figure 19. Customer value represents the
requirements of the customer and the ability to serve these needs defines the whole value
of the product or service. Value stream means the end-to-end process that is needed to
create the customer value, and it includes all tasks, information, work or material flows
to produce the product or service. Flow is an essential component for the value stream to
deliver value. Meaning that activities need to follow each other seamlessly without
interruptions. Pull means the trigger point when the value is needed, and this can be
triggered by the customer. In the ideal state, nothing is produced unless the next process
requires it.

Figure 19. The Key Principles of Lean (Adapted from Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 15)
34

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

Lean strives for perfection and the essence of perfection is to do things right the first time,
continuously improve, and be transparent (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 15). When the
delivery does not meet the expectations transparent process reveals the issues and error
reduction can be achieved by learning from mistakes (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 16).
Holt (2019) describes standardization as the cornerstone of Lean as it can reduce the waste
when repeatable work sequences, paced with customer demand, flow without
interruptions, and by using pull system are defined. Standardization is the stage where the
most effective way of accomplishing tasks is defined. (Bell & Michael, 2011, p. 42) When
a process step is done in different ways, it creates variation in time, quality, and cost (Bell
& Michael, 2011, p. 42). However, standardized work is not static but is measured
constantly, and based on that the improvements are developed, tested, approved, and
implemented (Bell & Michael, 2011, p. 42).
One of the key philosophies of Lean is continual improvement and the Deming’s cycle
embodies the continuous improvement process (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 9). The cycle
aims to create a feedback loop for the decision-makers so that the improvement areas are
identified and implemented as Lean IT Association describes Deming’s cycle core flow
as follows (Loader & Janssen, 2019, p. 9):





PLAN: design or revise business process components to improve results
DO: implement the plan and measure its performance
CHECK: assess the measurements and report the results to decision makers
ACT: decide on changes needed to improve the process

In the context of continual improvement Kaizen philosophy, kai (change) zen (good) or
change for better, is often mentioned (Chiarini et al., 2018). It is seen as a way to improve
business operations continuously and to drive innovation and knowledge (Chiarini et al.,
2018; Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 21). Kaizen is a methodology that is used for systematic
continuous improvement and is a central part of Lean (Bell & Michael, 2011, p. 40).
System Kaizen intends to improve the overall value stream by focusing on improving the
material and information flow, and process Kaizen focuses on specific areas within the
value stream (Bell & Michael, 2011, p. 41). Can be stated that process Kaizen is all about
everyday improvement, by everyone and everywhere.
35

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

In order to deliver a product or service, a set of activities are needed, and these activities
formulate a process. The tools used for scoping a process with detailed data are Supplier,
Input, Process, Output and Customer SIPOC and Value Stream Mapping (VSM) (Janssen
& Loader, 2019, p. 30). Performance of the process is measured by using key performance
indicators (KPIs) that are defined for each process separately (Janssen & Loader, 2019,
p. 30).
Lean Tools
Lean offers a wide set of tools for problem-solving (Bell & Michael, 2011, p. 36), which
can be used to structure and identify tasks, analyze problems, understand the root causes,
develop solutions to problems, implement improvements, and measure results.
A3: refers to the international paper size which is used in this method to summarize the
problem statement, background, current state, target state, implementation plan,
countermeasures, and evaluation of the results (Bell & Michael, 2011, p. 37; Janssen &
Loader, 2019, p. 67).
Fishbone/ Ishikawa diagram: the diagram can be used to understand causes of specific
events grouped into head categories, and to identify variations in the process (Janssen &
Loader, 2019, p. 67).
DMAIC: problem-solving has five stages define, measure, analyze, improve and control.
These stages are also called DMAIC, and it originates from Six Sigma. The DMAIC has
been proven to be an efficient method for investigating and solving problems. Thus, it
can be used to improve the delivery of value to the customer and business performance
(Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 21).
SIPOC: by using SIPOC the scope of the value stream can be defined which we aim to
develop. SIPOC is a tool to describe in detailed level the different actors in the process
and their key deliverables (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 30).

36

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

Solution matrix: is a visual method to demonstrate which solution should be taken
forward based on the highest priority. The solution matrix is used in the improvement
phase (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 30).
VSM: value stream map is a detailed diagram of the current process flow where key data
is showed, and the waste can be identified. The goal of VSM is to visualize the process
and based on that analysis can be conducted. VSM is built based on SIPOC but at a
detailed and more specific level (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 30). The value from value
stream mapping is to understand the current state, future state, and work plan how to get
there (Holt, 2019, p. 140).
5Why’s: a technique to ask repetitive questions with an aim of understanding cause-andeffect relationships in a root cause analysis (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 67).

3.3

Digitalization and Process Automation

Technology in supply chain optimization is acting an essential role and thus can offer
significant support in the development of material flows from the supplier to the
production, inventory management, production process optimization, and end customer
order management (Liotine & Pagano, 2020, p. 183). This is the driver in building digital
roadmaps for the companies in almost every process area from master data management
to delivering the order to the end customers. Maturity level is just varying according to
the company’s priorities and where the digital transformation is creating the most value
for the business. Moreover, a study done by Gartner reveals a general trend that Chief
Executive Officers’ (CEO) top priorities for years 2021 and 2022 are growth and
technology-related initiatives (Starita, 2021). Figure 20 illustrates the eleven most
important focus areas for 2021 and the upcoming year 2022. Growth is naturally on the
top of the list, although it is having a decline in importance. Technology is coming second

37

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

on the priority list, indicating that digital transformation is one of the core investment
areas in most companies.

Figure 20. CEOs' Top Business Priorities 2021-2022 (Adapted from Starita, 2021)
According to Ciccullo et al. (2020), process digitalization means heavy adoption of digital
tools to the operational processes managing information and material flows. The main
technology trends recognized in the year 2018 for SCM were: advanced analytics,
artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, cloud computing, conversational systems, and
social tool, the internet of things (IoT), mobile, mobility, 3D printing, and robotics
(Buyukozkan & Gocer, 2018, p. 1 57; Denner et al., 2018, p. 2; Ciccullo et al., 2021, p.
1093; Liotine & Pagano, 2020, p. 183; Panetta, 2019).


Advanced analytics supports the organization of managing and analyzing a great
amount of data to make better decisions throughout the supply chain (Denner et al.,
2018, p. 2). It has a great potential to reduce the full-time working time (FTE = fulltime equivalent) in functional areas such as supply chain planning, sourcing, and
logistics planning (Liotine & Pagano, 2020, p. 186).



AI’s potential in SCM lies in its possibilities to automate decision-making and
reinvent business models. However, today AI solutions are still mainly able to predict
38

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

future scenarios and are lacking the decision-making capabilities (Denner et al., 2018,
p. 3).


Cloud computing is an infrastructure that allows companies and individuals to access
the organization's data and applications on-demand basis globally without borders
(Denner et al., 2018, p. 3).



Use cases for IoT in SCM can be found in sourcing, manufacturing, logistics, and
demand management such as real-time vehicle location tracking via global position
system (GPS) and using radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to automatically
receive incoming cargo. (He et al., 2021, p. 4250; Liotine & Pagano, 2020, p. 183)



Mobile technologies are offering a wide set of applications that enable new ways to
communicate and share information on the go and mobility is comprising concepts
like self-driving trucks and vessels and drones delivering orders (Buyukozkan &
Gocer, 2018, p. 156; Denner et al., 2018, p. 4; Panetta, 2019; Ciccullo et al., 2021, p.
1099).



Social media and communication tools are providing a platform for businesses to
communicate 24/7 with the customers by using virtual personal assistants and
chatbots and by offering various channels of communication (Liotine & Pagano,
2020, p. 185; Ciccullo et al., 2020, p. 1094).



3D/4D printing is offering a revolutionary technology to print parts on-site,
potentially lower manufacturing costs, and create simpler supply chains (Al-Maadeed
et al., 2019).



By utilizing intelligent things such as robotics in SCM, there is a possibility to assist,
replace or relocate human workers to more value-adding functions (Liotine & Pagano,
2020, p. 188).

The following Figure 21 demonstrates how many of the above-mentioned technologies
were on the emerging technologies hype cycle in the year 2018 and are now coming closer
to the point of achieving their plateau stage (Panetta, 2019).

39

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

Figure 21. Gartner’s Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2018 (Panetta, 2019)
This means that many of these technologies are maturing and are available at lower costs
(Starita, 2021). From the discussed technologies sensors, cloud computing, data
warehouse, and integrations are considered being maturing technologies (Liotine &
Pagano, 2020, p. 184). Mobility, wearability, data analytics, and social media are
categorized as growth technologies. 4D printing, drones, and autonomous vehicles are
considered as emerging technologies with lower adoption rates, and blockchain, IoT,
virtual reality (VR), and machine learning are seen as the exponential technologies that
just have started to find their way into the business use in supply chain management
(Liotine & Pagano, 2020, p. 185).
According to Hippold (2021), supply chain technology trends for 2020 are very similar
to 2018 such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the internet of things. Only
concepts around these technologies have changed and evolved such as hyperautomation
where the idea is to mix and match legacy platforms with recently deployed applications
and services in the best possible way. Denner et al. (2018), discuss in their study, how the
key to elevating and reforming efficiently business processes, products, and services, is
40

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

to select the most suitable selection of tools from the technology portfolio based on
organizational needs.

Figure 22. Technologies that will drive the most change (Adapted from Starita, 2021)
Across different industries technologies that are believed to bring the most significant
impact on their business during the next three years from the CEO’s perspective are
demonstrated in Figure 22. The importance of this list lies in the fact that CEOs define
the investment priorities and implement them into the company strategy. Thus,
development across processes can strive towards a digital operating model (Payyazhi &
Sikdar, 2014, p. 973). Artificial intelligence arises in this list together with digitalization,
which supports the statement that 90 percent of companies across industries anticipate
digital technologies and digitalization to have an impact on their business (Bendig et al.,
2021).
3.3.1

Digital Operating Model

The digital operating model (DOM) is a concept that is discussed widely by consulting
firms (Bose & Gupta, 2019, p. 2; Detzler et al., 2020). It is a term to describe the transition
from incomplete, fragmented and siloed data to one centralized data model connecting all
key functions (Bose & Gupta, p. 3, 2019, Detzler et al., 2020). Knowledge is not anymore
inside one function or team, but the data is harmonized and cleansed to be used across an
organization (Bose & Gupta, 2019, p. 5; Detzler et al., 2020;). Thus, decisions are not
41

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

based on spreadsheets or scattered data, but the decision-making is driven by holistic data
retrieved from a centralized location (Bose & Gupta, 2019, p. 6; Detzler et al., 2020).
DOM aims to minimize custom-build systems and focuses on off-the-shelf solutions to
decrease the internal maintenance burden (Bose & Gupta, 2019, p. 7; Detzler et al., 2020).
AI's role is to automate repetitive tasks, optimize processes and generate insight (Bose &
Gupta, 2019, p. 8; Detzler et al., 2020). Whereas, in the traditional model impact of
transactions, decisions and planning are not always understood (Bose & Gupta, 2019, p.
9; Detzler et al., 2020). Digitalized operational environment aims to support continuous
learning and offer full visibility to E2E visibility (Bose & Gupta, 2019, p. 13; Detzler et
al., 2020).
Digitalization model drives forward agile organization which is flexible and fast to
change, uses real-time data and various communication means, collaborates with the
partners such as customers and suppliers, uses intelligent optimization done by people,
machines and analytics, enforces E2E visibility across all processes and supports holistic
decision-making through transparent information available for all functions (Bose &
Gupta, 2019, p. 13; Detzler et al., 2020).
3.3.2

Intelligent Process Automation

Already in 1988, Taiichi Ohno from Toyota Production Systems used the concept called
“automation” where the machines would operate autonomously with a human touch on
the production line (Coito et al., 2019, p. 1825). Today, the automation means adoption
of technologies and devices that are capable of autonomously interact with people, other
machines, and devices along the value chain (Coito et al., 2019, p. 1825). The concept of
intelligent automation aims to automate tasks taken care of by knowledge or service
workers by using technologies such as AI, robotics, integrations, and data analytics
(Coombs et al., 2020, p. 1). What Coombs et al. (2020), state in their paper is that several
studies in the field of intelligent automation suggest that the application of intelligent
automation can deliver improvements in business process performance. Besides this,
similar results have been noted when intelligent automation and human capabilities have
been combined in the process (Coombs et al., 2020, p. 3).
42

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

All applications and tools in use are generating different types of data and the
communication between the systems is getting more complex (Coito et al., 2019, p. 1825).
In addition to this, data is seen as one of the most valuable business assets and it needs to
flow coherently in the values chain (Coito et al., 2019, p. 1825). Therefore, to efficiently
utilize the data generated in the organization and by the partners, the road towards datadriven industry requires heavy integration between the internal and external systems.
Coito et al. (2019), list in their study nine (9) features of intelligent automation:
interoperability, virtualization, visualization, traceability, decentralization, real-time,
modularity, level of access, and knowledge management. Listed features can vary from
architecture and application to organizational level. The proposed guidelines by the Coito
et al. (2019), for the features are:


Interoperability: capability of one system to be integrated into another one. Interfaces
should use existing standards and protocols to connect and exchange information.



Virtualization: the creation of digital twins or replicas of the production
environment.



Visualization: an interface between the user and the system should be clear, flexible,
easily accessible, and responsive.



Traceability: the resources used should be trackable throughout the whole lifecycle in
real-time.



Decentralization: the ability of the support systems to make decisions of their own for
example by alerting errors. These systems can be either local or remote via cloudbased approaches.



Real-time: capability of acquiring, analyzing, and delivering information when the
event is recorded into the system. System architecture and infrastructure should
support real-time data handling.



Modularity: flexible integration of new modules and adaptation of the existing ones
with changes. Modular systems should be built from smaller and independent
subsystems to reduce complexity. Meaning that one system does not intend to do all.



Level of access: data access management policies to protect data integrity. This can
be done by moving periodically data to application data warehouses. Security
concerns can be mitigated by moving systems to the cloud.
43

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology



Knowledge management: documentation should be up to date and internal knowledge
shared across the organization so that the key information is not held by only certain
people.
3.3.3

Service-Oriented Architecture

According to Hustad and Olsen (2021), digital infrastructure is the key for organizations
that want to develop their usage of digital technologies. Digital infrastructure is not only
a technological layer but comprises organizational, process, and network layers. It
combines the software, hardware, standards, platforms, and humans using digital tools.
Such infrastructure has become indispensable in the private and public sectors, and
service-oriented architecture (SOA) is seen as essential infrastructure in the digital
transformation journey (Hustad & Olsen, 2021, p. 597; Lam, 2005, p. 1). Service-oriented
architecture (SOA) is an established approach that drives higher agility levels, better
utilization of existing recourses, and flexibility in the companies (Hustad & Olsen, 2021,
p. 597; Lam, 2005, p. 1). These characteristics are value creators for the business and thus
important advantages in today’s fast-changing technological environment (Hustad &
Olsen, 2021, p. 597; Lam, 2005, p. 1). Companies have faced architectural challenges
because of variations in legacy systems, enterprise systems, platforms, and applications
(Hustad & Olsen, 2021, p. 597; Lam, 2005, p. 1). In order to exchange data between all
of these systems, the common practice has been to create point-to-point integrations and
middleware solutions (Hustad & Olsen, 2021, p. 598; Lam, 2005, p. 3). However, in the
longer term, the resources needed to develop and maintain such a technological landscape
become extensive (Hustad & Olsen, 2021, p. 597; Lam, 2005, p. 1). The idea behind SOA
is to make a common pool of IT resources available regardless of the state of the
application or system (Hustad & Olsen, 2021, p. 597). Legacy and newly deployed
applications need to co-exist in the organization’s IT landscape, as in most cases legacy
systems have still business value due to the support of specific business scenarios (Hustad
& Olsen, 2021, p. 597). In addition to this, the core of SOA is to offer well-defined
interfaces that communicate by using standard protocols, and parties are loosely coupled
(Boubeta-Puig et al., 2017, p. 4647). Currently, one of the most common models to

44

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

implement SOA is web services, and these are discussed more in the integrations
paragraph (Boubeta-Puig et al., 2017, p. 4647).
The SOA benefits that have been acknowledged in the literature are SOA’s ability to
integrate easily with third-party systems, reducing the integration costs, improving
agility, more flexibility to change the business processes, ability continuously improve
the functional landscape and reuse the existing services (Boubeta-Puig et al., 201, p. 4648;
Hustad & Olsen, 2021, p. 600). The core idea of the SOA framework is to develop flexible
and robust IT-based services, which facilitate the adaption of business processes to the
rapid changes in the market (Hustad & Olsen, 2021, p. 600).
3.3.4

Integrations

Today, we can say that the industry 4.0, which others call the industrial revolution, is
powered by data (Liotine & Pagano, 2020, p. 183; Ciccullo et al., 2020, p. 1093; Tiwari,
2020, p. 990). Tiwari (2020), studied in his paper the relationship between industry 4.0
and supply chain integrations (SCI) and based on the academic papers in the field, can be
stated that SCI has played a significant role in enhancing supply chain and organizational
performance (p. 990). Industry 4.0 is bringing digital change into functional areas such
as management, production, planning, sourcing, and logistics, just to name a few (Tiwari,
2020, p. 990). In addition, the scholars in different fields such as information systems,
supply chain, business, and marketing have acknowledged how system integrations are
vital in the increasing cloud and mobile applications landscape, and how the well-made
integration design creates the foundation for communication between applications and
systems (Montali et al., 2021, p. 1; Geleilate et al., 2021, p. 17). Furthermore, Geleilate
et al. (2021), explained how a company’s increased system integration maturity internally
and with partners has shown results in highly improved company performance.
Tiwari (2020) defined that supply chain integration “as the degree of which a company
collaborates with its supply chain partners and collaboratively manages intraorganizational and inter-organizational processes, with the intention of attaining effective
and efficient integration of various flows in the form of physical, information and
financial flow” (p. 991). Meaning that strategic alignment with functions and processes
45

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

in the supply chain is primarily done with integrations so that the collaboration between
the company, customers, and suppliers is supported with a high degree of information
transfer (Tiwari, 2020, p. 991). In order to facilitate effective information exchange,
flexibility, and responsiveness, SCI is considered an essential part of the supply chain
performance improvement journey (Tiwari, 2020, p. 993). Three dimensions of
integrations were recognized in the literature: 1) integration of flows and process and
activities, 2) integrations of technologies and systems, and 3) integrations of actors of the
supply chain (Tiwari, 2020, p. 994). In the next paragraph we discuss more the second
dimension and what is the state-of-the-art means to integrate systems in the end-to-end
chain when facilitating digital infrastructure.
Web services
Boubeta-Puig et al. (2017), describe web services as self-descriptive software modules,
which can be accessed through the web, and can manage communication between
applications and systems and support their interoperability. There are existing different
web service protocols and SOAP messaging is the more traditional one (Boubeta-Puig et
al., 2017, p. 4647). Representational State Transfer (REST) web services have emerged
in the recent decade to offer an alternative to the traditional protocols. REST is an
architecture built on hypermedia systems and where services are identified based on
URLs, and communication between service clients happens by using HTTP operations
GET, POST, PUT and DELETE (Boubeta-Puig et al., 2017, p. 4647).
After open-source code and platforms changed the world, the next evolution of service
development has moved to offer API-based solutions. API is an application programming
interface, and it has the possibility to reuse its commodified application programming
interface. Meaning that several systems and applications can connect to the same API
endpoint (Moilanen et al., 2018, p. 6). Today, REST APIs are also referred to as RESTful
API, and it is one of the most commonly used web services that use the architectural
model based on HTTP protocol (Tian et al., 2020, p. 151). According to Tian et al. (2020),
during the last decade number of APIs has grown from 2000 to 23000, meaning a 1000%
increase in number.

Summary of The Theoretical Framework

This chapter presented a theoretical framework, which will be used as a foundation for
the further analysis conducted in chapter 5. Theory is used to evaluate the process
maturity, and to analyze the development needs required to improve process efficiency
and drive the digital strategy of the company. The first paragraph of the theory is focusing
on examining the supply chain and container domain, as in this thesis is essential to
understand the research field under this domain. This part presents a holistic overview of
the best practices of SCM and multimodal container logistics and discusses some of the
identified pitfalls and common development directions of the connected processes, and
also addresses the technological perspective.
As the core scope of the thesis is the improvement of supply to pay multimodal container
process, the theory regarding BPM management is extensively examined. After assessing
different framework approaches of the scholars, Integrated Business Process
Management (IBPM) framework was selected for further analysis instrument together
with tools that are commonly used in Lean methodology. Through BPM framework, this
thesis aims to analyze critically what the development needs of the feedstock supply
multimodal container process are, and how to align them with organizational strategic
objectives.
The technology section of the theory offers a wide overview of today’s information
technology landscape utilized in SCM. Thus, studies conducted in this area are used as a
guiding principle of how innovation and technological solutions should be taken into
consideration when redesigning the process. The theoretical framework is used to analyze
how to strive more efficient process by applying digital technologies and increasing
communication beyond organizational boundaries.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

This chapter presents the research method used in the thesis, different data collection
approaches, and how respondents were selected. The research method selected for this
thesis is a qualitative case study as the research focuses on examining the unique
organization and their ways of working in a specific process area (Swanborn, 2010;
Travers, 2001, p. 2). Lee and Saunders (2017) define a case study as a research strategy,
which contains different methods. In the social sciences, the case study approach is widely
used when examining phenomena such as production processes, innovation in the
organization, industrial mergers, collective decision-making, labor market careers, and
selection procedures (Swanborn, 2010).
Generally, case study research strategy progress in a linear fashion: review the literature
and define research question(s), design study, prepare for study and collect data, analyze
data and finally report findings (Lee & Saunders, 2017). This thesis was constructed in a
similar manner described in Figure 23. In the first phase, the aim was to understand the
area of the thesis by examining the conventional theory around the topic and to formulate
the research questions. Based on this in the second phase, the aim was to identify the key
stakeholders of the thesis and create a detailed research plan. After data collection was
done, the next step was to conduct comprehensive data analysis. In the final phase, the
findings were reported and elaborated upon.

4.1

Qualitative Research

The qualitative research methodology was selected for the thesis due to the nature of the
research, where the aim was to understand the unique characteristics of several teams
working directly or indirectly with the process and how their professional views influence
the analysis of the ideal development roadmap (Gillham, 2005, p. 13). To support the
methodology selection, several studies have stated that qualitative methods should be
used to answer questions such as process, examining new phenomena and when testing
relationships between construct and variables under empirical setting (Garcia & Gluesing,
2013, p. 424). Thus, qualitative research was seen a logical approach to examine
phenomena presented in this thesis. Furthermore, when designing the research process
purely quantitative approach was excluded, as it was not possible to conduct a reliable
questionnaire since the sampling size would not have been adequate. However, the case
company’s internal data obtained from the reporting tools were used as a part of the
analysis. Therefore, the case study strategy deemed to an appropriate choice for this thesis
as an intensive approach was applied, meaning that only one specific phenomenon was
studied in-depth (Swanborn, 2010). In addition, a case study offers the capability to study
an individual institution or phenomenon thoroughly and based on unique identified
characteristics and ways of acting to offer outcomes and explanations (Lee & Saunders,
2017).

4.2

Data Collection

There are five main recognized methods in qualitative research: observation,
interviewing, ethnographic fieldwork, discourse analysis, and textual analysis, and can be
used alone or these can be mixed in the research (Travers, 2001, p. 3). However, the most
commonly used data collection methods are interviews, observation, and document
analysis (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 23). Similarly, the primary data sources used in this
thesis are interviews and observations conducted in the case study company. Secondary
sources for the thesis were the company’s internal documents regarding processes,
business case analysis, used applications, and guidelines. In addition, reporting tools were
used to gather data about the KPIs and process performance.

4.2.1

Interviews

Respondents selected for the thesis were chosen from different stakeholder groups. The
semi-structured method was used to conduct the interviews (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p.
109). All the respondents were asked the same twenty-five questions presented in
Appendix 1. In semi-structured interviews, the questions are often a mixture of more or
less structured questions (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 110). However, the nature of the
semi-structured interview is that questions are flexible and even though pre-defined
questions exist, the interviews are not limited to those, and one specific question can lead
the interview to follow-up questions to gather specific data from all respondents (Merriam
& Tisdell, 2016, p. 110).

A total of eleven responders were interviewed from eight different functions. The duration
of each interview was approximately 45 minutes and interviews were conducted
individually with every respondent. All respondents work with the process, either on the
operational side or in the development function. Thus, respondents' knowledge regarding
the current operational state and the ideal future state was widely represented.
4.2.2

Workshops and Observation

Observation as a data collection method is based on acknowledging relevant data for the
thesis and noting those down (Adams et al., 2014, p. 93). In this thesis, the observation
technique was used in the project workshops. Both projects, RED and LEX that are
affecting on the thesis, started their work by having extensive workshops regarding
processes, current state analysis (As-Is), development needs, and the ideal future state
(To-Be).

In the workshops, which were held during spring and fall 2021, the current and ideal
process flow, integration architecture, and application landscape were discussed, and
principles were defined within a large sampling of stakeholders such as process owners,
operations, IT, development managers, business consultants, and project management.
During the workshops, the researcher worked as an employee within the organization and
was able to obtain a comprehensive picture of the company’s future directions and
guidelines relevant to the thesis, which would not have been possible to gain solely via
the interviews. Rather than observing participant behavior, the researcher concentrated
on noting down the relevant factual topics.

4.3

Data Analysis

The nature of qualitative research is to produce an extensive amount of unstructured data
and it is commonly analyzed in five phases: (1) in the exploration phase the aim is to
detect patterns and identify deviants and oddities, (2) classification phase different groups
are identified and data is compared against the theory, (3) in the drawing conclusion phase
groups are compared and contrasted and theory applied, (4) in the representation phase
model is built and (5) in the final testing phase model should be tested (Adams et al.,
2014, p. 152). However, this thesis applies content analysis to examine the data obtained
from the interviews and observation (Adams et al., 2014, p. 159). The content analysis
comprises six main steps: (1) identifying the object of analysis such as the company or
individual, (2) choosing a set of categories, (3) coding assertions under the categories, (4)
tabulation of the material by counting each assertation and presentation as a Table, (5)
illustrating the material and (6) summarize the results (Adams et al., 2014, p. 159).
Each interview was recorded, and the relevant data was mapped under different
categories. Data mapping was adopted in the further analysis phase, where waste in the
process was identified, and development items were recognized. In the analysis phase,
the value stream was mapped by using SIPOC to understand the scope of the
development, the E2E value stream map was illustrated to identify waste in the process,
and finally, an ideal process model was suggested based on the data collected from the
interviews and workshops.

ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF RESULTS

In this chapter, comprehensive analysis is done for the multimodal container process
based on the data obtained from the interviews, workshops, and the company’s internal
data sources. Interviews and workshops offered a thorough understanding of the overall
process, current state, and future development needs, and through the case company’s
reporting tools it was possible to analyze process performance based on the data.
The first phase of the analysis followed Malinova and Mendling’s (2018), integrated
BPM framework and context factors were defined. The second phase was to define the
scope of the process development, which was done by using SIPOC. In addition, the key
process steps were evaluated by using value stream mapping, which is a tool to identify
the current state, future state, and work plan for how to reach the objectives (Holt, 2019,
p. 140). VSM is built based on SIPOC but on a more detailed level (Janssen & Loader,
2019, p. 30). After visualization of the current state of the process and identifying the
potential improvement points, the second phase was to analyze the process holistically
and suggest To-Be state that is possible to achieve by following the steps in the final part
of this chapter, which presents the development roadmap proposal.

5.1

Integrated BPM Context Factors

Analysis of the results was started by defining the BPM context factors for the multimodal
container process. Context factors are the enablers for the BPM success, meaning that
process should be designed, executed, managed, and monitored according to the
organization’s defined strategy (Malinova & Mendling, 2018, p. 12). Table 3 shows the
main strategic initiatives that drive business process management. During the project
workshops, one core driver emerged repeatedly in the discussions, namely increased
competition of the feedstock. Thus, process management actions should aim to improve
the supplier experience with the case company so that they would be seen as a highly
desired partner to business with. All interview respondents emphasized the importance of
removing manual steps from the process, and digitalization together with process
automation was seen as the primary tool to develop more efficient processes and the most
53

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

importantly, avoiding the need of hiring a new workforce when supply volumes are
increasing. Respondent 1 commented that:
“Digitalization and automation have improved the MCP lead time and especially made
month end closing faster, and to further optimize the process waiting development ideas
should be implemented”.
Similarly, respondent 3 noted that:
“Automated ticketing improvement and data integrations would benefit the operations”
and respondent 7: “The process has a lot of integration potential”.
In addition, process monitoring and defined KPIs are one strategic focus point that aims
for better business process management. The closer the company is about to achieve
digitalized operational environment, the better it can monitor the E2E process, use realtime data, collaborate with the partners and react flexibly to changes (Gupta & Bose,
2019, p. 13; Detzler et al., 2020). Respondent 6 stated that:
“Direction of the process should go towards higher automatization level, process
visibility, better tracking of containers and better planning ability”.

People are an integral part of each organization and therefore it is essential for successful
BPM adoption that those people involved in the process and BPM initiatives have an
54

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

adequate understanding of the process and BPM knowledge (Malinova & Mendling,
2018, p. 12). The commercial operations, back office, logistics team, key users, process
owner, business development, and IT development teams are having the best knowledge
of the process. The respondents were selected from these groups, and the aim was to select
those who were familiar with the multimodal container process in the organization. These
individuals were in a key position when BPM development items were defined and
implemented. When MCP was designed and implemented in 2020, respondents from
EMEA commercial operations highlighted they were able to influence the development
at a sufficient level and incorporate their needs into the design. Comment from respondent
1 was that:
“We were able to influence the MCP As-Is design, and our requests were integrated to
the process rather well”.
Similar practice should be continued with the future To-Be development.
Governance means a clearly defined decision-making process between different roles
acting in the process (Malinova & Mendling, 2018, p. 12). Ideally, the responsibilities
and process management standards are documented to drive transparency and to have a
knowledge management repository where information can be updated and versioned
when changes occur (Malinova & Mendling, 2018, p. 12). With MCP development, the
key stakeholders are project resources and these are managed by the project management
organization (PMO). However, in general, the process owner and business development
roles are holding the responsibility to drive BPM standards, documenting key information
about the process flow and knowledge, monitoring the process performance, and
suggesting improvements accordingly.
Culture, which is the final contextual factor, composes concepts such as values, beliefs,
attitudes, and behavior (Malinova & Mendling, 2018, p. 12). The core of the culture is to
create an organizational environment that complements BPM initiatives (Malinova &
Mendling, 2018, p. 12). Such cultural dimensions that are favorable for BPM are change
acceptance, readiness to change, and process values, beliefs, attitudes, and behavior
(Malinova & Mendling, 2018, p. 12). In order to achieve successful BPM actions,
55

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

company management support needs to be obtained. This is achieved through
projectization, where only selected projects by the business will proceed to funding, the
project sponsor is defined, internal and external project resources are appointed and
priority of the project is defined. As shown in Table 3, the next leading cultural principles
are organizational change management (OCM) and willingness to change. The OCM is
widely used in the case company with almost every project and it is a strong tool to
commit and prepare people for the upcoming change. It also walks hand in hand with the
willingness to change, meaning that when OCM is applied effectively, the negative
perceptions towards the change are converted on the positive side. Two strong influencing
factors to support organizational commitment to change are continuous communication
about the upcoming development actions, what are the changes attempting to achieve,
and development, implementation, and training schedule. In addition, involvement of the
operative bodies, meaning that the knowledge of the employees doing the day-to-day
operations should be harnessed into the use of the project during the design phase. Some
of these resources will continue working on the project. Involvement is an important
power to strengthen the willingness to change. When people feel that they have been able
to affect the direction of their own work, they are more willing to commit to the new ways
of working. Most of the respondents felt that OCM actions are handled relatively well
with the previous project implantations and have helped to adapt to the new ways of
working and systems. Respondent 4 commented that:
“User training and provided material were sufficient to start working with the new
process”.

5.2

BPM Infrastructure

BPM infrastructure is the foundation for the operational part of the BPM initiatives
(Malinova & Mendling, 2018, p. 11). The infrastructure consists of concepts such as core
team, process modeling platform, and guidelines (Malinova & Mendling, 2018, p. 11).
The MCP core team is working under projects LEX and RED. Both projects are working
with different parts of the process, but the overall aim is the same, that is process
improvement. Project resourcing contains process owners, operations specialists working
56

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

with the process, IT development, business development, and PMO. The tools used in the
case company for modeling different processes are Google slides, ARIS tool, and
digrams.net. Google slides were selected as the tool for this thesis, as it is the most widely
used tool in the case company to illustrate processes. The tools used for current state
analysis are originated from Lean methodology. Lean is a widely used methodology in
the case company and therefore it is natural to apply already used methods to the analysis.

5.3

Process Identification

The current state is analyzed by utilizing SIPOC and VSM. SIPOC is constructed by
identifying supplier, input, output, and customer. In Malinova and Mendling’s (2018)
integrated BPM framework, this part belongs to the BPM lifecycle where the process is
identified, discovered, analyzed, redesigned, implemented and monitored, and controlled.
The scope of this thesis only touches upon the first five steps, and implementation and
monitoring are scoped out.
SIPOC is a tool to describe in detailed level the different actors of the process and their
key deliverables (Loader & Janssen, 2019, p. 30). Figure 24 describes both. Actors on the
supplier side are feedstock suppliers, ocean liners, hinterland carriers, and terminal
operations. Their input to the process is to deliver loading figures and dates, specific time
stamps during the transportation, and finally send the discharge specific details.
Customers on the order side are commercial operations, back office operations, and
logistics. The output and result for the customer is to have correct quantities and
timestamps in their system to be able to proceed to payment. To monitor the process,
commercial operations need details of the container movements that can be called in this
context as container events. Respondent 5 commented that:
“Would be beneficial to get tracking data of the containers to monitor performance
better” and respondent 8 highlighted that: “It is relevant to know where the containers
are moving”.

57

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

Key performance indicators that are defined for the supply to pay process are invoice lead
time, ticketing lead time, and nomination lead time. Thus, same KPIs are used with the
container process.

Figure 24. SIPOC - Multimodal Container Process
As the process discovery phase focus on heavily on the understanding of the current state
of the business process, it can be logical to address As-Is process in the analysis section
similarly as it was presented in chapter 2.2.1 (Malinova & Mendling, 2018, p. 11). Figure
25 is an illustration of the As-Is process steps presented above SIPOC Figure 24.

58

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

Figure 25. Multimodal Container Process As-Is Flowchart
Value stream map (VSM) is a detailed diagram of the current process flow where the key
data is illustrated, and the waste can be identified (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 30). The
goal of VSM is to visualize the process and, based on that, further analysis can be
conducted (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 30). VSM aims to describe the process in three to
five high-level steps (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 30). However, regarding the container
process, there was a need to include more process steps in the evaluation. Altogether, nine
main steps were illustrated in the VSM and without the previous, the next step cannot
exist. In general, value stream map intends to calculate the overall lead time of the process
together with the process cycle time. Cycle time is demonstrating the time how long it
takes to complete one output to start the next one. The data used to evaluate lead time and
cycle time are retrieved from process mining tool Celonis, which is used to evaluate key
operational metrics that are nomination lead time, ticketing lead time, and invoice
handling lead time. In addition, the SAP business warehouse report dedicated to analyzing
container history and delivery performance was also one data source for the VSM,
together with the back office operator and commercial operator’s evaluation regarding
the duration of the manual steps.

59

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

Figure 26. MCP Value Stream Map
Lead time value 1: in the VSM Figure 26, the first 52.4 days represent nomination lead
time. Nomination lead time is calculated by comparing reference document creation date
to nomination confirmation date. (Case Company, 2021) We need to address that
nomination lead time is the only indicative figure at the moment as the measure is under
building, and not fully validated, although it is considered as one KPI.
Lead time value 2: second lead time is marked n/a as this process step is not monitored
in any report and the loading time is not reported by the supplier (Case Company, 2021).
Lead time value 3: ticketing lead time 6.4 days is calculated by comparing the actual
loading date to the date when the ticket was created in the system. When the dates are
compared in such a way, it represents the time how long has it taken manually or via
integration to record actual quantities into the system (Case Company, 2021). This KPI
measures internal efficiency. In addition, ticketing lead time has a direct impact on the
invoice lead time, as payment to the supplier cannot be handled if actual quantities are
not ticketed to the system. However, even though the payment process is not part of the
scope of this thesis, we can state that improvements in the loading ticketing efficiency
will have a positive effect on the invoice lead time. In general, containers are delivered

60

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

based on CFR, CIF, CPT, FAS, FCA, and FOB, meaning that loading figures are the basis
for supplier invoicing and customer payment.
Lead time value 4: 87 days is an average calculated from all deliveries during the 1st of
January 2021 and the 30th of November 2021 (Case Company, 2021). The value itself is
not very indicative as container vessel sailing time will depend on the distance from
loading port to discharge port. Thus, the sailing time varies considerably.
Lead time value 5: 13 days illustrates the time used by the commercial operations to
nominate carriers for pickup of the arrived containers (Case Company, 2021). Currently,
the discharge terminal in EMEA is handling the transportation from the container port to
the terminal and the delay in the carrier nomination in TIS does not block hinterland
carrier operations. However, if this step is not conducted in a timely manner in the system,
it will delay all the proceeding process steps.
Lead time values 6 and 7: these lead times are marked as n/a as these are not available in
any report.
Lead time value 8: 8.4 days is the average time of what takes in the terminal to start the
discharge process. The calculation is done based on the timestamps carrier enters to
haulier portal. (Case Company, 2021) Compared events are container unload to terminal
premises and discharge date. We need to note here that when analyzing the data set, it
was evident that in some cases carrier has entered proximate timestamps to indicate the
unload time in the haulier portal, and therefore values are only indicative. This might be
because of a delay in the step where commercial operations are manually nominating
carriers, or due to the factor that the carrier needs to enter the same values to their system
together with the case company’s system. Meaning double manual work on their side.
Lead time value 9: the last value of 4.7 days illustrates discharge ticketing lead time, and
it is calculated similarly to the lead time value 3 (Case Company, 2021). Discharge
quantities are first entered into terminal quantity management system by the 3rd party
terminal operations. After the values are entered into Terminal Quantity Management
System (TQMS), these are sent via integrations to Terminal Inventory System (TIS). The
integration on the case company side is not completely automated, as the back office
61

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

operator needs to upload CSV files to TIS. Thus, integration is not real-time and manual
steps might cause some delay to the ticketing, as the value should be closer to 1 day when
integration is fully automated.
Cycle time value 1: value 5-7 minutes indicates the time how long it takes for a
commercial operator to create one nomination. Time is an approximate estimation given
by the commercial operator handling the task.
Cycle time value 2: second cycle time is marked n/a as this process step is not reported
by the supplier.
Cycle time value 3: to enter containers into the system back office needs to upload a
standardized CSV file with container information to TIS. The duration of these manual
steps is evaluated to take 5-10 minutes. Estimation was given by the back office operator
handling the task.
Cycle time value 4: The duration of this step is zero due to logic built into the system.
The logic unloads the containers automatically in TIS when the vessel’s estimated time
of arrival (ETA) hits the system. The downside of this is that if the ETA changes, this is
not reflected in the system and the step is ticketed with incorrect date information.
Cycle time value 5: nominating containers to a carrier is done as one batch. The duration
of this manual step is approximately 10 minutes. Estimation was given by the commercial
operator handling this step in the system.
Cycle time value 6 and 7: the steps to load and unload containers to truck or barge are
handled manually by the hinterland carrier in haulier portal. Estimation of the duration of
both steps is 10-15 minutes.
Cycle time value 8: the value is marked n/a as there is no existing report on how long it
takes for the terminal operations to discharge one container unit. In addition, the type of
container has a great effect on the overall discharge duration.

62

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

Cycle time value 9: the last estimated value is the manual discharge CSV file upload to
TIS. Back office operators estimate for the duration is 10-15 minutes. A fully automated
integration process would reduce this step’s cycle time to zero.
In a summary, value stream map analysis is offering a great way to illustrate waste in the
process and highlight the missing monitoring in some phases. It can be stated that lead
time as such might not be the best indicator for this particular process as there are 3 rd
parties who are affecting heavily on the overall lead time. However, overall performance
monitoring would increase the understanding of the most time-consuming process phases
and give transparency of how long it takes to manage the feedstock supply process from
the start to the finish. In addition, this would follow BPM core principles to control and
analyze the process (Payyazhi & Sikdar, 2014, p. 973). In this context, cycle time can be
seen as a better indicator for the process efficiency measure, as most of the manual steps
are handled internally in the case company and can be improved with process
development actions. However, both lead time and cycle time have phases that have waste
reduction potential. These are explained in more detail in the following chapters. The
final finding regarding VSM is that the VSM was only feasible to illustrate for EMEA
multimodal container process as it was not possible to distinguish containers from APAC
vessels as both containers and vessels are using the same nomination type. In addition,
the SAP BW report does not include APAC containers as when nomination type is a
vessel the individual container events are not created in the process, and thus cannot be
compared in the report. Respondent 5 and 6 had a similar view regarding this finding:
“Reporting would be only comparable if both regions would follow the same internal
process” and “better tracking data would benefit the container visibility in the APAC
region”.

5.4

Process Redesign

In this section, the analysis continues with the identification of the waste in the process
that could be potentially diminished with correct development actions. The waste was
recognized by analyzing the data from the reports, based on the respondents’ answers and
discussion held on the workshops. Figure 27 is representing the most potential
63

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

development process phases, with an exclamation mark in a triangle. The identified
development needs worked as a base for the To-Be process modeling. It is also important
to address that project LEX is implementing a new TMS system for logistic management,
which impacts the redesign of the MCP To-Be process.

VSM and Development Potential

Lead time value 1 (52.4 days) represents nomination lead time. It is considered as one of
the main KPIs, so naturally there is a great incentive to improve this area for all parties
working with the process. Suggested improvement in this area would be to increase
automation. When automation is applied intelligently, it can deliver improvements in
business process performance (Coombs et al., 2020). In the case company automation
could be applied for the repetitive cases not having variation in the input data. Respondent
8 commented that:
“Information like events and timestamps should be automated and send directly from
logistics integration portal”. This could potentially decrease the nomination lead time
and could have a positive effect on the operational forecasting when there is better
visibility ahead.

Figure 27. Identified Waste in the MCP
Cycle time value 1 (5-7 minutes) presents the time how long it takes for a commercial
operator to create one nomination. All respondents working with the nominations
highlighted that MCP increased the complexity of the nomination structure, which is
slowing down the speed of creating one nomination. Respondent 2 indicated that:
“MCP nomination is more complex than the vessel nomination due to several lines in the
system”.
In addition, respondent 3 viewpoint was that:
“Some nominations are complex and due to this automation can be difficult. One fits all
probably does not work here”.
However, one significant step in the nomination creation is the scheduling dashboard
phase where nomination is modeled first before it is created as an actual nomination. This
is purely executed for sales and operational planning and execution purposes. In addition,
in the MCP workshops were discussed how the nomination could be made simpler in a
way that not all transportation legs would be illustrated on the nomination but only having
loading location and destination available. This way it would also correspond better to
65

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

the needs of expanding container process to other locations, it would save master data
creation actions and make the creation simpler and faster for the operations.
Lead time value 3 ticketing lead time (6.4 days) is calculated by comparing the actual
loading date to the date when the ticket was created in the system and cycle time value 3
(5-10 minutes) is the time that is used by the back office to upload standardized CSV file
with container information to TIS. Both steps could be potentially decreased close to zero
by integrating new system TMS to existing solutions. Integration would remove the
manual back office input and would require rather monitoring actions on their part than
manual transaction handling. In case the integration is event-driven, meaning that
information is pushed to the case company system in real-time, the ticketing lead time
could be potentially one day. This would have a positive influence also to the invoice lead
time KPI, as invoices can be paid only when the loading quantities are actualized in SAP.
Loading ticketing phase automation has also another aspect which is the supplier
experience. Today they need to provide the container data uploaded to the system,
meaning that they are manually entering data to google sheet, which is then processed
manually further in the case company. Respondent 3 commented that:
“Fully automated loading and discharge ticket integration, automation of manual steps
would increase the operational efficiency” and similarly respondent noted that “when
there is a lot of transactions, integrations with the 3rd parties are more preferable option
than portals where one needs to enter data manually”.
When information flow is automatic, it would decrease the case company’s internal
workload and the suppliers' manual input. In addition, for SCM to be effective and
efficient, organizations should apply more widely digital technologies to enhance
performance (Ciccullo et al., 2020, p. 1093). When information is shared beyond
organization boundaries, it can help the case company to achieve a better alignment with
different actors in the supply chain (Ciccullo et al., 2020, p. 1093).
Lead time value 5 (13 days) illustrates the lead time how long it takes for the commercial
operations to nominate a carrier for pickup from the arrival to the container port and cycle
time value 5 (10 minutes) is representing the time how long does it take for commercial
66

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

ops to nominate container hinterland carrier in TIS. By the respondents managing this
step saw that this was an extra phase added to the process, as currently, only one
hinterland carrier is operating in every location. Respondent 4 commented that:
“Some tasks were automated but at the same time new manual tasks were added, which
require a lot of communication between different stakeholders”.
The added phase made the step visible in the system, but potentially this could be handled
in TMS, which will act as the logistics planning platform in the future. The suggested
way to handle this could be container events sent to TMS from the transportation tracking
system, which are platforms that gather global transportation tracking details. This way,
the step could be removed from the process, which would decrease the lead time and
cycle time to zero.
Cycle time value 6 and 7 (10-15 minutes) steps to load and unload containers to truck or
barge are handled manually by the hinterland carrier in the haulier portal. This phase was
added to the As-Is MCP process to increase the visibility of the hinterland carrier
performance. However, the downside of the increased visibility is that hinterland carrier
has to manually input the data to the case company’s system as well as their own. Meaning
that their work efficiency is decreased due to the added steps. Respondent 8 expressed
that:
“The most important development topics are to automate the processes and to increase
efficiency. The company cannot afford to manually enter individual transactions to
different systems”.
Potential development seen here is again the container events sent from the transportation
tracking system to TMS and further to SAP. This could potentially remove the need for
the carrier to manually input data to the haulier portal. In addition, data accuracy is
potentially better when the information is sent directly from its original source and no
manual input is needed in between.
Lead time value 9 (4.7 days) illustrates discharge ticketing lead time and cycle time value
9 (10-15 minutes) is the manual discharge CSV file upload to TIS. As the phase is not
67

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

currently fully automated, manual input is needed from the back office. Once full
automation is achieved, the cycle time is potentially zero and lead time reduced closer to
one. Moreover, if integration is event-driven, the transactions can be recorded almost in
real-time. Respondent 7 noted similarly:
“It is important to obtain status information from the key partners, to have event-based
transactions, and integrate with the partners”.
In summary, most of the benefits would be achieved by increasing the integration level
between internal and external systems so that the source system would be used as the
origin of the data and interfaced with the systems where it is needed. Respondent 8 noted
that:
“The main development needs are automated communication with the partners and lean
solution”.
This would also increase the automation level by removing internal and external manual
steps of the process. As stated by Oke et al. (2016), the cooperation with suppliers and
other partners in the supply chain network is the enabler for building competitive
capabilities such as quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost.
5.4.2

Redesigned To-Be Process Suggestion

This section unites all the development needs and improvement suggestions gathered
during the study in a form of a process chart. The ideal To-Be process in Figure 28 follows
the principles of digital operating model concept where decisions are not based on
spreadsheets or scattered data but the decision-making is driven by holistic data obtained
from centralized location (Bose & Gupta, 2019, p. 13; Detzler et al., 2020). Meaning that
google sheets and manual information repositories are avoided in the process. Moreover,
digitalized operational environment aims to support continuous learning and offer full
visibility to E2E process (Bose & Gupta, 2019, p. 2; Detzler et al., 2020). Intention to
achieve this is to digitalize as much data as possible so that it is available for use across
organization. In MCP case, SAP is used as the centralized location from where data can
be retrieved for reporting and to the use of other processes. The objective is to achieve a
68

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

state where the organization is flexible and fast to change, able to use real-time data, use
various communication means and collaborate easily with the partners such as customers
and suppliers (Bose & Gupta, 2019, p. 10; Detzler et al., 2020). In the next Figure 28 is
described the ideal To-Be process. In the Appendix 4. To-Be Multimodal Container
Process is explained in detailed level, including the process steps and if change is present
in the phase.

Figure 28. Ideal To-Be Multimodal Container Process Flowchart
Compared to the As-Is process, one of the biggest changes is that in the ideal To-Be
process TMS will play a central role in distributing logistic data to other systems via
integrations. It was addressed in the project LEX that TMS will offer capabilities that
support the case company’s logistics in a more holistic manner. Thus, when redesigning
MCP it was important to acknowledge this factor as this works as the basis of many
transactions in the process. Moreover, in the To-Be process, TIS would not act as the
central system of handling the containers, but this role would be shifted to TMS and SAP.
TMS would handle the logistics planning and execution, and SAP would act as the user
interface for monitoring containers. In addition, integrations would play a central role in
the To-Be process as they would enable two-way communication with the external
parties. Studies have shown that company’s increased system integration maturity
69

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

internally and with partners results in highly improved company performance (Geleilate
et al., 2021). The aim to achieve this with MCP would be to offer REST APIs to send and
receive data from the partners. Respondent 7 view was that:
“REST APIs can be used for loading and discharge quantity receiving and sending,
delivery request/ nomination sending to the terminal, and later to receive inventory
messages”.
Another notable factor with the integrations is that when those are implemented, various
manual steps can be removed from the process.

5.5

Comparison of EMEA and APAC Processes

At the beginning of this paper was presented two container processes. The purpose behind
this was to address the two different ways of managing the same process globally, which
is creating some barriers for development and monitoring the process similarly.
Currently, the APAC process is handled through the vessel process. Meaning that reports
developed specifically to measure multimodal container performance do not include these
supply orders. APAC container cases are part of vessel reports and thus complete
transparency of the container performance is not achieved in that business area. This was
also the reason why VSM was not possible to create for the APAC containers and a
comparison of the performance with EMEA was not achieved as a part of this case study.
Respondents acting in the roles of business process development emphasized the
importance of having a globally unified process in order to track the containers at a more
detailed level. Comment from respondent 6 was that:
“It is not optimal to have two different processes. Ideally company should drive general
process. However, process should be looked at case by case and differences can exist”
and respondent 8 overview was that: “It is preferable to have general global process for
the containers but first is needed to evaluate what is the correct way to go”.

70

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

On the APAC operational side vessel process was seen as an easy way to manage the
container supply, although it was causing a delay in the month-end closing activities.
Respondent 5 commented that:
“Process is more straightforward when containers are handled under vessel nomination,
and my feeling is that MCP is not needed in APAC area. In addition, APAC terminals are
not at the same technological level as in Europe”.
In the EMEA area, the biggest benefit from the current As-Is MCP was achieved
specifically from the quicker and fewer corrections requiring month-end closing. This
was achieved by increasing automation and by tracking the containers at the individual
level. Many respondents emphasized the faster month-end closing and faster process.
Respondent 2 noted that:
“Operations gain in time due to increased automation and more efficient month end
closing. Month end closing was decreased from 4 to 5 working days to 1 to 2 days. Before
transactions had to be manually ticketed and reconciliated”.
When containers are handled as one unit, it enables to enter multiple ticketing transactions
into the system and this way the loaded and discharged quantities are entered into the
system almost in real-time. When the vessel process is used, the quantities need to be
entered into the system when all containers from one batch are handled, which is never
real-time. In addition, the process is completely manual and container movements cannot
be followed, so transparency of the process is almost zero. Reasoning to drive
standardized processes lies in the cost and performance targets and decreased risk of
process failures (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 332). Additionally, what harmonization pushes
forward in the organization are unified IT systems, standard interfaces, advanced
communication practices, easier knowledge sharing, performance monitoring such as
common key performance indicators (KPIs), and the ability to outsource process
capabilities more easily (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 333).
The main focus of process harmonization is the common processes used globally
(Schönreiter, 2018, p. 340). Meaning that the same value-creating process should be
harmonized across organizations (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 340). One of the negatively
71

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

impacting factors of process harmonization is cultural differences, conflicting interests of
key players, and different operational processes (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 340). Such
notations can be noticed in the answers of the case company respondents, as all regions
do not have the same capabilities. Respondent 5 noted that:
“Suppliers in our region are not so advanced with the different tools and it is difficult to
get data from them in the format that we need”.
From the operational perspective easiness of managing the day-to-day process weights
more than reporting and unified ways of working. Business process development
perspective ability to track detailed process performance, ability to apply the same system
development actions across the same process, limit process variations so that global
instructions can be used across business units, and to drive automation so that better
efficiency and lower costs can be achieved are the driving forces. Respondent 6
commented that:
“Container supply made under vessel nomination does not provide the same visibility to
the process as MCP”.
When event-based controls and monitoring are in place, business decisions can be made
based on more accurate data. In practice, process harmonization means standardization
of business processes and the ability to control and monitor processes across several units
and locations (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 340). Based on the data collected from respondents,
the workshops and the literature harmonizing APAC and EMEA processes would have a
positive impact on the BPM activities.

5.6

Process Development Roadmap

This section summarizes the suggested development actions needed to achieve the ideal
To-Be process so that the case company can continue building competitive capabilities,
such as quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. One of the focus points on
the development list are the intelligent integrations between internal systems and the
integration endpoints offered to the partners. When the organization can digitalize
72

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

information exchange and retrieve real-time data, it can achieve higher maturity in its
journey towards industry 4.0. Today, system integrations are vital in the increasing cloud
and mobile applications landscape and a well-made integration design creates a strong
foundation for communication between applications and systems (Geleilate et al., 2021,
p. 18; Montali et al., 2021, p. 1). That is the state of what ideal To-Be process models try
to achieve; integrate the process in all three dimensions presented in the literature (Tiwari,
2020, p. 995).
1) Integration of flows and processes and activities (Tiwari, 2020, p. 995), all process
steps are executed in logical order so that the steps of the value stream are flowing
seamlessly without interruptions (Janssen & Loader, 2019, p. 15). Ideally, nothing is done
unless the process really requires it. Meaning that To-Be process steps are only executed
once the latter phase completion is triggering the next step.
2) Integrations of technologies and systems (Tiwari, 2020, p. 995), in the ideal To-Be
process internal systems are exchanging data digitally so that the data can be utilized
efficiently across functions. Thus, the To-Be process focuses on minimizing the manual
data inputs and relies on the data generated by the different systems acting in the process.
In addition, digitalizing data enables the organization to utilize advanced analytics, AI,
and other technologies in a mature state relevant for the supply chain management.
3) Integrations of actors of the supply chain (Tiwari, 2020, p. 995), REST API end-point
development aims to achieve seamless and real-time information exchange with the
partners, reduce manual work on both sides, and reach better data quality. Based on
studies company’s increased system integration maturity internally and with partners has
shown results in highly improved company performance (Geleilate et al., 2021). Although
web services are the prevailing way of integration technology, the integration means are
not only limited to REST APIs, but the case company should offer a wider range of
integration possibilities to its partners. This enables digital communication also with
global partners who do not possess the most advanced technological abilities.
When suggested three dimensions are implemented successfully, there is a high potential
to optimize the overall process and achieve more autonomous process flow, which is less
73

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

dependent on human input. This means naturally higher E2E process monitoring needs,
which is the second addressed development item and part of the strategic focal points.
Only by building reliable reporting and KPIs to monitor the process performance, it is
possible to evaluate where to improve. This is also the leading principle in BPM and Lean
methodology, that based on data you can increase transparency and understanding of the
process performance.
The final point on the roadmap is to drive simplicity in the process. Therefore, the
suggestion is to harmonize EMEA and APAC processes to follow the same internal steps.
This would enable monitoring of the process performance in the whole organization,
diminish process variations, improve the ability to develop container processes on a
global scale, and possibly decrease development costs when the implementation of
improvements can be done globally. Similarly, the simplified nomination structure and
application integration architecture could be followed globally.

DISCUSSION

Today is essential for companies to seek ways how to achieve performance levels that
create value and drive more efficient supply chain management. This is only
accomplished through well-designed processes, by applying leading technological
innovation across the organization and cooperating tightly with the partners acting in the
supply chain (Farahani et al., 2015, p. 21). This thesis, through a case study, examined
the ways to reach the ideal state in the internal container process so that value generation
is optimized. The thesis started with the research question: can ideal process design be
achieved by utilizing BPM framework together with Lean methodology? The thesis
discovered that when applying the BPM framework, the organization can use it as a
guideline to ensure that elements of successful business process development exist. In
terms of contextual factors, using the framework can help the organization identify the
core actors needed to drive the process development actions. The actors are business
process management enablers and are needed to increase understanding of what direction
process should be developed and who should be involved (Malinova & Mendling, 2018,
p. 12).
After the contextual layer is determined, the next important part is to understand who is
really working with BPM actions and what are the tools and guidelines. The thesis
revealed that the tools and guidelines are not clearly defined in the case company and
variation can exist when process modeling is done. In order to drive process excellence
in BPM, it would be beneficial to formalize the tools and ways of working when modeling
the process. Resource infrastructure for the BPM is rather clear as it flows down from the
projectization, where resources are tightly defined. However, when BPM is done outside
of the project, the core team needs to exist in the business as usual phase. Here, the leading
actors are process owners, business stakeholders, and IT development. The factor that
was clearly missing in the case company’s infrastructure side is the comprehensive
instructions on how to lead business process management and common tools to manage
development items. Harmonization of the tools would support BPM actions across
processes, and these could be measured and followed in a similar manner. In a summary,
an integrated BPM framework can help the company to identify the organizational
75

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

components to drive the change and key resources needed for the work. In addition, it can
reveal a lack of some areas of the BPM framework that can cause a pitfall when
implementing changes and improvements to the process. However, in order to identify
and analyze the process, it should be noted that the Integrated BPM framework does not
define specific tools for this. In other words, the framework needs to be complemented
with other more concrete analyzing tools. Thus, in this thesis, the integrated BPM
framework was complemented with Lean methodology and the tools it offers. Selected
tools were used in the process identification phase, where the current state was analyzed.
First, with the help of SIPOC a higher process level was possible to describe. This was
the base for the VSM analysis where the aim is to identify the waste in the process in a
visual manner. Both SIPOC and VSM support the BPM lifecycle phase’s core purpose
rather well. However, if the organization does not have sufficient data to measure the
process, VSM can be inaccurate and give only approximate values. This was noted when
formulating the case company’s VSM, since all the process steps were not statistically
measured. Thus, some of the identified waste is based on the evaluations of the acting
role in the process. Better accuracy would have been achieved if cycle and lead time could
have been obtained via reporting. Overall, it can be stated that Lean tools support the
BPM actions, but as this thesis focused on only two of the Lean tools, i.e., SIPOC and
VSM this cannot be evaluated holistically. In addition, there can be other tools outside of
Lean that support the BPM framework similarly or more comprehensive manner.
Additionally, three supporting research questions were formed besides the main question.
RQ1: What are the main development needs of the feedstock supply container process to
drive digitalization and operational excellence? Strategically, the case study company’s
target is to develop processes so that they work in no-touch mode. Meaning that the
automation level should be as high as possible and minimum human interference is
needed. This way the company is able to respond to increasing feedstock volumes without
needing to increase the headcount. Clearly, in the case company, the most development
needs concern the development of intelligent integrations between internal systems and
with the partners. It is important to note that the container supply process works globally
according to the principles of the global shipping companies and land logistics providers,
76

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

and it is managed in their application ecosystem. Moreover, companies utilizing container
logistics have their own internal process to record and track container supply movements
and quantities. Meaning that integrating with different parties working with the process
is fundamental, so that the process can be enhanced in a holistic manner. When
implementing an intelligent integrations process, it can potentially decrease half of its
manual work done today and enhance its operations. In addition, when data is digitalized
case company can build advanced analytics tools to support process monitoring and
control. This also complements the digital operating model initiatives, where knowledge
is centralized and decisions are not made based on spreadsheets and scattered data (Bose
& Gupta, 2019, p. 13; Detzler et al., 2020). The second supporting question was: what is
the optimal application integration architecture to support container logistics growth? The
ideal process was described in this thesis, and it was done based on the findings from the
interviews and various projects workshops. Appendix 4 is visualizing the suggested
automatic and manual communication between applications. However, this thesis can
only propose a solution model to follow, but as such the most optimal application
integration architecture can be discovered only after various development cycles. The last
supporting question is as follows: how to align diverse targets of the internal projects to
achieve a standardized model for container process management? As a principle, the
strategy drives the initiatives and goals of the projects. Here, the project management
organization (PMO) has an important role in supporting projects so that they are able to
align objectives and development actions clearly between each project. Meaning that
project scope is presented and evaluated transparently across organizations. Projects
should also establish direct communication channels between each other so that
continuous alignment is possible to perform. When the goal, scope, and responsibilities
of the projects are clear, the development actions can be taken forward by the most
suitable project team.

CONCLUCION

Business process management theory addresses that BPM tries to understand and manage
people, information, and technology dimensions (Reijers, 2021, p. 1). Moreover, BPM
involves organizational management, core value-creating processes, and functions such
as IT management. These together define the operational and organizational structure of
a company (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 331). As a theoretical implication, the thesis discovered
that the integrated BPM framework is a tool that can be utilized when the aim is to
optimize and develop a process. When applying the integrated BPM framework, the
organization can use it as a guideline to ensure that elements of successful business
process development exist. In terms of contextual factors, by using the framework can
help the organization to identify the core actors needed to drive the process development
actions. These are the business process management enablers and are needed to increase
the understanding of which direction process should be developed and who should be
involved (Malinova & Mendling, 2018, p. 12). In conclusion, the integrated BPM
framework can support an organization in identifying the organizational components to
drive the change and key resources needed for the work. In addition, it can reveal a lack
of some areas of the BPM framework that can cause a pitfall when implementing changes
and improvements to the process. However, the integrated BPM framework does not
define specific tools to identify and analyze the process, meaning that the framework
needs to be complemented with other more concrete analyzing tools. BPM is linked
closely to concepts such as quality management and management systems, and it is based
on frameworks like total quality management (TQM), business process reengineering
(BPR), Lean, and Six Sigma. (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 332). The tools used in this thesis
were obtained from Lean methodology, and complemented well the integrated BPM
framework in the analysis phase. However, due to a lack of comparison of the existing
tools, it cannot be stated that Lean tools are the ideal choice to be used with an integrated
BPM framework.
Technology in supply chain optimization plays an essential role and thus can offer
significant support in the development of material flows (Liotine & Pagano, 2020, p. 183).
When the ideal To-Be process was modeled it followed the principles of the digital
78

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

operating model concept where decisions are not based on spreadsheets or scattered data
but the decision-making is driven by holistic data retrieved from a centralized location,
meaning that in the ideal process, the data handling is not manual, and the process could
proceed to the next phase automatically once the system has received the input (Bose &
Gupta, 2019, p. 13; Detzler et al., 2020). Similarly, as with theory presented in this thesis
related to SCM, container management, BPM, digitalization, and automation states, ideal
To-Be modeling revealed that process could be optimized by integrating different internal
and external actors (Machado et al., 2017, p. 289; Neise, 2018, p. 79; Oke et al., 2016).
In addition, higher digitalization maturity and integrations could support the building of
competitive capabilities such as quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost (Liotine & Pagano,
2020, p. 183). Giacosa et al. (2018), discuss in their study how technology adaptation is
considered an important dimension in an organization’s BPM journey, and how IT-based
tools and new technological innovation can lead to business process optimization when
adding these elements to the organizational processes (p. 1155). Possibly even better
efficiency and effectiveness in business processes are achieved (Giacosa et al., 2018, p.
1155). When ideal To-Be process modeling was completed, the thesis discovered that it
is essential to apply digital tools and develop digital communication between systems to
achieve the ideal process state, where process automation level is higher and process
monitoring is possible in more detailed level by using data analytics.
The most important implications of the thesis for the case company are related to the
detailed E2E process understanding in different locations, and what could be the potential
development roadmap to follow so that the ideal process state could be reached. The AsIs and To-Be process modeling provides a detailed overview of the current state and ideal
process. In addition, process harmonization between locations could realize the benefits
presented in the literature where harmonization pushes forward unified IT systems,
standard interfaces, advanced communication practices, easier knowledge sharing,
performance monitoring such as common key performance indicators (KPIs), and the
ability to outsource process capabilities more easily (Schönreiter, 2018, p. 333).

7.1

Limitations and Future Research

Due to the nature of the case study, some limitations exist in the thesis. The research is
done only inside of one company and results are not directly applicable outside of the
case company. In addition, As-Is multimodal container process went live on 1st of October
in 2020 in two locations, the practical experience regarding how the process is managed
by the different stakeholders and the data gathered by the systems is relatively small.
Moreover, the respondents were selected based on their experience and understanding of
the container process, and the size of this group was rather small. However, their
knowledge and expertise adequately support the overall objective of this thesis.
Some limitations also exist in the data source, as the data gathered regarding multimodalcontainer process performance and used in the thesis to identify the current state of the
process has not been validated officially in the case company. This data is not seen as one
of the official KPIs and reports to follow. Moreover, the container process has variations
that were not taken into account in this thesis and could have impacted the suggested
solution and results. Thus, in the future, more comprehensive research could be done
based on measured data to examine the E2E process performance. In addition, different
tools could be used to evaluate the development needs since in this thesis there was only
a limited set of tools used for the analysis.

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

Step 1: Contract is created by the supply manager in CMS and interfaced with SAP.
Contract approvals are managed under a specific approval process. No changes.
Step 2: Pricing team prices the contract if fixed price. Otherwise, CMS sends updated
prices. No changes.
Step 3: Create a carrier service contract for a longer-term or spot basis. The contract is
interfaced to TMS where logistics planning is done in the new process. Communication
between commercial operations, logistic planning, and back office (BO) teams regarding
service contract information. SAP carrier service and sea freight contracts are created by
the back office in SAP
Step 4: Contract is reviewed and released by the commercial operations (Comm Ops). No
changes.
Step 5: Comm Ops creates nomination and sends the reference to the supplier and the
terminal. A potential point of development is by developing REST API endpoints, that
can be shared with the 3rd party terminals and suppliers, the order information can be
communicated digitally. In addition, nomination creation was seen as one of the pain
points by the commercial operations. In order to ease this manual phase, a considerable
option would be to automate nomination creation based on the data available in the
previous steps. Contract data could be one potential data source. Automation could have
a positive correlation to the nomination lead time which is currently the second-longest
lead time factor.
Step 6: Logistics Planner books carrier for the containers in TMS.
Step 7: Containers are loaded into the vehicle based on the logistics plan.
Step 8: Carrier enters quantities to TMS which sends loading information to SAP and
actualized quantities and time stamps are recorded to the nomination tickets. This
removes the manual step managed by BO where they upload container information to TIS
via CSV. In the To-Be process, TIS is not involved with the container loading information
but containers are followed through SAP Fiori developed solely for this purpose. Fiori
94

would work as a view-only user interface (UI) for the internal container management. In
case of corrections or reversals system to use would be either SAP or TMS.
Step 9: PO is created automatically in SAP when tickets are actualized for individual
containers. BO receives required delivery documents from the supplier to continue the
payment process. The delivery form is filled in the Supplier Portal (SP) by the supplier.
Other delivery documents are uploaded to Google Drive. Invoice is received by email to
the accounts payable common email. Back office checks received the invoice, delivery
form, and matches PO to the invoice. After DF and invoice are approved invoice is
released for the payment process. If DF is not approved it is sent back to the supplier for
correction. Similarly like in step 5, here could be achieved more efficient document
processing times by offering REST API endpoint for the 3rd parties to deliver required
delivery documentation to the case company.
Step 10: BO reviews received documentation such as invoice and delivery form. No
changes.
Step 11: Containers are loaded into the container vessel. TMS receives event information
from the logistics shipment tracking portal which is integrated into TMS. TMS passes
event information to SAP and container movement can be seen in Fiori UI.
Step 12: Container vessel arrives at the container port. TMS receives event information
from the logistics shipment tracking portal which is integrated into TMS. TMS passes
event information to SAP and container movement can be seen in Fiori UI.
Step 13: Carrier picks up the containers and records loaded quantity and times to TMS.
TMS passes event information to SAP and container movement can be seen in Fiori UI.
Optionally REST API could be offered to the carrier to connect with the case company’s
TMS.
Step 14: Comm Ops appoints the inspection for the arrived containers and schedules
terminal operations.

95

J.Narkiniemi: Business Process Optimization of Feedstock Supply Process in Multimodal Container Scenario Utilizing Business Process Management Framework and Lean Methodology

Step 15: The carrier unloads the containers to the terminal premises and enters the time
to TMS. TMS passes event information to SAP and container movement can be seen in
Fiori UI. Optionally REST API could be offered to the carrier to connect with the case
company’s TMS.
Step 16: Terminal Workers carry out the discharge process and enter quantity, date, time,
and other relevant discharge information to their internal TQMS. TQMS sends discharge
transactions to TIS via integration. TIS generates the discharge tickets and sends those to
SAP nomination. Event information is also interfaced with TMS in order to close the
order. Each container is ticketed individually.
Step 17: Supply chain compliance (SCC) reviews DF supply chain data and after approval
allocation data is sent to SAP.
Step 18: In the Allocation portal (AP) SCC allocates criteria. The final step of the
process is automatic shipment closing.
