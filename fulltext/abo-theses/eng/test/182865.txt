Title: How does (National) Culture influence Customer Satisfaction and the Customer’s
Willingness to Recommend a Company to others? A Cross-Country Comparison of Swedish,
Finnish, Norwegian and Danish Customer Feedback
Supervisor: Wilhelm Barner-Rasmussen
Abstract:
Customer satisfaction is a primary focus for an increasing number of companies, as customers
who are highly satisfied with a product or a service provide positive word-of-mouth to others.
Therefore, many companies are tracking both customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction in order
to ensure high levels of customer satisfaction, and thus, increase the number of customer
referrals. As many companies today are operating in a cultural environment that affects their
business on many different levels, it is highly important to acknowledge the cultural aspects in
international business. Previous studies show that people from different cultures are likely to
judge the same service differently based on differences in the perceived quality, and therefore,
companies ought to take cultural differences into consideration when comparing customer
feedback between different markets.
This study examines the influence of culture on customer satisfaction and the customers’
willingness to recommend a company to others, by analysing customer feedback on the
Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian and Danish markets, collected by Company X. The main objective
of the study is to provide a deeper understanding of how cultural differences between Sweden,
Finland, Norway and Denmark influence customer satisfaction, and thus, the potential customer
referrals. This study applies both quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques and the
empirical findings are analysed with the support of Hofstede’s framework of culture.
The results of the quantitative analysis showed that there were differences in customer
satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend the company to others, between the
markets. The Finnish customers were the most likely to recommend Company X to family or
friends, whereas the customer on the Danish market were the most satisfied with the overall
experience. On the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish markets, lack of responsiveness was the
main reason for the dissatisfaction, whereas the main reason for dissatisfaction among the
Finnish customers was Company X’s inability to provoke trust and confidence. Additionally,
empathy in service was the main reason for satisfaction among the customers in Sweden,
Norway and Denmark, whereas the main reasons for satisfaction among the Finnish customers
were responsiveness and reliability in service. Thus, the findings suggest that customers on the
Finnish market judge the quality of a service differently than the customers on the Swedish,
Norwegian and Danish markets.

Introduction

1.1

Background

Companies are constantly seeking ways to improve the performance of their business and
today, customer satisfaction is increasingly acknowledged as a key factor to success
(Kotler & Keller, 2016). According to Kotler and Keller (2016), customer-centred
companies view customer satisfaction both as a target and a marketing strategy. Emerging
technologies allow customers to share their service experiences with others, and customers
who are highly satisfied with a product or a service provide positive word-of-mouth to
others, whereas highly dissatisfied customers are likely to spread negative and
exaggerated word-of-mouth (Schiffman & Wisenblit, 2014).
Customer experience has become a top priority for companies worldwide, as it is
considered to be a key component of long-term corporate success (De Keyser et al., 2015).
Therefore, an increasing number of companies are putting the customers at the heart of
their business and adopting a customer-centred strategy. The purpose of adopting a
customer-centred strategy is to keep meeting and exceeding customer expectations (Cook,
2015). As people tend to perceive products or services according to their own
expectations, a customer who has been told by a friend or family member that a particular
brand or company is trustworthy and customer friendly will most likely also associate that
brand or company with positive attributes (Schiffman & Wisenblit, 2014).
For companies that do not market themselves directly to the end consumers, but instead
offer a service on behalf of another company, maintaining a high level of customer
satisfaction becomes a critical issue. As understanding customers can be seen as a key to
improving customer satisfaction, many companies are actively tracking both customer
satisfaction and dissatisfaction (Kotler & Armstrong, 2008). By constantly measuring how
well the company is meeting the needs of their customers, e.g., by sending out surveys to
the customers, companies are able to obtain valuable information when planning the
strategy for their business (Kotler & Keller, 2016).

As the internationalisation of business has forced more and more companies to expand
their business across their national borders, companies are dealing with customers of
different cultural backgrounds, and therefore, it is highly important to acknowledge the
cultural aspects in international business (Usunier & Lee, 2013). As the majority of
mistakes in international business are caused by a lack of understanding of other countries’
cultural values (Neelankavil & Rai, 2009), the importance of culture cannot be overlooked
by international marketers (Hollensen, 2012). Particularly in companies operating within
the Nordic region, the influence of culture ought to be more strongly emphasised, as
greater attention is often put into highlighting the similarities between the Nordic
countries, instead of examining possible cross-cultural differences between the markets.

1.2

Problem discussion

In order to navigate in today’s global marketplace and to ensure a high level of customer
satisfaction, companies are required to develop a global awareness (Kotler & Keller,
2016). Being globally aware is to be objective (Kotler & Keller, 2016; Ghauri & Cateora,
2014) and requires an ability to be tolerant and respectful towards cultural differences
(Ghauri & Cateora, 2014). Even though people of different cultures can share basic
concepts, a person from Finland and a person from Denmark are likely to view the
concepts from different angles and perspectives, which will also affect the way they
behave and react (Lewis, 2006).
Usunier and Lee (2013) argue that our understanding of different cultures is rather limited,
and therefore, we often rely on stereotypes. For a company that operates within a single
country, understanding consumer behaviour can be seen as a challenge, but for companies
that do business or provide a service in multiple countries, understanding and serving the
needs of the customers is overwhelming (Kotler & Armstrong, 2008). Therefore,
understanding the impact of culture on international business is arguably one of the most
important ways to succeed in the global business environment.
As word-of-mouth has become increasingly important to customers on today’s market and
is often the most important factor in the majority of customers’ purchase of a new product
2

or service (Goodman, 2009), an increasing number of companies are focusing on customer
experience and customer satisfaction as a means to ensure positive reviews and
recommendations. In order to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction, companies
can benefit greatly from listening to the customers, by actively tracking and measuring
customer satisfaction (Kotler & Armstrong, 2008). For companies that use referral
marketing as a way to promote their business, finding ways to improve the consumer
satisfaction ratings becomes an increasingly important issue.
In order to improve customer satisfaction, international companies ought to take culture
into consideration when comparing customer feedback between different countries.
Usunier and Lee (2013) argue that service perceptions and evaluations tend to vary in
different countries, and therefore, international marketers need to be aware of the impact
of culture on service perceptions, as people from different cultures are likely to judge the
same service differently based on differences in the perceived quality (Usunier & Lee,
2013). Understanding the differences (and similarities) that might exist between cultures
and using that knowledge as a tool to develop the business, is therefore seen as a highly
valuable ability in the competitive international marketplace (Kotler & Keller, 2016).
Companies that use customer experience measures as a way of demonstrating the health
and growth potential of their business, are therefore required to gain a deeper
understanding of how cultural differences can affect customer satisfaction and the
customers’ willingness to recommend a service or a product to others.

1.3

Purpose and research questions

The purpose of the thesis is to provide a deeper understanding of the impact of culture on
customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend a company to family
or friends. The main objective is to investigate how cultural differences between Sweden,
Finland, Norway and Denmark influence customer satisfaction, and thus, the potential
customer referrals, which becomes a critical issue for companies that operate across the
Nordic region.

3

To support the objective of the thesis, the following research questions have been
developed:
Q1:

Can differences in customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to
recommend a company to family or friends be detected between Sweden, Finland,
Norway and Denmark?

Q2:

What are the effects of culture on the customers’ willingness to recommend the
company to family or friends?

Q3:

Can cultural differences be detected in the open feedback provided by satisfied
customers and dissatisfied customer?

Although culture has taken an eminent place in marketing during the last 20 years (Usunier
& Lee 2013), and prior research has examined the impact of culture on customer
satisfaction (Tsoukatos & Rand, 2007; Hopkins et al., 2009; Duque & Lado, 2010), as
well as the influence of culture on service quality expectations (Khashkhuu, 2016; Donthu
& Yoo, 1998; Kueh & Ho Voon, 2007), very little research within international marketing
has focused on cultural differences in customer satisfaction or cultural differences in
service quality expectations between the Nordic countries. When comparing cultures, it is
also common for an outsider to view ‘the Nordics’ as one entity (Sataøen, 2021), and
instead of studying possible differences, the similarities between the Nordic countries are
often highlighted. In addition, the Nordic region as a brand has also received an increasing
amount of attention during the past couple of decades (Andersen et al., 2021), which has
further strengthened the representation of the Nordic countries as a highly integrated
region.
In regard to this research gap, this study aims to develop an understanding of how cultural
differences in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark) influence
customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend a company to others,
which is of significant importance for companies operating across the Nordic region in
order to improve the customer service, and thus, ensuring high levels of customer
satisfaction and increasing the number of customer referrals.

Delimitations

This study will focus on examining cultural differences in customer satisfaction and the
customers’ willingness to recommend a company to others, among Sweden, Finland,
Norway and Denmark. The research was conducted by analysing the continuous customer
feedback survey administered by Company X. Company X is an international insurance
company that offers different insurance solutions on behalf of its business partners. The
company has been kept anonymous in the study and will be referred to as Company X.
Thus, the study is limited to Company X’s customers from the Swedish, Finnish,
Norwegian and Danish markets. The survey is distributed by Company X to its customers
as a self-completion questionnaire, after the customers have been provided with a service
by the company. The data used in this thesis are from 2018-2021 and have been
depersonalised in a way that does not allow the individuals, or the company, to be
identified (Bryman & Bell, 2013). Due to GDPR regulations, the age and the gender of
the customers are only available in the data from 2020 onwards.
In order to compare customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend
Company X to others, among the Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian and Danish markets, this
study examines cultural differences on a national level, by using Hofstede’s cultural
dimensions. Hofstede states that his framework of culture only applies to the national level
of analysis (Taras et al., 2009), and thus, when comparing countries on a national level,
only countries can be compared, not individuals (De Mooij, 2015). In the event that no
distinction between country characteristics and individual characteristics are made,
Usunier and Lee (2013) argue that there is a risk of improper stereotyping. Thus, the
empirical findings of this study cannot be used to investigate differences across
individuals.

1.5

Methodology

The data source in this study can be referred to as secondary data, which means that the
data have originally been collected by some other researcher (Bryman & Bellman, 2013)
and for some other purpose (Saunders et al., 2007). As collecting data for a research
project is time consuming, and in some cases, also expensive, using secondary analysis
5

saves both cost and time. A second benefit with secondary analysis is that it creates
opportunities for cross-cultural analysis (Bryman & Bell, 2013; Krishnaswami &
Satyaprasad, 2010), as the data collection from different countries is not only challenging
in terms of cost and time (Saunders et al., 2007), but also due to cultural and language
differences (Bryman & Bell, 2013). Bryman and Bell (2013) argue that the sample size
and geographical coverage needed in order to conduct cross-cultural analysis makes it
nearly impossible for a researcher doing a student project to collect primary data, and
therefore, secondary data enable the study of cultural influence, in regard to customer
satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to make recommendations, between several
countries.
This study has been conducted by using mixed methods research, which is an approach
that combines qualitative and quantitative research components in the same study in order
to answer a particular question or set of questions (Hesse-Biber, 2010). According to
Saunders et al. (2007), mixed methods research is useful if it creates better opportunities
to answer the research questions and enables the researcher to do a better evaluation of
whether the findings of the study can be seen as trustworthy. Due to the large amount of
data (3902 responses), the total number of responses was only used for the quantitative
analysis, whereas a limited number of responses to open-ended questions were
qualitatively analysed, by categorising the responses according to the five dimensions of
service quality: reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy and tangibles. According
to Bryman and Bell (2013), a qualitative approach is widely considered necessary for
taking the views of the people studied, which will provide a deeper understanding of the
influence of culture on satisfaction (and dissatisfaction) and the customers’ willingness to
recommend a company to others.

1.6

Key definitions

Customer Satisfaction
Customer satisfaction is the customer’s perception that his or her expectations have been
met or exceeded (Gerson, 1993). When a product or a service exceeds a customer’s
6

expectations, the customer will be satisfied. If the customer’s expectations are not met,
the customer will be left dissatisfied.
Service Quality
Service quality reflects the customers’ perceptions of the reliability, responsiveness,
assurance, empathy and tangibles (Wilson et al., 2016).
Customer Experience
Customer experience is the customer’s overall perception of the company and is shaped
by the connection that the company makes with customer (Joseph, 2010). Customer
experience can be described as the journeys that the customers undertake when interacting
with the company (Villani, 2018).
Loyalty
Customer loyalty is defined as “a deeply held commitment to rebuy or repatronize a
preferred product or service consistently in the future, despite situational influences and
marketing efforts having the potential to cause switching be-havior” (Oliver 2010: 432).
The concept of loyalty refers to an attitude that has behavioural consequences (Wilburn,
2006).
Word- of- Mouth
Word-of-mouth is made up from communication where satisfied, or unsatisfied,
customers share their experience and opinions about a product or a service with other
people (Schiffman & Wisenblit, 2014). This type of personal communication reach
potential new customers through channels that are not directly controlled by the company
(Kotler & Armstrong, 2008).
Customer Success Metrics
Customer success metrics provide insight into what is happening within the company and
offer guidance to organisations regarding the right decisions to make in order to maintain
high levels of customer satisfaction (Villani, 2018).
7

Net Promoter Score (NPS)
The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a metric that measures customer loyalty by asking
customers the question: “How likely is it that you would recommend the product/service
to a friend or colleague?” (Hayes, 2009). The Net Promoter Score divides the responses
into three groups: Promoters (a rating of 9-10), Passives (7-8) and Detractors (0-6). The
Net Promoter Score is then calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from
the percentage of Promoters (Villani, 2018).
Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)
The Customer Satisfaction Score is a measurement of the customers’ satisfaction towards
a company’s product or service (Villani, 2018). The customers are asked to rate their
satisfaction (between 1 and 5) with the company’s product or service. The CSAT is then
calculated by dividing the satisfied customers (4 and 5) with the number of survey
respondents and multiplying the result with 100 (Qualtrics 2021).
Culture
Culture can be defined in many different ways, but it has been generally agreed that culture
is a group phenomenon that is different from personality or individuality (Taras et al.,
2009). In this thesis, the focus will be on cultural differences on a national level. Hofstede
(2001: 1) defines culture as “collective programming of the mind; it manifests itself not
only in values, but in more superficial ways: in symbols, heroes, and rituals”.

1.7

8

frameworks to study cultural differences across countries are presented and discussed in
terms of suitability for the purpose of the study. In Chapter 4, the chosen method for the
study is described and justified. Following this, the data source used in the study is
thoroughly presented, as well as the data analysis process. Chapter 5 presents the empirical
findings of the study, which will be analysed and discussed with the support of the
theoretical framework in Chapter 6. Chapter 7 concludes the thesis and discusses the
significance of the research findings. In addition, the limitations of the study are reflected
upon, and suggestions for further research are provided. Finally, Chapter 8 consists of a
Swedish summary of the thesis.

Key Elements of Customer-Centricity

The overall aim of this chapter is to provide a deeper understanding of the key concepts
related to the customer-centric approach adopted by companies in order to ensure high
levels of customer satisfaction and recommendations to others. The chapter starts by
defining customer satisfaction, service quality, customer experience and customer loyalty,
and the interaction between the concepts is identified and discussed. In addition, the
concept of word-of-mouth is introduced and its significance for the customers, as well as
the companies, is considered. Following this, different ways of measuring customer
satisfaction are presented, and finally, the purpose and the importance of customer
success metrics are discussed, and the metrics used in this study are described.

2.1

Customer Satisfaction

The word ‘satisfaction’ originates from the Latin words satis, which means ‘enough’ and
facere, which means ‘to make’ (Oliver, 2010). Kotler and Keller (2016: 153) define
satisfaction as “a person’s feelings of pleasure or disappointments that results from
comparing a product or a service’s perceived performance (or outcome) to expectations”.
The word ‘expectation’ is considered a crucial part of the satisfaction process, as the
customer’s expectations have a significant impact on whether the customer will be left
satisfied or not (Güngör, 2007). A satisfied customer is a customer whose needs are met
or exceeded (Gerson, 1993). Customer satisfaction is a key to keeping and growing
consumers, and therefore, many companies strive to not only meet the expectations of the
customers, but rather to create a feeling of excitement and enthusiasm among them (Kotler
& Armstrong, 2008). In case the product or the service provided does not meet the
expectations of the customer, the customer will be left dissatisfied.
According to Kotler and Keller (2016), customer satisfaction is viewed both as a target
and as a marketing strategy among customer-oriented companies. As highly dissatisfied
customers are very likely to spread negative word-of-mouth (Schiffman & Wisenblit,
2014), which can have severe consequences for a company, the delivery of high levels of
customer satisfaction has become a top priority for an increasing number of companies in
10

today’s highly competitive business landscape (Hill & Alexander, 2006). Therefore,
successful marketing companies place the customers at the very top of their organizational
chart, known as the modern customer-oriented organizational chart, whereas more
traditional organizations, who believe that the decision making belong in the top
management, place customers at the bottom of the chart (Kotler & Keller, 2016).

Figure 1. Traditional Organization versus Modern Customer-Oriented Organization Chart
(Kotler & Keller, 2016).

According to Hill and Alexander (2016), the advantages of satisfied customers cannot be
underestimated, as happy customers will repeat purchase, recommend the product or
service to others, and thereby, bring more business to the company. Following the
arguments put forward by Hill and Alexander (2016), Gerson (1993) argues that
satisfaction will create a referral cycle, which means that a satisfied customer will bring
the company more customers, who will then bring more customers and so forth. Thus, an
increasing number of companies actively track customer satisfaction (and dissatisfaction)
(Kotler & Keller, 2016) in order to ensure that the customers will be kept satisfied.
In order to satisfy the customers, companies must meet the customers’ needs (Hill &
Alexander, 2006). By researching the customers’ needs, the benefits and qualities that the
customers expect in a service can be identified (Wilson et al., 2016). According to Hill
11

and Alexander (2006), a significant part of a customer’s satisfaction with a product or a
service is determined before the purchase of the product or consumption of the service,
and therefore, the performance of the product or the service will be judged based on the
customer’s expectations. According to Wilson et al. (2016), the absence of knowledge
regarding customer expectations is a critical contributing factor to dissatisfaction. Thus,
marketers cannot assume that they know what the customers’ needs are (Lancaster &
Massingham, 2017).
The customers’ expectations are shaped by many different factors, such as personal needs
(Elearn, 2009), previous buying experience, public information, advertisement, as well as
friends’ or relatives’ advice (Keller & Kotler 2016). For companies that do not market
themselves to the end consumers, but instead offer a service on behalf of another company,
the impact of recommendations from friends or relatives cannot be overlooked, as it can
strongly influence whether the customers’ expectations of the service will be fulfilled.
Thus, companies need to learn what the customers expect of them in order to keep them
satisfied (Gerson, 1993).
Although customer satisfaction is commonly measured at a particular point in time,
Wilson et al. (2016) argue that satisfaction should be viewed as a dynamic and moving
target that gradually gets influenced by many different factors over time. As customers
consider all aspects of their experience when evaluating their satisfaction (Bolton, 2016),
it is of great importance that companies make sure they understand what their customers
need and expect in order to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction. Consequently, an
increasing number of companies are putting the customers at the heart of their business
and adopt a customer-centred strategy in order to keep meeting and exceeding customer
expectations (Cook, 2015).

2.2

Service Quality

According to Kotler & Keller (2016), customer satisfaction is also dependent on the
quality of the product or the service. Customer satisfaction and quality is closely related,
as higher levels of quality will result in higher levels of customer satisfaction (Kotler &
12

Keller, 2016). However, customer satisfaction refers to the emotional reaction to a service,
and thus, is more of a short-term measure, whereas service quality is closely linked with
expectations, and thus, is something that develops gradually (Hernon et al., 1999). Wilson
et al. (2016) argue that when customers are provided with pure services (e.g. financial
services), quality is the dominant factor in the customers’ evaluations of the service.
Customers judge the quality of a service based on multiple factors that are relevant to the
situation (Wilson et al., 2016). According to Usunier and Lee (2013), customers judge the
performance of a service based on their expectations of the service, which tend to vary
between individuals, and therefore, all customers cannot be treated in the same way
(Donthu & Yoo, 1998).
According to Usunier and Lee (2013), service perceptions and evaluations also tend to
vary in different countries. Previous studies (Khashkhuu, 2016; Donthu & Yoo, 1998;
Kueh & Ho Voon, 2007) have examined the influence of culture on service quality
expectations. Khashkhuu (2016) tested hypotheses regarding national culture values to
service quality perceptions and found that there was a positive relationship between
individualism and responsiveness, which suggests that those from individualistic societies
expect others to be efficient and also require a high level of service quality. The findings
of the study by Donthu & Yoo (1998) showed that those from low uncertainty avoidance
societies had high service quality expectations, and thus, expect responsiveness and
reliability in service. Thus, international marketers need to be aware of the impact of
culture on service perceptions, as people from different cultures are likely to judge the
same service differently based on differences in the perceived quality (Usunier & Lee,
2013).
The SERVQUAL model is the most frequently used framework to evaluate service
quality, which measures the gap between customer expectations and their evaluation of
the performance of the service (Usunier & Lee, 2013). According to Donthu and Yoo
(1998), it is necessary to know the level of expectations among the customers in order to
deliver a service that will satisfy the customers. Research has identified five specific

13

dimensions of service quality that apply to multiple service contexts: reliability,
responsiveness, assurance, empathy and tangibles (Wilson et al, 2016).
Reliability: According to Wilson et al. (2016), reliability is regarded as the most
important determinant of customers’ perceptions of service quality and refers to
the service provider’s ability to deliver the service accurately and dependably, e.g.
delivering the service in time (Kotler & Keller, 2016). In other words, reliability
means that the company keeps its promises, e.g., in terms of delivery of the service,
problem resolution and pricing (Wilson et al., 2016).
Responsiveness: Responsiveness refers to the company’s willingness to help
customers and deliver the service in a timely manner (Kotler & Keller, 2016).
According to Wilson et al. (2016), the process of service delivery and the handling
of requests must be approached from the customers’ point of view in order to
ensure that the customers’ requirements, e.g., in regard to speed and promptness
of the service, will be met.
Assurance: Assurance refers to the knowledge and courtesy of the company’s
employees, as well as their ability to provoke trust and confidence (Wilson et al.,
2016). According to Wilson et al. (2016), this dimension is particularly important
for services that the customers perceive as high risk, e.g. insurance services.
Empathy: Empathy refers to the ability of providing caring, personalised attention
to the customers (Kotler & Keller, 2016), which will ensure that the customers feel
like they are unique and special (Wilson et al., 2016).
Tangibles: Tangibles are defined as the appearance of the company’s physical
facilities, e.g. the company’s buildings and equipment, or website and mobile
phone apps (Wilson et al., 2016). For instance, a customer can judge a company’s
service based on the availability of modern equipment (Kotler & Keller, 2016).

2.3
Customer Experience
Customer experience is the customer’s individual interactions with a company, product or
service (Peppers et al., 2016) and is shaped by everything that the company does (Villani,
2018). Every interaction that a customer has with a company is an experience (Peppers et
al., 2016), but according to Peppers et al. (2016), each customer experience is not to be
seen as a remote event, but rather as something that is shaped throughout time. Therefore,
customer experience can be described as a dynamic and continuous process (Bolton,
2016). Rapid advances in new technologies have resulted in customers that are better
informed than ever and as a consequence, creating happiness and excitement among the
customers has never been more important than today (Villani, 2018).
In order to ensure a positive customer experience, a company needs to know what the
customers find important at every point of contact with the company the customers
experience (Wilson et al., 2016). According to Peppers et al. (2016), a company needs to
integrate all interaction channels in order to improve the customer experience, as each
interaction can be seen to impact the others. Following the argument put forward by
Peppers et al. (2016), McColl-Kennedy et al. (2019) empathise the importance of viewing
the customer experience as a journey that consists of different touch points. Different
experiences at every touch point, or step, along the journey that the customers undergo
when interacting with the company are likely to then influence the customers’ overall
experience (Wilson et al., 2016).
According to Villani (2018), the focus on customer experience within companies is a
direct response to the emerging awareness regarding the importance of innovation in
services. Creating meaningful customer experience is regarded as a key contributing factor
to competitive advantage and increased customer satisfaction (McColl-Kennedy et al.,
2019). In order to deliver a great customer experience, companies need to implement a
successful customer experience strategy, also known as a CX strategy (Villani, 2018),
which takes an outside-in view of the experience of dealing with a company, a product or
a service (Peppers et al., 2016). According to Villani (2018), a developed CX strategy
includes a constant collection of feedback from the customers, which will provide the
company with insights to improve the customers’ journeys.
15

2.4

Customer Loyalty

Oliver (2010: 432) defines loyalty as “a deeply held commitment to rebuy or repatronize
a preferred product or service consistently in the future, despite situational influences and
marketing efforts having the potential to cause switching be-havior”. Customer
satisfaction can be defined as a feeling, whereas customer loyalty is a behaviour
(Goldstein, 2009). Customer loyalty therefore refers to an attitude that has behavioural
consequences (Wilburn, 2006).
According to Kotler and Armstrong (2008), customers that are delighted will remain loyal
and also talk positively to others about the company. The relationship between satisfaction
and loyalty cannot be overlooked, as a small drop in customer satisfaction can result in a
dramatic decrease in loyalty (Kotler & Armstrong, 2008). According to Usunier and Lee
(2013), the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty tend to be stronger in
individualistic societies, as well as in masculine societies and societies that have a higher
tolerance for uncertainty (these phenomena will be introduced further in Chapter 3).
However, according to Goldstein (2009), creating loyal customers requires more than
satisfaction can measure. In order to measure loyalty, companies need to examine the
satisfaction, willingness to recommend and willingness the repurchase among its
customers (Goldstein, 2009). Allen (2014) identifies three questions that are frequently
asked in customer surveys in order to measure loyalty: “Overall, how satisfied are you
with this product/service?”, “How likely are you to recommend this product/service to a
friend or colleague?” and “How likely are you to purchase this product/service again in
the next three months?”
In addition to the close relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty,
the impact of customer experience on satisfaction and loyalty cannot be overlooked.
Previous studies (Human et al., 2020; Hosseini & Hamelin, 2021) have examined the
relationship between customer experience, customer satisfaction and customer loyalty,
and the findings of the studies show that customer experience directly influences customer
satisfaction and customer loyalty. According to Goldstein (2009), the customers’
willingness to recommend the company to others indicate that they have confidence in the
16

company, whereas the customers’ willingness to repurchase shows their future intensions,
which are often influenced by previous experiences. Thus, in order to gain customer
loyalty, companies cannot solely rely on customer satisfaction, but they also need to
ensure that the customers enjoy a better experience than they had expected (Villani, 2018).
According to Villani (2018), companies ought to make sure they define loyalty correctly,
as customers who stay with the company based solely on convenience are not going to
give an accurate measurement of loyalty. Therefore, instead of examining repurchase
intensions, companies should put more focus on word-of-mouth recommendations
(Villani, 2018). Ensuring that the customers are willing to recommend the company to
family or friends is crucial for companies that do not market themselves to the end
consumers, and therefore, maintaining customer loyalty is of great importance in order to
generate positive word-of-mouth. In Derakhsanfar and Hasanzadeh’s study (2016) of the
relationship between customer experience, customer satisfaction, customer loyalty and
word-of-mouth advertising, the results showed that customer satisfaction and experience
have an impact on loyalty, and in addition, loyalty has an impact on word-of-mouth
advertising. Thus, the value of loyalty in word-of-mouth recommendations cannot not be
ignored.

2.5
Word- of- Mouth
Word-of-Mouth (WOM) is made up from communication where satisfied, or unsatisfied,
customers share their experience and opinions about a product or a service with other
people (Schiffman & Wisenblit, 2014). WOM communication takes place because people
have a social and psychological need to share experiences, both positive and negative,
with others (Goodman, 2009). Silverman (2001) defines WOM as communication about
products or services that takes place in a context where both the people exchanging the
information and the forum where the communication takes place are independent from the
company providing the product or the service. The exchange of information can take place
face to face or via electronic communications and the people exchanging their experiences
with a product or service might know each other on a more personal level or only from
the internet (Schiffman & Wisenblit, 2014).
17

WOM has become increasingly important to customers on today’s market and is often the
most important factor in the majority of customers’ purchase of a new product or service
(Goodman, 2009). People are strongly influenced by what others think and how they
behave (Schiffman & Wisenblit, 2014), and according to Kotler and Keller (2016),
recommendations by friends or relatives remains the strongest influences on the
consumers’ choices regarding products or services. In addition, Silverman (2001) argues
that the power of WOM can be traced to its independent credibility, as people regard
information from someone they know, and who is not directly linked to the company in
question, as more trustworthy.
As pointed out by Kotler and Keller (2006), good marketing is not to be seen as an
accident, but rather treated as an art and a science. Today, good marketing is increasingly
vital and requires careful planning and innovative tools and techniques. Marketing can be
seen to build strong brands and a loyal customer base, which are both significant
contributors to the value of a company (Kotler & Keller, 2006). For many companies that
offer a product or a service on behalf of another company, WOM marketing is therefore
regarded as a crucial tool to spread the word about the product or the service to new
potential customers. Whenever customers receive a service that exceeds their
expectations, the costumers are satisfied and more willing to spread positive WOM about
the service or company to other people. Therefore, customer satisfaction has a significant
impact on the spread of WOM (Shi et al., 2016).
2.6
Monitoring Customer Satisfaction
In order to make sure that the word-of-mouth is positive, a company needs to reach a high
level of customer satisfaction. On today’s market, companies that strive to be one step
ahead of its competitors do not assume they know what their customers want, but instead
ask them directly (Brown, 1996). In order to drive the customer satisfaction, many
companies are actively tracking both customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction (Kotler &
Armstrong 2008). By consistently measuring how well the company is meeting the needs
of the customers, the company is able to get valuable information when planning the
marketing and strategy of their operations. As satisfied customers are likely to share good
word-of-mouth to others about the product or the service provided by the company,
18

regularly measuring customer satisfaction is regarded as the key to customer loyalty
(Kotler & Keller, 2016)
There are many different methods to gather data about the levels of customer satisfaction
(Hernon et al., 2013). By using period surveys, a company has the possibility to track the
customers’ overall satisfaction and to measure their willingness to recommend the
company, product or service to others (Kotler & Keller, 2016). Also, the company is able
to quickly react in case a customer has been dissatisfied with the service or the product,
as a negative experience is likely to results in unfavourable word-of-mouth, which could
have severe consequences for the company’s reputation.
Using questionnaires, that consist of a set of questions presented to the respondents, is by
far the most common method among companies to collect primary data (Kotler & Keller,
2016). By using closed-ended questions, where all the possible answers are laid out to the
respondents, the answers are easy to analyse and to interpret. However, according to
Kotler and Keller (2016), the open-ended questions, where the respondents have the
possibility to provide feedback and answer to questions in free text, can be very useful
when exploring new areas, as the researcher in these circumstances has limited knowledge
of the research topic.
Marketing research methods can be divided into two basic types, quantitative and
qualitative. Whether a company chooses to use a quantitative or a qualitative method, the
main goal of the research is to gain knowledge about the market (Ghauri & Cateora, 2014).
However, according to Brown (1996), soft customer satisfaction data, which refers to open
feedback provided by the customers, is often misleading and incomplete. Therefore, all
organisations would benefit from having both open-ended questions that can be
qualitatively analysed, as well as closed-ended questions that can be used to track overall
ratings from the customers (Brown, 1996) in order to gain a deeper understanding of the
results.

2.7

Customer Success Metrics

In order to develop a powerful customer experience strategy, well-grounded evidence is
crucial and provides insight into what is actually happening within the business (Villani,
2018). Due to the fact that measurement techniques are seen as vital to quality
improvement, an increasing number of companies are measuring the satisfaction levels
among their customers (Gerson, 1993). It is common for businesses to have more data
than they can manage, and therefore, companies struggle to get actionable insights from
the data (Villani, 2018). According to Brown (1996), the key to having a successful set of
metrics is to limit the data into a few key metrics that are linked to the company’s success.
These types of specialised customer success metrics enable companies to understand their
customers and what actions to take in order to improve the customers’ experience journey
(Villani, 2018).

2.7.1

Net Promoter Score (NPS)

Due to its simplicity and strong relationship to company growth potential, the Net
Promoter Score (NPS) has since its first appearance in 2003, become a widely popular
metric among companies to measure the customers’ willingness to recommend a product
or a service to relatives or friends (Kotler & Keller, 2016). By asking the customers a
single loyalty question: “How likely are you to recommend us/the service to a friend
/colleague?” (On a scale from 0 to 10) (Hayes, 2009), the Net Promoter Score quantifies
the difference between satisfied customers (Promoters) and dissatisfied customers
(Detractors). The Promoters (those who score 9 or 10) are the customers that are most
likely to recommend the product or the service to a friend or colleague, whereas the
Detractors (those who score 6 or less) are likely to spread negative word-of-mouth
regarding their experience with the company (Cook, 2015).

20

Figure 3. How to calculate NPS (Wexler et al. 2017)

Frederick F. Reichheld, the creator of NPS, introduced the metric in 2003 as “The Only
Number You Need to Grow”. According to Reichheld (2003), prior to NPS, there was a
strong need to take an entirely new approach to customer surveys, as the typical complex
customer satisfaction surveys that companies were using didn’t provide meaningful or
actionable insights. Although the NPS doesn’t show why customers have responded in a
certain way, the metric can be used to create awareness in the company that further
investigation of what is working and not working within the business is needed (Villani,
2018).
The basic idea behind the Net Promoter Score is that happy customers will share their
experiences they had with the company with family or friends (Villani, 2018). Research
shows that in many industries, there is a strong link between the growth rate of a company
and the number of customers that are Promoters, in other words, very likely to recommend
the company to a friend or a colleague (Reichheld, 2003). According to Reichheld (2003),
companies therefore ought to keep the customer surveys simple, by asking the right
question, which provides data that are easy to act on. Following the argument put forward
by Reichheld (2003), Wilburn (2006) argues that NPS can be particularly valuable in
product categories where word-of-mouth is considered important.
Although the NPS is embraced by a large number of companies around the world (Villani,
2018), as it is viewed as a straightforward way to measure how satisfied a company’s
21

customers have been with their product or service, the NPS has also been criticised for
being too simple (Kotler & Keller, 2016). According to Kotler and Keller (2016), one of
the most common criticisms is that many different combinations of responses actually
leads to the same NPS. In addition, a comparison of the NPS results within a company
that operates across different markets and cultures, adds complexity to the results and
raises questions regarding the potential influence of culture on the customers’ willingness
to recommend the company to others. Therefore, companies that offer services or products
to customers across different nations ought to take cultural differences into consideration
when using NPS as an indicator of future business growth.

2.7.2

Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)

Another widely used customer success metric is the Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT).
CSAT is commonly used in customer opinion surveys and focuses on what and how of
the customer experience (Villani, 2018). CSAT asks customers the question: “On a scale
from 1 to 5 (or 1 to 7), how satisfied were you with the product/service?” or “All in all,
how satisfied or unsatisfied are you with company X?” (Verhoef et al., 2015), where 1=
very dissatisfied/strongly disagree, 2= dissatisfied/disagree, 3= neutral/neither agree nor
disagree, 4= satisfied/agree and 5= very satisfied/strongly agree (Villani, 2018).
This type of rating scales is known as Likert scales and are commonly used in both
structured interviews and self-completion questionnaires about attitudes (Bryman & Bell,
2013). The Likert scale is used to measure the respondents’ level of agreement with a
statement (Hill & Alexander, 2016), or series of statements (Saunders et al., 2007).
Compared to rankings, ratings are considered an easy approach and has widely been used
in cross-cultural research (Taras et al., 2009). CSAT is calculated by dividing the number
of satisfied customers (those who rated 4 or 5) with the total number of survey responses
(Qualtrics, 2021). CSAT expresses the level of customer satisfaction as a percentage
between 0 and 100, where 100 percent equals complete customer satisfaction (Villani,
2018). In general, CSAT is viewed as a very respondent-friendly and straightforward way
of measuring customer satisfaction, as the Likert scale used in this metric is very easy to
understand (Hill & Alexander, 2016).
22

Figure 4. Measuring Customer Satisfaction (Gerson, 1993)

Whether the researcher uses a five-point or a seven-point scale, Gerson (1993) argues that
the scale should always include an odd number, as this will allow the respondents to
respond in a neutral manner, whereas others suggest that it is better to only offer the
respondents four alternatives in order to eliminate the middle numbers (Hill & Alexander,
2016). By only offering even numbers, the respondents are required to take a stand
(Goldstein, 2009). Although there are different opinions regarding the preferred layout of
the rating scales, Villani (2018) argues that the most important thing when using customer
success metrics is to customise the survey so that it meets the researcher’s objectives.

2.8

Summary

In today’s highly competitive business landscape, the delivery of high levels of customer
satisfaction is acknowledged as a key to success. Customer expectations and customer
satisfaction are closely related, as the expectations of a customer have a significant impact
on whether the customer will feel satisfied or not. In order to ensure that the needs and
requirements of the customers are met, satisfaction needs to be constantly measured.
Therefore, many companies place the customers at the very top of their organizational
chart and make measuring customer satisfaction a top priority.
Customer satisfaction and quality is closely related, as higher levels of quality will result
in higher levels of customer satisfaction. Customers judge the performance of a service
based on their expectations of the service, and researchers have identified five specific
23

dimensions of service quality that customers base their judgement on regarding the
performance. The five dimensions of service quality are: reliability, responsiveness,
assurance, empathy and tangibles. People from different cultures are likely to judge the
same service differently based on differences in the perceived quality.
In order to ensure high levels of customer satisfaction, the delivery of exceptional
customer experiences is of significant importance. Companies need to know what the
customers find important at every point of contact with the company in order to ensure
positive customer experiences, and therefore, an increasing number of customer-oriented
companies are implementing a customer experience strategy and actively collect customer
feedback.
Loyalty can be measured by examining customer satisfaction, the customers’ willingness
to recommend and their willingness the repurchase. Previous studies show that customer
experience directly influences customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. In order to
generate positive recommendations, the value of building and maintaining customer
loyalty cannot be overlooked, as a negative customer experience is likely to result in
unfavourable word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth is considered one of the most influential
sources of information transfer by consumers, and according to Kotler and Keller (2016),
recommendations by friends or relatives account for the strongest influences on the
consumers’ choices regarding products or services.
The Net Promoter Score is a widely used customer success metric to measure the
customers’ willingness to recommend a product or a service to relatives or friends,
whereas CSAT is viewed as a very respondent-friendly and straightforward way of
measuring customer satisfaction. Although customer success metrics can be used to create
awareness in the company that further investigation of what is working and not working
within the business is needed, all organizations would benefit from having both openended questions that can be qualitatively analysed, as well as closed-ended questions that
can be used to track overall ratings from the customers, in order to gain a deeper
understanding of the results.

Culture

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a deeper understanding of the concept of culture,
the different sources of culture and ways of measuring cultural differences. In addition,
previous studies on culture are presented and discussed in order to understand cultural
differences across countries, and finally, the theoretical framework for the empirical study
is presented and reflected upon.

3.1

What is culture?

Due to the fact that culture is difficult to accurately measure, culture has remained a rather
complex concept (Imm Ng et al., 2007). The word culture derives from the ancient word
cultera (Barthope et al., 2000), which means “cultivation” and refers to agricultural
activities (Usunier & Lee, 2013). The complexity surrounding the concept has also
resulted in a multitude of definitions of the word (Hollensen, 2012), and although the
concept of culture is centuries old, Taras et al. (2009) state that there is still no commonly
accepted definition of the word. Despite the complexity regarding the definition of culture,
it has been generally agreed that culture is a group phenomenon that is different from
personality or individuality (Taras et al., 2009). De Jong (2009) argues that even though
culture has been defined in many different ways, all definitions can be seen to refer to a
humanly designed phenomenon, which is transmitted from generation to generation.
According to Brady (2011), culture is influenced by everything that affects a society’s
lifestyle and development. In addition, Usunier and Lee (2013) state that culture represents
peoples’ adaptation to reality, which is based on their values, attitudes and behavioural
assumptions. Despite the great number of existing definitions of the word, there are
several common elements that can be found in all of them (Taras et al., 2009). According
to Taras et al. (2009), the notion that culture is a complex multi-level construct is present
in the majority of the definitions. Secondly, culture is a group phenomenon, which is
shared among the individuals within a group or society. In addition, culture is something
that has developed over a long period of time and is considered to be relatively stable
(Taras et al., 2009).
25

According to Schiffman and Wisenblit (2014), it is common to refer to culture as an
invisible hand that influences the behaviour of people of a particular society, rather than
the other way around (Lewis, 2006). Ghauri and Catoeora (2014) state that culture also
influences the priority of needs and the wants people strive to satisfy, as well as the way
they attempt to satisfy them. Therefore, as culture is regarded as a distinct source of
differentiation between international markets (Hollensen, 2012), identifying the impact of
culture on satisfaction is of significant importance for international companies in order to
reach a high level of customer satisfaction across different markets.
In order to understand how culture influence consumer behaviour, some researchers
distinguish between different levels of culture. The first level, the supranational level,
crosses national boundaries and reflects the underlying dimensions of culture that affects
numerous countries, e.g. regional character, racial and religious similarities, or shared
languages. The second level, the national level, reflects the shared values and customs by
nationality. The third level, the group level, reflects the subgroups of people, referred to
as cultural subgroups (Usunier & Lee, 2013), within a country or society (Schiffman &
Wisenblit, 2014).
As pointed out by Usunier and Lee (2013), our understanding of different cultures is often
rather limited, and as a result, we often rely on stereotyped ideas. Although stereotyping
can be dangerous, Lewis (2006) argues that generalizing works as a fair guide when
comparing cultural differences between nations. In addition, Hofstede (2001) argues that
stereotypes can be used to make statistical statements about a group, but not to make
predictions regarding traits of specific individuals. International managers might not have
time or resources to thoroughly analyse a particular culture, and therefore, understanding
the most distinctive cultural differences can provide a meaningful guidance for developing
the company’s strategy (Hollensen, 2012).
In order to understand cultural differences, it is also common among marketers to divide
cultures by nationality, as borders are viewed as natural dividers (Usunier & Lee, 2013).
According to Lewis (2006), it is important to acknowledge the fact that even though
26

culture represents a person’s outlook and world view, it is however not to be labelled as a
strictly national phenomenon. However, Usunier and Lee (2013) argue that regional
differences within countries often are much smaller than international differences. Thus,
national borders can be utilised for international marketing segmentation (Usunier & Lee,
2013).

Figure 5. Sources of Culture (Usunier & Lee, 2013)

According to Taras et al. (2009), culture has generally been a concept studied within
anthropology and archaeology. In these studies, which for the most part have been
qualitative, the focus has been put on the outer layers of culture, e.g. artefacts, traditions
and languages. However, along with the globalisation of business, different models of
culture, as well as different methods of measuring culture, have been presented by
different scholars (Taras et al., 2009). Taras et al. (2009) also state that the growing interest
to study cross- cultural issues has resulted in a shift from qualitative studies to quantitative
research, where the focus is on cultural values and attitudes.
Neelankavil and Rai (2009) state that the generous number of models that have been
presented throughout the years can easily give the impression that culture is something
that can be easily captured and understood. However, Taras et al. (2009) argue that too
27

simplified definitions and measurements of the concept can cause severe issues when
learning about different cultures. According to Lewis (2006), cultural diversity is not
something that will disappear, and due to the globalisation of business there is a growing
awareness in the business world, that when analysing concepts and values, nothing can be
taken for granted. Therefore, the question of how culture should be studied and measured
remains a topic of discussion.

3.2

Hofstede’s Cultural Framework

During the last 20 years, culture has taken a prominent place in marketing (Usunier &
Lee, 2013), where Hofstede’s work on cultural dimensions is the most commonly used
framework to understand cultural differences across countries (De Mooij, 2015). Lewis
(2006) states that no new research on cultural diversity can ignore the concepts presented
by Hofstede, and the dimensions introduced by Hofstede have repeatedly been used by
other researchers (Taras et al., 2009). Hofstede’s cultural framework is built on the
assumption that people from different countries are influenced by distinctive attitudes,
beliefs, customs, morals and ethical standards (Taras et al., 2009). Hofstede (2001: 1)
defines culture as “collective programming of the mind; it manifests itself not only in
values, but in more superficial ways: in symbols, heroes, and rituals”.
Despite the fact that the concept of culture is centuries old, Taras et al. (2009) argue that
it was not until the publication of Hofstede’s ‘Culture’s Consequences’, that a growing
interest to identify the concept could be seen to take place (Taras et al., 2009). Hofstede
(2001) identifies three levels of human mental programming: the individual level, which
is specific to every individual, the collective level, which is shared by some people but
not all, and the universal level, which is shared by nearly all humans. The majority of
peoples’ mental programming is learned at the collective level, whereas the mental
program is entirely, or partly, inherited on the individual and the universal level (Hofstede,
2001).

28

Figure 7. Three Levels of Human Mental Programming (Hofstede, 2001)

By collecting data from around 116000 employees in 40 countries (later expanded to more
than 50 countries), Hofstede analysed employee attitudes at the international corporation
IBM (Minkov & Kaasa, 2021) around 1968 and 1972 (Hofstede, 2001). Hofstede’s
cultural framework has influenced the majority of studies on cultural differences and
according to Taras et al. (2009), the popularity of Hofstede’s study is due to its large
sampling covering multiple countries and the fact that the relatively advanced research
design and use of statistical analysis tools was seen as ground-breaking.
Bases on his study, Hofstede developed a framework of national cultures, which is based
on the idea that people from different countries perceive and interpret the world around
them in different ways (Hollensen, 2012). According to Hofstede (2001), the dimensions
represent basic issues faced by all societies, but for which the societies find different
solutions to. Hofstede’s framework originally consisted of four dimensions: power
distance, collectivism versus individualism, femininity versus masculinity and uncertainty
avoidance. After doing some additional research in the eastern cultures, Hofstede added a
fifth dimension to the framework, the long-term versus short-term orientation (Usunier &
Lee, 2013). In addition, based on Minkov Kaasa’s items from the World Values Survey,
indulgence versus restraint was added as a sixth dimension to the framework (Hofstede,
2011).

29

Collectivism versus Individualism
The individualism versus collectivism dimension describes the relationship between the
individual and the collectivity that exists in a society (Hofstede, 2001). In individualistic
societies, people are expected to look after themselves, whereas people from collectivistic
societies put more value on group welfare (Blodgett et al., 2008). According to Hofstede
(2001), the relationship between the individual and the collectivity in human society is
closely linked with societal norms, meaning the values of a substantial portion of the
population in a society. Therefore, peoples’ mental programming can be seen to be
affected by this dimension of culture (Hofstede, 2001).
Uncertainty avoidance
The uncertainty avoidance dimension measures the extent to which people feel
uncomfortable or threatened by uncertain or unfamiliar situations. A society that scores
high on the uncertainty avoidance scale can be seen to value security (Blodgett et al.,
2008) and the people from such societies prefer formal rules and structure in their lives
(Hollensen, 2012), and therefore feel a need to control situations (Youngdahl et al., 2003).
People from societies with low uncertainty avoidance are more confident with uncertainty,
and therefore, more risk tolerant (Blodgett et al., 2008),
Power distance
Power distance refers to the way power is distributed in the society (Hollensen, 2012),
meaning how a society handles human inequality (Hofstede, 2001). The power distance
dimension measures to what degree persons within a society accept inequality in power,
which means that countries that are recognized as high power distance societies see the
unequal power distribution in the society as normal, whereas low power distance societies
want to equalise the distribution of power (Okpara, 2014).
Femininity versus masculinity
The femininity versus masculinity dimension refers to values that are regarded important
in a society, meaning that valuing money and achievements in general can be seen as
positive characteristics in a masculine society, whereas a feminine society tend to put more
30

emphasis on establishing relationships and the general quality of life (Minkov & Kaasa,
2021). In feminine cultures, people are more motivated by qualitative goals (Hollensen,
2012) and there is an openness about admitting and sharing problems (Usunier & Lee,
2013).
Long-term versus short-term orientation
The long-term versus short-term orientation dimension, originally named Confucian
Work Dynamism (Hofstede, 2011), resulted from Hofstede’s collaboration with Michael
Bond from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Minkov & Hofstede, 2011) in a study
of 23 countries (Hollensen, 2012). The long-term versus short-term orientation dimension
measures the way people in a society display a pragmatic future-oriented perspective,
rather than a short-term point of view (Hollensen, 2012). Long-term oriented societies
define a good person as someone who adapts to the circumstances, whereas short-term
oriented societies value personal steadiness and stability (Hofstede, 2011).
Indulgence versus restraint
The sixth dimension, indulgence versus restraint, was the last dimension added to
Hofstede’s model (Hofstede, 2011) and was based on the work of the Michael Minkov
and the World Values Survey (Usunier & Lee, 2013). The indulgence versus restraint
dimension is referred to as the perception of life control and importance of leisure in the
individual’s life (Minkov & Hofstede, 2011). Indulgent societies value the satisfaction of
basic and natural human desires related to enjoying life and having fun, whereas restraint
societies tend to control gratification of such desires with strict social norms (Hofstede,
2011).
By the support of Geert Hofstede, Hofstede Insights was founded in 1985, with the goal
of providing solutions to intercultural and organisational culture challenges, by utilising
their frameworks that are inspired by Hofstede’s work on culture (Businesswire, 2021).
On their website, Hofstede Insights offers a wide range of tools and training programmes
in order to deepen the understanding of the current cultural environment, based on
Hofstede’s cultural framework. One of the tools offered on the website, named the ‘6-D
31

Model’, allows the user to compare countries based on Hofstede’s six dimensions of
culture, which are: power distance, individualism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance,
long term orientation and indulgence. The countries are compared on the basis of their
scores (between 1 and 100), for each dimension (Hofstede, 2001).

Figure 8. Country Comparison (Hofstede Insights, 2021)

Although the Nordic countries are commonly viewed as one entity (Sataøen, 2021) and
more focus is put on highlighting the similarities rather than analysing the possible
differences, the comparison of Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark, based on
Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, imply that there are cultural differences between the
countries. Therefore, although the Nordic countries have much in common, labelling the
countries as one common culture could generate issues for international marketers due to
the cross-cultural differences identified by Hofstede’s framework.
Although the approach of using national level data for cross-cultural comparison has been
subject to criticism, as it does not pay attention to differences within nations, international
marketing more than often works with national level data (De Mooij, 2015), as borders
are considered easily definable (Usunier & Lee, 2013). According to Usunier and Lee
(2013), national culture is built on the assumption that there is within-country
homogeneity, as well as differences between countries, and according to Steenkamp
(2001), cultures can justifiably be studied at the national level in case there are some
meaningful degree of similarities within a country and differences between the countries.
32

In addition, the national level is useful for international market researchers who aim to get
a deeper understanding of, e.g. differences in usage, brand preferences and motives, which
are not captured by differences in demographic characteristics, such as ethnicity and
income (De Mooij, 2015).

3.3

Alternatives to Hofstede’s Framework

One of the earlier attempts to measure culture was done by Edward T. Hall. Hall
introduced the concept of high and low context cultures as a way of understanding cultural
differences, which was one of the few models that did not place focus on values as the
main component of culture (Taras et al., 2009). Hall’s theory is based on the idea that
people from different cultures communicate in different ways. In high-context cultures,
communication heavily relies on the context and the use of non-verbal elements, whereas
low-context cultures put more emphasis on words in communication (Hollensen, 2012).
According to Taras et al. (2009), Hall’s model has only remained a theory, as no largescale empirical cross-cultural study has been done in order to classify the existing cultures
according to the high-low context dimension.
According to Taras et al. (2009), the lack of alternative frameworks has also contributed
to the continuous popularity of Hofstede’s cultural value framework. However, although
Hofstede’s model has been receiving far more praise than criticism (Minkov & Kaasa,
2021), Hofstede’s framework has also generated controversies (Minkov & Hofstede,
2011). The results of Hofstede’s study have been discussed and questioned (Ghauri &
Cateora, 2014), largely due to the fact that the study is considered outdated, but also due
to the sampling method used in the study, which is poorly understood (De Mooij, 2015).
Due to a growing interest among scholars to create their own way of measuring culture
(Minkov & Kaasa, 2021), a number of alternative approaches to study culture, as well as
attempts to replicate Hofstede, have been presented and also gained both recognition and
popularity (Taras et al., 2009).
Despite the increasing number of alternative models to measure culture, very few models
without any influence of Hofstede’s work have been introduced (Taras et al., 2009).
33

Schwartz followed the steps of Hofstede and focused on values when measuring cultures,
although both on individual and culture-level, which resulted in ten value types at
individual level and seven value types at culture-level (De Mooij, 2015). Although both
Hofstede and Schwartz used large scale multi-country samples in their studies, Hofstede
established his framework from empirical data, whereas Schwartz’s framework is based
on theory (Imm Ng et al., 2007). Nevertheless, Steenkamp (2001) states that Schwartz’s
work on human values is not particularly known within marketing.
The GLOBE project (The Global Leadership and Organizational Behaviour
Effectiveness) with its nine dimensions of culture, was introduced by House et al. as an
improvement to, rather than a replication of, Hofstede’s framework (Minkov & Kaasa,
2021). Although the authors of GLOBE were inspired by the cultural dimensions
introduced by Hofstede, they felt that some of the dimensions did not exactly measure
what Hofstede had implied (Minkov & Hofstede, 2011). According to Alipour (2019),
one distinctive difference between Hofstede’s model and the work by GLOBE, is the
uncertainty avoidance dimension, as the two studies seem to capture different aspects of
avoiding uncertainty. Hofstede’s uncertainty avoidance dimension uses stress and anxiety
as measurements, whereas the GLOBE Project’s dimension put focus on orderliness and
consistency (Alipour, 2019).
Although the frameworks by Hofstede, Schwartz and GLOBE put focus on values as a
measurement of culture, and the models share similar dimensions, the purpose and
sampling, as well as questions asked, vary between the frameworks (De Mooij, 2015).
Despite the differences in terms of intentions and choice of methods between the studies,
the researchers all found larger cultural differences between countries than within
countries, which according to Imm Ng et al. (2007) suggests that the models could be used
to compare countries. However, De Mooij (2015) states that not all dimensions contribute
equally to understanding cultural differences in consumer behaviour and marketing, and
the more recent cultural frameworks have not provided significant improvements
compared with Hofstede’s original framework. Thus, Hofstede’s framework is considered

34

a cornerstone for cross-cultural research (Minkov & Hofstede, 2011) and has remained
the most commonly used framework within the field of marketing (Usunier & Lee, 2013).

3.4

Summary and Theoretical Framework

Culture is seen as a distinct source of differentiation between international markets, and
therefore, the impact of culture on satisfaction and willingness to recommend is a critical
issue for international companies in order to ensure high levels of customer satisfaction
and customer referrals. As a result, the question of how culture should be studied and
measured remains a topic of discussion. Hofstede’s work on cultural dimensions is the
most commonly used framework to understand cultural differences. Hofstede’s
framework of national cultures consists of six dimensions: power distance, collectivism
versus individualism, femininity versus masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term
versus short-term orientation and indulgence versus restraint.
However, Hofstede’s approach has been widely discussed and questioned. The majority
of criticism concerns Hofstede’s methodology, as well as the fact that the survey findings
are considered out-dated. Despite the criticism regarding Hofstede’s work, many
researchers are following the steps of Hofstede, which has resulted in many attempts of
replication and improvements to Hofstede’s original work, such as Schwartz’s work on
human values, as well as GLOBE’s nine dimensions. However, in comparison with
Hofstede’s work, the more recent studies have not provided significant improvements, and
therefore, Hofstede’s framework has remained a cornerstone for cross-cultural research
and the most commonly applied framework within the field of marketing.
National level data are regularly used within international marketing, and it is considered
an accurate approach as long as there is some meaningful degree of similarities within a
country and differences between the countries. Due to a lack of significant differences in
the communication style of people from Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark, Hall’s
framework, which puts the Scandinavian countries at the same level on the scale regarding
high and low context societies, the research questions proposed in this thesis are not likely

35

to be answered by using Hall’s framework when analysing the customer feedback in
Company X.
Understanding the most distinctive cultural differences can provide a meaningful guidance
for developing a company’s strategy. Therefore, generalizing can work as a fair guide
when comparing cultural differences between nations. Due to the fact that Hofstede’s
dimensions of culture were established at national level, Hofstede’s framework can be
used to examine and analyse cultural differences between the Sweden, Finland, Norway
and Denmark, in terms of customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to
recommend a service to others.

Methodology

The following chapter presents and justifies the chosen research design and method used
in this study. The chapter also describes the data source and explains how the data have
been analysed in order to answer the research questions. In addition, the reliability and
validity of the research are reviewed. Finally, the ethical considerations in the thesis are
identified and discussed.

4.1

Research Design

The purpose of this study is to provide a deeper understanding of cultural differences in
customer satisfaction and how culture impacts the customers’ willingness to recommend
a company to family or friends. In order to understand the impact of culture on customer
satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend a company to others, customer
feedback in Company X from the Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian and Danish markets is
analysed. When choosing the research method for a study, the importance of thinking
about the research project in terms of the objective of the study ought to be highlighted
(Saunders et al., 2007). The choice of research strategy, design and method also has to be
in line with the research question being investigated. As data collection can be seen as a
key point in the research project (Bryman & Bell, 2013), the choice of method should be
based on the most effective way of meeting the research objectives (Saunders et al., 2007).
Research methods are associated with different kinds of research designs, which provides
the framework for the collection and analysis of the data. The research design can be seen
as the general plan for the research (Saunders et al., 2007). As cultural differences between
four nations (Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark) are examined, this study can be
defined as cross-cultural research, which entails a collection and analysis of data from two
or more nations (Bryman & Bell, 2013). According to Usunier and Lee (2013), differences
in cultural assumptions complicate both the questions the researcher needs to ask, and the
methods needed, but also the researcher’s interpretation of the answers. However, if wellplanned, Usunier and Lee (2013) state that cross-cultural market research can be very
insightful.
37

4.2

Methodology Selection

In business research, the terms quantitative and qualitative are widely used to separate
data collection techniques and data analysis methods (Saunders et al., 2007). The
quantitative approach used to be the most popular strategy for conducting business
research, until the influence of qualitative strategy started increasing at the end of the
1980’s (Bryman & Bell, 2013). Quantitative research focuses on numerical data, whereas
the focus in qualitative research lies on non-numerical data (Saunders et al. 2007),
meaning that qualitative research usually puts emphasis on words rather than
quantification when collecting and analysing data (Bryman & Bell 2013).
In quantitative research, the respondents are asked to answer to close-ended questions,
e.g. with ‘yes’ or ‘no’ (Ghauri & Cateora, 2014) or to rate their level of agreement to a
particular statement, by choosing a number on a five-point scale (or seven-point scale)
known as the Likert scale (Bryman & Bell, 2013). Before quantitative data have been
processed and analysed, Saunders et al. (2009) state that the numbers do not provide much
meaning to anybody. Therefore, by using quantitative techniques, such as graphs and
charts, the data can be transformed into information that can be used to answer the research
objectives and questions (Saunders et al., 2007). According to Bryman and Bell (2013),
there are a number of advantages with a measurement device in quantitative research.
Firstly, measurement allows the researcher to identify fine differences between people or
cases, which can be challenging to detect otherwise. Secondly, a measurement device
gives the researcher a compatible instrument for assessing differences (Bryman & Bell,
2013).
Despite the many advantages of quantitative research, which enables the questions of
‘how often’ and ‘how many’ of the studied phenomenon to be answered (Malina et al.,
2011), Bryman & Bell (2013) state that quantitative research has been subjected to many
criticisms by qualitative researchers. According to qualitative purists, time- and contextfree generalizations favoured by advocates of quantitative researchers are neither
preferable, nor possible, but instead they highlight the need for the researcher to stay
emotionally attached to the objects of the study (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004). In
38

addition, Bryman and Bell (2013) state that most of the criticism is based on a view that a
natural-science approach is not appropriate for studying the social world.
In qualitative research, the theory is commonly viewed as something that emerges out of
the research (Bryman & Bell, 2013), and the analysis in qualitative research is conducted
through the use of conceptualisation (Saunders et al., 2007). In contrast to the objective
approach taken in quantitative research, qualitative research puts emphasis on the meaning
from the individual’s point of view (Bryman & Bell, 2013), which is expressed through
words (Saunders et al., 2007). In qualitative research, the researcher often establishes a
close relationship with the people studied and according to Bryman and Bell (2013), the
subjective nature of qualitative research is widely criticised by quantitative researchers.
Despite the strengths and weaknesses of the methods, Johnson & Onwuegbuzie (2004)
argue that both quantitative and qualitative research are important and useful.
As many researchers find it helpful to distinguish between quantitative and qualitative
research, there is a risk that the differences between them are exaggerated (Bryman &
Bell, 2013). Although there are several acknowledged differences between quantitative
and qualitative research, there are also some similarities between these two methods that
are not always clearly highlighted. Both quantitative and qualitative researchers use
empirical observations in order to answer the research questions of their studies. In
addition, when conducting research, both methodologies aim to describe the data,
establish explanatory arguments from the data, as well as analysing the reasons for the
outcome (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004).
Along with qualitative and quantitative research, mixed methods research, also known as
mixed research, is increasingly recognised as the third major research approach (Johnson
et al., 2007; Bryman & Bell, 2013). The mixed methods research design refers to research
that combines or mixes qualitative and quantitative research in a single study to
understand the research problem (Bryman & Bell, 2013). The ultimate goal of mixed
research is however not to replace the qualitative or the quantitative approach, but rather
to take the best qualities from both approaches and using them together in a single study
(Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004) in order to create a stronger research outcome (Malina
39

et al., 2011). According to Bryman and Bell (2013), the mixed methods research approach
is suitable for studies where the researcher cannot rely on a qualitative or a quantitative
method alone. Following the argument put forward by Bryman and Bell (2013), Saunders
et al. (2007) argue that multiple methods can provide better opportunities to answer
research questions and to evaluate to what degree the results can be trusted and
conclusions made. In addition, Johnson and Onwuegbuzie (2004) state that mixed
methods research is a creative form of research, as the use of both quantitative and
qualitative research can initiate new modes of thinking, as well as a fuller picture and
deeper understanding of the results (Johnson et al., 2007). A mix of quantitative and
qualitative methods can therefore be useful for obtaining new empirical insights (Malina
et al., 2011).
Mixed methods are divided into two types: mixed methods research and mixed model
research (Saunders et al., 2007). Although both types refer to the usage of quantitative and
qualitative methods, mixed methods research employs both methods at the same time or
one after the other, but does not combine them (Malina et al., 2011; Saunders et al., 2007),
whereas in mixed models research, the two methods are combined, which means that the
quantitative data can be analysed qualitatively and vice versa (Saunders et al., 2007).
According to Johnson and Onwuegbuzie (2004), the number of ways studies can mix and
combine methods have opened doors for exciting future research.
According to Saunders et al. (2007), the relationship between the data collection technique
and the empirical findings cannot be overlooked, as the chosen techniques and procedures
used will impact the results of the study. Due to the fact that all techniques and procedures
will have different effects, Saunders et al. (2007) state that using mixed methods could
cancel out the ‘method effect’, which could help the researcher to understand and confirm
the findings of the study. According to Bryman and Bell (2013), mixed methods research
can offer great potential, as it might provide a better understanding of the phenomenon
studied, as well as enhance the confidence in the empirical findings. As the purpose of
this study is to identify and analyse cultural differences in customer satisfaction and the
customers’ willingness to recommend the company to others, an analysis of both
40

quantitative and qualitative data can provide a deeper understanding of the research
questions, as a quantitative data analysis will help to draw general conclusions, whereas a
qualitative data analysis will support the quantitative findings by addressing the questions
of ‘how’ and ‘why’ (Malina et al., 2001).

4.3

Company

This study analyses customer feedback from the Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian and Danish
markets, which is collected on a continuous basis by an international insurance company.
The company is kept anonymous in the study and will be referred to as Company X. On
behalf of its business partners, Company X offers different types of insurance solutions
for the end consumers worldwide. In this study, the customer feedback analysed is
provided by customers from Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark for the service they
have received by Company X. The services provided by Company X are concerning
relatively large loss claims.

4.4

Data Source

The data used in this study can be referred to as secondary data, which means that the data
have originally been collected by some other researcher (Bryman & Bellman, 2013) and
for some other purpose (Saunders et al., 2007). Secondary data can either refer to
published or unpublished data (Sontakki, 2009). The data used in this study have been
collected by Company X in 2018-2021. The data have originally been collected for a
customer experience management purpose and the data have been used to measure
customer satisfaction and customer experience scores across markets. Therefore, the data
used in this study is referred to as survey-based secondary data (Saunders et al., 2007).
Although secondary data can be diverse and consist of different types of materials, there
are some common characteristics that define the data. One feature of secondary data is
that they are readily available and does not require the researcher to go through the process
of collecting them. Another common feature is that the lack of control, which means that
the form and content of the sources are shaped by somebody else and the researcher cannot
41

affect the data collecting process or the classification of data (Krishnaswami &
Satyaprasad, 2010).
Due to the fact that the data were originally not collected to meet the objectives of the
study, there is a risk that the data are not appropriate to answer the research questions of
the study (Saunders et al., 2007). In addition, although the use of secondary data can save
a lot of time in terms of the collection process, the researcher should not underestimate
the time required to get familiar with the data, as it originally were administered and
collected by somebody else (Bryman & Bell, 2013). However, according to Krishnaswami
and Satyaprasad (2010), a researcher who is flexible and imaginative could still use the
data by reformulating the research question, even if the available data does not exactly
meet the specific needs of the researcher.
There are however many reasons why secondary analysis should be considered as an
interesting alternative to collecting primary data in a research project, and according to
Bryman & Bell (2013), secondary analysis is not only suitable for students that conduct
research project as a part of their graduation, but could as well offer many advantages for
all business researchers. As collecting data for a research project is time consuming, and
in some cases, also expensive, using secondary analysis saves both cost and time. Another
benefit with secondary analysis is that it creates opportunities for cross-cultural analysis
(Bryman & Bell, 2013; Krishnaswami & Satyaprasad, 2010), as the data collection from
different countries is not only challenging in terms of cost and time (Saunders et al., 2007),
but also due to cultural and language differences (Bryman & Bell, 2013). Thus, the use of
secondary analysis is a justified method for this study, where cultural differences between
several markets are analysed.

4.4.1

Self-completion questionnaire

Questionnaires is one of the most widely used methods to collect data within the survey
strategy (Krishnaswami & Satyaprasad, 2010). By asking each person to respond to the
same set of questions, the researcher is able to efficiently collect responses from a large
sample before conducting a quantitative analysis (Saunders et al., 2007; Bryman & Bell,
42

2013). With self-completion questionnaires, also sometimes referred to as selfadministered questionnaires, the respondents read and answer the questions in the
questionnaire themselves (Bryman & Bellman, 2013). Self-completion questionnaires can
be administered electronically using the internet or intranet, through post or mail, or by
handing them out to the respondents and collecting those back after the respondents have
completed the questionnaires (Saunders et al., 2007).
Due to the fact that there is no interviewer present in the administration of the selfcompletion questionnaires, the layout for the questionnaire is of significant importance
for the outcome of the research (Bryman & Bell, 2013). According to Saunders et al.
(2007), producing a good questionnaire is not an easy task, as the researcher has to ensure
that it collects the exact data that the research questions and objectives require. Bryman
& Bell (2013) state that with postal questionnaires, there is a much greater risk of missing
data and issues with low response rates, as the respondents can easily skip a question, or
ignore the whole questionnaire, in case the person view it as irrelevant or boring.
Therefore, it is common for researchers who use postal or mail questionnaires as a data
collection method to employ a mixed methods research approach in order to increase the
validity of their study (Bryman & Bell, 2013).
The data source used in this study is a questionnaire that is distributed to the customers by
Company X on a continuous basis. The questionnaire is distributed to the customers per
email, after the customers have received a service provided by Company X. The
questionnaire is sent out in the local language to the customers on each market. In total,
the questionnaire has been distributed to 30168 customers on the Swedish, Finnish,
Norwegian and Danish markets in 2018-2021. The questionnaire consists of thirty-one
questions (see Appendix 1). Three of the questions in the questionnaire use a rating scale,
where the customers are asked to rate their willingness to recommend the company to
family or friends on a scale from 0-10 (Question 1), as well as their overall claims
experience (Question 5) and their satisfaction regarding their interactions with the staff on
a scale from 1-5 (Question 13). Nine questions in the questionnaire are open-ended

43

questions. In sixteen questions, the respondents are asked to reply with either ‘Yes’ or
‘No’, and in the remaining three questions, the answer options are fixed.
Due to the fact that the data were not originally collected to answer the research questions
of this study, all questions in the questionnaire are not relevant in order to meet the
objectives of the study. Therefore, in order to quantitatively analyse cultural differences
in customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend the company to
family or friends, the total number of responses to the following questions in the
questionnaire have been analysed:
- How likely would you be to recommend Company X to family or friends?
- Thinking about your overall claims experience, what star rating would you give
us? 1 is the lowest rating and 5 is the highest rating.
As answers to open-ended questions for large-scale questionnaire surveys are very time
consuming to code (Saunders et al., 2007), the number of responses to the open-ended
questions that are analysed in the study have been limited to 100 responses per market.
Due to the fact that there were 50 responses in total by satisfied customers on the Danish
market, 50 responses by satisfied customers and 50 responses by dissatisfied customers
have been analysed on each market. The responses on the Swedish, Finnish and
Norwegian markets, as well as the responses by the dissatisfied customers on the Danish
market, have been randomly selected.
In order to qualitatively analyse cultural differences in customer satisfaction and the
customers’ willingness to recommend Company X to family or friends, responses to the
following questions in the questionnaire by satisfied and dissatisfied customers on each
market have been analysed:
- What could we do to improve your rating on likelihood to recommend?
- Why did you give us a high rating for likelihood to recommend?

44

4.5

Data analysis

Data analysis refers to a critical examination of the collected data and requires the
researcher’s own judgement and knowledge (Krishnaswami & Satyaprasad, 2010). As the
data used in this study consist of secondary survey data and the verbatim responses already
have been compiled in an Excel file, there was no need to collect data in this study, which
according to Bryman & Bell (2013 is time-consuming, and also limits the amount of time
spent on analysing the data. Thus, as there was no need to collect primary data in this
study, both quantitative and qualitative analysis methods were used in order to provide a
fuller picture and deeper understanding of the empirical findings.
In order for the quantitative data to be useful, the data needs to be analysed and interpreted,
which can be done with the help of quantitative analysis techniques, such as graphs and
charts (Saunders et al., 2007). According to Bryman & Bell (2013), the bar chart or the
pie chart are two of the easiest methods to present quantitative data. Thus, when analysing
the differences in customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend the
company to others, charts were used to show the frequency of occurrence, and thus,
provide an understanding of the data (Saunders et al., 2007). In order to display the number
of Promoters, Passives and Detractors on each market, a percentage component bar chart
was used, which according to Saunders et al. (2007) is one of the best ways to compare
proportions and totals. The quantitative data used in the study are purely descriptive,
which means that the data count the number of occurrences in each category of a variable
(Saunders et al., 2007).
According to Bryman and Bell (2013), there is no straightforward way of analysing
qualitative data. However, Saunders et al. (2007) argue that the qualitative data should be
divided into relevant and meaningful categories, which might be obtained from the data
or from the theoretical framework used in the study. The first step of the qualitative
analysis was to reduce the amount of data, which according to Bryman & Bell (2013) is
necessary in order to interpret the data. As there were 50 responses in total by satisfied
customers on the Danish market, the data analysis was limited to 50 responses by satisfied
customers and 50 responses by dissatisfied customers on each market. In order to analyse
45

the responses by the satisfied and dissatisfied customer, the five dimensions of service
quality (reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy and tangibles) were used to group
the responses, where tangibles were used whenever a customer referred to Company X’s
websites.
When analysing the data in Excel, I made a separate column for each dimension of service
quality next to the responses (see Figure 9). In case a response could be categorized under
a particular dimension, I marked a ‘1’ in the column, if it did not fit under the dimension,
I marked a ‘0’ in the column. This allowed me to easily filter the responses by dimension,
and thus, examine differences and similarities in the responses across the markets. When
presenting the results of the qualitative analysis, direct quotations from the respondents
were used. Saunders et al. (2009) state that qualitative data can sometimes also be
quantified in order to display the frequency of certain events. Therefore, charts were also
used to show the frequency of responses categorised under a specific dimension of service
quality.

Figure 9. Categorising responses according to the five dimensions of service quality

Although combining both quantitative and qualitative techniques can help the researcher
understand and confirm the findings of the study (Saunders et al, 2007), Bryman and Bell
(2013) argue that the quantitative and the qualitative findings should not be treated as
separate domains when conducting mixed method research. Although the researcher can
separate between the quantitative and qualitative findings when presenting the results, the
different findings ought to be integrated in the discussion section of the study (Bryman &
Bell, 2013). Therefore, the quantitative and the qualitative findings of this study will not
be separated, but instead brought together in order to get a more complete understanding

46

(Bryman & Bell, 2013) of the influence of culture on customer satisfaction and the
customers’ willingness to recommend a company to family or friends.

4.6

Reliability and Validity

In order to ensure the credibility of the research findings, the researcher needs to pay
attention to the reliability and validity in regard to the research design (Saunders et al.,
2007). Although the terms reliability and validity often are treated as synonyms, Bryman
and Bell (2013) argue that they mean different things. Reliability refers to the consistency
of the researcher’s data collection technique or analysis procedures, whereas validity
concerns the accuracy of the method (Saunders et al., 2007). In other words, validity has
to do with the whether a method actually measure what it is intended to measure (Bryman
& Bell, 2013).
According to Saunders et al. (2007), measurement validity is one of the most important
criteria for the data. When using secondary data, the researcher has no real control over
the quality of the data (Saunders et al., 20017). However, Saunders et al. (2007) argue that
data in large and well-known organisations are likely to have been collected and compiled
in a thoughtful and accurate manner. Therefore, the survey data in large organisations are
expected to be reliable and trustworthy, as the organisations’ continuous existence is
dependent on the credibility of the data they use (Saunders et al., 20017). As the data used
in this study have been collected by a large international company, I have confidence in
the quality of the data and I have evaluated the data to ensure that it contains the data I
need in order to answer my research questions.
Reliability is especially a concern in connection with quantitative research (Bryman &
Bell, 2013). Saunders et al. (2007) identify four threats to reliability: subject or participant
error, subject or participant bias, observer error and observer bias. In case the secondary
data used is a report of a consumer satisfaction survey, there is a risk that the company
has intentionally reduced the amount of negative comments in order to make the service
appear better when showing results to shareholders (Saunders et al., 2007). However, as
the data used in this study had not been processed by Company X, but rather consists of
47

all the verbatim responses collected in an Excel- file, the potential lack of validity in my
findings are reduced, since they are not affected by the conclusions made by Company X.
Generalisation, which is also referred to as external validity, is a concept commonly
associated with quantitative research and concerns the questions of whether the research
results are generalizable (Saunders et al., 2007), in other words, if the results of a study
can be applied to a broader group of people (Bryman & Bell, 2013). As the focus of this
study is to examine cultural differences on a national level, the results of the research
cannot be used to study differences across individuals. Generalizability is especially a
critical issue for researchers that are conducting research in one organisation (Saunders et
al., 2007). In these cases, Saunders et al. (2007) argue that the researcher cannot state that
the results or conclusions of the research can be generalised.
According to Saunders et al. (2007), the use of multiple methods can provide better
opportunities to answer research questions and to evaluate whether the research findings
can be trusted. However, although mixed method research can offer great potential, as it
can enhance the confidence in the empirical findings, Bryman and Bell (2013) argue that
conducting mixed methods research does not automatically mean that that the findings are
valid and reliable. According to Hesse-Biber (2010), conducting mixed methods research
without having the necessary knowledge about the methods is likely to result in
questionable quality. Therefore, a researcher that uses mixed methods to answer the
research questions needs to be familiar with both methods in order to enhance the validity
and reliability of the results (Hesse-Biber, 2010).

4.7

Ethical considerations

According to Saunders et al. (2007), ethical concerns are likely to occur at all stages of
the research project. Bryman and Bell (2013) identify four main ethical issues that are
associated with business research: harm to participants, invasion of privacy, lack of
informed consent and deception. The course of action the researcher takes to obtain
consent, collect data from the participants, as well as the way the data are analysed and
reported, can cause harm to the participants (Saunders et al., 2007). According to Saunders
48

et al. (2007), anonymity is often considered crucial in order for the researcher to gain
access to organisations and individuals. Before I was allowed access to the customer
feedback data used in this study, the data was de-identified by Company X. The
respondents are therefore kept anonymous in order to ensure that the individuals cannot
be identified when the findings are published (Bryman & Bell, 2013).
According to Bryman and Bell (2013), lack of informed consent is an area within business
research that generates huge controversies. Saunders et al. (2007) state that in cases where
the researcher gets access to personal data about individuals who have not given their
consent to use their data, the researcher must make sure not to use it in any way that might
cause harm to the individuals. Therefore, using secondary data, which were originally
collected for another purpose, can give rise to ethical issues (Saunders et al., 2007).
However, as the data used in this study were de-identified by Company X before I was
granted access to the data, there is no risk that personal details about the respondents
would be revealed in the study, and therefore, there is a low risk of causing harm to the
individuals.
When research is being carried out in a company, it is common for the companies to ask
the researcher to sign a confidentiality agreement in order to ensure that the researcher
does not reveal particular information about the company (Bryman & Bell, 2013). In order
to gain access to the data used in the study, I shared the purpose of my research project
with the company and assured that the identity of the company would be kept confidential.
The company did not however ask me to sign a confidentiality agreement, but I was
advised to keep the company anonymous in the study. Saunders et al. (2007) argue that
once promises about confidentiality and anonymity have been given, it is crucial to make
sure that these are kept. Therefore, as I don’t have the company’s consent to reveal the
name of the company in the thesis, the company will be referred to as Company X. In
addition, the nature of the insurance services that Company X offers is not disclosed.

Empirical Findings

In this chapter, the results of the quantitative and the qualitative analysis of the feedback
provided by Company X’s customers on the Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian and Danish
markets are presented. The results will be analysed and discussed in Chapter 6. This
chapter starts with a presentation of Company X’s collected survey data that have been
used to answer the research questions in this study and is followed by a presentation of
the empirical findings. Finally, the findings of both the quantitative and the qualitative
analysis are summarised.

5.1

Surveys & responses

In Chart 1, an overview of the number of questionnaires distributed to customers on the
Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian and Danish markets is presented. In total, 30168
questionnaires were distributed by Company X to its customers on the Swedish, Finnish,
Norwegian and Danish markets in 2018-2021. Company X distributed 17349
questionnaires on the Swedish market, 7909 questionnaires on the Finnish market, 3012
questionnaires on the Norwegian market and 1898 questionnaires on the Danish market.
The total number of responses was 3902.
In total, there were 2156 responses to the questionnaire on the Swedish market, 1071
responses on the Finnish market, 489 responses on the Norwegian market and 186
responses on the Danish market. As shown in Chart 1, the response rate was the highest
on the Norwegian market (16.2 %). The response rate on the Finnish market was the
second highest (13.5 %), followed by the Swedish market (12.4 %). The response rate was
the lowest on the Danish market, where only 9.8% of the customers replied to the
questionnaire.

5.2

Differences in customer satisfaction and willingness to recommend

In order to examine differences in customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to
recommend Company X to family or friends, the NPS and the CSAT were calculated for
each market. The NPS measures the customers’ willingness to recommend the company
to family or friends, and is calculated by quantifying the difference between the Promoters
(those who gave a rating of 9 or 10) and the Detractors (those who gave a rating between
0 and 6). The results, presented in Chart 2, show that the NPS was highest on the Finnish
market, where the NPS was 13.4. On the Danish market, the NPS was 10.8, followed by
Norway, where the NPS was 2.8. Lastly, the results show that the NPS in Sweden was
0.3. Thus, the results show that the Finnish customers were the most willing to recommend
Company X to family or friends, followed by the Danish customers. The customers from
Norway were less willing to recommend Company X to family or friends compared to the
Finnish and the Danish customers, and the customers from Sweden were the least willing
to recommend Company X to family or friends.

51

Chart 2. NPS scores

The results also show that Finland had the highest number of passive replies (25.2 %),
meaning those who have scored 7 or 8, whereas Norway had the lowest number of passive
replies (16.6 %). Although the percentage of Promoters on the Danish, Finnish and
Norwegian markets did not vary remarkably (Denmark 44.7%, Finland 44.1 % and
Norway 43.1%), the percentage of Detractors in Norway (which was 40.3%, compared to
Finland 30.7% and Denmark 33.9%) lowered the NPS score for Norway.
When calculating the CSAT for each market, which is done by dividing the number of
satisfied customers (those who rated 4 or 5) with the total number of survey responses and
multiplying it with 100, the results (presented in Chart 3) show that 65.1% of the
customers on the Danish market were satisfied with the overall experience. On the
Swedish market, 57.9% of the customers were satisfied, 64.8% of the Finnish customers
and 58.7% of the Norwegian customers. The results show that the difference between the
satisfaction level between the Danish and the Finnish customers were not remarkable,
whereas the results indicate that the customers on the Swedish and the Norwegian market
were less satisfied with the overall experience.

52

Chart 3. CSAT scores

In total, there were 873 Promoters on the Swedish market. As shown in Chart 4, 78.8% of
the Promoters in Sweden rated their overall experience with a 5 and 18.9% with a 4,
whereas 1.6% of the Promoters rated their overall experience with a 3. On the Finnish
market there were 472 Promoters, of which 66.3% rated their overall experience with a 5
and 30.5% with a 4. On the Norwegian market there were 210 Promoters in total, of which
79.1% rated their overall experience with a 5 and 19.5% with a 4. On the Danish market,
there were 83 Promoters in total, of which 81.9% rated their overall experience with a 5
and 15.7 % with a 4.

Chart 4. Level of satisfaction among Promoters

53

The results of the comparison of the customers’ ratings regarding their overall experience
and the number of Promoters on each market show that the Swedish, Norwegian and
Danish customers that rated their overall experience with a 4 were less willing to rate their
likelihood to recommend Company X to family or friends with a 9 or 10 compared to the
Finnish customers. Thus, the results show that the customers on the Finnish market were
more likely to recommend Company X to family or friends even when the customers did
not rate their satisfaction regarding their overall experience with a 5.

5.3

The impact of culture on customers’ willingness to make recommendations

The responses to the open-ended questions ‘Why did you give us a high rating for
likelihood to recommend? and ‘What could we do to improve your rating on likelihood to
recommend?’ have been compared in order to analyse the influence of culture on the
customers’ willingness to recommend Company X to family or friends. The responses to
the open-ended questions were analysed by categorizing each response according to the
five dimensions of service quality: reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy and
tangibles. In total, fifty responses by satisfied customers (those who rated their likelihood
to recommend Company X to family or friends with a 9 or 10) and fifty responses by
dissatisfied customers (those who rated their likelihood to recommend between 0 and 6)
from each market were analysed. The results of the analysis of the open-ended responses
on each market are shown in Chart 5. Due to the fact that many customers mentioned
aspects of the service that could be categorised under more than one of the five
dimensions, Chart 5 displays how many of the 100 responses (on each market) that were
categorised under a certain dimension.

54

Chart 5. Responses according to the five dimensions of service quality

In the section below, the results of the qualitative analysis of the responses to the openended questions provided by satisfied and dissatisfied customers are presented. For the
dimensions of service quality that were the most important to the customers, verbatim
quotations from the respondents are used in order to present the findings of the analysis.
Sweden
Responsiveness
For the Swedish customers, responsiveness was the most important factor influencing
their rating regarding their likelihood to recommend Company X to family or friends.
Among the dissatisfied customers, responsiveness was the main reason for the customers’
low rating on likelihood to recommend. Many of the respondents expressed dissatisfaction
with the long handling time and the fact that it was difficult to get in contact with Company
X.
Mindre krångligt och bättre handläggningstid. Bör vara lättare att få kontakt med
er
Tog lång tid att få information om hur ärendet fortskred. Fick söka upp Company
X för att få information.

55

Long time to respond to my case

For the satisfied customers, responsiveness was the second largest determining factor
influencing the customers’ evaluation of the service quality. Many of the customers
responded that they appreciated the speed of the service.
Väldig nöjd därför att behandlingen av mitt ärende tog endast 10 dagar.
I kontakt med er bara trevliga människor, snabb handläggning, enkel kontakt via
mail. Inget krångel, lätt för vanliga människor att förstå brev, telekontakt och
mail
Snabbtåget. Effektivitet

Empathy
The most determining factor influencing the satisfied customers’ willingness to
recommend Company X to family or friends was Company X’s representatives’ ability to
provide caring and individualised service to them. Several customers stated that the claim
handlers were nice, friendly and patient. Many of the respondents also implied that they
appreciated that the claim handlers treated them with respect.
Jag vill fullt ut rekommendera Company X till mina vänner för att jag själv var
så glad och uppskattade mycket ert arbete och bemötande av mig. Ni håller fullt
ansvar och tar hänsyn till kunden. Ni var tålmodiga att lyssnade och förklarade
med tydlig kunskap....
Blivit väldigt trevligt bemött vid våra samtal o fått adekvat information
Empatiska o lättsamt att prata med er! Tog inte lång tid innan pengarna kom!

Several dissatisfied customers implied that the lack of empathy was the reason for their
low rating regarding their likelihood to recommend Company X to family or friends.
Many of the respondents expressed a wish for Company X’s claim handlers to be friendlier
and nicer. One of the respondents also implied that the lack of personalised service was
the main reason for not wanting to recommend Company X to family or friends, as it felt
like talking to a robot when speaking with Company X’s claim handler.

56

Ha trevligare personal som inte tycker i ett ärende innan de fått in pappren som
bedömer ärendet, samt jobba för kunden som betalar försäkringen, mig!!!!
Vänligare bemötande när man ringer er
Förbättra servicen, jag fick känslan av att jag talade med en robot.

Reliability
Quite a few of the responses by Swedish customers, both by satisfied and dissatisfied
customers, indicated that the reason for the customers’ rating regarding their likelihood to
recommend Company X to family or friends was influenced by Company X’s ability, or
inability, to deliver the service accurately and dependably. Some of the satisfied customers
answered that the insurance is reliable, and that Company X’s insurance kept what had
been promised.
Reliable
Pålitlig försäkring
Tecknade en försäkring som höll vad den lovade. Enkel process när anmälan,
intyg registrerats till utbetalning på kontot.
Det är en bra försäkring som håller vad den lovar.

One of the customers who was satisfied with the service expressed appreciation for the
safety that the insurance provides and stated that it is only when something actually
happens that one can know if an insurance works or not. The customer also added that the
only positive thing about the accident that occurred was the contact the customer had with
Company X and the fact that the customer had the insurance.
Det är först när man råkar ut för något som man vet om en försäkring fungerar
eller ej. Det enda positiva med den olycka jag råkat ut för var kontakten med
Company X. Är så glad att jag tecknat denna försäkring då vår ekonomi inte
behövde bli lidande mitt i allt elände. Enkelt, snabbt, smidigt - precis det man
önskar sig om olyckan är framme. Kommer varmt rekommendera Company X för
släkt och vänner.

57

The lack of reliability was also a determining factor for some of the customers that were
not willing to recommend Company X to family or friends. Some of the customers implied
that they had been deceived by Company X.
Jag skulle beskriva er som skojare av rang.
Sluta lura folk att tro att dom är försäkrade då den inte är det ni lurade mig på
ca 3000 kr

A few customers referred to the fact that Company X did not handle or assess their claim
correctly, which implies that the customers did not find the company reliable.
Börja med att bedöma ärenden rätt.
Läs igenom de handlingar som skickas in ordentligt så att beslut inte fattas på
felaktiga grunder.

Finland
Responsiveness
When comparing the responses from both satisfied and dissatisfied customers on the
Finnish market, the results show that the Finnish customers regarded Company X’s
willingness to help them and the company’s ability to provide prompt service as the most
important factor influencing their willingness to recommend Company X to family or
friends. Responsiveness in the service was however more important for the satisfied
customers than for the dissatisfied customers. Many of the respondents appreciated the
prompt service and the fact that Company X was quick to respond to the customers’
questions.
Korvauspäätös hoidettiin asiallisesti ja kiitettävällä aikataululla. Käsittelyn
kulkuun sai hyvin tietoa asiakaspalvelun kautta.
Olin tyytyväinen asian nopeaan ratkaisuun.
Korvausasia sujui nopeasti ja helposti.

58

Although Company X’s willingness to help the customers and provide prompt service was
a stronger influencing factor on the likelihood to recommend among satisfied customers,
several dissatisfied customers also complained about the long handling time of their
claims, e.g., the first customer below states that the handling of the claim took nearly two
weeks and that speeding up to process would improve the experience, whereas the second
customer below expresses a need for a faster handling of the claim, as well as prompt
payments.
Käsittely kesti lähes kaksi viikkoa, palvelun nopeuttaminen auttaisi parantamaan
kokemusta.
NOPEAMPAA KÄSITTELYÄ, MAKSU PÄIVÄ HETI.

Reliability
When comparing the responses from both satisfied and dissatisfied customers on the
Finnish market, the Finnish customers referred to reliability as an important factor
influencing their satisfaction with the service. Reliability in the service was however more
important for the Finnish customers who were satisfied with the service, than for the
dissatisfied customers. Many respondents on the Finnish market who rated their
willingness to recommend Company X to family or friends with a 9 or 10 responded that
the reason for the high rating was due to the fact that the insurance lived up to their
expectations. The customers below state that the insurance worked as it should and just as
the customers had expected.
Ihan odotusten mukaisesti on toiminut
Koska kaikki toimi niinkuin pitikin.
Homma toimii juuri niinkuin pitää, ja mistä olen maksanut!

Another reason for the customers’ high willingness to recommend Company X to family
or friends was that Company X kept its promises in terms of delivery of the service.

Kiitos kun maksatte korvaukset kuten ehdoissa lupaatte :)

59

Korvauksen hakeminen sujui vaivatta eli niin sujuvasti kuin olitte luvanneet.

Several satisfied Finnish respondents implied that they would recommend Company X to
family or friends because of the security that the insurance provides in case of unexpected
events in life. The first customer below mentions that the insurance serves as a great safety
in case of an accident, whereas that second customer below states that one can never be
sure what might happen, and therefore, one should have Company X’s insurance to rely
on in these cases. Even though the monthly insurance premium might feel high in relation
to one’s monthly budget, the customer concludes that the insurance is worth it as the
compensation will come at rescue in case of an emergency.
Suuri turva vahingon sattuessa.
Koska koskaan ei tiedä mitä voi tapahtua ja silloin kannattaa olla Company Xvakuutus turvaamassa. Kuukausittainen vakuutusmaksu voi tuntua suurehkolta
kuukausibudjetissa mutta hädän hetkellä saatava korvaus pelastaa. Joten se on
sen arvoista.

Assurance
For the Finnish customers that were not likely not recommend Company X to family or
friends, the lack of assurance was the main reason for their dissatisfaction. Compared to
the other markets, assurance was also more important for the satisfied customers on the
Finnish market. Some of the respondents implied that the lack of honesty in the service
affected their willingness to recommend Company X to family or friends, as they
answered that Company X should be honest and tell the truth in all instances. The response
from the third customer below implies that Company X did not succeed in provoking trust
and confidence, as the customer states that the insurance did not cover for the claim even
though the customer specifically asked about this prior to taking the insurance, which
resulted in a low rating on the likelihood to recommend Company X to family or friends.
Olemalla rehellinen
Puhuisitte kaikissa asioissa totta ja lopettaisitte kiertelyn.

60

It seems that the whole reason why I got this insurance in the first place was not
covered even though I was sold the insurance when I asked for this. If I had known
I would have not wasted my money on this. Also if you need a 500 page disclaimer
for a service you're selling, you're not selling someone a very good service.

Some of the dissatisfied customers stated that they felt that they got different answers
every time they spoke with Company X representatives and that the representatives did
not either understand their questions and also gave them wrong information.
Kouluttakaa puhelimitse asiakaspalvelua tekevää henkilökuntaanne! Antavat
virheellistä tietoa ja eivät ymmärrä asiakkaan lisäkysymyksiä. Tämä ei koske vain
yhtä asiakaspalvelijaa, vaan niitä kaikkia kolmea, joiden kanssa asioin.
En ole ollut tyytyväinen. Tulee toisena päivänä toisenlaista tietoa erittäin
pettynyt. En suosittelisi kenellekään

A couple of customers who gave a high rating regarding their likelihood to recommend
Company X to family or friends appreciated that they had received professional and
knowledgeable service by Company X’s staff, which implies that Company X’s was able
to convey trust and proved that that the company is credible.
Olen saanut nopeaa ja asiantuntevaa palvelua.
Kysymyksiin vastattiin heti ammattitaidolla.
Koska olen saanut hyvää ja asiantuntevaa palvelua.

Tangibles
Although tangibles were not the most important factor influencing the customers’
willingness to recommend Company X to family or friends, the results show that the
Finnish customers referred to tangibles more frequently than the customers on the other
markets. Among the customers that rated their willingness to recommend Company X to
family or friends with a low score, tangibles were mentioned more frequently compared
to among the customers that gave a high rating. Several customers expressed
dissatisfaction with Company X’s websites. Some customers implied that they
experienced issues when logging into Company X’s online service, whereas others stated
61

that the information provided on Company X’s websites was false or that it was difficult
to find information on the websites.
Ei ollut helpoimmasta päästä kirjautua palveluun
Palvelun helpottaminen netissä.
Webbisivut toimii ihan ala-arvoisesti, yhteystietoja vaikea löytää
Netti sivut ovat surkeat jossa kaiken lisäksi väärä tietoa. Asiakaspalvelu ei vastaa
viesteihin päiväkausiin jolloin muutenkin jo myöhässä olevat korvaukset
myöhästyvät entisestään. Todella pettynyt koko toimintaan, kun ottaa huomioon
kuinka paljon olen 15v aikana tuonut rahaa yhtiöllenne.

Norway
Responsiveness
When comparing the responses from both satisfied and dissatisfied customers on the
Norwegian market, the Norwegian customers referred to responsiveness as an important
factor influencing their satisfaction with the service. The results show that the lack of
responsiveness in the service was the main reason for the dissatisfied customers’ low
willingness to recommend Company X to family or friends. Several customers expressed
dissatisfaction with the long handling time of their claims.
Raskere saksbehandling
Brev pr post bruker evig lang tid. Svar pr mail tar evig lang tid. Saksbehandlingen
tar evig lang tid. Dette må dere skjerpe inn!
Alt for treg saksbehandling å utbetaling, venta i 4 må der enda ikke fått utbetalt
en dritt.

Some of the customers also expressed dissatisfaction with how long it took for Company
X to get back to them with an answer or an update regarding their claims.
Gi tilbakemelding til kunde!
Bedre og mer empatisk kommunikasjon .. var ikke enkelt å kommunisere med dere
.. ble steik forbanna

62

Svare på mine spørsmål / henvendelser rettet på mail og på weben til Company
X

For the customers that were willing to recommend Company X to family or friends,
responsiveness was the second most important factor influencing their evaluation of the
service quality. Several customers stated that the handling of their claim was fast and
effective and that they were very satisfied with this.
Alt fungerte raskt og effektivt
Rask behandling av mine saker. VELDIG FORNØYD
Hele prosessen gikk utrolig fort! Ikke mye papirarbeid, kort behandlingstid...jeg
er veldig fornøyd!!!

Reliability
For the dissatisfied customers, lack of reliability was the second most important factor
influencing the customers’ willingness to recommend Company X to family or friends,
whereas reliability was the third largest influencing factor for the satisfied customers’
willingness to recommend. Some of the dissatisfied customers implied that they had been
deceived by Company or that Company X did not handle their claim accurately.
Det er som svindel från Company X forsikring.
Dere er ikke ærlig bedrift
Gi meg tilbake pengene for forsikringen jeg har betalt i 8 år. useriøst lureri kaller
jeg det, og dere burde alle skjemmes!

Many of the customers that gave Company X a high rating for likelihood to recommend
commented that the reason for their high rating was that their claim had been approved or
that they had received what they applied for.
Var en ryddig og god prosess og fikk det jeg hadde krav på.
Fikk fullt gjennomslag for mitt krav.
Jeg fikk den erstatningen jeg skulle ha i henhold til forsikringen jeg hadde tegent

63

Empathy
For approximately a third of the customers that gave Company X a high rating for
likelihood to recommend, Company X’s ability to provide caring and individualised
service to them was the main reason for their high rating. Several customers responded
that they found the customer service both friendly and helpful.
Ryddig oppgjør. Hyggelig kundeservice, veldig imøtekommende.
Alltid hyggelige folk som tar telefonen og får alltid ordentlig svar vis en lurer på
noe
Jeg vil anbefale venner og familie min å bruker og stole på Company X pga.
Company X bryr deg om kunder med integritet og ærlighet.! Takk så lenge! Meget
vennlig kundebehandler.

For the customers that were not willing to recommend Company X to family or friends,
empathy in service was not influencing their evaluation of the service quality to a large
extent, although a few customers responded that they would like the service to be more
customer-friendly and empathic.
Mer kundevenlig
Bedre og mer empatisk kommunikasjon .. var ikke enkelt å kommunisere med dere
.. ble steik forbanna
Være litt venlig

Denmark
Responsiveness
Among the Danish customers, responsiveness in the service was the most determining
factor influencing the customers’ rating regarding their willingness to recommend
Company X to family or friends. For the customers that gave a low rating regarding their
likelihood to recommend, responsiveness was referred to as the main reason for the
customers’ low rating. Many of the respondents expressed opinions indicating that they
felt the service was too slow or the process too complicated.
64

Mere smidig sagsbehandling.
Det er meget omstændigt.
Hurtigere ekspeditionstid

Several customers also expressed dissatisfaction with how difficult it was to get in contact
with Company X or to get a response from them, both per telephone and per e-mail.
Svar på mails og ikke kun autosvar. Komunikationen er for dårlig
kompliceret at komunikere
Har ikke fået svar på skadeanmeldelse. Har ikke hørt et eneste kvæk fra Company
X ind til jeg fik en invitation til kundeundersøgelsen.

Although Company X’s willingness to help the customers and provide prompt service was
a stronger influencing factor on the likelihood to recommend among dissatisfied
customers, several satisfied customers also responded that the fast and effective handling
of their claims was the reason for their high ranking on likelihood to recommend Company
X to family or friends.
Hurtig sagsbehandling :-)
Immødekommende, forstående, hurtig og effektiv sagsbehandling.

Empathy/Reliability/Assurance
The second, the third and the fourth largest determining factors that the customers implied
had affected their likelihood to recommend Company X to family or friends were
empathy, reliability and assurance. However, the responses by the satisfied and the
dissatisfied customers were not so clear or detailed compared to the responses by
customers on the other markets, and therefore, the responses were more difficult to
categorise according to the five dimensions of service quality. Many of the respondents
that that gave a high rating for their likelihood to recommend answered that the customer
service was good, as well as credible and that the claim handlers were capable of
answering to their questions.

65

God og troværdig kundeservice
God kundeservice. Altid svar på mind spørgsmål
Fordi Company X:s medarbejdere ydede en fantastisk service til mig. Alle
medarbejdere jeg mødte, var meget professionelle, informerende, vejledende og
troværdige.

Several customers that gave a high rating for their likelihood to recommend did not
provide any specific examples of the reasons for their rating, but instead responded, e.g.,
“no comment”, “because it was okay”, “have no reason for anything else” or “carry on as
you do”
Ikke kommenter
Fordi den var ok
Har ikke grund til andet
Bliv ved som i gør

Several of the dissatisfied customers accused Company X of being dishonest and not able
of providing the customers with the help they would have needed. In addition, some of
the customers responded that Company X’s representatives were arrogant. Thus, these
responses suggest that the lack of reliability, assurance and empathy in the service
influenced the customers’ evaluation of the service, which resulted in a low rating
regarding their likelihood to recommend Company X to family or friends.
At i rent faktisk hjælper en og giver det produkt i har lovet.
Man skal huske ikke at love noget som man ikke kan overholde, det er det samme
som at træde på folk der allerede lægger ned. Også det frækt man skal betale til
jer når man ikke kan få hjælp . Det penge ud af vinduet
I ville ikke hjælpe mig. Så kan ikke anbefale jer overhovedet. I er så pisse
arrogante. I er en pengemaskine ikke andet. Skam jer
I kan hjælpe når det gælder. I er så arrogante at i burde skamme jer.

66

Many of the customers that gave a low rating regarding their likelihood to recommend did
not either give any specific examples of the determining factors for their low rating, but
instead, responded “No”, “No! - It’s too late.”, “No, I have had a lot of negative
experiences” or “No, I don’t recommend my experiences in general”- Therefore, these
responses could not be categorised according to the five dimensions of service quality.
Nej!
Nej, - det er for sent.
Nej, Jeg har meget fået negativ oplavelse
Nej, generelt anbefaler jeg ikke mine oplevelser

5.4

Responses by satisfied and dissatisfied customers on each market

The results of the qualitative analysis of the responses to the open-ended questions
provided by Promoters (satisfied customers) on each market are shown in Chart 6. The
numbers distributed per dimension represent the number of responses that could be
categorised under a specific dimension.

As displayed in Chart 6, the plurality of the responses on the Swedish, Norwegian and
Danish markets could be categorised under the dimension for empathy, and thus, the
results show that Company X’s ability to provide caring and individualised service was
the main reason for satisfaction in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, followed by
responsiveness in the service. The main reasons for satisfaction among the Finnish
customers were responsiveness and reliability in the service, whereas the results show that
empathy was not a major influencing factor on the Finnish customers’ willingness to
recommend Company X to family or friends.
In Chart 7, the results of the qualitative analysis of the responses given by Detractors
(dissatisfied customers) on each market are presented.

Chart 7. Responses by Detractors according to the five dimensions of service quality

As displayed in Chart 7, responsiveness was the main reason for the dissatisfied
customers’ low willingness to recommend Company X to family or friends on the
Swedish, Norwegian and Danish markets. On the Finnish market, the main reason for
dissatisfaction was Company X’s inability to provoke trust and confidence, as the plurality
of the responses could be categorised under the assurance dimension.

Summary

The results of the quantitative analysis showed that the Finnish customers were the most
likely to recommend Company X to family or friends, whereas the Swedish customers
were the least likely to recommend. The findings also indicated that the customers on the
Danish and the Finnish markets were the most satisfied with the overall experience,
whereas the Norwegian and the Swedish customers were less satisfied with the overall
experience.
The results also showed that the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish customers who rated
their overall experience with a 4 were less willing to rate their likelihood to recommend
Company X to family or friends with a 9 or 10 compared to the Finnish customers. The
fact that the customers on the Finnish market were more likely to recommend Company
X to family or friends, even when the customers did not rate their satisfaction regarding
their overall experience with a 5, could indicate that the customers from Finland are more
loyal compared to the customers on the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish markets.
However, the reason for the higher willingness to recommend among the Finnish
customers, even though a higher percentage of the Promoters on the Finnish market rated
their satisfaction with a 4 compared to the other markets, could also be found in cultural
differences regarding expectations of the service or a tendency among the customers in
Finland to give higher scores.
The qualitative analysis of the responses to the open-ended questions provided by the
customers on the Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian and Danish markets showed that Company
X’s willingness to help the customers and deliver the service in a timely manner was the
most determining factor influencing the customers’ willingness to recommend Company
X to family or friends. The need for empathy in service was found to be the strongest on
the Swedish market, followed by Denmark and Norway, whereas only 7 out of 100 Finnish
customers referred to empathy in service as a determining factor influencing their
willingness to recommend Company X to family or friends.

69

Trust and confidence, as well as the service provider’s ability to deliver the service
accurately and dependably, was more important among the Finnish customers compared
to the other markets. In addition, in comparison with the responses on the other markets,
the responses on the Finnish market included much more feedback, both positive and
negative, about Company X’s websites, which suggests that Finnish customers put
stronger emphasis on tangibles in service.
The results of the comparison between the responses by satisfied customers and
dissatisfied customers on each market showed that responsiveness was the main reason
for the dissatisfied customers’ low willingness to recommend Company X to family or
friends on the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish markets, whereas the main reason for
dissatisfaction among the Finnish customers was Company X’s inability to provoke trust
and confidence. The results also showed that Company X’s ability to provide caring and
individualised service was the main reason for satisfaction in Sweden, Norway and
Denmark, whereas the main reasons for satisfaction among the Finnish customers were
responsiveness and reliability in the service.

Analysis

In the previous chapter the empirical findings from the quantitative and the qualitative
analysis of the Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian and Danish customer feedback were
presented. In this chapter, the findings will be analysed and discussed in relation to the
research questions and the theoretical framework presented in the literature review
chapters. The chapter starts by providing an overview of the culture of the countries
according to Hofstede’s cultural dimensions. Thereafter, the finding of the study will be
analysed and discussed with the support of Hofstede’s framework.

6.1

Country comparison according to Hofstede’s cultural dimensions

Hofstede’s framework of national cultures is based on the idea that people from different
countries perceive and interpret the world around them differently (Hollensen, 2012).
Hofstede established six cultural dimensions in order to gain a deeper understanding of
differences in cultures across countries. Hofstede’s framework originally consisted of the
following four dimensions: power distance, collectivism versus individualism, femininity
versus masculinity and uncertainty avoidance. At a later stage, the long-term versus shortterm orientation dimension, as well as the indulgence versus restraint dimension, were
added to the framework. Hofstede’s framework compares countries on the basis of the
country scores (from 1-100), for each dimension (Hofstede, 2001).
Based on Hofstede’s comparison of cultures according to the country scores for each
cultural dimension, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark are referred to as
individualistic societies. However, Finland scores somewhat lower on individualism,
whereas Denmark scores slightly higher on individualism compared to Sweden and
Norway. All four countries are low power distance countries, although Denmark is at the
very low of this dimension compared the other countries (Hofstede Insights, 2021).
Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark are all also classified as feminine cultures,
although Sweden, Norway and Denmark have a lower score on the masculinity versus
femininity dimension compared to Finland, and thus, Finland is considered less of a
feminine culture compared to its neighbour countries. In comparison with the other
71

countries, Sweden scores higher on indulgence, as well as long-term orientation, which
implies that the satisfaction of basic and natural human desires related to enjoying life and
having fun (Hofstede, 2011), as well as having a pragmatic future-oriented perspective
(Hollensen, 2012) are more highly valued within the Swedish culture. The country
comparison also suggests that those from Sweden and Denmark are more confident with
uncertainty, whereas those from Norway, and particularly those from Finland, are more
uncomfortable or threatened by uncertain or unfamiliar situations (Blodgett et al., 2008).

Figure 10. Country Comparison (Hofstede Insights, 2021)

Due to the fact that very little previous research within international marketing has focused
on cultural differences in customer satisfaction between the Nordic countries, the purpose
of this study was to provide a deeper understanding of the influence of culture on customer
satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend a company to family or friends,
between Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark. To support the objective of the thesis,
the following research questions were developed:
-

Can differences in customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to
recommend a company to family or friends be detected between Sweden,
Finland, Norway and Denmark?

-

What are the effects of culture on the customers’ willingness to recommend
the company to family or friends?

72

6.2

Can cultural differences be detected in the open feedback provided by
satisfied customers and dissatisfied customer?

Cultural influence on customer satisfaction and willingness to recommend

By comparing the NPS scores for each market, the results showed that the Finnish
customers were the most likely to recommend Company X to family or friends, whereas
the Swedish customers were the least likely to recommend. The CSAT scores for each
market showed that the customers on the Danish and the Finnish markets were the most
satisfied with the overall experience, whereas the customers on the Swedish and the
Norwegian markets were less satisfied with the overall experience.
Although there was no remarkable difference in the level of customer satisfaction between
the Danish and the Finnish markets, the NPS results showed that the Finnish customers
were the most likely to recommend Company X to family or friends, as the NPS on the
Danish market was 10.8 compared to 13.4 on the Finnish market. According to Schiffman
and Wisenblit (2014), customer satisfaction is directly linked to the likelihood to
recommend, and therefore, customers who are highly satisfied with a product or a service
also provide positive and encouraging word-of-mouth to others.

When comparing the number of Promoters on each market in relation to the customers’
ratings regarding their satisfaction with the overall experience (responses to the question
‘Thinking about your overall claims experience, what star rating would you give us? 1 is
the lowest rating and 5 is the highest rating), the results showed that the Swedish,
Norwegian and Danish customers who rated their overall experience with a 4 were less
willing to rate their likelihood to recommend Company X to family or friends with a 9 or
10 compared to the Finnish customers.
Although the NPS has become a popular metric among companies, largely due to its
simplicity and strong relationship to company growth potential (Kotler & Keller, 2016),
Kristensen and Eskildsen (2014) questioned the trustworthiness of NPS as a performance
measure, and the results of their study indicated that NPS is a poor predictor of both
73

customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. Therefore, Kristensen and Eskildsen
discourage companies to make decisions regarding their business based on the NPS
scores, as the measure is very sensitive to differences in the distribution between
Promoter, Passive and Detractors. In addition, Kristensen and Eskildsen (2014) argue that
the absence of a “No answer option” in the measurement forces the customers to give a
rating, which was shown to lead to a lower NPS.
According to Dolnicar and Grün (2007), cross-cultural differences in survey response
patters also represent a threat to the interpretations of market research findings. Therefore,
Dolnicar and Grün state that international companies who conduct surveys involving
customers with different cultural backgrounds cannot overlook the potential influence of
culture on response patterns. Therefore, Dolnicar and Grün (2007) encourage companies
to carry out tests of statistical significance on the answer patterns in order to establish
whether the possible differences are significant in regard to cross-cultural differences or
whether they are caused by cultural differences in survey response patterns.
Following the arguments put forward by Dolnicar and Grün (2007), Seth et al. (2006)
argue that there are issues related to the use of NPS in cross-cultural research, and the
results of their study suggest that cultural differences are likely to have an impact on the
NPS scores. Therefore, when analysing the results of this study, which indicated that there
are differences in customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend
Company X to family or friends, the impact of culture on the NPS scores needs to be
considered. Thus, the higher NPS on the Finnish market could be due to cultural
differences e.g., differences regarding expectations of the service or a tendency among the
customers in Finland to give higher scores.
According to Usunier and Lee (2013), the relationship between customer satisfaction and
loyalty tend to be stronger in individualistic societies, as well as in masculine societies
and societies that have a higher tolerance for uncertainty. Although Sweden, Finland,
Norway and Denmark are all classified as individualistic, as well as feminine, societies
according to Hofstede’s framework, Sweden, Norway and Denmark have a lower score
74

on the masculine versus feminine dimension compared to Finland. In addition, Finland
has a score of 59 on the uncertainty avoidance dimension, and thus, can be classified as a
high uncertainty avoidance society, whereas Sweden and Denmark are classified as low
uncertainty avoidance societies. Norway, with a score of 50, is neither classified as a low
nor a high uncertainty avoidance society.
According to Blodgett et al. (2008), those from societies that score high on the uncertainty
avoidance scale value security highly, and thus, are less confident with uncertainty.
Usunier and Lee (2013) argue that uncertainty avoidance is positively related to loyalty,
and therefore, loyal consumers want to know what they buy and are less likely to switch
to other brands or seek for other alternatives on the market. Therefore, the results suggest
that the customers from Finland are less confident with uncertainty, and therefore, are
more willing to stay loyal to the company in order to reduce any risks associated with the
unfamiliar and unknown.

6.3

The impact of culture on customers’ willingness to make recommendations

The results of the analysis of the responses to the open-ended questions on the Swedish,
Finnish, Norwegian and Danish markets showed that Company X’s willingness to help
the customers and deliver the service in a timely manner was the most determining factor
influencing the customers’ willingness to recommend Company X to family or friends.
Both satisfied and dissatisfied customers on the Swedish market referred to
responsiveness in the service as the reason for their high or low ranking on likelihood to
recommend. The satisfied customer below states that the handling of the claim only took
10 days, and therefore, the customer was satisfied, whereas the response by the dissatisfied
customer below indicate that the process was too complicated and handling time too long.
In addition, the customer states that it should be easier to reach Company X.
Väldig nöjd därför att behandlingen av mitt ärende tog endast 10 dagar.
Mindre krångligt och bättre handläggningstid. Bör vara lättare att få kontakt med
er

75

Several customers on the Finnish market stated that the reason for their high rating
regarding their likelihood to recommend was the prompt service and the fact that
Company X was quick to respond to the customers’ questions, whereas several dissatisfied
customers complained about the long handling time of their claims. The satisfied customer
below states that the decision for the claim was made correctly and within a short period
of time. In addition, the customer states that it was easy to get information about the claim
process through Company X’s customer service. The dissatisfied customer below
expresses frustration with the fact that it took nearly two weeks for Company X to handle
the claim and that a faster service would help improve the experience.
Korvauspäätös hoidettiin asiallisesti ja kiitettävällä aikataululla. Käsittelyn
kulkuun sai hyvin tietoa asiakaspalvelun kautta.
Käsittely kesti lähes kaksi viikkoa, palvelun nopeuttaminen auttaisi
parantamaan kokemusta.

Among the responses on the Norwegian market, many customers stated that the handling
of their claims was fast and effective and that they were very satisfied with this. However,
even more customers expressed dissatisfaction with the long handling time of their claims.
The satisfied customer below states that the whole process was very fast. In addition, the
customer says that there was not much paperwork and the handling time was fast.
However, according to the dissatisfied customer below, the handling of the claim was
slow and the payment for the claim took time, as the customer had to wait four months
before anything was paid.
Hele prosessen gikk utrolig fort! Ikke mye papirarbeid, kort behandlingstid...jeg
er veldig fornøyd!!!
Alt for treg saksbehandling å utbetaling, venta i 4 må der enda ikke fått utbetalt
en dritt.

On the Danish market, quite a few satisfied customers responded that the fast and effective
handling time of their claims was the reason for their high rating regarding their likelihood
to recommend Company X to family or friends, whereas several of the respondents
expressed opinions indicating that they felt the service was too slow or the process too
76

complicated. The satisfied customer below states that the service was welcoming and
understanding, and the handling was fast and efficient, whereas the dissatisfied customer
below requires a faster process.
Immødekommende, forstående, hurtig og effektiv sagsbehandling.
Hurtigere ekspeditionstid

According to Hofstede’s framework of culture, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark
are all individualistic societies, which suggest that people from these countries are
expected to look after themselves (Blodgett et al., 2008), and are driven by personal
preferences, needs and rights (Usunier & Lee, 2013). Khashkhuu (2016) studied the
relationship between culture and service quality perceptions and found that there was a
positive relationship between individualism and responsiveness, which suggests that those
from individualistic societies expect others to be efficient and also require a high level of
service quality.
Based on their score on Hofstede’s cultural dimension for power distance, Sweden,
Finland, Norway and Denmark are all classified as low power distance societies, and thus,
the consumers on these markets are expected to have less tolerance of inequalities in
power (Donthu & Yoo, 1998). Instead, people from low power distance societies expect
to be more involved in decision making and power to be more widely distributed in the
society (Hollensen, 2012). Thus, the results of the analysis of the open-ended feedback by
Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian and Danish customers, which showed that responsiveness
in service was the main factor influencing the customers rating regarding their likelihood
to recommend, can be explained with the values regarding higher involvement, as well as
interdependence, personal needs and rights, in these societies.
The need for empathy in service was found to be the strongest on the Swedish market,
followed by Denmark and Norway. Several customers on the Swedish, Danish and
Norwegian markets implied that Company X’s ability to provide caring and personalised
attention to them was the reason for their high rating regarding their likelihood to
77

recommend Company X to family or friends, whereas many responses also indicated that
the lack of empathy in the service was the reason for the customers’ low willingness to
recommend Company X to family or friends. However, on the Finnish market, only 7 out
of 100 responses referred to empathy in service as a determining factor influencing their
willingness to recommend Company X to family or friends.
According to Donthu and Yoo (1998), individualistic consumers make their own
satisfaction a top priority and also expect the service providers to care about them and
show empathy and attention. However, although Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark
are all classified as individualistic societies, the empirical findings indicate that empathy
in service was not considered a very important factor among the Finnish customers
compared to the customers on the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish markets. Although
Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark are all classified as feminine societies according
to Hofstede’s framework of culture, Sweden, Norway and Denmark have lower scores on
the masculinity versus femininity dimension compared to Finland. Due to the fact that
those from feminine societies value quality of life, interdependence and service (Donthu
& Yoo, 1998), the lower scores on the masculinity versus femininity dimension for
Sweden, Norway and Denmark compared to Finland could explain the Finnish customers’
lower need for empathy in service.
The empirical findings of the study also showed that trust and confidence were considered
as more important aspects of the service among the Finnish customers compared to the
customers on the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish markets. For the Finnish customers
who were not likely not recommend Company X to family or friends, the lack of assurance
was the main reason for their dissatisfaction. In addition, compared to the customer on the
other markets, assurance was also more important for the satisfied customers on the
Finnish market. In comparison with the other markets, the customers on the Danish market
did not regard the service provider’s ability to inspire trust and confidence as particularly
important aspects of the service.

78

According to Tsoukatos and Rand (2007), consumers from high uncertainty avoidance
societies tend to put emphasis on assurance. Thus, as Finland is considered a high
uncertainty avoidance society, whereas Sweden and Denmark are classified as low
uncertainty avoidance societies, and Norway as neither a low nor a high uncertainty
avoidance society, the results suggest that consumers from Finland have a lower tolerance
for uncertainty. Therefore, consumers on the Finnish market place higher value on security
and regard the service provider’s ability to inspire trust and confidence as more important
than the consumers from Sweden, Norway and Denmark. According to Hofstede’s
framework of culture, Denmark scores the lowest on the uncertainty avoidance dimension
in comparison with Sweden, Finland and Norway, and therefore, consumers on the Danish
market can be expected to be more tolerant towards uncertain or unfamiliar situations,
which the empirical findings of this study also supported. In addition, Tsoukatos and Rand
(2007) argue that customers from societies with a high score on the masculinity dimension
tend to put more value on assurance in service than customers from feminine societies.
The results also showed that the service provider’s ability to deliver the service accurately
and dependably was most important among the Finnish customers, as 34 respondents on
the Finnish market implied that reliability, or lack of reliability, was the reason for their
rating regarding their likelihood to recommend Company X to family or friends. Many
respondents on the Finnish market who rated their willingness to recommend Company
X to family or friends with a 9 or 10 responded that the reason for their high rating was
due to the fact that the insurance lived up to their expectations or that Company X kept its
promises in terms of delivery of the service.
The study by Khashkhuu (2016) showed a positive relationship between uncertainty
avoidance and reliability, which suggests that those from high uncertainty societies put
higher value on trustworthiness and consistency in service. On the contrary, the results
showed that reliability was not as important for the customers on the Danish market, which
can be explained with the fact that Denmark scores low on uncertainty avoidance
compared to Sweden, Finland, and Norway. Therefore, the findings of the study suggest
that reliability is not a particularly important aspect of the service for the customers on the
79

Danish market, as customers from low uncertainty avoidance societies have a higher
tolerance for the unexpected and unknown.
In comparison with the responses on the other markets, the responses on the Finnish
market included much more feedback, both positive and negative, about Company X’s
websites. Several customers on the Finnish market expressed dissatisfaction with
Company X’s websites. Some customers implied that they experienced issues when
logging into Company X’s online service, whereas others stated that the information
provided on Company X’s websites was false or that it was difficult to find information
on the websites. Although the difference was not significant, the results of the study by
Donthu and Yoo (1998) showed that customers from high uncertainty avoidance societies
placed more value on tangibles in service compared to customers from low uncertainty
avoidance societies. The results of the study by Donthu and Yoo (1998) therefore implies
that consumers from high uncertainty avoidance societies do not regard the relationship
with the customer service representatives as important. Instead, Khashkhuu (2016) argue
that tangibles are used to reduce the closeness in the interaction with the service provider.
Therefore, as the Finnish customers did not consider empathy to be a particularly
important aspect of the service, the quality of Company X’s websites had a larger
influence on the level of satisfaction on the Finnish market compared to the other markets.

6.4

Cultural differences between by satisfied and dissatisfied customers

Usunier and Lee (2013) argue that service perceptions and evaluations tend to vary in
different countries. The analysis of the open-ended responses by satisfied and dissatisfied
customers clearly showed how culture impacts the customers’ satisfaction with a service,
as the results showed that the customers’ service perceptions differed between the
markets. Responsiveness in service was the main reason for the dissatisfied customers’
low willingness to recommend Company X to friends and family on the Swedish,
Norwegian and Danish markets, whereas the main reason for dissatisfaction among the
Finnish customers was Company X’s inability to provoke trust and confidence. The
analysis also showed that empathy in service was the main reason for satisfaction in

80

Sweden, Norway and Denmark. The main reasons for satisfaction among the Finnish
customers were responsiveness and reliability in the service.
The comparison of the countries, based on the scores on each of Hofstede’s cultural
dimensions, implies that there are visible cultural differences between the countries. The
analysis showed that the cultural differences in customer satisfaction and the customers’
willingness to recommend Company X to family or friends were not that visible between
Sweden, Norway and Denmark, but greater between Finland and the three other markets.
A comparison of the countries based on Hofstede’s dimensions for uncertainty avoidance,
masculinity and power distance, suggests that the culture in Finland differs from the
cultures on the three other markets, and thus, Hofstede’s framework provided an
explanation for the differences regarding the evaluation of the performance of the service,
between Finland and the three other markets.

6.5

Summary

In order to get a deeper understanding of the influence of culture on customer satisfaction
and the customers’ willingness to recommend a company to others, the empirical findings
of the study have been analysed and discussed in relation to the research questions, and
with the support of Hofstede’s framework. The results of the quantitative analysis
identified differences, regarding customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to
recommend Company X to family or friends. However, as previous studies suggest that
cultural differences are likely to have an impact on the NPS scores, the influence of culture
on NPS ought to be considered when comparing NPS results between different markets.
As Finland is a high uncertainty avoidance society, Hofstede’s framework suggests that
the customers from Finland want to reduce any risks associated with the unfamiliar and
unknown, and therefore, are more willing to stay loyal to the company, which could
generate a higher NPS on the Finnish market compared to the other markets.
The analysis of the responses to the open-ended questions provided a deeper
understanding of how culture influences customer satisfaction and the customers’
willingness to recommend a company to others. According to Hofstede’s cultural
81

dimensions, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Demark are classified as individualistic
societies. The findings of the study by Khashkhuu (2016) showed that there was a positive
relationship between individualism and responsiveness, which suggests that those from
individualistic societies require a high level of service quality and also expect others to be
efficient. In addition, the Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark are all classified as low
power distance societies, and thus, consumers on these markets expect to be more
involved in decision making and power to be more widely distributed (Hollensen, 2012).
As responsiveness in service was the most important factor influencing the Swedish,
Finnish, Norwegian and Danish customers’ willingness to recommend Company X to
family or friends, the results of the analysis are supported by previous research.
The analysis of the responses to the open-ended questions showed clear differences
regarding the customers’ need of empathy in the service. Although Donthu and Yoo
(1998) argue that consumers from individualistic societies make their own satisfaction a
top priority and also expect the service providers to care about them and show empathy
and attention, empathy was not considered an important factor among the Finnish
customers. The results of the study by Donthu and Yoo (1998) implied that consumers
from high uncertainty avoidance societies do not regard the relationship with the customer
service representatives as important. Instead, tangibles are used to reduce the closeness in
the interaction with the service provider (Khashkhuu, 2016), which the analysis also
supported, as tangibles in service was more strongly emphasised on the Finnish market.
In addition, Tsoukatos and Rand (2007) argue that consumers from high uncertainty
avoidance societies tend to put emphasis on assurance in service, which the analysis also
showed, as the Finnish customers considered trust and confidence as more important
aspect of the service.
Reliability in the service was more important among the Finnish customers, and thus, the
analysis was supported by the findings of the study by Khashkhuu (2016), which showed
a positive relationship between uncertainty avoidance and reliability. Reliability was not
considered a particularly important aspect of the service among the Danish customers,
which is supported by Hofstede’s framework, as those from low uncertainty avoidance
82

societies tend to have a higher tolerance for the unexpected and unknown, whereas those
from high uncertainty societies put higher value on trustworthiness and consistency in the
service.
The analysis also showed clear differences in the causes for satisfaction and dissatisfaction
among the customers from the different markets. The analysis showed that the cultural
differences in customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend a
company to others were not that visible between Sweden, Norway and Denmark, but
greater between Finland and the three other markets. The majority of differences between
Finland and the three other markets could be explained by the differences in the country
scores for the uncertainty avoidance, power distance and masculinity dimension. Thus,
the differences in culture across the markets, regarding customer satisfaction and the
customers’ willingness to recommend a company to others, can be understood with the
support of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory, and the analysis was also supported by
previous research.

Conclusions

7.1

General Conclusions

The purpose of the study was to provide a deeper understanding of the influence of culture
on customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend a company to
family or friends, which was done by analysing customer feedback in Company X on the
Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian and Danish markets. Throughout this work, I have argued
that it is highly important to acknowledge the cultural aspects in international business,
particularly for companies operating across the Nordic region, as very little previous
research has focused on highlighting cultural differences, but rather emphasised the
similarities, between the countries within the Nordic region.
As customer satisfaction is a primary focus for an increasing number of companies, many
companies are tracking both customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction in order to ensure
high levels of customer satisfaction, and thus, increase the number of customer referrals.
Therefore, key concepts related to a customer-centric approach, adopted by companies in
order to ensure high levels of customer satisfaction and recommendations to others, were
initially presented. As previous studies show that people from different cultures are likely
to judge the same service differently based on differences in the perceived quality, the five
dimensions of service quality (reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy and
tangibles) were introduced. The second theory chapter shed light on the complexity
surrounding the concept of culture, as well as introduced Hofstede’s framework of
national culture, which was used to support the findings of the research.
By comparing the NPS and CSAT scores on each market, the results of the quantitative
analysis showed that the Finnish customers were most likely to recommend Company X
to friends or family, even though fewer customers on the Finnish market compared to the
other markets rated their satisfaction regarding their overall experience with a 5. The
findings also indicated that the customers on the Danish and the Finnish markets were the
most satisfied with the overall experience, whereas the Norwegian and the Swedish
customers were less satisfied with the overall experience. Thus, the results showed that
84

differences in customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend a
company to others, between Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark, could be detected,
which answered the first research question.
The second research question was answered by analysing the responses to the open-ended
feedback on each market. Company X’s willingness to help the customers and deliver the
service in a timely manner was the most determining factor influencing the Swedish,
Finnish, Norwegian and Danish customers’ rating regarding their willingness to
recommend Company X to family or friends. As the four studied countries are all
classified as individualistic societies according to Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, the
emphasis on responsiveness in service was supported by the findings of the study by
Khashkhuu (2016), where a positive relationship between individualism and
responsiveness was found, and thus, suggests that those from individualistic societies
expect others to be efficient, and in addition, require a high level of service quality.
On the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish markets, the need for empathy in service was an
important factor influencing the customers’ willingness to recommend Company X to
family or friends, whereas the Finnish customers did not consider empathy to be an
important factor influencing their willingness to recommend. Instead, trust and
confidence, as well as the service provider’s ability to deliver the service accurately and
dependably, was more important among the Finnish customers. In addition, the Finnish
customers put stronger emphasis on tangibles, which in this study referred to Company
X’s websites.
The analysis of the open-ended responses also answered the third research question, as the
results showed that a lack of responsiveness in the service was the main reason for
dissatisfaction among the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish customers, whereas the main
reason for dissatisfaction among the Finnish customers was Company X’s inability to
provoke trust and confidence. The main reason for satisfaction in Sweden, Norway and
Denmark was Company X’s ability to provide caring and individualised service, whereas

85

the main reasons for satisfaction among the Finnish customers were responsiveness and
reliability in the service.
In summary, the qualitative analysis of the responses to the open-ended questions showed
that the cultural differences in customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to
recommend were detectable between Finland and the three other markets, whereas the
cultural differences in customer satisfaction and willingness to recommend were less
visible between Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Thus, the findings of this study suggest
that customers on the Finnish market judge the quality of a service differently than the
customers on the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish markets. The analysis was supported
by Hofstede’s framework, which implies that there are differences between Finland and
the three other markets based on the country scores on the dimensions for uncertainty
avoidance, masculinity and power distance.
Donthu and Yoo (1998) argue that it is essential for companies to know the level of
expectations among the customers in order to deliver a service that will satisfy the
customers. Acknowledging the differences that might exist between cultures and using
that knowledge as a tool to develop the business, is according to Kotler and Keller (2006)
a highly valuable ability in the competitive international marketplace. Therefore, the
findings of this study offer valuable insights in understanding the influence of culture on
customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend a company to others,
which is of great importance for companies operating within the Nordic region in order to
develop and improve the service, and thus, ensuring high levels of customer satisfaction
and customer referrals by meeting the expectations of the customers on these markets.

7.2

Managerial Implications

In order for companies operating across the Nordic region to maintain high levels of
customer satisfaction, and thus, increasing the number of customer referrals, the influence
of culture on customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend a
company to others ought to be taken into consideration. Very little previous research has
focused on analysing the influence of culture on consumer behaviour between the Nordic
86

countries. Therefore, this study has contributed to the understanding of cross-cultural
differences within the Nordic region, and thus, shed light on the fact that international
managers need to acknowledge cross-cultural differences when comparing customer
feedback and when targeting the consumers on Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian and Danish
markets.
This study has shown that people from different cultures judge the same service differently
based on differences in the perceived quality, and thus, all customers within the Nordic
region cannot be treated in the same way. In order to meet the needs of the customers, and
thus, ensure that the customers are kept satisfied and remain willing to recommend the
company or service to others, international managers need to take the influence of culture
into account. The results of this study indicated that the cultural differences between the
markets cannot be overlooked, and instead of treating the Nordics as one entity, the
cultural differences between the markets needs to be acknowledged in order to improve
the customer service, and thus, ensuring high levels of customer satisfaction and customer
referrals on the markets.

7.3

Limitations & suggestions for further research

The aim of this study was to provide a deeper understanding of the influence of culture on
customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend a company to others.
Although this study has provided valuable insight into cross-cultural differences between
Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark, in regard to customer satisfaction and the
customers’ willingness to recommend a company to others, this study contains some
limitations that need to be considered in order to understand the conclusions that can be
made from the findings.
The study was conducted by analysing customer feedback on the Swedish, Finnish,
Norwegian and Danish markets, collected by Company X. The study is therefore limited
to the customers of Company X. As Company X is an international insurance company
that offers insurance services on behalf of its business partners, the study is also closely
tied to the insurance sector. Therefore, it would be interesting to conduct the same study
87

within another industry, as Wilson et al. (2016) argue that the five dimensions of service
quality applies to multiple service contexts.
According to Saunders et al. (2007), a larger sample size decreases the likely errors in
generalizing the findings to the population. Although the large sample size used in this
study offered great advantages, the differences in the response rate between the markets
limited the number of responses to the open-ended questions that were analysed. As
Saunders et al. (2007) argue that survey-based secondary data with a high response rate is
likely to be more reliable than survey data that have a low response rate, the lower
response rate on the Danish market made the interpretation of the results more
challenging. Therefore, as the qualitatively analysed responses in this study were limited
to two questions in the questionnaire, a possible area of future research would be to
analyse responses to other open-ended questions in the questionnaire in order to confirm
the findings of this study.
This study showed that differences, in regard to customer satisfaction and the customers’
willingness to recommend a company to others, between Sweden, Finland, Norway and
Denmark could be detected. However, as previous studies suggest that cultural differences
are likely to have an impact on the NPS scores, the influence of culture on NPS ought to
be considered when comparing NPS results between different markets. Thus, in order to
draw conclusions about these findings, tests of statistical significance should be
implemented, as other factors, such as cultural differences, or differences in the provided
service, are likely to have an impact on the NPS scores.
Thus, although this study has detected differences between Sweden, Finland, Norway and
Denmark, in regard to customer satisfaction and the customers’ willingness to recommend
a company to others, as well as contributed with valuable insights into cultural differences
regarding service quality perceptions, further research on the Swedish, Finnish,
Norwegian and Danish markets is needed in order to gain a more comprehensive
understanding of the relationship between customer satisfaction and the customers’
willingness to recommend a company to others.

Swedish Summary – Svensk Sammanfattning

Hur påverkar (nationell) kultur kundnöjdheten och kundernas vilja att rekommendera?
En jämförelse av svensk, finsk, norsk och dansk kundfeedback
8.1

Inledning

Allt fler företag betraktar idag kundnöjdhet som en nyckel till framgång. Kunder som är
nöjda med en produkt eller en tjänst talar fördelaktigt om företaget i fråga, medan
missnöjda kunder med stor sannolikhet sprider negativ, samt ofta även överdriven,
information om företaget till andra (Schiffman & Wisenblit, 2014). För företag som inte
marknadsför sig direkt till slutkonsumenterna, utan istället erbjuder en tjänst på ett annat
företags vägnar, är upprätthållandet av en hög nivå av kundnöjdhet av ytterst stor
betydelse. Därför mäter företag aktivt både kundnöjdhet och missnöje bland sina kunder
(Kotler & Armstrong, 2008).
På grund av att allt fler företag idag har expanderat sin verksamhet utanför sin nationella
gräns, påverkas företagen av den mångkulturella omgivningen på ett flertal olika sätt.
Eftersom majoriteten av de misstag som sker på den internationella marknaden orsakas av
en bristande förståelse av andra länders kulturella värderingar (Neelankavil & Rai, 2009),
kan internationella marknadsförare inte kan blunda för den påverkan kulturen har inom
internationell affärsverksamhet (Hollensen, 2012). För internationella företag utgör
nationerna det mest synliga kulturella lagret. Nationella kulturer har analyserats och
studerats på en mängd olika sätt, av vilka Hofstedes kulturdimensionsteori utgör den mest
använda metoden att studera kultur på (Shenkar m.fl., 2014).
För att stärka kundupplevelserna, samt höja kundnöjdheten, bör internationella företag ta
kulturens påverkan i beaktande när de analyserar och jämför kundfeedback mellan olika
marknader. Att förstå skillnaderna, och likheterna, mellan kulturer utgör en värdefull
förmåga på den konkurrenskraftiga internationella marknaden (Kotler & Keller, 2016).
Usunier och Lee (2013) menar att sättet människor uppfattar och utvärderar tjänster på
tenderar att variera i olika länder, och därför kommer människor från olika kulturer
sannolikt att bedöma samma tjänst på olika sätt baserat på skillnader i den upplevda
89

kvaliteten. För företag som använder olika kundupplevelsemått som en indikation på
tillväxtpotentialen inom företaget, är det ytterst viktigt att få en djupare förståelse av hur
kulturella skillnader kan påverka kundnöjdheten och kundernas vilja att rekommendera
företaget till andra.

8.2

Avhandlingens syfte och forskningsfrågor

Syften med avhandlingen är att ge en djupare förståelse för kulturens påverkan på
kundnöjdheten och kundernas vilja att rekommendera ett företag till andra. Huvudsyftet
är att undersöka de kulturella skillnaderna mellan kunder i Sverige, Finland, Norge och
Danmark, vilket är av ytterst stor betydelse för företag med affärsverksamhet i de nordiska
länderna. Även om tidigare studier undersökt kulturens påverkan på kundnöjdheten, finns
det ytterst få studier som fokuserat på kulturella skillnader mellan de nordiska länderna.
För att stödja syftet med denna studie, har följande forskningsfrågor formulerats:
- Kan skillnader i kundnöjdhet och kunders vilja att rekommendera ett företag till
familj eller vänner upptäckas mellan Sverige, Finland, Norge och Danmark?
- Vilken inverkan har kulturen på kundernas vilja att rekommendera företaget till
familj eller vänner?
- Finns det kulturella skillnader mellan den öppna feedbacken av nöjda respektive
missnöjda kunder?

8.3

Teori

Kundnöjdhet ses inom företag som en nyckel till att behålla och nå ut till nya kunder, och
därför strävar många företag efter att inte bara möta kundernas förväntningar, utan snarare
till att skapa förtjusning hos dem (Kotler & Armstrong, 2008). Kundernas förväntningar
har en avgörande roll i tillfredsställelsesprocessen, eftersom kundens förväntningar har en
betydande inverkan på om kunden kommer att känna sig nöjd eller inte (Güngör, 2007).
Därför undersöker allt fler företag aktivt kundnöjdhet, och missnöje, bland kunderna
(Kotler & Keller, 2016).

90

Enligt Kotler & Keller (2016) är kundnöjdheten också beroende av produktens eller
tjänstens kvalitet. Enligt Usunier och Lee (2013) tenderar serviceuppfattningar att variera
i olika länder, och därför kommer människor från olika kulturer sannolikt att bedöma
samma tjänst olika utifrån skillnader i den upplevda kvaliteten (Usunier & Lee, 2013).
Forskning har identifierat fem specifika dimensioner av servicekvalitet, vilka är:
tillförlitlighet, tjänstvillighet, försäkran, empati och materiella ting.
Varje interaktion som en kund har med ett företag kan ses som en upplevelse (Peppers
m.fl., 2016) och därför formas kundupplevelsen av allt som företaget gör (Villani, 2018).
För att säkerställa en positiv kundupplevelse måste ett företag veta vad kunderna anser
vara viktigt vid varje tillfälle de har att göra med företaget (Wilson et al., 2016). Därför
implementerar allt fler företag en kundupplevelsestrategi, vilket enligt Villani (2018)
innebär att ständigt samla in feedback från kunderna. Detta bidrar med insikter som
företagen kan ha hjälp av för att kunna förbättra kundernas upplevelser.
Medan kundnöjdhet kan definieras som en känsla, kan kundlojalitet beskrivas som ett
beteende (Goldstein, 2009). Förhållandet mellan kundnöjdhet och kundlojalitet är
betydelsefullt, eftersom majoriteten av de tidigare studierna visar att högre kundnöjdhet
leder till ökad lojalitet bland kunderna (Kotler & Armstrong, 2008). Enligt Kotler och
Armstrong (2008) kommer kunder som är nöjda att förbli lojala och även tala fördelaktigt
om företaget med andra. Att kunderna vill rekommendera företaget till familj eller vänner
är speciellt viktigt för företag som inte marknadsför sig till slutkonsumenterna.
Det finns många olika metoder för att undersöka kundnöjdheten inom ett företag, av vilka
frågeformulär är den vanligaste metoden (Kotler & Keller, 2016). Det är dock vanligt att
företag har mer data än vad de kan hantera (Villani, 2018) och därför menar Brown (1996)
att alla företag borde begränsa data till några få nyckeltal som är kopplade till företagets
framgång. Net Promoter Score (NPS) har blivit ett mycket populärt mått bland företag för
att mäta kundernas lojalitet, genom att fråga kunderna hur gärna de rekommenderar
produkten, tjänsten eller företaget till släktingar eller vänner (Kotler & Keller, 2016). Ett
annat vanligt mått företag använder sig av är CSAT, dvs. Customer Satisfaction Score,
91

som fokuserar på frågorna vad och hur i kundupplevelsen, genom att fråga kunderna hur
nöjda de var med produkten eller tjänsten (Verhoef m.fl., 2015).
Kultur har förblivit ett komplext begrepp (Ng m.fl., 2006), vilket även har resulterat i en
mängd olika definitioner av ordet kultur (Hollensen, 2012). De Jong (2009) menar dock
att alla definitioner hänvisar till ett fenomen som utformats av människan och som
överförs från generation till generation. För att förstå kulturella skillnader är det vanligt
bland marknadsförare att dela upp kulturer efter nationalitet (Usunier & Lee, 2013).
Usunier

och

Lee

(2013)

menar

att

nationella

gränser

kan

användas

för

marknadssegmentering inom internationell marknadsföring eftersom regionala skillnader
inom länder ofta är mycket mindre än internationella skillnader.
Hofstedes kulturella dimensioner är idag det mest använda ramverket för att förstå
kulturella skillnader mellan länder. Hofstedes ramverk bygger på tanken att människor
från olika länder uppfattar och tolkar omvärlden på olika sätt (Hollensen, 2012). Hofstedes
ramverk består idag av sex dimensioner: maktdistans, individualism kontra kollektivism,
maskulinitet kontra femininitet, osäkerhetsundvikande, samt de senare tillagda
dimensionerna lång kontra kort tidsorientering (Usunier & Lee, 2013) och tillfredställelse
kontra återhållsamhet (Hofstede, 2011).
Data på nationell nivå används regelbundet inom internationell marknadsföring, och det
anses vara ett korrekt tillvägagångssätt så länge det finns någon meningsfull grad av
likheter inom ett land och skillnader mellan länderna. Eftersom en chef inom ett
internationellt företag oftast varken har tid eller resurser att analysera en viss kultur på
djupet, kan en förståelse av de mest utmärkande kulturella skillnaderna ge en meningsfull
vägledning för att utveckla företagets strategi (Hollensen, 2012). Därför kan
generalisering fungera som en rättvis vägledning när man jämför kulturella skillnader
mellan nationer (Lewis, 2006). Eftersom Hofstedes dimensioner av nationella kulturer
etablerades på nationell nivå, kan Hofstedes ramverk användas för att undersöka och
analysera kulturella skillnader mellan Sverige, Finland, Norge och Danmark, avseende
kundnöjdhet och kundernas vilja att rekommendera en tjänst till andra.
92

8.4

Metod

Forskningsfrågorna i denna studie analyseras med hjälp av en tvärkulturell studie av
företag X:s kundfeedback, då det gäller kundnöjdheten och viljan att rekommendera
företaget till familj eller vänner, på den svenska, finska, norska och danska marknaden.
Datakällan som används i denna studie är ett frågeformulär, som företag X regelbundet
skickar till sina kunder efter att kunderna utnyttjat en tjänst av företag X. Företag X är ett
internationellt försäkringsbolag som erbjuder olika slags försäkringstjänster på uppdrag
av sina affärspartners. De tjänster som företag X tillhandahåller berör relativt stora
skadeanspråk.
Datakällan i denna studie kan betecknas som sekundärdata, vilket innebär att data
ursprungligen har samlats in av någon annan forskare (Bryman & Bellman, 2013) och för
något annat ändamål (Saunders m.fl., 2007). Användning av sekundär data sparar både tid
och pengar och samtidigt skapar det möjligheter för tvärkulturell analys (Bryman & Bell,
2013; Krishnaswami & Satyaprasad, 2010). Totalt bestod datakällan av 3902 svar från
den svenska, finska, norska och danska marknaden.
Denna studie har genomförts genom att kombinera både kvantitativa och kvalitativa
forskningskomponenter i samma studie. Enligt Saunders m.fl. (2007) kan användningen
av både kvantitativa och kvalitativa metoder skapa bättre möjligheter att svara på
forskningsfrågorna, samt att utvärdera om studiens resultat kan ses som tillförlitliga. På
grund av den stora mängden data som fanns tillgänglig, användes det totala antalet svar
på frågeformuläret enbart för den kvantitativa analysen. Däremot analyserades enbart en
begränsad mängd svar (100 svar per marknad) kvalitativt. För att presentera de
kvantitativa resultaten användes diagram för att visa förekomstfrekvenser, medan de
kvalitativa data analyserades genom att kategorisera svaren på de öppna frågorna enligt
de fem dimensionerna av servicekvalitet: tillförlitlighet, tjänstvillighet, försäkran, empati
och materiella ting.

93

8.5

Resultat

Resultaten av den kvantitativa analysen visade att de finska kunderna var mest benägna
att rekommendera företag X till familj eller vänner, medan de svenska kunderna var minst
benägna att rekommendera. Resultaten visade också att kunderna på den danska och den
finska marknaden var mest nöjda med den totala upplevelsen, medan de norska och de
svenska kunderna var mindre nöjda med den totala upplevelsen. Resultaten visade också
att de svenska, norska och danska kunderna som betygsatte sin totala upplevelse med 4
var mindre villiga att bedöma sin sannolikhet att rekommendera företag X till familj eller
vänner med 9 eller 10 jämfört med de finska kunderna.
Den kvalitativa analysen av svaren på de öppna frågorna, givna av både nöjda kunder och
missnöjda kunder på den svenska, finska, norska och danska marknaden, visade att företag
X:s vilja att hjälpa kunderna och leverera tjänsten inom den utsatta tiden var den mest
avgörande faktorn som påverkade kundernas vilja att rekommendera företag X till familj
eller vänner. Behovet av empati var starkast på den svenska marknaden, följt av den
danska och norska marknaden, medan endast 7 av 100 kunder på den finska marknaden
nämnde empati inom servicen som en avgörande faktor som påverkat deras vilja att
rekommendera företag X till familj eller vänner.
Förtroende och tillit, samt pålitlighet och tjänsteleverantörens förmåga att leverera
tjänsten korrekt, var viktigare för de finska kunderna jämfört med kunderna på de andra
marknaderna. Dessutom, i jämförelse med svaren på de andra marknaderna, inkluderade
svaren på den finska marknaden betydligt mer feedback, både positiv och negativ, om
företag X:s webbsidor. Detta tyder på att finska kunder lägger större vikt vid materiella
ting i tjänsten.
Resultatet av jämförelsen mellan svaren av de nöjda respektive de missnöjda kunderna
visade att företag X:s oförmågor att hjälpa kunderna och leverera tjänsten inom den utsatta
tiden var den mest avgörande faktorn som påverkade de svenska, norska och danska
kundernas vilja att rekommendera företag X till familj eller vänner. Huvudorsaken till
missnöje bland de finska kunderna var företag X:s oförmåga att bygga förtroende och tillit
94

hos kunderna. Resultatet visade också att företag X:s förmåga att tillhandahålla
omtänksam och personlig service var den främsta anledningen till nöjdhet på den svenska,
norska och danska marknaden. De främsta skälen till nöjdhet bland de finska kunderna
var tjänstvillighet och tillförlitlighet i servicen.

8.6

Analys och slutsatser

Baserat på Hofstedes jämförelse av kulturer med hjälp av de kulturella dimensionerna,
klassificeras Sverige, Finland, Norge och Danmark som individualistiska och feminina
samhällen. Jämförelsen visar dock att Finland anses vara ett osäkerhetsundvikande
samhälle, medan Sverige, Danmark och Norge har en högre tolerans för osäkra och
obekanta situationer. Dessutom har Sverige, Norge och Danmark något högre poäng på
dimensionen individualism och även lite lägre poäng på maskulinitetsdimensionen
jämfört med Finland. Därför tyder jämförelsen baserad på Hofstedes kulturella
dimensioner på att det finns kulturella skillnader mellan länderna.
Resultaten av den kvantitativa analysen identifierade skillnader mellan marknaderna, då
det gäller kundnöjdhet och kundernas vilja att rekommendera företag X till familj eller
vänner. Eftersom resultaten av tidigare studier dock indikerat att kulturella skillnader har
en sannolik påverkan på NPS resultaten, bör kulturens inverkan på NPS tas i beaktande
när man jämför NPS resultat mellan olika marknader. Eftersom Finland är ett samhälle
som undviker hög osäkerhet tyder resultaten på att kunderna från Finland vill minska
eventuella risker förknippade med det okända och därför är mer villiga att förbli lojala
mot företaget, vilket kan generera en högre NPS på finska marknaden jämfört med de
övriga marknaderna.
Analysen av svaren på de öppna frågorna visade hur kulturella skillnader påverkar
kundnöjdheten och kundernas vilja att rekommendera företaget till andra. Enligt
Hofstedes kulturella dimensioner är Sverige, Finland, Norge och Danmark
individualistiska samhällen. Resultaten av studien av Khashkhuu (2016) visade att det
fanns ett positivt samband mellan individualism och tjänstvillighet, vilket tyder på att
människor från individualistiska samhällen kräver en hög servicekvalitet och även
95

förväntar sig att andra skall vara effektiva. De fyra länderna klassificeras även som låga
maktdistanssamhällen, och därför förväntar sig konsumenter på dessa marknader att bli
mer involverade i beslutsfattande och att makten skall vara jämnare fördelad i samhället
(Hollensen, 2012). Eftersom tjänstvillighet i servicen var den viktigaste faktorn som
påverkade de svenska, finska, norska och danska kundernas vilja att rekommendera
företag X till familj eller vänner, stöder den tidigare forskningen resultaten av analysen.
Analysen av svaren på de öppna frågorna visade tydliga skillnader vad gäller kundernas
behov av empati i servicen. Även om Donthu och Yoo (1998) hävdar att konsumenter från
individualistiska samhällen förväntar sig att tjänsteleverantören visar empati, ansågs
empati inte vara en viktig faktor för de finska kunderna. Resultaten av studien av Donthu
och Yoo (1998) antydde dock även att konsumenter från samhällen som undviker hög
osäkerhet inte ser relationen med ett företagets kundtjänst som viktig. Istället används
materiella tillgångar för att minska närheten i interaktionen med tjänsteleverantören
(Khashkhuu, 2016). Detta antydde även resultaten av denna analys, eftersom materiella
tillgångar i tjänsten betonades starkare på den finska marknaden.
Studien visade att tillförlitlighet i tjänsten var viktig för kunderna på den finska
marknaden. Enligt Hofstedes kulturdimensionsteori, är trovärdighet och enhetlighet i
service viktigare för människor från samhällen med hög osäkerhet. Studien av Khashkhuu
(2016), som visade ett positivt samband mellan osäkerhets undvikande och tillförlitlighet,
stödde därmed även denna analys. Analysen visade även att det fanns tydliga skillnader i
orsakerna till nöjdhet och missnöje mellan kunderna från de olika marknaderna. Analysen
visade att de kulturella skillnaderna, då det gäller kundnöjdhet och kundernas vilja att
rekommendera företaget till andra, inte är iögonfallande mellan Sverige, Norge och
Danmark. Däremot visade studien att skillnaderna är större mellan Finland och de tre
andra marknaderna. Analysen visade att majoriteten av skillnaderna mellan Finland och
de tre andra marknaderna påverkas av skillnader i ländernas poängsättning på
dimensionerna för osäkerhetsundvikande, maktdistans och maskulinitet. Således kan
skillnaderna i kultur mellan marknaderna, vad gäller kundnöjdhet och kundernas vilja att

96

rekommendera

ett

företag

till

andra,

förstås

med

hjälp

av

Hofstedes

kulturdimensionsteori.
Den här studien har visat att människor från olika kulturer bedömer samma tjänst olika
utifrån skillnader i den upplevda kvaliteten. För att möta kundernas behov, och därmed
säkerställa att kunderna förblir nöjda och rekommenderar företaget eller tjänsten till andra,
måste internationella chefer ta hänsyn till påverkan av kulturen. Resultaten av denna
studie indikerade att de kulturella skillnaderna mellan marknaderna inte kan förbises, och
istället för att behandla Norden som en enhet måste företag ta de kulturella skillnaderna
mellan marknaderna i beaktande för att förbättra kundservicen och därmed säkerställa en
hög nivå av kundnöjdhet och rekommendationer gällande servicen till andra.
Eftersom denna studie är begränsad till kundresponsen inom företag X, som är ett
internationellt försäkringsbolag, kunde det vara intressant att utföra samma studie inom
en annan bransch, samt även analysera svaren på flera frågor i formuläret, för att bekräfta
resultaten av denna studie. På grund av att resultaten av tidigare studier tyder på att
kulturella skillnader kan ha en inverkan på NPS resultatet, bör kulturens inverkan på NPS
även beaktas när man jämför NPS-resultat mellan olika marknader. För att fastställa om
de möjliga skillnaderna mellan olika marknader är signifikanta med avseende på
tvärkulturella skillnader eller om de orsakas av kulturella skillnader i sättet att svara på
enkäter, uppmanar Dolnicar och Grün (2007) därför företag att göra en statistiska test på
svarsmönstren.
Även om denna studie har upptäckt skillnader mellan Sverige, Finland, Norge och
Danmark, vad gäller kundnöjdhet och kundernas vilja att rekommendera ett företag till
andra, samt bidragit med värdefulla insikter om kulturella skillnader när det gäller
uppfattningar om tjänstens kvalitet, krävs det ytterligare forskning på den svenska, finska,
norska och danska marknaden för att få en mer övergripande förståelse för sambandet
mellan kundnöjdhet och kundernas vilja att rekommendera ett företag till andra.
