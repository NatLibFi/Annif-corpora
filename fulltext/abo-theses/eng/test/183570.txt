Abstract
Internationalisation has increased the mobility of students and teachers, the establishment of
networks, as well as research and academic programmes. Despite the large amount of
research within the field of education, more research is still necessary concerning international
networking in e-learning environments and cultural exchange online.
Telecollaboration contributes to the cultivation of intercultural competence, which is needed for
internationalisation. The development of new technologies has facilitated practices of
intercultural communication.
The present study explores the intercultural competence in learning Spanish as a foreign
language in Finnish higher education. It focuses on the telecollaboration between students
from two European universities: Hanken School of Economics in Vaasa, Finland, and Utrecht
University in the Netherlands, in an attempt to communicate in a lingua franca. The participants
collaborated by videoconference, in intercultural groups, and in order to accomplish a common
task based on different cultures. Their assignment was part of the oral assessment of the
Spanish courses in their respective universities. The targets of the telecollaboration were to
develop linguistic skills in Spanish as a foreign language, to enhance media literacy, and to
promote intercultural communicative competence.
The purpose of this study is to examine the participants’ attitudes and behaviour while
developing intercultural competence in their virtual exchange. In order to accomplish this, the
study is based on a theoretical framework composed by the Intercultural Competence Model
of Deardorff (2006). The models of other authors were also regarded as support to the study.
A virtual ethnographical approach was applied so as to obtain answers to the research
questions. The data was gathered from video observations, and the videos were recorded
during the respondents’ online interaction. The results show that the students presented
appropriate attitudes and behaviour for developing intercultural competence in their
telecollaboration with peer students from other cultures.
Similar studies could be carried out to enhance the use of telecollaboration in higher education
in Finland and other European countries. This could, in turn, enhance the possibilities for
intercultural exchange and help to expand interculturalism.

1. Introduction
As a powerful phenomenon in the higher education context since the 90s, internationalisation
has increased the mobility of students and teachers, the establishment of networks, as well as
the research and the academic programmes (Dodou, 2016). However, this remarkable
evolution over the past 25 years is questioned by Wit and Knight (2018) who emphasise the
need for widening the research in relation to internationalisation.
Technology has contributed to create interactions across cultures around the world to become
a common practice and research field in our global 21st century (Durden, Taylor, De Guzmán,
Guzmán & Potthoff, 2016) and the development of communication technologies have also
facilitated

intercultural communication

eluding

the need of

geographic

closeness

(Arasaratnam, 2016).
Virtual exchange embraces the term telecollaboration, an area of Computer Assisted
Language Learning (CALL), research and practice that originated in the 90s. The research
field has developed considerably in the past 30 years. Learning outcomes, gains, and
difficulties from teachers’ and researchers’ perspectives have been extensively studied (Helm,
2015). Nevertheless, the students’ perspective needs to be further considered. Most research
examines the exchange of languages in an eTandem1 context (O’Rourke, 2007); nonetheless
this current study focuses on the telecollaboration between non-native speakers, who are
students from two different European universities and attempt to communicate in Spanish,
their lingua franca. The trend of online practices in higher education based on the development
of students’ lingua franca appears to be rising although mainly concerning the English
language (O’Dowd, 2016; Godwin-Jones, 2019).
The use of virtual exchanges in language teaching at tertiary education is constantly increasing
despite the wide range of students’ exchange mobility programmes at offer. The Finnish
National Agency for Education promotes these programmes with the argument that they are
essential for the internationalisation of higher education. However, the participation of students
from Finland in mobility programmes appears to have decreased (Finnish National Agency for
Education, 2018; 2021) over the last years and significantly nowadays due to the coronavirus
pandemic. Telecollaboration allows the students to study at home and abroad at the same
time, avoiding the physical relocation and the related additional costs. Furthermore, according
to O’Dowd (2006), telecollaboration contributes to develop intercultural competence.
This current study investigates university students’ intercultural competence when they
collaborate online, using electronic technologies to accomplish a common task. Intercultural
1

students who are native speakers of one language learn the mother tongue of the other and vice versa.

competence is defined as the ability of a person to interact and build important relations with
people from varied cultural backgrounds (Arasaratnam, 2016). Intercultural competence is
developmental (Arasaratnam, 2016), and collaborative learning facilitates its development
(Zhang, 2012).
The use of audiovisual media is suggested by the Common European Framework of Reference
for Languages (CEFR) as a teaching method in foreign languages. The CEFR likewise
expresses that the emotional-affective aspect is important for the development of attitudes
toward the target language and socio-culture. In foreign language teaching the socio-cultural
component and the linguistic component converge (2001). Since the relation between
language and culture is essential, teachers of foreign languages are expected to find methods
to incorporate Intercultural Communicative Competence (ICC) in their language education
(Çiftçi & Savaş, 2018).
My profession as a pedagogue of Spanish is endorsed by more than two decades of language
teaching experience in Finland. My work has focused mainly on coaching youngsters and
adults, at international enterprises and educational institutions, in formal and non-formal
education. In my teaching I have created and incorporated varied and innovative methods. I
have also participated in different European projects. I hold a master’s degree in Audiovisual
Communication and as a lifelong learner I continue to consolidate my knowledge in order to
progress in my career in the field of education, especially in Digital Didactics.
My own concern about interculturalism and internationalisation, my interest in ICT, and my
passion for language teaching and collaboration with other countries and cultures, bring me to
consider my personal options in sharing my enthusiasm with the students at Hanken School
of Economics in Vaasa, Finland. It is pleasant to give them the opportunity to use new methods,
breaking walls and geographical limits with the help of technology. The attempt of broadening
the knowledge base for my teaching constitutes an incentive to undertake this study.

1.1 Aim of the study and research questions
The aim of this study is to investigate intercultural competence in telecollaboration in higher
education. The research questions are:
1.

How do students express attitudes during intercultural telecollaboration?

2.

How do students behave when interacting in intercultural telecollaboration?

The questions are related to Deardorff’s Model of Intercultural Competence explained in
chapter 2. The first question aims to examine the students’ expressions of attitude towards the

5

cultures of others when collaborating online. The attitudes constitute the first step in the
process of Intercultural Competence regarding Deardorff’s model and are categorized in
respect, openness, and curiosity and discovery. The purpose of the second question is to find
different perspectives of the students’ intercultural communication competence in their virtual
interaction. It refers the last step in Deardorff’s model and includes appropriate communication
and behaviour.
In order to obtain the answer to these questions, a virtual ethnographical approach was
applied. A deductive theory-driven analysis was implemented to evaluate the findings. Data
were collected by observation of videos recorded during the students’ online interplay. The
students from the two European universities collaborated by videoconference in intercultural
groups and on two tasks as part of the oral assessment of the Spanish courses in their
respective universities. Being the respondents’ teacher, I stay directly involved in the
phenomena of this study. As e-ethnographer, my role centres on uncovering and analysing the
students’ relevant attitudes and behaviour of the investigated culture.

1.2 Sequence of the study
The structure of the thesis is as follows: Chapter 1 is a short summary of the study. It includes
an introduction of the subject of the study, the aim of the study and the research questions, the
sequence of the study, and the definitions of the main concepts and context needed for better
understanding of the thesis. Chapter 2 presents the theoretical framework. It contains the
previous research on the subject and the theory that explains and predicts the phenomena
being investigated. The compendium of models puts together the foundation and pillars of the
current research. Chapter 3 is dedicated to the research strategy, approach and method. The
results of the research are presented in Chapter 4 and thereupon discussed in Chapter 5. A
list of references retrieved for this study can be found in the last part. The thesis ends with the
Appendices and Acknowledges.

1.3 Definition of terms and context
The central concepts of the thesis are telecollaboration, in a specific context mentioned as ecollaboration, and interculturalism. Telecollaboration has been defined in different ways; three
terms and the current trend will be explained below. Interculturalism and multiculturalism need
also to be clarified in order to consequently understand the concept intercultural competence,
the core in this study.

6

E-collaboration or telecollaboration
Collaboration is defined as the interplay between communication, coordination, and
cooperation in the Encyclopedia of E-collaboration (Kock, 2008). Communication is the
conversation to negotiate and reach conclusions during an incremental process, coordination
is the supervision of people, activities and resources in circumstances of collaboration, and
cooperation means working together in the common workspace, by performing shared tasks
and with a mutual target.
Telecollaboration has been alternatively labelled with many terms concerning different
approaches, depending on the educational perspective and the pedagogical focus of the
professionals (O’Dowd, 2018). The terminology comprises the following notions: ecollaboration (Kock, 2005), telecollaboration (Guth & Helm, 2010; Helm, 2013), virtual
exchange (Helm, 2015), online intercultural exchange (OIE) (Thorne, O’Dowd & Lewis, 2016),
collaborative online international learning (COIL) (Rubin, 2017), and eTandem (O’Rourke,
2007).
The term e-collaboration embeds a broader concept than telecollaboration. Its industry related
origin is involved in Kock’s definition: ”… collaboration using electronic technologies among
different individuals to accomplish a common task” (Kock, 2005, p.1).
Telecollaboration is described by Guth and Helm (2010, p. 14), based on Byram’s definition
(1997), as an ”… internet-based intercultural exchange between people of different
cultural/national backgrounds, set up in an institutional context with the aim of developing both
language skills and intercultural communicative competence through structured tasks”. These
bilateral exchanges focus mainly on acquiring pragmatic competence or linguistic development
in a second language, but also on improving intercultural communication competence across
shared multicultural learning situations (Guth & Helm, 2010).
Telecollaboration has been the most referred of all terms as confirmed by the titles of the
immense quantity of research carried out in the context of foreign language learning in higher
education. Over time, the term “virtual exchange” appears to be positioned as covering the
different terminology applied on this certain field of practice (O’Dowd, 2012).
Interculturalism vs. multiculturalism
Interculturalism differs from the term multiculturalism regarding UNESCO’s guidelines.
Multicultural means culturally diverse and includes ethnical, national, linguistic, religious and
socio-economic diversity whilst intercultural refers to evolving relations between different
cultural groups. Interculturalism has been defined as “the existence and equitable interaction
of diverse cultures and the possibility of generating shared cultural expressions through
7

dialogue and mutual respect on a local, regional, national or international level” (Guidelines on
Intercultural Education, 2006, p. 17). Accordingly, in a multicultural society, cultural groups do
not need to interact with each other. Interculturalism is a more dynamic concept, that requests
multiculturalism and the exchange of the different cultures with understanding and respect
(Barret, 2013).
Omori (2017) notes that the terms intercultural communication and cross-cultural
communication can be interchanged at times. They discern in terms of the focus of the
research: intercultural communication focuses on the interaction with different cultures
meanwhile cross-cultural communication focuses additionally on comparing the different
cultures. This study is meant to focus on the interaction, not on the comparison of different
cultures and because of that the term intercultural communication is used.
Intercultural awareness and Intercultural communicative competence
Intercultural awareness and intercultural competence are noticeable concepts across research
concerning helping and educating people.
Awareness is described in the Encyclopedia of E-collaboration (Kock, 2009, p. 644) as “the
human beings’ capability of perceiving the activities of the others and their own activities in the
context of collaboration”. The definition adds that groupware or collaborative software
generally provides elements and information to enable awareness.
Intercultural awareness is fundamental in communication between people from different
cultures and comprises cultural self-awareness and awareness to others (Zhu, 2011). It needs
to be supplemented with cultural knowledge. To have cultural knowledge means to be familiar
with certain cultural characteristics, history, values, believes, and behaviours of another ethnic
group (Adams, 1995).
Intercultural competence is “the ability to communicate effectively and appropriately in
intercultural situations based on one’s intercultural knowledge, skills, and attitudes” (Deardorff,
2006, p. 249). Many other terms are used in literature referring intercultural competence as for
example cross-cultural awareness, which can cause confusion.
Regarding Coperías Aguilar (2010) the intercultural communication competence can be
understood as meaning the interaction in a foreign language, therefore the competence of the
participants in the exchange is also related to their language knowledge. People from different
countries and languages bring their knowledge about their own country and about that of the
others when they interact socially. The success of the interaction will partly depend on the
establishment and continuation of human relationships based on attitudinal factors. Knowledge

8

and attitude are influenced by the processes of intercultural communication. (Coperías Aguilar,
2010).
Both terms intercultural competence and intercultural communication competence can
nowadays be used indistinctly in communication literature (Arasaratnam, 2016).
The intercultural communicative competence can also be assumed as a crucial human
aptitude to subsist in today’s multicultural communication context (Tran & Seepho, 2016). Tran
& Pham (2017) reiterate the importance of developing this skill aiming to become an effective
intercultural communicator and fitting in the cross-cultural and globalized community.

2. Literature review
2.1 Prior research on telecollaborative and intercultural learning
The methodology of telecollaborative learning between language students from different
cultural backgrounds and locations has been applied by innumerable models and approaches,
considering diverse pedagogical objectives and learning contexts. Consequently, the research
in the educational field in regard to acquisition and development of language and intercultural
communicative competence within these telecollaborative environments is extensive.
The investigations have mainly been centred on the nomenclature of the concept
telecollaboration; the different initiatives applied in the telecollaborations; the difficulties
encountered by practitioners and participants in the implementation of the practices; the
students’ outcomes, and on the inclusion of this practice in academic programmes (O’Dowd,
2018). Nevertheless, telecollaboration continues expanding in academic terms regarding new
perspectives and focus as well as in non-tandem-based projects (O’Dowd, 2016).
The following sections provide a review of previous research that is significant for this study
concerning telecollaborative learning, intercultural competence and all three telecollaborative,
intercultural and linguistic learning.

2.1.1 Telecollaborative learning
Literature on telecollaborative learning in diverse disciplines is expansive.
O’Dowd, in an earlier study (2006) sustains that Network-based Language Teaching (NBLT)
and telecollaboration offer a powerful alternative to traditional classroom-based culture
learning methods, as they allow learners to interact and learn directly from actual members of
the target culture while remaining in their home environment. The students can be involved in

9

semi-authentic intercultural communication. They are given the opportunity of learning more
about their peers’ culture in a more real and inspiring way when connecting two multicultural
classes by activities such as creating websites together, discussing a book or a movie or
comparing their cultures (2006).
Intercultural communicative competence through telecollaboration (O’Dowd, 2011) refers to
the complexity of organizing and executing telecollaborative projects. However, the researcher
emphasises in this study that the research findings reviewed show the great potential that the
collaboration holds for the development of intercultural communicative competence in
education, after proving the rich intercultural learning both, teachers and students, experience
in these practices. Secondly, O’Dowd (2011) states that telecollaboration should be
understood as an essential practice in language programmes instead of just an extra activity
and therefore it should be integrated into foreign language education.
In his article Telecollaborative networks in university higher education: Overcoming barriers to
integration O’Dowd (2013) presents his findings from extensive quantitative and qualitative
studies on telecollaboration in European higher education. The research identifies the
difficulties found by the practitioners when organizing online intercultural exchanges at
university level and the strategies to overcome them.
After his participation at the Telecollaboration in higher education conference in Dublin on April
2016, O’Dowd identified some tendencies on this field that he complied in an article published
the same year. He anticipated the proliferation of practices in higher education based on the
development of students’ lingua franca (mainly English), which subsequently would expand
the telecollaborative partnerships and networks. In addition, he foresaw the increase of the
use of videoconferencing for online intercultural interaction.
In a recent work (2018), O’Dowd clarifies the terms telecollaboration and virtual exchange and
also presents an analysis of different initiatives and models of telecollaboration mainly
performed across higher education, in a tandem-basis, and in the European context. He
concludes the article by stating that all the varied and magnificent work performed in the field,
despite challenges and problems, shares common educational goals. Goals listed by Guth &
Helm (2010) as “… the development of transversal skills, digital literacies, intercultural
awareness and the ability to live and work together with people from other cultural
backgrounds”.
In her doctoral thesis, Canto (2020, p. 3) explains telecollaboration based on O’Dowd’s (2011)
definition as “the application of synchronous and asynchronous online communicate tools to
bring together (classes of) language learners in geographically distant location to develop their
foreign language skills and intercultural competence through collaborative task and project

10

work”. By reviewing different cases of video communication and virtual words, Canto studied
the effects of computer mediated communication through telecollaboration with native
speakers on foreign learning, by considering their understanding of target cultures. Her
empirical research showed that virtual collaborative exchanges endorse intercultural learning,
provide opportunities to develop cultural awareness and intercultural communicative
competence.

2.1.2 Intercultural competence
As Arasaratnam (2016) explains, intercultural competence has been a subject of study since
the 1960’s. Researchers already acknowledged some fundamental features as flexibility,
stability, curiosity, openness to other perspectives, and sensitivity in intercultural
communication when adapting to a new culture. Their work on identifying and assessing the
variables in acculturation2 continued in the next decade. This time they centred their
approaches on cross-cultural competence and effectiveness. In the 1980’s, they created a
special Journal (International Journal of Intercultural Relations) dedicated to ICC. The studies
continued referring to the interaction of two specific cultures and from interpersonal
communication extended to intercultural contexts. The research in the following decade raised
many theorems about the components of ICC. Effective and appropriate communication in
intercultural contexts represented the core of multiple studies. The question of competence as
innate and/or learned arose and the constitution of the International Academy for Intercultural
Research in 1997 meant important progress toward interdisciplinary collaboration in research
(Arasaratnam, 2016.)
The labels for this subject have been very diverse due to the multiple studies. However,
Deardorff proved in 2006 the consensus on ICC amongst experts and published the SAGE
Handbook of Intercultural Competence three years later (Arasaratnam, 2016). The consensus
among researchers consists of the fact that ICC refers to effectiveness, as the ability to achieve
one’s goals, as well as to appropriateness, i.e., to display estimated and accepted behaviour
in context (Arasaratnam & Banerjee, 2010).
Arasaratnam and Doerfel developed a model of ICC in 2005 after studying the ICC not from
one’s self-perspective but from the other’s perspective, encompassing this way various cultural
perspectives. By an inductive approach on the participants’ response, they counted five
variables which contribute to ICC: “… experience, listening skills, positive attitudes towards
other cultures, motivation to interact with people from other cultures, and ability to empathize

2

adaptation to a different culture, usually the dominant one

11

or enrol in cognitive and emotional role-taking behaviour.” (Arasaratnam & Banerjee, 2010, p.
227).
The need of measurement of ICC of the culturally diverse groups of participants in cooperation
programmes prompted Asaratnam (2009) to develop a new instrument of measure. A study
described the development and empirical testing of this tool by performing regression, factor
and correlation analyses. The instrument should not only evaluate a person’s ICC but also all
participants’ ICC with multiple cultural backgrounds. The promising results obtained led to
future research and potential models.
A new study implemented by Arasaratnam and Banerjee (2010) investigated for the first time
the relationship between sensation seeking and behaviours in intercultural communication,
and also how ethnocentrism3 effects the other variables in an intercultural communicative
context. Based on literature in health communication, the researchers started from the concept
that sensation seeking is a personality variable associated to adventure and risk. Furthermore,
sensation seekers enjoy experiences that are physiologically stimulating and related to intense
emotions. They gathered data from participants’ surveys and the results confirmed the positive
relationship between sensation seeking and ICC. The high sensation seekers appear to have
favourable attitudes toward those from other cultures and therefore motivation to search for
opportunities for intercultural interaction. The relationship between ethnocentrism and ICC
appeared to be negative despite the presence of the other positive variables: sensation
seeking, motivation to engage in ICC and attitude towards other cultures.
The subsequent Integrated Model of Intercultural Communication Competence (IMICC)
created by Arasaratnam and Banerjee generated new research. The authors investigated the
factors that influence cultural competency and developed a new model, analysed in section
2.1.3. Arasaratnam and Banerjee’s first model presented the following five variables that
conceptualise ICC: empathy, experience, motivation to engage in intercultural communication
or MTEEIIC, listening ability, and attitude towards other cultures or ATOC. The most recent
version of IMICC model incorporates the two previously tested variables: sensation seeking
and ethnocentrism. The attitudes between the university students towards other cultures are
one of the main components in this model. Although it was previously based on research only
addressed in the Western context, the authors encouraged researchers to extend their study
for the new model to develop. Research has already been conducted also even in other
continents. (Arasaratnam, 2017).

3

belief that one’s own culture is better than all others

12

Both, Deardorff’s model of Intercultural Competence and Arasaratnam’s Integrated Model of
Intercultural Communication Competence (IMICC) are examined and developed in next
section, building the theoretical framework of this study.
Besides the development of models for measurement, Arasaratnam’s wide research on
intercultural competence has contributed to the understanding of this very relevant concept
that grows alongside a world-wide diversity. She evokes the fact that a great part of the theories
in ICC stem from the United States and that the definition of intercultural competence as “the
ability to understand and interact with people of different cultures in authentic and positive
ways” is an occidental concept that could be furtherly studied (Arasaratnam, 2016, p. 1). The
majority of experts in the subject come from developed parts of the world, hence their point of
view does not represent manifold cultural views. In contemporary research, researchers need
to take into consideration that it cannot be assumed that participants in a dyadic intercultural
interaction come from only two distinct cultural perspectives, there might be those who are
bicultural or with blended cultural identities (Arasaratnam, 2016).
The definitions and terms of intercultural competencies are numerous according to Deardorff
(2009) and they depend on the language and culture. The consensus definition would be:
“communication and behaviour that is both effective and appropriate when interacting across
difference” (Deardorff, 2006, p.241).
Deardorff’s last book Manual for Developing Intercultural Competencies: Story Circles
(Routledge/UNESCO, 2020) presents a methodology for developing intercultural competence
in different contexts around the world; an overview of tools for the individuals to improve their
key elements (self-awareness, openness, respect, flexibility, empathy, awareness of others
and cultural humility) in order to “… understand, and appreciate difference, develop
relationships with those across difference, engage in intercultural dialogue, and bridge societal
divides”. (Deardorff, 2020, p. 1).
The opportunities for developing the intercultural competencies can be formal and non-formal,
but both comprise the three main domains of learning: cognitive, socio-emotional and
behavioural. Consequently, they will include communication and behaviour. Deardorff’s
overview is based on a formal approach: story circles. Deardorff reminds that the development
of intercultural competencies is a process for life, and for that reason a sole experience is not
enough if the objective is to develop intercultural competencies. However, if the objective is
the process itself then the development could be possible. That process’ goals could include
rising one’s own cultural self-awareness, awareness of others, connecting respect, increase
empathy and discovering similitudes with the most different. (Deardorff, 2020).

13

Deardorff’s model of intercultural communication (2008) supported by Arasaratnam’s models
constitute the main theorical base of this study.

2.1.3 Trends on telecollaboration
This section presents contemporary research and trends based on practices that relate to
intercultural and linguistical competence in telecollaborative projects.
Çiftçi and Savaş (2018) investigated 17 research papers published from 2010 to 2015, related
to language and intercultural learning within telecollaboration that excluded studies on tandem
basis. Individual studies were synthesized into a more theoretical level. Through their
qualitative meta-synthesis, they could report emerging research trends, observe patterns in
telecollaborative practices and identify six main subjects studied in the investigations. The
themes included research trends, the participants’ view on their experiences, language and
intercultural

learning

through

telecollaboration,

challenges

experienced

within

the

telecollaboration projects, and needs for more effective telecollaboration.
Within the research trends, Çiftçi and Savaş studied the technology applied and the
environments designed, the contexts, countries and participants of the studies and the varied
points of focus in telecollaborative language and intercultural learning. The majority of
participants showed positive telecollaborative experiences, based on lively engagement with
other students of the target language and from different cultures, and they admitted being
willing to participate in future telecollaborative projects. (Çiftçi and Savaş, 2018).
Godwin-Jones (2019), in his study “Telecollaboration as an approach to developing
intercultural communication competence.”, asserts Çiftçi and Savaş (2018) and other
researchers’ estimation that telecollaboration should be methodically implemented in foreign
language education because of its effectiveness in language acquisition and development of
intercultural

communicative

competence.

Nevertheless,

other

researchers

consider

telecollaboration ineffective when it is applied occasionally, and it can reinforce stereotypes in
cultures involved. Some studies support the use of telecollaboration as an important classbased guide for development of ICC whereas others believe in the autonomous learning by
accessing the multiple informal resources which are very easy to access online nowadays.
This and other great advances on telecollaboration in teaching education are observed in his
research, as the emerging trend of using lingua franca, predominantly English, in virtual
exchanges. The capability and effectiveness of native speakers as cultural and linguistic
experts in bilateral exchanges has been overestimated in previous practices. The native
speakers represent the power position in these exchanges meanwhile non-native speakers
remain in a more equivalent level. It appears that projects involving other foreign languages

14

are decreasing (O’Dowd, 2016), this trend could contribute to enforce the global position of the
English language world-wide, since it is also the lingua franca in global commerce and
communication, and to drop the promotion of plurilingualism and diversity. Accordingly, this
should boost us, other foreign language teachers, to proliferate the practices in
telecollaboration in order to contribute to the enforcement of diversity in globalization.
In the last years, the research on intercultural competence in telecollaborative projects and
other virtual exchanges has significantly increased. However, not all findings accomplish the
positive expectations. The article Building Intercultural Competence Through Virtual Team
Collaboration Across Global Classrooms (Swartz, Barbosa & Crawford, 2019) describes the
6-week collaboration online between pupils in three European countries. The researchers take
into account the cognitive, affective and behavioural factors on intercultural competence in
their investigation. They state that intercultural competence includes ICC and intercultural
sensitivity (i.e., the capability to identify differences in behaviour, perceptions and feelings in
intercultural communications), that differences between cultures exist, that there are difficulties
in intercultural interaction, and that collaboration can succeed when being aware of these
factors. They discuss the effectivity of their project in developing the students’ intercultural
competence by observing not only their ICC but their intercultural sensitivity. The first one is
based on the Intercultural Communication Competence scale developed by Arasaratnam
(2009) and the second is analysed by using the Intercultural Sensitivity Scale (ISS), which
focuses on the affective factor, and was developed by Chen and Starosta in 2000. ISS includes
five factors: intercultural engagement, respect for cultural differences, interaction confidence,
interaction enjoyment and interaction attentiveness (Swartz, Barbosa & Crawford, 2019).
Despite organizational difficulties due to students’ lack of commitment and the instructors’
differences in expectations and deadlines, the overall response expressed appreciation of the
experience. The project’s outcomes appeared to be positive, but the study also showed some
changes before and after the project regarding understanding, attitude and behavioural
awareness, and thus a growing dislike of intercultural interaction. Changes are categorized
under awareness of verbal, non-verbal, and paraverbal communication; appreciation of cultural
differences; ethnocentric tendencies and stereotypes plus fears, confidence, and awareness
of difficulties coping other cultures.
The instructors await encouraging their students in new telecollaborations. They refer StarkeMeyerring and Andrews’ (2006) emphasis in the need of enjoying despite the difficulties of
collaborative practices. The motivation to embrace joy in an intercultural learning experience,
although hesitation, is a prerequisite for instructors and students (2019). Investigation in future
projects is suggested so as to improve the participants’ awareness of cultural variances and
their aptitudes in intercultural interaction (2019).

2.2 Theories and models on culture and interaction
The different theories and models reviewed in this chapter basically focus on culture and
interaction, i.e. dimensions of culture, intercultural competence and awareness, as well as
communication in computer-supported workspaces.
To enter in context, or quite literally “to break the ice”, it is interesting to review the iceberg
analogy of culture developed by Hall (1959, 1976). This metaphor visualises that few aspects
of culture stand explicit, are observable and easy to identify as the tip of an iceberg. This part
can be felt by the senses and includes art, language, cooking, dancing, folk dresses, and other
elements commonly associated with culture. The superficial part formed by behaviour and
language is the visible summit, the formal level. By contrast, beneath the surface of the sea
where the iceberg floats, other manifestations of culture stay implicit, hardly revealed and
difficult to be observed but they cannot be ignored since they affect the behaviour that is visible
above the water. Attitudes, values, beliefs, communication style, perception, concept of time,
personal space, body language, cultural approach to interpersonal relationships, and social
norms are aspects corresponding to a deeper part. The real fundamentals are submerged in
the human subconscious, the informal level. (Hall, 1959.) He points out that culture is
communication and counterwise communication is culture. By trying to summarize the
meaning and inseparable connection of these two concepts he explains that each culture
influences the communication based on the cultural behaviours and it is culture itself that
communicates. The behaviours are apparent and when entering a new culture, the original
aspects that dictate those behaviours will be revealed. The cultural behaviours are
communication systems that are developed within different groups in interaction not just by the
communication itself. The expressive forms of communication are considered a reflection of
the culture that originated them. He sees culture as a structured system of codes, a space of
human interaction where communication takes place. (1976).

2.2.1 Dimensions of culture, an international view on interculturalism
In UNESCO’s Guidelines on Intercultural Education, interculturalism is defined as the presence
and engagement of different cultures, as well as the opportunity of generating common cultural
expressions in communication and mutual respect on local, regional, global, or international
basis. Interculturalism requests multiculturalism and the exchange of the different cultures with
understanding and respect. (2013).
The definitions of culture are countless inasmuch as perceived from different views depending
on the discipline and its nature (Nadeem, Mohammed & Dalib, 2017).

16

Geert Hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory (1980) has been used mainly to understand crosscultural differences in business, but it also applies to education.
The following graphic shows the six dimensions of culture:

Figure 1. Hofstede’s six categories that define culture. (Adapted from CFI Education Inc., 2015).

Taking into account Hofstede’s second dimension, Finland is characterised as a quite
individualist culture with 63 points out of 100 and the Netherlands hold an even higher score
of 80. Spain, on the other hand, grades with only 51 points. In individualist societies as the
Finnish and the Dutch, people prioritise their own interests over that of the group.
Communication may be more open and direct. The word “I” predominates over “we”. Individual
choices and decisions are expected to be taken and personal opinions may be asked for.
People may take individual initiatives in certain situations. “In individualist societies, offence
causes guilt and a loss of self-steem” (Hofstede Insights, 2019). This dimension defines the
level at which individuals integrate into different societies and their sense of belonging to the
group (Hofstede, 2011).
Nowadays society is turning increasingly global and governments are promoting international
cooperation. Geert Hofstede (2015) states:
For gaining an international perspective we have to become unconscious of our own culture,
admit the variety of cultures, when we are meeting people from elsewhere. There is no
substitute for personal international experience. In addition, we can acquire knowledge about
differences in national cultures in the present world, as referred in research. (1:05)
Hofstede’s assumption that all individuals in a nation have the same culture and his definition
of culture based on statistics have been repetitively criticized. On the other hand, other studies
consider the adequacy of his research and methodology (Mc Sweeney, 2002).

2.2.2 Intercultural communicative competence
Intercultural competence “… typically describes one’s effective and appropriate engagement
with cultural differences”, viz., it encompasses effective and appropriate communication.
Competence itself is defined, within an occidental sense, as the “ability to understand and
interact with people of different cultures in authentic and positive ways”. Effectiveness includes
an individualistic stress since it refers to the success in achieving one’s purposes in a
communication exchange, i.e., from one self’s perspective, whilst appropriateness has a
contextual angle as it is seen also from other person’s point of view (Arasaratnam, 2016, p. 1).
Other individual-centred variables are e.g. mindfulness, self- and other awareness, listening
skills, positive attitude toward other cultures, flexibility, tolerance for ambiguity, language skills,
adaptability, cultural knowledge, ethnocentrism, and sensation seeking. Contextual variables
are inter alia common goals, incentives, perceptions of equality and perceptions of agency4.
Arasaratnam (2016) undergirds that the great part of research, models and theories on
intercultural competence have focused on the individual. There are many important theories
and models, but few well-formed and widely tested. No leading one at the moment.
Hereby I analyse chronologically some relevant models for the current study: Byram’s model
(1997), Deardorff’s models (2004, 2008), Arasaratnam and Doerfel’s model (2005) and
Arasaratnam and Banerjee’s developed model (2011). The observation and data collection for
this study will be predominantly based on Deardorff’s model (2008) and particularly supported
by Asaratnam’s (2011), hence these are more extensively discussed below.
According to Byram (1997) the intercultural competence refers to the ability of foreign language
learners to interact with people from other countries and cultures. The intercultural
communicative competence embraces sociolinguistic, discourse, strategic, socio-cultural and
social competence, in addition to linguistic skills. A person improving the intercultural
communicative competence can communicate and interact with others in their lingua franca.
They will respect each other and their different cultures, being willing to continue developing
their skills in communication (Byram, 1997).
Byram’s model (1997, p. 73) for developing intercultural communicative competence includes
totally five elements or “savoirs” to be acquired or developed by the learner: “savoir être” or
attitudes (showing curiosity and openness); “savoirs” or knowledge of social groups and of
social processes of interaction; “savoir comprendre” or skills of interpreting and relating (the
ability to interpret documents or events from other cultures and relate it to one’s own); “savoir
apprendre/ faire” or skills of discovery and interaction (ability of acquiring and operating new

4

Sense of agency is defined as the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own
free choices.

18

knowledge of a culture and cultural practices in interaction) and “savoir s’engager” or critical
cultural awareness/political education (ability to evaluate critically perspectives, practices and
products in other cultures and countries as in one’s own). These elements focus mainly on
culture and the relations between cultures, i.e., interculturality that means interaction which, in
turn, is communication, languages.
Deardorff’s first model of intercultural competence was created in 2004. It complements
Byram’s model and emphasises the need to improve self-awareness, openness, and
transformation (2006). The figure below illustrates the next model developed two years later.

Figure 2. Caption. Deardorff’s Model of Intercultural Competence. (Deardorff, 2009).

According to this later model of Deardorff (2009), the following areas are important parts of
intercultural competence: attitudes, knowledge and comprehension (cultural self-awareness,
deep cultural knowledge, sociolinguistic awareness), skills (to listen, observe & evaluate; to
analyse, interpret & relate) and outcomes.
Deardorff suggests that one starts with attitudes, then move from individual level (attitudes) to
interaction level (outcomes).
Attitudes (corresponding to Byram’s “savoir être”) include the respect for the cultures of others
(valuing cultures), openness towards intercultural learning and people from other cultures
(tolerating ambiguity) thus curiosity and discovery (withholding judgement). Deardorff (2009)
19

explains that openness and curiosity imply a disposition for risking to move out of the comfort
zone. She refers to LeBaron and Pillow (2006) who consider that openness gives the possibility
to see from different perspectives and curiosity sets the basis for creative ways to change
differences into possibilities. Durden et al. (2016) suggest a way of developing cultural
competence in terms of curiosity and discovery by asking open-minded, open-ended questions
and for more information to the members of a cultural group. Additionally, by trying to detect
verbal and nonverbal actions that can be less appropriate in certain cultures.
Deardorff (2006) emphasizes in her model the importance of attitudes as openness, respect,
and curiosity and discovery as starting point, requisite and the most critical elements in the
process. This model demonstrates that the process for development and improvement of
intercultural competence is continual, we continue to attain competence with new relationships,
and consequently we may not never achieve final intercultural competence.
As also illustrated in the model, it moves from the individual level to the interactive cultural level
coming to outcomes, differentiated by internal and external.
The internal outcome includes adaptability, flexibility, ethnorelative view and empathy. An
individual can achieve a modicum of external results without having fully achieved a shift in the
frame of reference. Notwithstanding it is not required, it enhances the external outcome of
intercultural competence, which she describes as observable. (Deardorff, 2006).
The step called “Knowledge and Comprehension” includes cultural self-awareness, deep
cultural knowledge and sociolinguistic awareness. Intercultural awareness is essential in
communication between people from different cultures. It involves both the awareness of one’s
own culture and the awareness of another culture (Zhu, 2011).
The external (observable) outcome covers effective and appropriate communication and
behaviour in an intercultural situation. Effectiveness and appropriateness are directly related
to language fluency, cultural sensibility and attachment to cultural norms of a person
(Deardorff, 2009). The importance and the role of the language in intercultural competence
have a direct impact on international education and need further research in Deardorff’s
opinion (2006).
Deardorff states that the more components acquired and developed from her model, the bigger
intercultural competence results as an external outcome. However, she also sustains that it is
not limited to those components included in the model (Deardorff, 2006).
According to Durden et al. (2016, p. 5) “Displaying the cultural competency behaviours of active
listening, empathy, and effective engagement can help us to create a welcoming environment
and establish the appreciation of similarities and differences among cultures”.

20

In 2005 Asaratnam and Doerfel carried out a study in order to develop a culture-general model
of ICC not only focused on West. The perspective from both the communicator as well as from
the other person with whom she/he communicates in a specific interaction should be
considered in order to best evaluate if they behaved in a socially expected and accepted
manner. For this reason, both students from Utrecht University and from Hanken School of
Economics in Vaasa interacting online will be observed for the current study.
After collecting qualitative data from participants representing different cultural backgrounds,
Arasaratnam and Doerfel’s findings showed that an intercultural competent communicator in a
particular intercultural exchange, possesses the identified five qualities that allow him/her
being also competent in other exchanges. The qualities were represented by the model’s
variables: empathy or the capacity to relate to another person at a cognitive and emotional
level; experience or prior involvement in intercultural communication; motivation to interact with
people from other cultures; global attitude toward other cultures, and listening ability, to be a
good listener in a conversation. (2010, 2005). According to Nadeem, Mohammed and Dalib
(2017, p. 15), empathy is described by Arasaratnam (2004) as “… an individual’s ability to
engage in cognitive and emotional role taking and to adapt his or her behaviour appropriately
to the situation”. Intercultural experience is understood as a former acquaintance of other
cultures and involvement in intercultural communication. This variable was substituted by
sensation seeking in the following research, since a person with no previous experience as
intercultural communicator could still be perceived as competent (Arasaratnam, Banerjee and
Dembek, 2010).
Motivation, defined as the ambition to participate in intercultural interactions in order to learn
and understand other cultures, was measured using a 7-item motivation scale (Arasaratnam,
2006). Listening ability or interaction involvement is one person’s cognitive and behavioural
engagement in communication by listening the other communicator. ATOC or global attitude
is a positive, non-ethnocentric attitude towards people from new cultures. (Arasaratnam et al.,
2010).

Figure 3. Caption. Arasaratnam’s Model of Intercultural Competence (Arasaratnam, 2008).
21

They also proved that intercultural competence combines one’s personal abilities and
contextual variables. Supported by the findings of their study, a first model was developed and
in turn, a new instrument of ICC was generated.
The Integrated Model of Intercultural Communication Competence (IMICC) is based on
Deardorff’s theory and on the results of Arasaratnam and co-authors’ previous studies in 2006,
2007 and 2010. The model in 2011 presented the developed five variables that conceptualise
ICC: empathy, experience, MTEIIC (motivation to engage in intercultural communication),
listening ability, and ATOC (attitude towards other cultures). Additionally, sensation seeking,
and ethnocentrism were incorporated. (Nadeem, Rosli & Dalib, 2020). Ethnocentrism, the
conviction that one’s cultural perspective is the right one, goes through three phases: denial,
progression and minimization. This last stage is achieved after acceptance of one’s own culture
as a valid one within many other, adaption in behaviour to adapt to the other culture and
assimilation of other global perspective into one’s own sense of identity (Arasaratnam-Smith,
2017). Sensation seeking has been associated to dangerous activities or games, never to
hazardous activities but to public activities with intercultural individuals. This variable was
connected with individuals from new cultural backgrounds and also to empathy. From an
international higher education perspective this indicates that high sensation-seekers are
predisposed to participate in intercultural contact-seeking behaviour such as study-abroad
programmes, for example (Arasaratnam-Smith, 2017).
Arasaratnam-Smith (2017) in her overview of ICC models includes Fantini’s framework (2006)
for assessing intercultural competence in case studies. The frame identifies four dimensions
(knowledge, skills, attitudes and awareness) and categorizes eight qualities of which patience,
flexibility, suspended judgement, tolerance for ambiguity and humour are not included in other
models.
Intercultural behaviour: empathy and awareness
In order to develop a model for guiding training and research cross-cultural programs, Brisnis,
Landis and Brandt (1983, pp. 3-8) found necessary to firstly conceptualize the term intercultural
behaviour regarding the distal effects5 of the actions. They defined intercultural behaviour as
an “action that produces a significant change in the judgements of the actor’s social or skill
competence by people from another cultural background”. Behaviours can be different as the
cultures of the actors change. They took a psychological perspective to look at behaviour as
the viewpoint of the person behaving and the other people with whom that person is interacting.

distal effect = any influence that particular responses of an organism may have on the environment
https://dictionary.apa.org/distal-effect

22

As distal variables Brisnis et al. (1983) considered characteristics and thought processes that
the person brings to the intercultural action. These functional intercultural skills are: past
experiences with persons of the host culture, perceived role and norm differences, anxiety that
results from intercultural behaviour (regarding it as a personal characteristic or a state evoking
in a particular situation), increased ability of working together when having a common
assignment and a consequent centralized goal, a broad perceptual and cognitive set to view
the world, and the ability to take another’s point of view to “become” the other.
The thought processes refer to people’s way of thinking about their inputs and judgments
regarding their own and the others’ behaviour as stereotyping and the imposition of one’s
opinion. People should be prepared for adjustments in intercultural interactions and training
can help it. If the training includes information about the behaviour of the others it will be easier
to explain the behaviour from the others’ point of view. Stereotypes are concerned with people
but not individually. People group features and statements are classified into categories to
respond to them as a form of generalization, hiding individual differences. Stereotypes give
people information and help to organize thinking. They can be useful, but they can also be
dangerous if they include false descriptions for individuals being inappropriate to the category,
which would require great effort and time to overcome the conception. Training cannot stop
stereotyping but can present the nature of the stereotypes and their mistakes. Consequently,
people can search for further and better information than the stereotype describes. (Brisnis et
al., 1983).
Zhu (2011) considers stereotypes being one obstacle that can be found in the process of
cultivating intercultural empathy. To be empathetic, understanding others by entering their
world or “standing in somebody else’s shoes” is necessary in intercultural communication in
addition to the understanding of cultural awareness.
As already mentioned in the first section of this study, cultural awareness alludes to the
sensitivity and understanding of another cultural group, where awareness refers to the
development of openness and flexibility for people in relation to others. Cultural awareness
needs to be supplemented with cultural knowledge, i.e., to be familiar with certain cultural
characteristics, history, values, believes, and behaviours of another ethnic group (Adams,
1995).
Intercultural awareness is essential in communication between people from different cultures.
It involves both the awareness of one’s own culture and the awareness of another culture.
Lack of intercultural awareness can easily lead to misinterpretation of the verbal and nonverbal behaviours of the people interacting. A person can understand and interpret interplay in
an appropriate way in his/her culture but being inappropriate in the others’, which can result in

23

misunderstandings in the communication. Language students in cross-cultural situations
should try to cultivate empathetic perceptions and principles in foreign language learning in
order to effectively improve their communicative competence. Only the understanding of
cultural awareness is not sufficient, they need to be empathetic. (Zhu, 2011).
Empathy’s role in the context of international higher education has widely studied after being
considered a key component in development of intercultural competence. It can be
demonstrated by several abilities as to connect emotionally with others, showing compassion,
to listen actively and mindfully and having different perspectives of situations. At its first stage
empathy is passive and helps to simply recognize the other as a human being, the second
stage allows a spontaneous change from just noticing a global similarity to be inside the other,
the third involves consideration and communication and the last stage ethical responsibility.
(Calloway-Thomas, Arasaratnam-Smith and Deardorff, 2017).
Zhu (2011) asserts that in foreign language education and intercultural communication,
empathy is called intercultural empathy and he defines it as “placing himself into the cultural
background of the target language and being able to effectively communicate his
understanding of that world”. (2011, p. 116-117). It is not about mixing cultures. It consists of
projecting one’s cultural frame of reference in another culture without leaving one’s own
perspective, by keeping the native cultural identity and being aware of other identities of people
with different cultural background.
Intercultural empathy assures effective intercultural communication since empathy brings one
person to experience the other person’s feelings and behaviour, reflect on them and compare
them with one’s own. Cultural empathy is not sympathy or identification with an explicit culture,
but a rational understanding and acceptance of different cultural values and beliefs. It is not
necessary to agree with different cultural values and beliefs to understand them; nor to agree
with the different cultures so they become similar and develop empathy. (Zhu, 2011).
In addition to stereotypes, Zhu (2011) reviews two other obstacles that can be found in the
process of cultivating intercultural empathy: prejudices and lack of cultural sensitivity.
Stereotypes should not be used to describe individual behaviour, only as the behavioural norm
for the group. However, they influence our assumptions on how the other people relate to us
and to others, which do not let us see other similarities. Prejudices are a premature judgement
or a negative attitude towards others. They are not based on objective facts, but usually on
stereotypes. Cultural sensitivity refers to the skill of being aware that cultural differences and
similarities exist and of respecting other cultures.
Zhu ratifies that many factors interfere in the achievement of a good intercultural
communication. Intercultural communication can be enhanced by cultural empathy while it can

24

be negatively affected by the three factors named above. In order to develop empathy and
reach effective communication, he suggests being persistent in keeping open communication,
perceptive to dissimilarities in other people’s way of communicating (words, voice and body
language) and honest and ready to take risks. As well as, not to have prejudgments, to be
interested in other cultures, to adapt to other’s behaviour and norms plus to be open,
compassionate and respectful amongst other cultures. (2011).

2.2.4 Virtual interaction and communication
The CEFR proposes as methodology options for teaching a foreign language the use of
audiovisual media in its option f): “[…] as interactive work method, through the electronic
contact with other schools, other classrooms and even with other students”. Concerning the
interaction and communication of the Spanish students, the “Common European Framework
for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment” compiled by the Council for Cultural
Cooperation, Education Committee in Language Policy Division in Strasbourg presents
different characteristics scaled after the level (2020, p. 72). The characteristics of students at
A2 level in “Overall spoken interaction” and particularly in “Conversation” are listed below in
figure 4.

Figure 4. Caption. CEFR. Overall spoken interaction, Conversation. (Council of Europe, 2020).

Regarding online interaction, under the division “goal-oriented online transactions and
collaboration”, the CEFR states that a student at A2 level “can interact online with a supportive
partner in a simple collaborative task, responding to basic instructions and seeking
clarification”. Plus, considering online conversation and discussion, a Spanish student at A2
level can manage simple exchanges online with provided enough time. In another scale called

25

“Facilitating collaborative interaction with peers” it is shortly stated that a student with A2 level
can indicate when he/she is following. (2020, pp. 85-86, 88).
Telecollaboration takes place in a computer-supported workspace, using a computer mediated
communication. A brief appreciation on how communication fosters and mediates in group
work online will be useful for a better understanding of the telecollaboration.
The Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) is defined as a process whereby electronical
messages between senders and receivers are transmitted in a synchronous (e.g.,
videoconference) and/or asynchronous mode (e.g., chat and messenger tools). In
synchronous mode the information is transmitted continuously as it is generated, whilst in
asynchronous communication the interlocutors have more time to reflect before action (Fuks,
Raposo, Gerosa, Pimental & Lucena, 2008, p. 637). By CMC people can communicate and
collaborate without limitations of time and space. CMC technologies are tools that facilitate the
communication between group members. It is important to know how people collaborate more
effectively using these technologies by distance. (Zakaria, 2008).
The Encyclopedia of E-collaboration (2009) presents Kock’s 3C Collaboration Model, a model
for the analysis, representation, and development of collaborative software by means of the
interplay between the 3Cs: communication, coordination, and cooperation.

Figure 5. Caption. Kock’s 3C collaboration model instantiated for group work. (Kock, 2008).

On a general term, the Encyclopedia of E-collaboration defines awareness as the human’s
ability to perceive the other’s activities and one’s own in a collaborative context. Groupware or
collaborative software generally provides elements and information to enable awareness in the
interplay (Kock, 2008). The awareness support in a computer-supported workspace is less
effective due to the limitation of means that allow sensory organs to perceive information. On
the other hand, and when filtering irrelevant information, this also leads to a reduction of
distractions that disturb face-to-face collaboration (Baker, Greenberg and Gutwin, 2001).
26

2.3 Summary of the theoretical framework
Hofstede defines six dimensions of culture in his cultural dimensions’ theory (1980) as well as
the level at which individuals integrate into different societies and their sense of belonging to
the group. Despite the critics against the validity of this theory, it has been applied
internationally and confirmed that it can support scholars and practitioners to distinguish
between different national cultures and their influence. Taking also into account his statement
about the continuously increasing globalization of our societies, I consider this theory useful
when observing the students interacting in multicultural groups. It enables my task of eethnographer to see some hardly revealed and rare observable parts as per Hall’s iceberg
analogy of culture (1976), in the respondents. Moreover, it can benefit in better understanding
their behaviour and attitudes towards other cultures during their telecollaboration when
perceiving more sharply some dimensions of their own cultures.
In my study I aim to examine the students’ behaviour which stays in the visible part of the
iceberg and also their expressions of attitudes, which correspond to a deeper part and are
difficult to observe regarding Hall’s analogy. However, I intend to see the findings in this part
as a deeper culture and since they are related to the behaviour. In order to facilitate my
observation, I centre it on the three specific attitudes: respect, openness and curiosity and
discovery, already categorised, and for that considered observable, in Deardorff’s model of
Intercultural competence as explained later in section 2.2.2.
As Arasaratnam corroborates, of the numerous important theories and models on intercultural
competence few are considered completed and adequately tested. All five models reviewed in
the section “Theories and Models on culture and interaction“ apport valuable information about
the fundamental variables conceptualizing intercultural competence and some have been
applied for cultural competence assessment. The observation and data collection for this study
will be predominantly based on Deardorff’s model (2008) and particularly supported by
Asaratnam’s model of intercultural competence (2011) since this is a latest model, it refers
more specifically to communication and it includes other current variables. The students’
changes or degree in intercultural communicative competence are not measured in this
investigation. The study aims to obtain an appreciation of the attitudinal and behavioural
aspects of the students in their intercultural communication when interplaying on a virtual
space.
Both, the students from Utrecht University and from Hanken were observed when interacting
online for the current study according to Asaratnam and Doerfel’s study (2005). The
researchers stated that both perspectives from the communicator and from the receptor of the

27

communication in a specific interaction should be considered in order to best evaluate whether
they behaved in a socially expected and accepted manner.
In order to study the respondents’ intercultural communicative competence during their ecollaboration, two parts in Deardorff’s model will be examined: attitudes and external outcome.
Attitudes are considered by many scholars, as well as by its author, an essential component
and starting point in the process of fostering intercultural competence. Attitudes apply to the
individual level whilst external outcome concerns the interaction level. This is consistent with
Arasaratnam and Doerfel’s (2005) conception of intercultural competence of one’s personal
abilities and contextual variables. Attitudes between the university students towards other
cultures constitute also one of the main components in Asaratnam and Banerjee’s model. In
my observation, the focus was placed on respect for the cultures of others, openness towards
intercultural learning and people from other cultures, and curiosity and discovery, referring to
the attitudes and in order to find the answer to the first research question: How do students
express their attitudes during intercultural telecollaboration?
Deardorff sustains that an individual’s external results can be observable without having fully
achieved a shift in the frame of reference, that is “Internal outcomes” or “Knowledge and
comprehension”. The observation considered the “External outcome”, and specifically
“Appropriate

communication

and

appropriate

behaviour”.

Hall

(1979)

considers

communication connected to behaviour, that culture influences the communication based on
the cultural behaviours and that it is culture itself that communicates. These two united aspects
will help to find the answer to the second research question: How do students behave when
interacting in intercultural telecollaboration?
The consensus definition of ICC, as well as Deardorff’s model, compasses appropriateness
and effectiveness. Appropriateness can be seen from another person’s point of view and as
expected and accepted behaviour in relation to cultural sensibility and cultural norms,
meanwhile effectiveness refers to an individual’s skill to achieve his/her own purposes and
from his/her own perspective (Arasaratnam, 2016; Arasaratnam & Banerjee, 2010). Since the
students’ purposes are not investigated in this study, the effectiveness will not be considered
either.
Deardorff additionally states that the more components acquired and developed from her
model, the bigger intercultural competence results as an external outcome. Nevertheless, she
also sustains that it is not limited to those components included in the model. (Deardorff, 2006).
According to this, any other relevant ability observed as a pattern in the collaborative practice
will also be presented as a finding of the research.

28

Other models and theories presented will support the identification of other possible variables
in the communicators’ engagement to other cultures, which also contribute to their intercultural
competence.
The participants in this virtual exchange may develop and become aware of their intercultural
competence through their interaction in a computer-supported workspace. This aspect can be
expressed for example when/if they are persistent in keeping open communication since they
need to perform a conducted task; when/if they perceive dissimilarities in other people’s way
of communicating (words, voice and body language) and are honest and ready to take risks.
It can be challenging to uncover this aspect that includes both, the respondents’ cultural selfawareness and their awareness to others with only a one single observation and to study
uniquely awareness is not the purpose of this study so, despite its essential role in intercultural
communication, it will not be examined in the observation.

3. The method
The empiric part of this study is based on qualitative research using the methodology of virtual
ethnography. Data was collected through non-participant semi-structured observation when
the students collaborate online. Ethical issues are addressed before the start of the study.
Haverinen (2015) points out that ethnography can be used both as a research method and as
an approach for analysis of qualitative data. She quotes Boellstroff, Nardi, Pearce and Taylor
(2012, p. 6) when describing ethnography as a “… flexible, responsive methodology,
sensitive to emergent phenomena and emergent research questions”.
In this study I examine the students’ intercultural competence through telecollaboration where
the social interaction is researched by ethnographical approach and method, in order to answer
the research questions:
1. How do students express attitudes during intercultural telecollaboration?
2. How do students behave when interacting in intercultural telecollaboration?
Ethnographic observation is the method to be employed for data collection since it helps to
uncover the variables that conceptualise intercultural competence phenomena and allows the
researcher to interpret the students’ action in a social situation online.

3.1 E-ethnography as approach in a qualitative study
E-ethnography, also known with the prefixes internet, cyber-, digital, virtual, electronic, and
29

online before the term ethnography, will be pursued as research approach in the present study.
The origin, development, and use of the discipline are described below.
Ethnography
Ethnography enables the researcher to describe, explain and form interpretations and views
of human action in social contexts and will provide an overall understanding and description of
the concrete phenomenon to be studied (Genzuk, 2003).
Up until the 1800s, anthropologists simply conducted their research from their homes, reading
stories and information written or collected by missionaries and other travellers. Later, in the
mid- 1900s, they needed to travel to a distant location to be able to observe and analyse
different cultural behaviours in field. Then they transcribed field notes and interviews and
draught sketches by hand, took photos and used their body and mind to analyse people’s
behaviour. Today’s ethnographers can use their computers or other devises, anywhere with
internet connection and instantly enter the digital environment to observe and research
people’s behaviour, interactions and cultures. Helped by technological tools, programmes and
apps, ethnographers can collect and analyse digitalised data in form of pictures, notes,
recorded audios and videos, both online and offline. Haverinen (2015, p. 79) summarizes the
situation as follows: “They use technology to study the use of technology in a world of
networked relationships mediated by the internet”. In this study I observed the students’ videos
asynchronously, that is not at the same time as when the students interacted during their
telecollaboration but afterwards.
Anthropologists have become increasingly interested in the combination of ethnography and
internet to analyse networked lives and relationships, intending to understand cultures online
and offline. The internet is a wide compendium of technologies and applications with unlimited
possibilities, a network of interlinked computers connecting people globally, and a provider of
information, tools, and environments for research. Haverinen (2015, p. 82) summarizes: “[…]
what it embeds and mediates are the experiences, emotions, knowledge, visual imagery and
text that formulate our world and how we understand it.”
E-ethnography
The concept e-ethnography has developed since the early 1990s and the terms to describe it
have changed following its progress. First, internet technology was mainly based on text,
therefore the researchers focused on the analysis of text-based virtual domains and
collaborative software. Later, they concerned the creation of communities and the distribution
of the related information in this new type of media. The terms cyberspace, cyborgs and cyber
culture appeared in this phase.

30

Towards the end of the 1990s, when the private use of internet turned into more commercial
and popular (used by the masses), ethnography tried to generate consciousness about the
rising use of internet and studies began focusing on users. Later, during the first years of the
new millennium, the prefix digital budded and ethnography started focusing more on the
material and on offline environments, whereas the term virtual ethnography is centred around
researching phenomena and cultures in online environments. The concept virtual has also
been understood as non-real and is nowadays related to online gaming environments and
shared worlds with imagined people and spaces. Murthy (2011) defines digital ethnography as
ethnography mediated by digital technologies.
The ethnographic site, i.e. the field for the ethnographic approach or where the internet can be
studied ethnographically, can vary. Depending on the research questions and settings of the
ethnographers, the focus can be on online, offline or both views. It can also be in a distant
location or in situ regarding geographical terms. Haverinen (2015) refers to Marcus (2014)
staying that is not relevant where the ethnographic research takes place but where its context
is. The current research scoped what happened when the respondents e-collaborate in
intercultural groups. I, as the researcher, observed their online interaction but I did not
participate in the groups’ sessions.
E-ethnography offers the possibility of combining both the digital and the analogue, the online
and the offline, as well as provide and share information. Although ethnographic research has
traditionally been followed by a qualitative analysis, nowadays ethnographers can choose to
collect both quantitative and qualitative data from the internet.
After comparing qualitative research to quantitative studies, Lapan, Quartaroli and Riemer
(2012) emphasise some key ideas: qualitative research places more emphasis on the study of
phenomena from an insider perspective, i.e. the researchers immerse themselves in the
phenomena they study; it uses interpretive frameworks or methodologies and it needs to be
open to change during investigations. This means that qualitative researchers should not only
plan a rigorous research strategy, but they should be sensitive to changing contexts and
situations where the research takes place. Qualitative research should be conducted
strategically, with flexibility and in context (Pekkola, 2014). Regarding Meinefeld (2004) the
qualitative research is much more open and emergent than other approaches and the
researcher effects the research (Cohen et al., 2007).
As the researcher of this study, I am not independent from the phenomena of the study when
being the respondents’ teacher; the study conducts e-ethnography, an interpretative
methodology, and it can be affected by variations during the process of investigation.

31

Accordingly, a qualitative analysis of the data obtained is an appropriate implementation for
studying the students’ competence of the cultural exchange in their telecollaboration.

3.2 Observation as method for data collection
The ethnographical research may include language and culture learning, study of a particular
field or domain and a combination of historical, observational, and interview methods (Genzuk,
2003). The method for data collection in the current study was ethnographical observation.
The activity of a person or a group online can be recorded with different applications for later
observation and analysis of their use of internet (Haverinen, 2015). The data was collected by
recording the videoconferencing in Jitsi meet (or Skype) and saving the videos in Dropbox.
Semi-structured observation of the videos selected was conducted for the ensuing analysis.
In observations respondents are acting naturally which minimises the possibilities for wrong or
made-up statements, whereas in questionnaires the validity of the respondents’ attitude and
their descriptions on their own behaviour can be very doubtful. The difference between what it
is said and what it is done can become a problem. The time when the methods are undertaken
has also a significance on the research (Bryman, 2018). By observation, the researcher gets
the opportunity to collect data in social situations that are taking place naturally and in
immediate location and time. For this reason, this mode of research permits to gather more
valid and authentic data than others (Cohen, Manion and Morrison, 2007). In order for not to
miss important information in my research when the students interact online, they were told to
record the whole videoconference and not only the part when they do the tasks, no matter
which language they use then.
Structured observation refers to direct observation of the human behaviour helped by a
previously categorized register based on theory. The structured or systematic observation has
not been popular among many researchers, it has mainly been used for classroom research
(Bryman, 2018), mostly used with infants and young children. The characteristics of each
behaviour need to be precisely defined so the researchers agree on the categories and can
check the frequency when the categories occur under analysis (Dictionary.apa.org, 2020). On
the other hand, unstructured observation does not require tables with categorisation of the
behavioural aspects to be studied. Instead, it aims to note the participants behaviour and giving
a narrative description of it. It is usually associated with non-participant observation (Bryman,
2018). Semi-structured observation has a schedule of questions but will collect data to clarify
them in a less precisely, predetermined or systematic manner (Cohen et al., 2007). In both
structured and unstructured observation, the researcher usually is close to the phenomenon

32

of the study but not part of the social action. Non-participant observation refers to a situation
which the observer is not attending. (Bryman, 2018).
Semi-unstructured observation was used for collecting data in this study because I was not
participant in the situation to be observed and I used a semi-structure template and not a
precisely categorized table for collecting observational data (see Appendix C, Template 1 and
2). As observer I was close to the situation to be observed due to the fact that I am the teacher
of the students in Vaasa.

3.3 Settings for the study
In August 2019, the Director of the Centre for Language and Business Communication at
Hanken School of Economics in Helsinki gave his approval for the telecollaboration project
with a European University, within the Spanish language teaching. Following that, my search
for a European University that would be interested in cooperation started immediately
thereafter. I had an interest in a northern European language context, preferably bi- or
multilingual, to increase linguistic and cultural diversity within my research setting.
Furthermore, I had prior familiarity with Dutch culture. Thus, I tried to find contacts in the
Netherlands. The first step consisted of taking contact with some Spanish teachers at different
Dutch universities via LinkedIn. Still waiting for answers, I took an alternative approach via
Google search which gave, among the first results, information about the Spanish University
teacher at Utrecht University who quickly and happily approved my proposal. She is an
Assistant Professor and coordinator of the Spanish courses at the University of Utrecht and
holds a doctorate in Telecollaboration backed by a vast experience in this field at higher
education.
The courses offered by the Centre for Languages and Business Communication emphasise
business and academic context as well as intercultural communication. The university students
at Hanken School of Economics, Vaasa Campus take courses in the two national languages
Swedish and Finnish (6 + 6 ECTS) and at the minimum in two foreign languages (6 + 6 ECTS)
at Bachelor level or at least 5 ECTS at Master level. Thus far, Hanken offers only two Spanish
courses (i.e. Español 1A and Español 1B) in Vaasa. The first one was held during the autumn
term and the second during spring term 2020. The courses grant 3 ECTS each. The
respondents of this study form a group of 20 students of Economics, participating in Español
1B at Hanken, plus 42 students at Utrecht University, attending bachelor or master’s degrees

33

in different disciplines and studying Spanish as an optative subject. Both groups aiming a target
level of A26.
On the basis of my teaching experience, I would characterise the group of students in this
study as a quite typical beginner’s group at Hanken, i.e. most of them in their first year at the
University.
In this group dynamics were functional, and they acted coherently as a group. My contact and
confidence in them were good as usual. There were talkative, social and open students but
also some more quiet and introvert students. They were happy with the course and had been
motivated until March when they start showing spring fatigue and disillusion. The group had
never been engaged in a virtual exchange earlier. When I told them about this project, they
started asking curiously about it, about my study as well as about the Netherlands and the
Dutch culture. I even discussed Hofstede’s dimensions of culture with them and some of them
got very interested in the subject.
The students at the Dutch and Finnish universities were assigned to intercultural groups of
three to four persons (i.e. one or two Finnish and two or three Dutch). They collaborated on
two tasks as part of an oral assignment in both universities which accounted for 30% of the
final grade for the students of Spanish at Hanken. The tasks were originally prepared by the
coordinator of the Spanish courses at Utrecht University and we slightly modified them
together.
The students in Finland working in pairs had to perform these two tasks twice, since the total
number of the participants in Finland was half of the participants in the Netherlands. The
groups were formed two weeks before the project started.
Both the culture and the students’ personalities were reflected on their attitude about meeting
and working with new people. Regarding this, six students at Hanken freely chose to cooperate
individually and with two other students from Utrecht University and the rest 14 preferred to
work in pairs and with 2-3 different students from the peer university. These ones had to repeat
the same tasks twice so the two students totally worked with 4-6 peer students.
The project was executed during the weeks 11 and 12 (9th to 22nd March 2020), with the
implementation of a task per week. The project coincided with the start of the coronavirus
pandemic in Finland. The students had already started their telecollaboration when Hanken
suddenly changed from in-class into online teaching, on Friday the 13th of March, being the
first university in Finland in applying this measure.

34

The tasks were announced one week before the project started. The components of each
group decided together, by email or in their first meeting online, the schedule for their two (or
four) weekly meeting sessions.
For the implementation of the tasks, they used Jitsi meet, a videoconferencing on-line
programme that offers free tools, is open source, and WebRTC7 compatible. The use of Skype
was offered as optional later due to difficulties regarding the quality of the videoconferencing
with Jitsi. The videos of their sessions were recorded and saved in Dropbox for future
observation. The students received guidelines about how to use these programmes helped by
a YouTube video tutorial provided by the teacher at Utrecht University and by an instruction
manual made by me, as their teacher at Vaasa.
The dynamic collaborative tasks in this e-collaboration educational project deal with culture,
habits and stereotypes. Task 1 focuses on getting to know their peer colleagues and their
cultures a bit better. During the session for the performance of this task they can discuss about
young people in their home countries and about Spanish, Finnish and Dutch stereotypes
among other stereotypes interesting for the group. Task 2 focuses on customs and habits
(personal and in their own countries). During this session they can discuss for example about
their studies, universities, timetables. These assignments can benefit the participants to
develop their competence of the diverse cultures through their intercultural interactions.

3.4 Data transcription and theory-driven analysis
Using ethnographic methodology in order to study social and cultural relationships on the
internet, is challenging for researchers, sociologists and culture analysts. A known concern is
the vast amount of data that the investigators using qualitative methods can obtain and how to
handle or limit it (Pekkola, 2014). Documenting the participants’ observation is important in
digital environments due to the amount of information shared and provided in a very quick
tempo, which can be difficult to remember later on.
A deductive analysis based on the theoretical framework of the study, which agrees
investigation, assessment and understanding of collaborative performances (Skelcher &
Sullivan, 2008), contributed to the evaluation of the findings.

3.4.1 Election of the videos
A total of 13 intercultural groups of 20 students studying at Hanken, Vaasa and 42 in the
University of Utrecht telecollaborated in two or four different sessions, depending on if the
7

Web Real-Time Communication
35

students in Vaasa worked in pairs or alone. The ones working in pairs needed to repeat the
tasks in two different groups, since the students from Utrecht were double the amount. They
recorded 39 videos totally, two or four per group (a group recorded both tasks together in only
one video). To facilitate the order and storage of the videos they were named by the date in
six digits, the group number, number 1 or number 2 for first or second telecollaboration and
which task the group performed.
For my thesis I observed and analysed five videos that reflected good information for my study.
This amount is considered by the aim of the study, which is not to obtain any general
conclusions but to identify abilities of intercultural communication. When observing the last two
videos I noticed the same patterns and same subcategories than in the previous observations,
consequently I stopped the observation in order to avoid attaining saturation. My choice was
initially founded on samples with better technical quality of the recordings: with no lagging, no
sound problems and visualizing all the members. The second requisite was the participants
being as natural as possible in the conversation and more confident with their Spanish
knowledge. I did not choose the videos where the group had prepared the tasks by memorizing
or reading loud the questions and answers; talking only freely without focusing on the subject
of the task; neither those with very short conversations due to their very basic Spanish level.
With less than a half of the videos adequate for observation, I chose the videos where
conversations outside the task were also recorded and more cultural diversity. Then I selected
the videos from different groups and performing different tasks too.
The students were not previously asked about their cultural backgrounds, but I assumed many
of them being bicultural or with blended cultural identities. Hanken is a Swedish speaking
university with many bilingual Finnish-Swedish students. Utrecht University uses to welcome
high quotes of international students every academic year.
As a result, I observed and analysed the following five videos (three videos correspond to the
performance of task 1 and the other two videos of task 2) to with totally 19 correspondents (9
Hanken students and 10 Utrecht students):
1) Video 1 saved as “200311_GRUPO 7_ECO 1_T1”
A group formed by two men from two Swedish-speaking cities in Finland (the Åland island and
Jakobstad) studying at Hanken, Vaasa, and two women studying at Utrecht University: one of
them living in a village in the countryside, and the other one wearing a religious garment. They
performed task 1.
2) Video 2 saved as “200312_GRUPO 8_ECO 2_T2”
A group formed by two Swedish-speaking Finnish women plus one Dutch man and one woman

36

who has grown up in the Netherlands, but in a half Kurdish, half Turkish family. They performed
task 2.
3) Video 3 saved as “200319_GRUPO 5_ECO 1_T2”
A group formed by two bilingual Finnish men and two Dutch women studying at Utrecht
University. One of the Hanken students has a relationship with a Dutch woman so he is more
aware of this culture. They performed task 2.
4) Video 4 saved as “200319_GRUPO 9_ECO 2_T1”
A group formed by two bilingual Finnish women and two Dutch men studying at Utrecht
University. They performed task 1.
5) Video 5 saved as “200311_GRUPO 12_ECO 1_T1”
A group formed by one bilingual Finnish man, a Dutch woman and German man studying at
Utrecht University. The German student is located in Berlin, his hometown, due to the
coronavirus pandemic. They performed task 1.
3.4.2 Method for the data analysis
The data collected in this study is evaluated by following the theory-driven content analysis
method.
Cohen et al. (2007) define content analysis as a form of qualitative data analysis that consists
of the process of summarizing and exposing the central contents of the collected data and their
messages. Furthermore, the researchers refer to Krippendorp (2004), who states that content
analysis describes the noticeable aspects of communication (who says what, how and to
whom) and deduces the background (purposes, reasons and context) and the consequences
or effects of the communication.
This method has its origin in the analysis of mass media and public speeches but nowadays it
is applied to examinate any form of communicative material. Cohen et al. refer Weber (1990)
to underline that it can be used for problems at intercultural and social structure and interaction,
“… to study groups as microcosms of society” (Cohen et al., 2007 p. 476). More specifically
the theory-driven approach provides the researchers the instrument for analysing, assessing
and understanding collaborative performance (Skelcher & Sullivan, 2008).
One of the aims of using this procedure is to reduce vast amounts of written data respecting
its quality by classifying it in few categories. These categories usually originate from theoretical
constructs, but they can also be developed from the material itself and be adapted to the
empirical data. In my study I classified the data obtained after observation applying Deardorff’s
model of Intercultural Competence (2006). I derived my classification from the model’s
groupings “Attitudes” and “Appropriate communication and behaviour”. I subsumed the
37

categories “Respect”, “Openness” and “Curiosity and discovery” under “Attitudes” in order to
be more explicit. In addition, these main categories other subcategories were developed from
the transcriptions and material collected from the observation and referred to the theoretical
framework of this study.
This method is used to describe attitudinal and behavioural responses in communications
(Palmquist, 2021), essential part in this study.
The content analysis method is also appropriate for this study since it enables computerassisted analysis to be undertaken and the analyst can observe without being observed. It is
systematic and demonstrable because it uses codes and categories. Furthermore, and since
it uses permanent data, it allows verification as well as a second analysis if needed.
Cohen et al. (2006) expound the process of content analysis in three essential features: to
divide text into divisions of analysis, to undertake statistical analysis of the divisions and to
present the analysis in an efficient way. Other important features are to examine the relation
between the categories, to study the origin of the themes and the testing, development and
generation of theory.
The whole process includes firstly the definition of the research questions, population, sample,
context, units of analysis, and codes. Codes can be a word or abbreviation that define concepts
in different ways. This will be followed by the construction and subsequent handling of the
codes and the categories (sort data into key headings, list topics within each key heading, put
them into groups avoiding category overlap plus comment and review the groups and their
messages). Afterwards the data analysis will be conducted and summarized at the same time
that possible interferences are generated. (Cohen et al., 2006).

3.5 Reliability, validity, and ethical issues
Reliability and validity in semi-structured observation and in theory-driven analysis
It is not easy to achieve an adequate level of reliability with structured observations. Validity
presumes reliability. E.g., the observers’ capacity of attention can become worse and this can
make the study less reliable.
The validity is affected by mistakes in implementation: if the instrument for observation is not
handled as planned or if the respondents change their behaviour when knowing that they are
observed.
Besides the threat of validity due to subjective observation, there are other risks to validity and
reliability in observation: e.g. the observer may be unaware of essential previous events when

38

looking only at the present; the informants can be not representative of the sample for the
study; the presence of the observer can cause diverse behaviours and the researcher reaction
when seeing a non-motivated group can also affect the study (Cohen et al., 2007). Even not
being synchronously with them when they interact, the students knew beforehand that their
recordings would be observed by me as both their teacher and the researcher.
All the videos had already been observed twice in my role as teacher, for the students’ oral
evaluation. In this first visualization I concentrated only on my students’ linguistic knowledge
and improvement on their oral skills.
I planned thoroughly the observation for this study. I read again the theoretical framework and
I prepared the templates for the notes regarding Deardorff’s Model of Intercultural
Competence.
Since the study concerns interaction between all the participants and the videos last from
approx. 20-40 minutes each, they were observed in sequences of maximum 20 minutes.
Meanwhile observing the videos for the first time to examine intercultural communication, I
took raw notes regarding any category, by hand, and in a blank paper. I observed the videos
three or more times if needed. Those notes were transferred later to a Word document,
classifying them and filling one template for attitudes and another one for external outcomes,
i.e. an observation’s protocol based on Deardorffs’ model of intercultural competence (see
Template 1 and Template 2 in Appendix C). Empathy that conceptualises intercultural
communicative competence regarding Arasaratnam’s model IMICC was also marked when
uncovered under the observation. I read the notes of each group, improved them, added more
or/and changed into other subcategory when necessary. I visualized the videos another time
for confirmation of the notes. After this and regarding the patterns and most interesting
comments, I developed the subcategories presented in section 4.
I examined the videos in detail in order to guarantee the maximum reliability and validity for
this study. Achieving solid results and an authenticated statement, regarding not only the
linguistic development but the intercultural competence, would help to propose Hanken the
implementation of telecollaboration with other European countries in the Spanish teaching
programme and not only as an extra activity (as proposed by O’Dowd, 2011).
Since the categories when conducting content analysis can be deduced by the researcher, the
closer to inference the more reliability may be compromised (Cohen et al., 2006 p. 479). The
nearness to empirical data and its support to the construction of the categories reinforces the
reliability. Cohen et al. (2006) add that categories need to be thorough in order to address
content validity. The categories in the analysis of this study refer to the theoretical construct
and previous findings in the literature. The main categories are literally labelled after

39

Deardorff’s model of Intercultural Competence (2006) and the subcategories are thoroughly
named in reference to this and other models and previous research referred in the theoretical
framework for this study.
Ethical issues
Some special ethical issues need to be acknowledged before beginning an ethnographic
research, since it occurs among human beings (Genzuk, 2003, p. 8). Even Haverinen (2015,
p. 86) points out that using ethnography as the methodology in an online environment, as in
the current study, offers many possibilities but it also raises many considerations regarding
ethics, access, protections of privacy or anonymity and publicity. The ethics in an internet
ethnographic approach entail carefully examination for each particular case.
Ethnographers must assure that the participants of the community where the research will be
undertaken are not harmed or exploited due to the study. Therefore, the participants need to
be informed about the research scope and the researcher must gain their informed consent
before starting. The respondents were asked whether they prefer to be named or to use a
pseudonym in the written report and if they wanted to see the results of the research. As an
ethnographer, I need to concern cautiously their choices before, during and after the research.
As Genzuk’s guidelines (2003, p. 8) suggest, the students observed and questioned, as well
as their University teachers, will remain anonymous. The participants were not asked about
their gender, ages, place of birth, religious affinities or cultural backgrounds. An agreement
from both Universities was signed by the Spanish teachers responsible for the
telecollaboration, as well as by their respective superiors. The students signed up a consent
form supplied by the researcher regarding the ethical conditions of the research, in order to
approve on condition that the data obtained in the project can be used for academical purposes
and whether the collected material is allowed to be published or not. The students kept contact
via email, so they were only asked for a first name or an appropriate pseudonym and an email
address, no telephone number or other private data was needed for the exchange. Some of
them did exchange them under their own choice and responsibility.
Furthermore, the use of digital tools, data collection from the internet and the respect of the
internet researcher to the Web are also important ethical matters. Murthy (2011, p. 167) quotes
Robinson’s (2011) claim: "[…] if our identities in cyberspace are extensions of our off-line
identities, they must be afforded the same ethical consideration as they would be given in the
off-line world".
The videoconferencing programme Jitsi meet does not require an account, nor downloading
and everyone can be invited to participate via a custom URL. It allows chatting while

40

videoconferencing with an integrated chat and also sharing documents and the desktop. It is
a fully encrypted 100% open-source videoconferencing solution which can be used for free
without time limits. The researcher can easily observe the interaction of all the participants of
the group in the video conference. The big screen shows the person/s who is/are talking at
that time and small captures of all the persons are continuously shown down on the left side.
The programme makes it possible to save the videos and send them to Dropbox. The files of
the study were later deleted from Dropbox and kept in an external storage.
The students were anonymised. Their family names were not required for the study. In the
template for field notes they are coded HAS1/HAS2 as per Hanken Student and UUS/UUS2
as Utrecht University Student (Annex C). To preserve the participants’ words, avoid source
identification and minimise the risk of exposing the identity of the participants, many scholars
choose to paraphrase textual data. In this current study, the participants’ words are mainly
paraphrased. The students communicated in a A2 level of Spanish when doing the tasks,
otherwise they could use English. Their words were literally transcribed only if they were
imperative for the study.
Franzke, Bechmann, Zimmer, Ess (2020) and the Association of Internet Researchers present
the guidelines IRE 3.0 for researchers, students, members of the association and technical
developers facing ethical concerns in their work. This new document (AoIR, 2019) includes
different ethical considerations depending on the stages of the research: initial design
(including ethical issues seeking grant funding), processes (including acquiring data), analyses
(using techniques or instruments), dissemination (publicizing research findings and data) and
close of the project (destruction of research data and related material). Franzke et al. (2020 p.
5) presume thus ethical pluralism and cross-cultural awareness: “Cross-cultural awareness is
required

when

internet

research

projects

involve

either

researchers

and/or

subjects/participants/informants from diverse national and cultural backgrounds”.

4. Results
This chapter reports the results of the observation of the videos recorded. Based on the
context, previous research and the theory of this thesis, I investigated group dynamics in the
students’ telecollaboration intending to uncover expressions of their attitudes and behaviour
related to intercultural competence. Observation endorses ethnography as the descriptive
qualitative research method of this thesis.
The students’ virtual interaction was recorded in real time; however, no participant
synchronous observation was undertaken. I carried out the observation some time later. The

41

raw data and transcripts collected during the observation is included in the thesis, although not
in this section. The templates filled with the notes taken are displayed at Appendix D, whereas
the compilated and thorough analysis of the results will be exposed hereunder.
Following a theory-driven analysis, the data collected and displayed in this section was
classified in five main categories as per Deardorff’s model of Intercultural Competence (2006).
The main categories in the classification of the results are: 1. Respect, 2. Openness, 3.
Curiosity and discovery, 4. Appropriate communication and 5. Appropriate behaviour. The first
three review expressions of attitudes and the following two review behaviour. The findings are
also supported by Arasaratnam’s models (2005, 2011), the model of Durden et al. (2016) and
Fantini’s framework (2006).
Since the results are multiple and of equal significance, I chose to present them in a systematic
disposition. I present first a hierarchy chart of each main category divided in subcategories to
further illustrate the key findings. Afterwards, in order to help the reader to better understand
each finding, I display a short explanation of a result with one example or more if significant.
When naming who expressed the examples, I use the code HAS1 or HAS2 for Hanken
students and UUS1 or UUS2 for Utrecht University students. Each result is followed by the
next result, its explanation and its example/s. After listing the results of every main category, I
include a short summary of them. Finally, at the end of the section, a brief synthesis of all the
key findings from every subcategory is added to provide a narrative connection to the
discussion of the results, in the following section.
The findings regarding the respondents’ manifestation of attitudes towards an intercultural
situation refer to the first research question: How do the students express attitudes during
intercultural telecollaboration? They are based on the first step in Deardorff’s Model of
Intercultural Competence (2006), categorized as “Attitudes” in the model, and including:
Respect, Openness, and Curiosity and discovery.
1. Respect
The category labelled “Respect” was divided into subcategories according to figure 6.

Figure 6. Description of the category “Respect” in subcategories.

42

The respondents showed respect for the cultures of others by listening with attention to their
peers’ explanations and welcoming them. They smiled, nodded or agreed with a simple “ok”
or “yes” when the peer colleagues talked about their customs and habits, noticing and
appreciating cultural diversity. For example, a Hanken student (HAS2) told her peers in Utrecht
that Finns are barefoot at home and she even showed them her foot. They listened with
attention. UUS1 responded with “ok” meanwhile UUS2 commented appreciatively that she is
Turkish and they also are barefoot at home (VIDEO 1).
They demonstrated that the others’ and their own cultures are valuable by encouraging the
other students. A student from Utrecht University (UUS2) constantly said “very good” or “that’s
nice” when a Hanken student (HAS2) talked about their university associations, the canteen
and student life in Vaasa (VIDEO 2).
The students showed kindness and politeness in helping the others to follow the conversation
in their lingua franca. They translated into English or repeated the sentence in another way
trying to make them understand. For example, in VIDEO 1 an Utrecht student (UUS2) asked
and explained in English when noticing that the others (UUS1, HAS1 and HAS2) did not
understand.
They made considerate statements valuing other cultures, such as “I like my university
because it is international” (UUS1, VIDEO 2) or towards cultures in the group “They are just
different cultures!” (HAS2, VIDEO 3).
Respect was shown by appropriate mindsets. The students were considerate, well-mannered
and polite towards each other and valued their peers, their cultures and cultural diversity. No
bad reaction, arrogance or disrespect was observed. No one showed any inappropriate sign
or word against the others and the others’ cultures.
1. Openness
The category labelled “Openness” was divided into subcategories according to figure 7.

Figure 7. Description of the category “Openness” in subcategories.

43

The students were open about themselves, their own customs and other aspects regarding
their own culture. For example, an Utrecht University student (UUS2) revealed personal
information. She said that she started drinking alcohol at the age of 16. Her fellow student at
Hanken (HAS2) asked why and she said that it was just a question of different cultures (VIDEO
3). Two Finnish students (HAS1 and HAS2) admitted that they did not like going to sauna
(VIDEO 1).
The students were non-judgmental and they were disposed to accept their peers’ judgements,
even when disagreeing. The student UUS2 in VIDEO 4 identified himself as a typical Dutch
young man when smoking marihuana, being tall and big, practicing sports and liking going out.
He waited for the other students’ reaction and judgement regarding cannabis and asked if they
smoked it. HAS1 answered she did not and that it is illegal in Finland. No judgements followed.
The students showed patience and tolerance and accepted diverse cultural differences. For
example, HAS1 showed to be very patient during the complete recording. He did not express
any worry or nervousness. He was calm. He waited for his turn to talk and spoke serenely. He
listened to his peer colleagues talking about diverse stereotypes and differences between
cultures. They also accepted HAS1 being quiet. When suddenly a student (UUS1) could not
see him in the screen of her computer, he kept calm and asked the student to wait a minute.
Then he continued as normal (VIDEO 5).
The students were receptive to different cultures, ways of thinking, feeling and behaving
without any sensation of being challenged or threatened. They discussed stereotypes without
any difficulties. In VIDEO 1, VIDEO 4 and VIDEO 5 the groups performed task 1 which included
the discussion of stereotypes. They discussed about what they considered stereotypes about
their own cultures and about their peers’ culture. The students knew in advanced that the task
referred to Spanish and Latin-American, Finnish and Dutch stereotypes, but they happened to
meet also students from other cultural backgrounds. The stereotypes considered in each video
are the following:
VIDEO 1: “There are a lot of bikes in the Netherlands” (HAS1), “All the Finns have a sauna”
(UUS2), “Dutch people eat a lot of fries” (UUS2), “All Dutch like cheese” (UUS1), “Dutch are
very tall” (UUS1), “Dutch have blue eyes” (UUS2).
VIDEO 4: “Dutch are tall” (UUS2), “Dutch smoke marihuana. I think it applies Amsterdam”
(UUS1), “Finns have saunas” (UUS2), “We do not walk with wood shoes” (UUS1), “I live
alone with two other students” (UUS2), “In Finland it is always cold and snowy” (HAS1), “We
are very shy. We do not talk to unknown people, for example in a bus” (HAS2), “We drink a lot
of alcohol, especially Vodka” (HAS1), “Spanish people sleep siesta and eat paella” (UUS2),
“Spanish people have dinner very late” (HAS2).

44

VIDEO 5: “All people in Holland eat Gouda cheese” (UUS2), “Dutch people go by bike
everywhere” (UUS2), “Dutch are very tall” (UUS2), “We drink a lot of alcohol” (HAS1), “In
Holland people smoke marihuana.” (HAS1), “Dutch are very direct when speaking” (UUS1),
“Dutch people are stingy. They don’t want to spend money. They are not generous ” (UUS1),
“All Germans drink sparkling water” (UUS1), “Finnish people have sauna at home” (UUS1),
“Finnish people drink a lot of alcohol” (UUS1), “People in Finland are very calm” (UUS2),
“Germans like travelling” (UUS1), “Dutch do like travelling too” (UUS2), “Spanish people like
siesta” (UUS2), “Spanish people are machos” (UUS1), “Germans are a bit unfriendly for
example in restaurants and supermarkets” (UUS2), “Germany is a very bureaucratic country”
(UUS2).
Openness towards intercultural learning and people from other cultures was likewise shown
by appropriate attitudes. The students were open when talking about themselves and their
cultures withholding judgements. They were open-minded and tolerant. They did not show any
prejudices and they were willing to welcome new cultures. No bias or prejudices were
observed.
2. Curiosity and discovery
The category labelled “Curiosity and discovery” was divided into subcategories according to
figure 8.

Figure 8. Description of the category “Curiosity and discovery” in subcategories.

The students attempted to ask things they did not feel comfortable with. They dared to discuss
a delicate or controversial subject, entered the uncomfortable zone and became aware of the
differences in their respective cultures. However, they did not show to accept them. For
example, a Hanken student (HAS2) asked his peer from Utrecht University (UUS2) at what
age the consumption of cannabis is allowed in the Netherlands (VIDEO 3).

45

The respondents’ attitudes as sensation seekers were also observed in the videos. They
showed interest in other cultures expressing their wish to travel to certain countries for
pleasure, cultural trips or for study-programs. In VIDEO 1 an Utrecht student (UUS1) asked
the other students in the group where they would like to travel. She admitted herself being
interested of travelling to Indonesia, Mali and Ecuador. Another student (UUS2) in VIDEO 5
explained for his peers that he was living with his parents in Germany, his home country, due
to the pandemic. He did not identify himself as a typical German student since the majority do
not study abroad. He was attending three different studies at Utrecht University. He revealed
his motivation to search for opportunities for studies abroad and a positive attitude towards
sensation seeking. UUS2 at VIDEO 2 told her peers her wish of visiting Finland in the near
future.
They also demonstrated their willingness to meet other cultures. The participants asked their
peers with curiosity about different cultural features. They showed also curiosity by learning
expressions related to their language, their gastronomy, customs, habits or other cultural
aspects. For example, a Hanken student (HAS2) asked his fellows from Utrecht University
(UUS1, UUS2) what was behind the English expression “going Dutch” (VIDEO 1). Another
Hanken student (HAS) asked his peer colleagues in the Netherlands about Dutch food. He told
them that her girlfriend liked “stroopwaffels” and “poffertjes” and he wanted to know what the
latter were precisely (VIDEO 3).
The curiosity about people from other cultures and the discovery of intercultural learning was
demonstrated by appropriate attitudes. The overall observation was that students were willing
and interested to meet other cultures. Some of them however showed less curiosity.
The findings regarding the following two categories of appropriate communication and
appropriate behaviour in an intercultural situation are related to the second research question:
How do students behave when interacting in intercultural telecollaboration? They are based
on the final step in Deardorff’s Model of Intercultural Competence (2006), categorized as
“External outcomes” in the model. Empathy, classified in Deardorff’s Model as internal
outcome, is considered a behavioural variable according to Durden et al. (2016), a significant
variable in Arasaratnam and Banerjee’s model (2010), and a quality in Fantini’s framework
(2006). Consequently, it was included in this category of results under the division “Appropriate
behaviour”.
3. Appropriate communication
The category labelled “Appropriate communication” was divided into subcategories according
to figure 9.

46

Figure 9. Description of the category “Appropriate communication” in subcategories.

The respondents actively listened to the other members of the multicultural group. They waited
for the others to finish their statements and they took their turn to talk later on. The students
HAS1 & HAS2 in videos number 2, 3 and 4, HAS2 in video 1 and UUS4 in VIDEO 5 showed
to be active listeners by keeping silent and responding afterward to the others’ discussion.
Most of the students from Utrecht University were direct in their questions or answers. For
example, in VIDEO 4, the groupmates were performing their first task about stereotypes when
a Hanken student (HAS2) told her peers that Finnish people did not talk to unknown people,
only to family and friends. UUS2 immediately asked if she did it. An Utrecht student (UUS1) in
VIDEO 5 admitted that a stereotype about Dutch people is that they say things straight.
In four videos, the students from Utrecht University lead the conversation and kept it going. In
the fifth video this ability was shared in the group. Utrecht students were more talkative and
open than the Hanken students. They asked and clarified in English if the other students did
not understand showing respect and also an appropriate communication. For example: the
student UUS2 in VIDEO 1; the students UUS1, UUS2, and HAS2 in VIDEO 2; UUS1 in VIDEO
4 and UUS2 in VIDEO 5 explained some words in English so the others could follow their
intercultural communication.
Hanken students minced their words, they showed being more introvert and quiet in the
conversation than their peer colleagues. An example was the student HAS1 in VIDEO 5, also
considered heretofore an example of patience and tolerance. HAS1 in VIDEO 1 is another
example. The exceptions to this pattern were the students HAS2 in VIDEO 2 and HAS2 in
VIDEO 3, who were talkative and good communicators.
They used polite questions and expressions also when talking outside the tasks. The student
HAS1 said “Nice to meet you” as farewell at the end the task and UUS1 asked in a gracious
English for permission to leave the meeting: “Do you mind if I leave?” (VIDEO 1).
The students use non-verbal language with hand or facial gestures. An Utrecht student (UUS1)
with blended cultural background and another one not originally from the Netherlands were
very expressive and move constantly their hands when talking in VIDEO 2 and VIDEO 5. A

47

Hanken student (HAS1) was very communicative by his facial gestures (VIDEO 3). The student
HAS2 became very happy and showed thumbs up when UUS2 said that she and UUS1 would
come to Finland. HAS2 asked out of the tasks how their university had been affected by the
pandemic. UUS2 said their University would close the following day. “Ours from tomorrow too!”,
responded HAS2. UUS2 virtually slapped hand in a “high five” to her (VIDEO 2). In most cases
the screen showed only the correspondents’ face or the upper part from their shoulders, so
their hands could not always be seen.
They used interjections to express different emotions as giving compliments and encouraging
each other. For example, an Utrecht student (UUS2) in VIDEO 4 used many interjections like
“oh!” or “ah!” to express admiration, surprise, happiness, encouragement or approval. Another
student (UUS1) in VIDEO 1 said “Wau!” to express surprise and admiration when HAS2 talked
about Swedish being the second official language in Finland.
An appropriate communication occurred by listening to each other, respecting turns to talk,
encouraging and giving compliments, using polite language, keeping the conversation going,
following one’s own norms and customs but also respecting the others. The communication
was slow in the first video due to some technical issues and to language knowledge limitations,
but fluent in the other four videos. No inappropriate or aggressive communication was
observed.
4. Appropriate behaviour
The category labelled “Appropriate behaviour” was divided into subcategories according to
figure 10.

Figure 10. Description of the category “Appropriate behaviour” in subcategories.

The students collaborated and supported each other in confusing situations, clarified
misunderstandings and continued performing their task. The Finnish respondents were
responsible for recording and saving the videos. They collaborated with their peers and
provided support when technological difficulties arose regarding the application used for

48

videoconferencing or other matters on the recording. A Hanken student (HAS2) in VIDEO 3
was an example for helping his peer colleague with the connection of her camera.
Expressions of empathy toward other cultures were clearly shown. In a particular case (VIDEO
3) a Dutch respondent (UUS2) displayed empathy towards her peers when they discussed the
different legal ages for consuming alcoholic beverages in Finland and in the Netherlands and
about at what age young people started drinking. She said it was a question of different
cultures. The student UUS1 in VIDEO 5 was also respectful and empathic with the others in
another cultural matter.
The respondents acted with humbleness and did not try to impress the others. For example,
when UUS2 in VIDEO 5 told the peer colleagues that he was studying three different degrees
at the same time at Utrecht University or when HAS2 in VIDEO 2 told the peers about the good
education and benefits that Hanken offered: the food, the great university associations, etc.
They did not behave haughtily, in an unfriendly or arrogant way or considering themselves
better than the others.
In VIDEO 1, VIDEO 2 and VIDEO 3 some students at both Utrecht University and Hanken
appeared to be worried and expressed unease in different ways: by turning a cord of the
sweater all the time, constantly touching their hair or looking at their nails, eating chocolate,
drinking water very often or by using dry snuff. In one case the student made noises and spoke
when eating, but the others kept on conversing. Some of them expressed anxiety as a personal
characteristic or a state evoking in these particular intercultural situations.
The respondents laughed and smiled repeatedly during the telecollaboration. Some students
showed humour and a Finnish participant (UUS1, VIDEO 3) made funny face gestures twice
to keep the participants motivation. Humour is not a variable studied by Deardorff or included
in other models, but it is part of Fantini’s framework (2006) for assessing intercultural
competence in case studies. Humour was demonstrated by different persons in all the videos
and joy was also revealed in every interaction. For example, UUS2 explained to her
groupmates in VIDEO 2 that surprisingly in the Netherlands there was a city with more “coffee
shops” than secondary schools. HAS2 kidding and with humour responded “Very good!” and
laughed for a while.
In addition to these subcategories, I could observe acceptance and as the only reaction from
the students towards each other’s’ behaviour. No expressions of non-acceptance or
disappointment of the others’ behaviour are shown in the videos.
An appropriate behaviour was shown by supporting others having difficulties, by being humble,
empathic, following one’s own norms and customs but respecting also the others’ culture.
Some expressions of discomfort or worry about the situation were understandable. No
49

unacceptable or discouraging behaviour was observed. Ethnocentrism, belief that one
student’s culture is better than all others, was not exposed.
Regarding the results listed above it can be indicated that videos 1, 2 and 3 presented the
most findings as seen by the number of examples presented in each observed ability. This can
be also determined by the quantity of notes taken during the observation and stated in the first
six filled templates (two per video).
In this section I identified five main categories: respect, openness, curiosity and discovery,
appropriate communication and appropriate behaviour as expressed by the correspondents in
the telecollaboration. The students expressed respect by appreciating with a smile or nodding
their peers’ explanations about cultural differences; encouraging them; helping them with the
communication and making considerate statements towards other cultures. They did not have
any bad reaction nor expression of arrogance or disrespect.
The students expressed openness towards intercultural learning and people from other
cultures by being open about themselves, non-judgmental and disposed to accept their peers’
judgements, receptive to different cultures, not feeling challenged or threatened and being
patient and tolerant. They discussed stereotypes without hindrances or difficulties. They did
not express any prejudices nor bias.
They expressed curiosity and discovery by taking risks to discuss and ask about uncomfortable
subjects and showing sensation seeking when expressing their wishes to travel to certain
countries for pleasure, cultural trips or for study-programs and also when searching information
and asking their peers about different cultural features. However, some of students did not
show curiosity.
The participants in the telecollaboration communicated appropriately by following one’s own
norms and customs regarding communication but also respecting the others (direct
communication and silence), listening to each other and respecting turns to talk, using polite
language, encouraging and giving compliments verbally or through non-verbal communication.
Sometimes their communication was slow or temporary interrupted.
They behaved appropriately by following one’s own norms and customs regarding behaviour
but respecting also the others’ culture (humour), collaborating and supporting each other with
difficulties, being empathic as well as humble. Some expressions of anxiety about the situation
were understandable. Ethnocentrism was not exposed.
The previous results characterized the participants’ attitudinal expressions and appropriate
communicative and behavioural expressions towards intercultural telecollaboration. They will
be discussed in the following section of this thesis.

50

5. Discussion
This section explores the relevance and consequences of the results of the study. It includes
an interpretation of the findings related to the research questions, the implication of the
findings, and possible limitations. Accordingly, after a general discussion, the section is divided
into four subsections: an ethnographic interpretation of e-collaboration in the context of this
study, a method discussion, hindrances possibly affecting the results, and the conclusion of
the study.
The research questions for this study, How do the students express attitudes during
intercultural telecollaboration? and How do students behave when interacting in intercultural
telecollaboration? sought to visualise the university students’ attitudes and behaviour in an
intercultural practice of SFL learning. The purpose was to examine their intercultural
competence when they collaborate online.
The results indicate that the university students cultivated intercultural competence during the
virtual exchange; they demonstrated holding requisite attitudes and their appropriate behaviour
denoted outcomes in the development of intercultural competence.
In line with Deardorff’s model (2006), the development of intercultural competence starts with
attitudes and ends in external outcomes. In terms of attitudes, the students showed respect
for their peer students’ cultures, openness towards intercultural learning and people from other
cultures, as well as curiosity and discovery.
The students expressed respect or valuing cultures (Deardorff, 2006) by listening to each
other, by being encouraging, by helping each other, or by making considerate statements
about each other’s cultures. Respect is not only shown at the beginning of a process as
Deardorff illustrates, but also during the whole session. No bad reaction, nor a disrespectful
sign or word against each other’s cultures was observed from the students.
Active listening, empathy and effective engagement are essential components in cultural
competence according to Durden et al. (2016). The students demonstrated these abilities
when creating a welcoming environment in their telecollaboration. Active listening constitutes
an individual variable in Deardorff’s model that contributes to attain cultural competence.
However, this variable is not considered a requirement in the process. The model illustrates
these so called “skills” as its second step and as part of the individual level. These particular
skills are expressed by the students in the practice of collaboration at the same time as other
variables. This contributes to appreciate my hesitation on Deardorff’s model concerning the
preestablished order of the process. My visual perception of the process is instead illustrated

51

by the IC in the centre and surrounded by the different components or abilities, connected but
excluding the sequential order. My interpretation will be presented at the end of this section.
Deardorff’s first model (2004) already emphasised the need of openness. Openness was
shown by the students who were open about themselves and about aspects of their own
culture. They were non-judgmental and willing to accept the judgements of others. They
admitted differences, were receptive to different cultures and could discuss stereotypes without
any hindrances. According to O’Dowd (2010), researchers consider that telecollaboration
could reinforce stereotypes of the cultures involved, that is, more people would believe in a
specific and commonly agreed perception. Likewise, Zhu (2011) warns about stereotypes,
prejudices, and lack of cultural sensitivity as obstacles in the process of cultivating intercultural
empathy. Empathy is an essential ability in fostering intercultural communication. Contrariwise,
here the results indicate that the students’ discussions about stereotypes (which definition is
explained in their assessment), helped them to clarify the ones that were not accurate and did
not correspond to the conceptions of the aspects or people they described or concerned. The
students did not try to impose their own opinions.
Curiosity and discovery also emerged before and during the telecollaboration. As Deardorff
refers, curiosity sets the foundation for creative ways to change differences into possibilities
(LeBaron and Pillow, 2006). The participants tolerated ambiguity and they felt curious already
at the beginning of the project when it was explained for them in previous lessons at the
university. The explanation awakened the students’ interest in the project and some of them
got very curious about Hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory. Most of them already showed
their interest towards the Dutch culture and they requested more information about their peers.
They got very happy to receive an “ice-breaking” video from the Spanish teacher and her
students at Utrecht University prior their group tasks. In response, a very nice introduction
video was prepared and sent to the Dutch university. The video contained a presentation of
Hanken School of Economics, the classroom, and the participants in the Spanish course. The
participants also showed curiosity about cultural features in the videos recorded for the
assignments. They had searched information beforehand about the peers’ cultures or they
learnt it from them, and they contrasted it further on when performing the tasks. Their
disposition to discovery was also reflected by their wishes and dreams about travelling to other
countries, not only to Finland and to the Netherlands.
Some Hanken students already showed this attitude of curiosity and discovery when they were
told about the organisation of the telecollaborative project, about Hofstede’s dimensions of
culture, and about my thesis.

52

Sensation seeking is a personality variable in Arasaratnam’s model of ICC (2011) referring the
willingness to participate in intercultural contact-seeking behaviour. Sensation seekers enjoy
exciting experiences associated to adventure and risk. Arasaratnam and Banerjee (2011) state
that sensation seekers enjoy emotionally intense and physiologically stimulating experiences.
Afterward, Arasaratnam (2017) adds that sensation seekers are willing to be part in
intercultural contact-seeking behaviour such as travelling abroad for study programmes. The
wish of studying in Finland was also expressed by two Dutch students in one of the videos.
As per Deardorff (2004), curiosity can be shown by detecting verbal or non-verbal actions that
can be less appropriate in a certain culture. This is not exposed in the videos. On the other
hand, the students felt curious and they dared to verbally ask about aspects they felt
uncomfortable with (for example about the legal consumption of marijuana in the Netherlands,
which is an illegal practice in Finland, or the differences in legal ages for alcohol consumption
in both countries) and contrasted them with their own culture. These abilities allowed the
participants to be aware of the existence of differences and similarities within their cultures,
without any need of accepting them. They demonstrated empathetic considerations and values
during the Spanish language learning, which Zhu (2011) considers a requirement for language
students in cross-cultural situations in order to improve cultural communication. This empathy
or cultural sensitivity allows the students to be placed into the cultural background of the target
language and of their peers’ in order to better understand them and to achieve an effective
intercultural communication.
The results correspond with previous research that showed that the foreign language learners
hold the aptitude to communicate and interact with people from other countries and cultures in
their lingua franca when improving the intercultural communicative competence and linguistic
knowledge (Byram, 1997). This endorses also that the intercultural communicative
competence comprises sociolinguistic, discourse, strategic, socio-cultural and social
competence, plus linguistic knowledge. Likewise, according to Coperías Aguilar (2010), the
ICC can be understood as the interaction in a foreign language. Therefore, the competence of
the participants in the exchange is also related to their language knowledge. People from
different countries and languages bring their knowledge about their own country and about the
country of the others when they interact socially. The success of the interaction will partly
depend on the establishment and continuation of human relationships based on attitudinal
factors. Both knowledge and attitude are influenced by the processes of intercultural
communication.
The communication showed to be appropriate. More students from Utrecht University were
open and direct in their statements to their Finnish peers; meanwhile these were more introvert
and quiet. Hofstede’s (1980) dimensions of culture partially support this cultural feature. On
53

the other hand, the individualism that the Finnish and the Dutch societies are characterised
with in the second dimension of his theory is not covered in the telecollaboration. Regarding
Hofstede’s second dimension, the students may take certain individual initiatives during their
telecollaboration. Nevertheless, they did not show priority for their own interests over those of
the group. Instead, they expressed the sense of belongingness to the group already during the
first task. They helped their mates with technical uses and/or with the language. The students
held the conversation by asking and encouraging the others and some called their peers by
their names showing closeness and friendship. This could be understood as the opportunity
the telecollaboration within groups of students from diverse cultures offers to encourage
fellowship among the participants and to reduce individualism in reference to other abilities
that conceptualise cultural competence. In a big scale, this could not be assumed as
individualism and isolation but as collectivism and globalisation.
The non-verbal communication in CALL (Computer Assisted Language Learning) is restrained
and can lead to misunderstanding. The body language, as well as humorous expressions, can
be negative when having different interpretations and not sharing the same sense of humour.
This is however not the case in this telecollaboration. There were no reactions of
misunderstanding in any case in the videos. It would be interesting to investigate Victor Borge’s
quote: “a smile is the shortest distance between two persons” in relation to telecollaboration.
The behaviour was likewise appropriate. The concept “appropriate behaviour” can be
dispersed and could be understood differently from diverse points of views and different
cultures. Arasaratnam and Doerfel (2005), as well as Arasaratnam and Banerjee (2010),
defined this variable as the socially expected and accepted manner. Later, Arasaratnam adds
(2016) that appropriateness is also seen from other persons’ point of view and has a contextual
context. Following these concepts, an appropriate behaviour was understood as a considered
behaviour, accepted or contemplated to be normal by all the participants. The multiple
examples in the recorded videoconferences of the students’ interactions confirm this.
Furthermore, their joy in interacting with other students from other cultures is clearly
perceptible. Especially nowadays, when the mobility is restricted due to the current pandemic,
they considered the telecollaboration being an amusing activity for their studies online and a
perfect occasion for interaction with other students from home. This also agrees with
Arasaratnam’s (2016) definition of intercultural competence as “the ability to understand and
interact with people of different cultures in authentic and positive ways” and likewise with the
definition of Durden et al. (2016) as the ability to interact and build significant relationships with
people from different cultural backgrounds. Some of them invite their fellows to visit them in
their country and others even made new friends and shared their Instagram accounts or started
a WhatsApp chat group to keep in contact.

54

Brisnis et al. (1983, p. 3-8) defined intercultural behaviour as an “action that produces a
significant change in the judgements of the actor’s social or skill competence by people from
another cultural background”. Characteristics and thought processes that the person brings to
the intercultural action are considered by them as distal variables in intercultural behaviour.
The students listed functional intercultural skills, which can be recognised in the videos. Among
these intercultural skills they named some past experiences with persons of the host culture
(for example a Hanken student has a Dutch girlfriend); they perceived role and norm
differences (for example regarding alcohol drinking in Finland and in the Netherlands), and
they showed anxiety (for example when using dry tobacco, eating sweets, touching their hair
or looking at their nails all the time). Anxiety that results from intercultural behaviour can be a
personal characteristic or a state evoked in a particular situation. They also demonstrated an
increased ability of working together when having a common assignment and consequently a
centralized goal. Despite being quite individualistic cultures according to Hofstede, the
students cooperated nicely in their assignment and they did not prioritise their own interest
over that of the group. They showed a broad perceptual and cognitive set to view the world
(when learning for example that the use of marihuana is legal in the Netherlands) and the
ability to take another person’s point of view to “become” the other (showing empathy). The
researchers affirmed that people should be prepared for adjustments in intercultural
interactions and that training can help in the preparation. If the training includes information
about the behaviour of the others, it will be easier to explain the behaviour from the others’
point of view. The students prepared the tasks about the peers’ culture and the Spanish culture.
They collected some previous information and discussed later stereotypes concerning their
own culture and the other cultures. Brisnis et al. (Ibid.) also stated that training cannot stop
stereotyping but can present the nature of the stereotypes and their mistakes so that people
can search for further and enriched information, as the students did when discussing
stereotypes. The reactions to the others’ cultural features are not many (a couple of
correspondents do not show any of them) but adequate regarding the extent of this study.
However, it is important to highlight that the students showed no expressions of nonacceptance or disappointment towards the behaviour of the others, which endorses that they
behaved appropriately during their cultural interaction.
The results support the consensus definition of ICC as it refers to appropriateness, i.e., to
display estimated and accepted behaviour in context (Arasaratnam & Banerjee, 2010). The
definition also includes effectiveness and the ability to achieve one’s own goals. The latter has
not been examined for this study from the affective and behavioural perspective, as already
mentioned, due to the difficulty of identifying it from others’ perspective or not knowing
beforehand the students’ own purpose and goals.

55

The students not seemed to be very observant about their peers’ cultural features. Instead,
they concentrated on handling the language in order to perform a good task in Spanish. They
are young and they are continuously learning when meeting and interacting with people from
other cultures. The assignment eased to discover these features. However, as Hall’s iceberg
analogy of culture (1976) shows, few aspects of culture stand explicit, are observable, and can
be easily identified like the visual part of an iceberg. This part includes behaviour, language,
clothes, food and other aspects that can be felt by the senses. The invisible part of the iceberg
hides other manifestations of culture that are hardly revealed and difficult to be observed such
as attitudes. This deeper part also includes beliefs, values, communication style, perception,
concept of time, body language, cultural approach to interpersonal relationships, and social
norms. Some of these cultural aspects could be identified from the students when analysing
the videos. Nevertheless, real fundamentals, submerged in the human subconscious (Hall,
1956, 1979), could not be recognised.
As presented and discussed above, the data collected from the samples indicates that the
students, on a personal level and on an interaction level, accomplished with the requisites of
attitudes and behaviour needed in the process of cultivating intercultural competence.
According to Deardorff’s model, the skills and knowledge are part of the development of
intercultural competence, but not a prerequisite to attain it. Based on that, the students can
also show some external outcome even not showing skills and knowledge. This statement,
although proved, can be difficult to assent and instead could be understood as the fact that an
individual can acquire skills and knowledge during the whole process.
Deardorff (2006) sustains that the more components acquired and developed from her model,
the bigger intercultural competence results as an external outcome. Other components can
also be learnt. The achievement of the students in terms of level or improvement of learning,
was not evaluated. However, different variables in the students’ process of cultivating cultural
competence, from Deardorff’s model and from other models, were observed.
Figure 11 below presents a personal interpretation of intercultural communication in
telecollaboration based on Deardorff’s Model of intercultural competence, Arasaratnam’s
Model and Kock’s 3C Collaboration model for group work. Only the skills and abilities observed
and discussed in this study have been taken into consideration:

and communicating in an intercultural situation. Their intercultural competence stays in the
centre and is surrounded by their abilities. The expressions based on different models and
observed and discussed in the study are included in figure 11. These skills can be shown
during the interaction without any certain sequence, not appear at all, or appear in another
situation. The development of intercultural competence is an individual life-long process and
this figure represents it in a certain situation of e-collaboration. Coordination and cooperation
stay essential in telecollaboration as per Kock’s 3C collaboration model for the interplay in
group work in a computer-supported workspace.

5.1 An ethnographic interpretation of e-collaboration: a digital echoculture
The dynamic collaborative tasks in this educational project by e-collaboration were related to
culture, habits and stereotypes. These three aspects of the observed and studied culture are
described in this section after my perception as an ethnographer.
From an ethnographic point of view, I could define the telecollaboration in this specific context
as a culture of cooperation; a collaborative culture in which the individuals help each other to
accomplish a common task without meeting cultural prejudices or obstacles. Some students,
mostly the ones at Hanken, were more skilled in the technical part of the telecollaboration and
they helped their peers with it. Other participants, mostly the ones from Utrecht University, had

57

a more fluent Spanish language or more confidence in their knowledge and supported their
colleagues’ conversation when performing the tasks. Although both groups of students belong
to individualist societies, they cooperated effortlessly.
The students from Utrecht University seemed to be more used to meeting people with diverse
cultural backgrounds. One possible reason for this is the fact that their university welcomes
every year many exchange students from all over the world. The population of the city is about
six times bigger than Vaasa and, in 2020, the university of Utrecht had an enrollment of approx.
35300 students. The students at Utrecht University participating in this virtual exchange
studied different disciplines. Thus, they only knew each other from their common Spanish
course. Despite this, they were more open and felt more comfortable working with unknown
people from other cultures. Furthermore, they were more talkative than their peers in Finland.
Approx. 2550 students studied at Hanken year 2020. The students at Hanken all study
economics and participate in other common subjects. However, they showed to be quieter and
shyer in the videos. The combination and collaboration of these two different groups worked
perfectly in this context.
I could observe different habits in the performance of the task: some students individually
prepared themselves in advance, few improvised during the interaction, but most of them
agreed previously within their group on how to perform it together.
The telecollaboration, and especially the online language teaching, counts with some general
stereotypes. The most expanded statement is that beginners of a foreign language cannot be
taught online, or at least, it is not considered as an effective learning method when starting to
learn a language. The in-class teaching is preferential. As their teacher and from my
observations, I could appreciate the effectiveness of the digital didactics and of the virtual
exchanges. My students were more concentrated when performing tasks in the computersupported space than in class. It has been studied that the perception of information of our
sensory organs decreases in these spaces. Conversely, that helps to filter irrelevant
information and reduces other disturbances that occur in face-to-face collaborations. The
technology and internet connections work smoothly nowadays in Europe. Hence, the sound
and image of the participants do not differ much from the in-class teaching. Biases about the
weaknesses and disadvantages of online learning might have changed after the current
pandemic.
Another preconception is that tandem language learning constitutes a better option for the
students since they learn each other’s mother tongue. The participants are “language experts”
in their own language. In this telecollaboration the students learnt a common foreign language,
a lingua franca. The fact that they were at approximately the same level in Spanish permitted

58

them to dare to practice the language in a more relaxed situation. They did not feel much
pressure for not understanding each other well and they did not have the need to be at a very
good level to be able to communicate with a native speaker.
It is also said that when living abroad, one defends and appreciates her/his own culture the
most. In this telecollaboration the participants felt proud of their own cultural or multicultural
features even when they were not living abroad. They did not become arrogant, they did not
show off, nor did they depreciate other cultures. In fact, they respected and appreciated the
other cultures.
To sum up, I would define the observed culture of e-collaboration between the two European
countries as a “digital echo”. The word “echo”, in different spellings and meanings, can be
associated to diverse aspects reflected or characterised in the observed culture. “E-co” could
be an abbreviation for e-collaboration but also for European countries in reference to the
countries participating in this project. “Eco” also represents a shortening of ecological, which
would denote the sustainable development of the education through virtual exchanges.
Digitalization and the use of new technologies allow international and intercultural interactions
and collaboration without the need of physical mobility. This, in turn, contributes to the
mitigation of sustainability issues, such as climate change. The students learn digital
competences by exploiting the potential of sustainable ICT that will be useful also in their
professional lives. Global issues require global interaction, collaboration, and solutions.
Accordingly, challenges related to sustainability development need interdisciplinary and
intercultural competences in order to be mitigated or solved.
Furthermore, and most of all, the word “echo” describes the continuous expansive learning
produced by telecollaboration. Virtual exchanges can be performed in shorter and longer
cycles. The sound waves are reflected back from surfaces, and therefore, the sound is
repeated. Interaction entitles to reflection and feedback, which consequently allows for
expansive learning.
The sound waves produced by an echo depend on each other. The participants in the virtual
interaction represent a social interdependence; they are positively depending on each other.
The sound waves travel at 343 m/s through the air and faster through solids. They transfer
energy from the source of the sound. Telecollaboration transfers energy in form of knowledge
and culture.
In this way, the culture of telecollaboration in language learning can be compared to a “digital
echo” when contributing to the propagation of cultures and to the expansion of
internationalisation.

5.2 Discussion of the method
I chose to collect qualitative data, which places more emphasis on the phenomena that are
studied (Cohen et al., 2007). Virtual ethnography focuses nowadays on researching
phenomena and cultures in online environments (Haverinen, 2015). In this study,
ethnographical observation is the chosen method for data collection and theory-driven content
analysis is preferred for evaluating the collected data.
Diverse aspects of the research method and approach are reviewed in this section. The main
subjects discussed below stay the task as a qualitative researcher, as an e-ethnographer and
as an observer as well as the correspondents’ participation.
Qualitative researchers should plan a detailed research strategy (Cohen et al., 2007), but they
should still be flexible to change contexts and situations where the research takes place
(Pekkola, 2014). The current pandemic probably disturbed the functionability of Jitsi since
many people in the world suddenly started to communicate online and made use of this free
and open-source videoconferencing programme. The students became overwhelmed for some
time, and the connections weakened and worsened. As their teacher and also the researcher
of the study, I encouraged them to use Skype instead when they had big issues with Jitsi. The
poor quality in some of the videos moderately disturbed my task as an e-ethnographer as well
as the students’ communication. Fortunately, there were numerous videos to analyse and
many with good quality.
Cohen et al. (2007) mentioned that Meinefeld (2004) maintains that in qualitative approaches
the research is much more open and emergent than in other approaches. The researcher has
an influence on the study. My own culture could affect the interpretation of the results. I am
Spanish, I have lived in a Swedish-speaking community in Finland for 22 years and my partner
is Dutch. The thread of subjective observation was already accepted as a risk to validity and
reliability in observation (Cohen et al., 2007). Nevertheless, my wide understanding for at least
these cultures eased the interpretation of the observations and at the same time developed
my intercultural awareness. As Franzke et al. (2020, p.5) presume, ethical pluralism and crosscultural awareness are necessary in a research process when acquiring and also when
destructing data. They are also needed “… when internet research projects involve either
researchers and/or subjects/ participants/informants from diverse national and cultural
backgrounds”. In consequence of my own cross-cultural awareness, I could observe many
different cultural features and generalised ways of acting that the students did not seem to be
aware of. For example, one student drank tea from an Iittala cup, a Marimekko rag was used
in a kitchen, another student ate Fazer sweets, another one removed dry snuff from his mouth
and yet another student left the shoes by the entrance in her apartment.

60

As e-ethnographers currently proceed, I used my computer to collect and analyse offline,
digitalised data in form of videos. I observed the students’ online interaction and I studied their
attitudes and behaviour to identify their culture. The telecollaboration, the context of the
research, was online whilst the observation, the focus of the approach, took place offline and
asynchronously. Not to have to observe their interaction in real time allowed me working with
flexibility on time but still with real and valid information.
In non-participant observation the observer is not attending, but usually the researcher is close
to the phenomenon of the study. This describes my position in this study, which helped to
understand the students’ interaction and eased my task as an observer. However, sometimes
I found it difficult to separate my role as an ethnographer in this study from my job as a teacher.
For example, when trying not to take into account a students’ feedback about the
telecollaboration only meant for the course and not to be included in this study.
Besides the threat of validity due to subjective observation, the presence of the observer can
alter diverse behaviours (Cohen et al., 2007). The students knew that the teacher/researcher
would observe the recordings. This could have influenced their behaviour even though they
knew that they were not synchronously observed.
By observing, the researcher counts with the opportunity of collecting data in social and natural
(or semi-natural) situations in immediate location and time (Cohen et al., 2007). Therefore, this
type of research allows the researcher to collect more valid and real information than other
methods. Responses in a questionnaire or statements in an interview can be completely
different from interactions in video observations. Observation minimize the amount of nonnatural or invalid information. (Bryman, 2018). As this is the case, I could collect more useful
and authentic information from the correspondents’ videos when they interacted online than
the information I had obtained by using other methods.
A known concern named by Pekkola (2014) is the big amount of data that can be collected
when using a qualitative method and the difficulties to handle or limit it. This was not an issue
in this study since it was planned in detail. I used direct observation of the human behaviour
helped by a previously categorised register and I collected data in a predetermined or
systematic way by using encoded templates. Technology helped to handle the data. In addition
to contribute to make interactions across cultures a common experience in our global 21st
century, technology helps to collect valuable information as well as to handle and limit the data.
I finally acknowledge that I could obtain a general and adequate view of the students’
disposition towards the cultures of others when collaborating online. However, one’s own
cultural competence can benefit by being aware of one’s own preconceptions and attitudes
towards other cultures. Consequently, the observations could have been complemented by

61

conducting interviews or sending questionnaires to the participants aiming to involve them
even more in the development of their cultural awareness, to examine their own goals, and to
explore their attitudes towards intercultural telecollaboration more deeply. This would have
resulted in a bigger outcome and endorsement of the results of this study.

5.3 Challenges possibly affecting the results
This study was performed as planned and the results agreed for the most part with the literature
review. Nevertheless, the study explored various challenges or difficulties. I address here three
factors that did not limit my study but could have influenced the students’ behaviour and
interaction and consequently my observation:
A new online experience for the students
Virtual collaboration with European students for developing oral skills in a foreign language
was a completely new experience for the Spanish students in Hanken. Their peer students
were unknown. They spoke Spanish in a semi-authentic situation for the first time. Despite
their high ITC skills, an unknown and new didactic method can also affect the students’
capability, attitude and behaviour. The fact of being recorded and observed is still not
comfortable for all students and it is possible that this circumstance made them behave
differently than in class. This could also have affected their general behaviour when trying to
accomplish the tasks as well as when interacting or communicating within other cultures.
The students’ lack of awareness of the others’ cultural expressions could also agree with the
Encyclopedia of E-collaboration regarding computer-supported workspaces. Kock (2008)
defines awareness as the human’s ability to perceive the other’s activities and one’s own in a
collaborative context. He underlines the fact that despite of the collaborative software nearly
always provides elements and information that allow awareness during interaction, the
awareness is not so effective when interplaying in a computer-supported workspace. The
reason for that is that the means allowing sensory organs to perceive information are limited.
Instead, Baker et al. (2001) state that this also leads to less interferences than when
collaborating face-to-face. Although this is part of the process of developing intercultural
competence in telecollaboration, I did not focus my observation on the online domain, but on
the students’ intercultural interplay.
The knowledge of SFL
Intercultural communication competence refers to the interaction in a foreign language
(Coperías Aguilar, 2010). Therefore, the competence of the participants in the exchange is
also related to their language knowledge. The CEFR (2001) states that a student at level A2

62

“can handle very short social exchanges but is rarely able to understand enough to keep
conversation going on his/her own accord”. The communication between the correspondents
was held at a beginner’s level in the studied foreign language. Both courses at the respective
universities shared a goal level of A1.2-A2, i.e. a basic user level. Managing to communicate
some more information or express further opinions than what it was asked in the tasks,
appeared to be difficult for them. They were limited in what they were able to add to the
conversation. Therefore, their basic skills in the Spanish language remained one of the
impediments for their fluent communication.
Even though they were previously informed about the possibility of using English to discuss
any other subject outside the tasks, they concentrated on the assignment, so the side
interaction became very poor and did not offer much relevant information for the study. This
restrained the observation and hindered their communication.
Multiculturalism
Arasaratnam (2016) considers participants in a dyadic intercultural collaboration coming not
only from two distinct cultural backgrounds but having multicultural identities. The students had
not been asked in advance about their culture. I assumed the Swedish-Finnish and Dutch
cultures being predominant. When observing the videos, I realised the existence of other
cultural settings. This was also the case for the students. The tasks concerned the prevalence
of Spanish, Dutch and Finnish cultures, stereotypes and habits. However, some participants
had backgrounds in more than only one cultural group, different to the ones considered in the
task. For example, two students at Utrecht University were exchange students coming from
other European countries and another student’s family came from an Asiatic country.
On the other side, most of the students in Utrecht were not knowledgeable about the SwedishFinnish culture of their peers in Vaasa. At the beginning, they struggled to understand that
Hanken offers most courses in Swedish and not in Finnish. This could have turned into a
limitation of the development of intercultural awareness since it needs to be supplemented with
cultural knowledge (Adams, 1995), but it did not prove to be a limitation of the study. Instead,
this awoke their interest. The students in Utrecht became more curious about the culture of the
Swedish-speaking population in Finland. The Finnish students in Vaasa had very limited
occasions to meeting exchange students, at least during the first year of their studies, and they
became very interested in the Dutch culture and other cultures.
As previously proved by O’Dowd (2006, 2011), the students are given the opportunity to learn
about their peers’ culture when they need to discuss their cultures. O’Dowd also states that
telecollaboration should be integrated in the language education and should not occur only as
an extra activity. In March 2021, a second telecollaboration took place between 80 students of

63

Spanish as a Foreign Language at Utrecht University and 80 students at Hanken, Vaasa and
Helsinki. The main purpose of our virtual exchange consists in incorporating this ecollaboration as the standard oral assessment in the course Español 1B at Hanken.
Despite all challenges that were encountered, it is necessary to recall that enhancing cultural
competence is a lifelong process (Deardorff, 2020). We all progressively develop and improve
our cultural competence through different experiences, one single experience is not sufficient.

5.4 Conclusion
Based on the literature review and the findings of this study, it can be concluded that the
students presented appropriate attitudes for the development of intercultural communicative
competence in their telecollaboration with peer students from other cultures. They displayed
respect, openness, curiosity and a desire to discover other cultures. They demonstrated their
abilities as good listeners and appropriate communicators when interacting in a multicultural
group and in a virtual workplace. They also showed appropriate behaviour in an intercultural
situation as well as engagement, humour and embracement of joy. The tasks supported them
to be aware of the other countries’ generalised habits, customs, and stereotypes, which
appeared to contribute to enhanced cultural competence. Even though the practice was brief,
it posed good learning opportunities and perhaps even contributed to the students’ life-long
process to develop into global citizens.
Previous research confirmed the potential that telecollaboration holds for the development of
intercultural communicative competence in higher education, even in small-scale practices. As
a part-time teacher, my effort feels like as a humble contribution foremost to the students’
learning, to the university’s curriculum and a small input to the internationalisation of the
Finnish higher education. Hopefully, this can inspire other scholars and teachers in tertiary
education to use similar practices and research on the field, and thus contribute to
telecollaboration. This could develop the exchange of intercultural communication, preserving
and promoting cultural diversity and consequently internationalism.
Further research or practical implementation
The potentials for research in this field are countless. Research centred on non-tandem based
practices, on innovative technologies and digital learning methods thus on other foreign
languages than English would widen the network of telecollaboration and promote
plurilingualism and diversity. More individual-centred variables such as effectiveness could be
studied and analysed in future projects endorsing intercultural communicative competence by
using not only observation but complementary methods of research such as questionnaires or

64

group interviews. To examine humour or joy in telecollaborative practices in higher education
is a less appraised scope but interesting to investigate. Positive psychology in SFL teaching
through virtual reality is also a subject of my interest. To develop a new model of ICC specific
for telecollaboration could be a project with a bigger dimension. In addition to all these
possibilities, I propose primarily to promote and support the participation of part-time teachers
in intercultural exchange programmes online, giving them and their students related
possibilities of cultural development and internationalisation.

Furthermore, I thank my Dutch partner for his encouragement and cultural backing, my
daughter, my best pupil and supporter, and my greatly missed mum, my best pedagogue
eternally.
