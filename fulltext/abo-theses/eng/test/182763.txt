Abstract

Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate, from a social-psychological and
constructivist perspective, how much the relatively sparse research into South
American collective identities could potentially benefit from literature, models, and
previous experiments on European transnational identity, by developing different
measures and then using these to gauge the psychological existence of and
identification with South America as a transnational imagined community in a
Brazilian sample.
Method: A questionnaire was completed by 96 female and 74 male Brazilian citizens,
and one who identified as “other”. The mean age was 40.7 years (SD 15.2) for females,
and 38.4 years (SD 16.1) for males. The age range was between and 16 and 93 years
of age.
Results: The results showed that identification with one’s own country was
significantly stronger than identification with Latin America, with the world as a
whole, and with South America. Of the respondents, 55 reported explicitly negative
feelings when thinking of South America, while 32 reported explicitly positive
feelings. Meanwhile, 65 held negative prospects for the future of South American
integration, while 45 of the respondents viewed this future in a positive manner.
Conclusions: It was found that most of the proposed measures adapted from previous
research were reliable and significantly correlated to one another. Some of the trends
observed in previous European identity research were not observable in a South
American context in the Brazilian sample of the current study. This study also
suggests the context-invoked model to be relevant for investigating multiple identities
within individuals, and for future research into South American transnational
identities.

1. Introduction
1.1 Aim of the Study

The main objective of this study was to assess if and to what extent models and theories drawn
from social-psychological and constructivist research on European collective identities can

measure the impact of a relatively long and numerically plural regional integration project on
the population of the region’s largest nation, Brazil, and the extent to which these elite-led
efforts have translated into the perceived creation of an imagined transnational community

(Anderson, 1983; Raposo, 2018). This assessment is carried out by means of a proposed sevenscale model for measuring scales correlated with the entitativity of transnational imagined

communities and the levels of identification with them. In other words, the aim of the study
was to find out how much the sparse field of South American transnational identity research

could potentially benefit from the rich literature on European collective identities. Although
there is arguably no equivalent to the European Union (EU) in South America (SA) in terms of
institutional depth and scope, a framework drawn largely from social constructivist (and

psychological) perspectives into European identity and integration is highly relevant due to the

fact that the very idea of "South America", as opposed to e.g. Latin America (LA), is still in
essence a political construct gradually promoted by the national political elites (Bethell, 2010).

Furthermore, even if the prevailing institutions in SA are mostly concerned with trade, and even
if they are intergovernmental rather than supranational at their core, these “are also social

projects —efforts that rely on and produce cultural, legal, and political material” (Duina, 2013,

p. 139). Therefore, one of the initial arguments here is that SA is not only a geographical
denomination, but also a label embedded with political meaning, which motivates the present

effort in so-called “comparative regionalism”1 (Börzel and Risse, 2019). One goal motivating
the elaboration of the aforementioned scales will then be to assess what other meanings
Brazilian citizens might attribute to it and how close their own loyalties stand as regards the
region.

“The emerging field of comparative regionalism takes it as an empirical question how far European integration
theories travel in explaining the emergence of regionalism, its outcomes, and its effects in other parts of the
world” (Börzel and Risse, 2019, p. 1233).

1.1.1 Background

This survey brings two important new additions to the discussion into South American
collective identities in areas where significant knowledge gaps have been identified through a

review of literature. First, research on collective identities 2 at a South American (or even Latin

American) level has been relatively scarce with few exceptions (cf., Cavalcanti, 2013; Meunier

& Medeiros, 2013; Raposo, 2018). Second, even where past research is present, a socialpsychological approach to the subject is arguably brand new in a South American context, even

though it is widespread in European Identity and Integration studies (cf., Brewer, 2004; Castano
2004). The research tools applied are largely based on mass surveys conducted over the years

both across the EU (Eurobarometer) and LA (LAPOP, Latinobarometer) and yet attempt to

incorporate different models drawn from the social psychology of collective identities, in

particular concepts such as the entitativity of social groups, which can be seen as an innovation,
especially in the context of South American identity research. This interdisciplinary

background serves to foreshadow the model elaborated and proposed in this study which draws

from disciplines as diverse as international relations, social science and social psychology. The
instrument employed in conducting this research was developed with the thought in mind of
drawing from traditional mass-survey models such as the Eurobarometer or the

Latinobarometer, while at the same time aiming to “further refine their methods of enquiry by
allowing more sophisticated combinations of layerings of identity” (Meinhoff, 2004, p. 245).

Some clarification on the definitions of important concepts employed throughout the text is

considered helpful to avoid confusion. Regional integration is here taken as “the pooling and

delegating of authority in regional institutions” (Börzel & Risse, 2019, p. 1232). Such a process
is also understood to require “elites with pro-regional identities to engage in community
building that resonates with citizens’ identities and generates public support for integration

going beyond intergovernmental cooperation” (Börzel & Risse, 2019, p. 1232). This process is
related to the phenomenon of regionalism, or “a primarily state-led process of building and
sustaining formal regional institutions and organizations among at least three states” (Börzel
and Risse 2016, p. 7, as cited in Börzel and Risse, 2019, p. 1246).

It is to be noted here that throughout the study, regional identity, supranational identity and transnational
identity will be used interchangeably.

1.2 Historical Context
1.2.1 The Construction of South America: Early Years

The historical labels attributed to the landmass extending from Mexico all the way to the

southernmost tip of Chile have been around for a significant amount of time now. The concept

of Latin America was first introduced by foreigners, taken as a name by the elites within the
region and appropriated by the United States when trying to exert continental influence. Other

labels have come and gone, such as “Hispanoamérica” (Hispanic America), which in itself is
othering by nature leaving out nations that were not Spanish-speaking or that had not been

colonized by Spain, such as Brazil, and “Iberoamérica” (Iberian America) that in itself includes

Brazil, but leaves out nations not colonized by the powers of the Iberian Peninsula, such as
Guyana or Surinam (Bethell, 2010). Some authors even go to lengths to claim that, starting
from Iberian colonization, past military dictatorships and all the way to the more recent

democratization waves “all Latin American countries share a common history”. However, the
same projects that drove each of those nations through all those processes are also the ones that
arguably set them apart and “[t]hus, national reaffirmation was promoted at the expense of
projects of unionism and reciprocal trust among neighbors” (Santos, 2013, p. 43).

Parallel to these broader, continent-wide groupings, smaller ones were also proposed,

restricted to less amalgamating features such as a smaller geographical congruity, such as
Caribbean and Andean nations. The concept most relevant to the current study is that of South

America (“América do Sul”, “Sudamérica”, “América del Sur”, “Sudamérica”...). This concept

is somewhat geographically clear and has rarely been politically contested (Galvão, 2009). The
main premise is that all 12 nations below the Equator (obviously excluding French Guyana
which is technically a part of France, a “department”) can be characterized as such by their
mere geographical location (Bethell, 2010). However, in line with what is proposed by Hurrell
(1995) that all regions are politically contested social constructions, other important features
have to be made salient when addressing the issue of SA.

The nations in the region share much in terms of their history dating back to the colonial era

when they were almost completely divided between the Iberian powers of Portugal and Spain.
Projects for regional integration can be traced at least as far back as the age of the great heroes

of South American liberation struggles, such as the Bolivarian idea of “Gran Colombia”, even
though most of these projects portrayed Portuguese Brazil as the “other” to be left out of the

union due to the peculiarities of Brazilian independence and monarchy (Bethell, 2010). Coming
8

Emilio L. Del Pupo

to more recent times, even during the mid to late 19th century, many military dictatorships rose
to power and fell in different nations in the region at similar times, and several of those (while

still in power) worked together and established region-wide military alliances (Cavalcanti,
2013).

1.2.2 South American Integration from the Mid-twentieth Century to Today: from Regional
Integration to Institutional Dismantling?

In the later years, one of the legacies of democratic SA has been the significant push,
particularly from Brazilian foreign affairs, of integrating the region, especially as a means of
opposing influence from other regional powers further north such as Mexico or the United

States (Galvão, 2009). Out of those political elite-led efforts a large sprawl of regional bodies

has sprung, some with clear strictly technical or economic goals, and others, such as the Union
of South American Nations (Unasur), with broader and more ambitious goals that make political

integration and the creation of a South American citizenship part of their leading agenda
(Unasur, 2008; Meunier & Medeiros, 2013). The focus of the prevailing institutions in South
America to which Brazil has signed has been on the integration of elites rather than of societies.

The inter-presidential nature of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur, established in 1991)
reflects a “top-down model of integration [rather] than the process of a true de facto regional

integration among the Mercosur societies” (Santos, 2013, p. 44). Brazil and five other South
American nations left Unasur in 2018, denouncing it for its inefficiency, and its state leaders

decided to form yet another regional institution named Forum for the Progress and
Development of South America (Prosur, which had its first summit in 2019).

Unlike Unasur, Mercosur does not mention the fomenting of a South American identity as

one of its goals, as most “official documents of RTAs [Regional Trade Agreements] do not
mention identity” (Duina, 2013, p. 140). That being said, there have been arguments (Santos,
2013) about the different ways in which different processes led by the bloc have helped foster

a “sense of identity among the citizens of the member states”, usually by catapulting policies
that help foster a larger sense of democracy by allowing further citizen participation at

transnational decision-making, and by promoting stronger ties between fellow citizens and

between citizens and elites across borders, such as the Somos Mercosur (we are Mercosur)
program and the establishment of a Mercosur Parliament.

1.3 Literature Review

1.3.1 Social Constructivist Approaches to Regional Integration: Ideas, Discourse, and
Identities

Having seen that the research on transnational identities is largely based on European identity
research, and that the contextual differences between Europe and South America make

themselves quite clear, there might be some confusion when discussing SA. It has been argued

that the EU has largely captured the ontology of Europe for itself, so European identity research
has at large been used interchangeably with identification with/support for the EU. SA,

however, currently has no regional bodies as large and as significant as the EU. The most

relevant organization in the region, Mercosur, constitutes merely a common trade agreement,
which by no means presents the level of institutionalization or, more importantly, societal
integration that the EU has demonstrated to have. In that case, there may be some confusion

throughout the work over in which cases to talk about SA as a political community, or instead
talk about SA as being a social and cultural community. This research intends to address such
a meaningful gap, and it will try to adapt these foreign models of enquiry as adequately as

possible to the relevant context at hand. Comparisons will then be made between the findings

and methodology applied in this study and previous research into European collective identities.
1.3.2 Psychological Existence of Transnational Imagined Communities

In many studies (cf. Castano, 2004; Risse, 2010) it has been argued that that, in order for

collective identities to take place in the minds of citizens or peoples, these identities must first
acquire the condition of having psychological existence. For these imagined communities to

effectively exist within the perception of, say, the peoples of a larger, supra-national

geographically- (and to some extent politically, economically, and culturally) bounded region,
they would have to be perceived as real, united entities to some extent capable of collective
action. Entitativity entails this degree of psychological existence of a group as a community, as

coined by American social psychologist Donald Campbell (1957). To quote Campbell, “the

degree of being entitative. The degree of having the nature of an entity, of having real existence”
(p. 17). Mention should also be made to the importance of John C. Turner’s theory of selfcategorization, which proposed that “[w]hen people define themselves in terms of a shared
social category membership, there is a perceptual accentuation of intragroup similarities and

intergroup differences on relevant correlated dimensions” (Turner, 2012 [1999], p. 21). From

this perspective, it is also relevant to point out that it was stated that “people generally tend to
10

Emilio L. Del Pupo

evaluate their ingroup from an intragroup perspective” while “[i]n contrast, they spontaneously
adopt an intergroup perspective when they judge an outgroup” (Castano, Yzerbyt, and
Bourguignon, 2003, p. 743).

Entitativity is argued (Castano, 2004) not to automatically take place in the presence of

factors, such as cultural homogeneity. In fact, “cultural homogeneity is not necessary to
establish a sense of belonging to a political community. What mediates the impact of cultural

homogeneity on the sense of common identity is the extent to which the community acquires a

psychological existence” (p. 54, emphasis in original). In other words, entitativity would
actually require, as it has in the case of the EU, efforts to bring the aforementioned

psychological existence into being, with symbols and icons having significantly demonstrated
importance in such efforts. Examples of such symbolism include the introduction of elements

commonly associated with the process of national identity-building: a flag; a common currency;
the Euro; and an anthem, Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy”. The potential impacts of this sort of
symbolism has been demonstrated in cognitive experiments by social psychologists studying

European collective identities. Castano (2004) argues that even under the presence of a degree

of homogeneity, this entitativity does not spontaneously fall into place, which brings an extra
degree of importance to the efforts of national elites to implement symbols, as described above.
The case of the Europeanization of national identities, shown by research to be effective to a

significant extent (Risse, 2010), leads to the questioning of previously established notions that

(especially cultural) homogeneity alone is conducive to the forming of collective identities. At

a regional (transnational) level, a first analysis of two distinct cases, the EU and SA, might
effectively show this not to be the case and to some extent dismiss the direct correlation between
the phenomena of homogeneity and entitativity.

The process of establishing entitavity at a regional level, i.e., bringing psychological

existence to a regional entity and into the minds of peoples, and thus developing a process of
social (or collective, to be used interchangeably here) identity is theoretically complex. It

benefits greatly from contributions across the fields of social-constructivist approaches to
European integration theory (Risse, 2009; 2010) and from social-psychological research into

social identities, especially at a broader, national, or even supranational, level of
conceptualization

(Castano,

2004;

Tajfel,

1982).

However

ontologically

and/or

methodologically distinct these approaches might seem to be, they hold substantial similarities

and share significant common ground, such as the notion that identities are not static.

Furthermore, across these approaches, identities are taken to be oftentimes multiple within a
single individual. Other important common features of these approaches include the
11

Emilio L. Del Pupo

psychological, emotional and political importance attributed to membership; and the
paramountcy of the concept of “psychological existence” in the establishing of “supranational

imagined communities” (cf. Anderson, 1983; Castano, 2004; Risse, 2010; Tajfel, 1982). These
similarities between approaches will be explored in order to establish a theoretical framework
that can effectively connect the two and, furthermore, be included into measurement scales.
1.3.3 The Hierarchies of Collective Identities

Several models have been proposed to explain the relationships between multiple identities

within individuals. The most relevant models in this case are the ones proposed by Risse (2004),
for instance that of nested identities, or identities “conceived of as concentric circles or Russian
Matruska dolls, one inside the next”. The second model proposed by the author is cross-cutting,
in which “some, but not all, members of one identity group are also members of another identity

group” (p. 277). Lastly, the third one is the so-called marble cake model, in which “the various
components of an individual’s identity cannot be neatly separated on different levels”. The last
one is the model that proposes the question: “what if identity components influence each other,
mesh and blend into each other?” (p. 279). The hypothesis here is that the low degree of South
Americanization of Brazilian national identities, coupled with a low attachment to
supranational loyalties as compared to local or national ones, would nevertheless lead to the

assumption that the model that the marble cake model is the most appropriate one when dealing
with collective South American identities in a Brazilian sample.

12

Emilio L. Del Pupo

There have been previous suggestions (Santos, 2013) that a marble cake model might be more
suitable for investigating multiple collective identities in a South American context. Referring

specifically to the existence of a collective identity among country members of Mercosur,
Santos argues “that there is much more Mercosurness embedded in national, regional, or other
collective identities than is usually assumed […] even though the degree of regional collective
identity achieved could be debated” (p. 52). It seems reasonable to assume that regional
influence on parochial identities, even if this influence is not strong enough to place an alleged

regional identity at a same level of importance to a Brazilian citizen as their national or more
local ones, is a given fact. However, in line with the aforementioned studies on multiple
collective identities, these identities are not necessarily exclusive, and there might even be

levels of “South Americanness” embedded in national or local identities. In data, this would
translate into a convergence, however slight, of respondents identifying themselves as both
South American and other more parochial labels (such as Brazilian or other local identities). In
this case, a non-exclusive dynamic of multiple identification is expected to take place.

1.3.4 “European Identity Revisited” and More Recent Research into Transnational Identity

It should be noted that extensive more recent literature has been developed in the study of

transnational identities, once again mostly in the context of the EU. However, a significant trend
in these studies deems them mostly unsuitable for the present context of this research, seeing

that the state of the art of the research on transnational European identities shows that
“constructivist approaches have diverted scholarly energies away from determining the
presence/absence or the possibility of European identity to studying the processes of its

construction and its evolving and multifarious relationship to national identities” (Rumelili &
Cebeci, 2016, p. 56). In other words, constructivist research into European identities already
sees the existence of said transnational identity as a given, and most research has now moved

on to analyze its dynamics in different contexts. Seeing that the very existence of a South
American identity is a point of inquiry in the present study, said identity is far from being a

given, and therefore, earlier studies into the development and existence of a European iden tity
are deemed more appropriate to be translated into a South American context.

1.3.5 Presenting the Theoretical Framework: Measuring Scales for Transnational Identity

The link between political integration and the building of common identities can be drawn from

relevant works in interdependency and constructivism in the field of international relations (cf.
Keohane & Nye, 1977; Wendt, 1999). It is also worth noting that there have been previous
13

Emilio L. Del Pupo

endeavors at establishing links between constructivist and social identity theory in international

relations (cf. Larson, 2011), but these have largely constrained themselves to the identities of

nation states as agents in the international system, while the current inquiry instead proposes
using a combined framework for assessing the state of social identification at an individual
level, or rather, the level of social identities of citizens.
1.3.5.1 Group Entitativity and Identification

As relates to social identities as studied by social psychologists, there is a need to narrow the
existing research down to the works that relate more specifically to the issues of collective

identity-building at a regional level or, relating to the aforementioned research, the

psychological existence of supranational communities without which, according to research by
social constructivists (Risse, 2010), citizens would not be able to truly perceive each other as

part of a single community. Further on, the empirical and theoretical research referred to in here
brings forward notions that add value to the present inquiry, such as the idea of entitativity
(Castano, 2004). Within the concept of entitativity, the four factors that authors (Campbell,

1958, as cited in Castano, Sacchi, & Gries, 2003) have argued to have direct impact on group

entitativity have also been included in the model introduced here. These factors include
common fate; similarity; salience; and boundedness.
1.3.5.2 Awareness

Also relevant to the model proposed here are notions of political awareness/participation

measured for example by: knowledge of supranational political affairs; reading news on
supranational affairs; discussing supranational affairs with relatives, and how it affects attitudes

towards political processes at that level. As proposed in studies on Euroscepticism and support

for the process of expanding the EU by Lauren Maclaren (2007), “knowledge about the EU is
also thought to reduce hostility to the EU project. Empirical analyses have indeed indicated that
those who were more cognitively mobilized — that is, those who are better educated and discuss
politics more frequently — and those who are more knowledgeable about the EU are indeed

more positive about European integration” (p. 235). There has been much written on the

importance of mass media in [supra] national identity-building. For instance, Siapera (2004)
writes that “the media can be seen as crucial both for the formation of a European identity,
analogous to national identity, and for the forging of a European political public, attuned to and

oriented toward discussion and the exchange of opinion on subjects of common concern” (p.
170). These factors motivated the inclusion of measures for such awareness in the model, and
14

Emilio L. Del Pupo

higher measures of awareness and civic participation are in turn expected to correlate to higher
degrees of transnational group entitativity.
1.3.5.3 Trust

A final layer constituting this model would be the dynamics of trust in the context of support

for a process of regional integration. When addressing specifically the issue of trust in national

institutions and how these translate to institutional trust/support at a supranational level,
Maclaren postulates that “it is expected that feelings of distrust for EU institutions are likely to
explain some of the Euroscepticism that exists in the modern day while trusting the EU

institutions may lead to more positive feelings about the integration project as a whole” (p.
236). Castano (2004) also implies that disappointment with the performance of national state
institutions might lead to stronger perceived entitativity of a supranational community, in

particular if the individual perceives the existence and performance of the supranational
institutions in a positive manner. This is called the “terrestrial” function of entitativity and
“refers to the fact that entitative in-groups are perceived as having a capacity for action, as

possessing intentionality and as providing security to their members. As the nation-state
provides a progressively less fitting framework for understanding and action in the modern

world” the entitativity measure of such a body would likely increase (p. 76). Support for and
positive attitudes towards a process of regional integration have also been directly correlated to

higher levels of attachment towards the referred to community as demonstrated by previous

inquiries (Citrin & Sides, 2004, p. 220: “increased attachment to or pride in Europe depends
only on identifying with Europe in some respect, regardless of how one prioritizes European

and national identities”). A correlation between lower levels of trust in national institutions and
higher entitativity of a transnational community (SA) is expected, as is a correlation between
identification with and a sense of belonging to South America.

Higher levels of interpersonal trust are here also assumed to be directly correlated to stronger

group identification within this dynamic of “national and international identification” as was
demonstrated by Brewer and Herrmann (2004), who stated that “if trust between the groups
exists, the increasing integration can lead to positive feedback and growth in a common

identity” (p. 26). Risse (2010) also makes a point that interpersonal trust across different
nationalities is one of the building blocks of transnational identities, when he states that

“another measurement for the degree of transnational social integration and for the sense of
community among strangers refers to cross-national trust levels among Europeans” (p. 43).
Based on the literature, this scale is then deemed relevant for the model proposed here.
15

Emilio L. Del Pupo

Different measures of civic engagement and awareness assessed by the questionnaires are

expected to exert varying influence on both the intensity of social identity and levels of
institutional trust (McLaren, 2007). Higher measures of entitativity are expected to translate

into higher measures of interpersonal trust, particularly if the persons are given to be part of the
in-group (Brewer, 2004). Group entitativity is given to directly influence group identification

(Sacchi, Castano & Brauer, 2009), which would justify the inclusion of the two as a single

measurement scale 3. Previous research (Raposo, 2018) points at the nonexistence of a South
American identity: “there are doubts as regards the existence of an alleged transnational identity
among South Americans that transcends the national identities predominant in the region […]
the hypothesis is that this transnational identity does not exist” (p. 74, own translation).

The present study presents an inquiry into this alleged transnational collective identity solely

from a sample of the population from one country, Brazil, and not comparing it between
different nations in the region. It is nevertheless expected that this transnational identity not

only does manifest itself in the minds of Brazilians, but also that Brazilians are expected to have

a significant degree of attachment to this identity. Respondents are finally expected to see
regional integration efforts as not being effective, i.e. the efforts of the political elites have not

made a positive impression of, or generated support for, integration in the region (Raposo,
2018). This can translate as a lack of awareness of transnational affairs or a lack of trust
in/knowledge of transnational bodies acting in the region.

“[T]he entitativity of the ingroup moderates the level of identification with the ingroup. Specifically […] high
levels of entitativity are conducive to strong identification, whereas low levels of entitativity reduce
identification with the ingroup” (Castano, Yzerbyt, and Bourguignon, 2003, p.735).

1.4 Research Questions
Research question 1: The interdisciplinary model for measuring entitativity proposed here
contains reliable scales and is able to demonstrate significant correlations between these scales

as they are deemed relevant to the study of transnational group entitativity and identification,
e.g. between higher levels of awareness of South American affairs and higher levels of
identification with South America.

Research question 2: The multiple elite-led institutionalization and integration efforts at a

regional level were able to foster a significant level of identification with or entitativity of South
America in the minds of Brazilians.

Research question 3: The multiple elite-led institutionalization and integration efforts at a

regional level were unable to significantly foster positive attitudes towards South American
regional institutions or the process of South American integration.

2. Method
2.1 Sample

A questionnaire was completed by 96 females, 74 males, and one respondent who identified as

“other”, with 171 respondents in total. Of the respondents, 165 were Brazilian nationals, 153
lived in Brazil, and 18 lived elsewhere. Of the respondents, two were Chilean nationals, two

were Brazilian Italian dual nationals, one dual national from Argentina and Brazil, and one was

of indigenous origin. The mean age was 40.7 years (SD 15.2) for females, and 38.4 years (SD

16.1) for males. The age difference was not significant. The age range was between 16 and 93
years. The sample was randomized.

Most respondents (n = 153) said they resided in Brazil, seven said they resided in Finland,

two in England, two in Uruguay, two in Paraguay, one in Australia, one in Mexico, one in

Morocco, and one in the United States. All of the respondents were either Brazilian nationals,
living in Brazil at the time of the survey, or both.

2.2 Instrument

A mixed-method questionnaire was constructed for measuring collective identities in SA. The
instrument was modeled after both mass surveys and in-depth interviews to assess the levels of

identities with the hope that these models will be complementary (Blanchard, Caudill, &
Walker, 2020; European Commission, 1990; Gaertner et al., 1993; Gerhards, Hans, 2014;
Hudson, 2006; LAPOP, 2019; Latinobarómetro, 2018; Latcheva, 2009; Lochner, Kawachi, &

Kennedy, 1999; Sinnott, 2005). All measures presented here have been translated to English
for the convenience of the reader, since the original questionnaires were distributed in Brazilian
Portuguese. The original version has been made available as an appendix.
2.2.1 Quantitative Measures

Sense of belonging to different geographical groups was measured with seven items in response

to the question “How much do you feel like you belong to the following geographical groups?”
The items were (a) The locality or town where you live, (b) The state or region of the country

where you live, (c) Your country as a whole, (d) South America, (e) Andes, (f) Latin America,
and (g) The world as a whole. The response alternatives were on a five-point scale (0 = not at

all, 1 = slightly, 2 = undecided, 3 = quite much, 4 = very much). Cronbach’s alpha for the scale
was .72.

18

Emilio L. Del Pupo

South American group entitativity and identification were measured with eight items in

response to a request to “Please respond to each item by choosing the alternative that comes

closest to your opinion”. The items were (a) South America has a real existence as a group, (b)
South Americans have similar values, (c) South Americans from different countries should

interact more with each other, (d) South Americans share a common history, (e) South
Americans share a common fate, (f) South Americans from different countries are more similar

than different from each other, (g) I feel strong ties to other South Americans, (h) I interact
frequently with South Americans from other countries. The response alternatives were on a
five-point scale (0 = disagree completely, 1 = disagree slightly, 2 = neutral, 3 = agree slightly,
4 = agree completely). Cronbach’s alpha for the scale was .82.

Civic Engagement and Awareness were measured with eight items in response to a request

to “Please respond to each item by choosing the alternative that comes closest to your opinion”.
The items were (a) I seek information on events in my community and/or country, (b) I seek
information on events across South America, (c) I read books, newspapers, magazines, or
websites in foreign languages, (d) I discuss community and/or national political matters when

I get together with friends or relatives, (e) I discuss South American political matters when I

get together with friends or relatives, (f) I attend a public meetings/rallies about politics or go
to demonstrations, (g) I feel like I receive enough information on multilateral organizations in

South America, (h) I feel the impact of multilateral organizations in my daily life. The response
alternatives were on a five-point scale (0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = frequently, 4
= always). Cronbach’s alpha for the scale was .82.

Trust in National Institutions was measured with five items in response to the question “How

much do you trust the following institutions in your country?” The items were (a) The Armed

Forces, (b) The police, (c) Congress, (d) Government, (e) Judiciary, (f) The political parties, (g)

The electoral authorities. The response alternatives were on a five-point scale (0 = not at all, 1
= slightly, 2 = undecided, 3 = quite much, 4 = very much). Cronbach’s alpha for the scale was
.73.

Trust in International Bodies was measured with six items in response to the question “How

much do you trust the following international organisms?” The items were (a) United Nations,

(b) Organization of American States, (c) UNASUR, (d) PROSUR, (e) Andean Community, (f)
MERCOSUR. The response alternatives were on a five-point scale (0 = not at all, 1 = slightly,
2 = undecided, 3 = quite much, 4 = very much). Cronbach’s alpha for the scale was .86.

Trust in People in General was measured with three items in response to the query “Do you

think that”, in order to check for deviations on levels of trust towards other people in general
19

Emilio L. Del Pupo

and people of different South American countries in particular. The items were (a) Most people

can be trusted, (b) Most people would try to take advantage of me if they got the chance 4, (c)
Most of the time people try to be helpful. The response alternatives were on a five-point scale
(0 = disagree completely, 1 = disagree slightly, 2 = neutral, 3 = agree slightly, 4 = agree
completely). Cronbach’s alpha for the scale was .75.

Trust in People from Different Countries in SA was measured with twelve items in response

to the question “How much do you trust people from different countries in South America?”
The items were Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru,

Surinam, Uruguay and Venezuela. The response alternatives were on a five-point scale (0 = not
at all, 1 = slightly, 2 = undecided, 3 = quite much, 4 = very much). Cronbach’s alpha for the
scale was .97.

2.2.2 Qualitative Questions

Feelings that come to mind when thinking about South America and attitudes regarding the
future of South America as an integrated community were measured with two open-ended
questions.

2.3 Procedure

The data collection was conducted with an online questionnaire. The link was distributed via
email and social media. The link was active from 28/06/2021 to 27/08/2021.

2.4 Ethical Considerations

The study is consistent with the principles concerning human research ethics of the Declaration

of Helsinki (World Medical Association, 2013), as well as it follows the guidelines for the
responsible conduct of research of The Finnish Advisory Board on Research Integrity (2012).

3. Results
3.1 Quantitative Results
3.1.1 Sense of Belonging to Different Social Groups

Sense of belonging to six different social groups was compared using IBM SPSS Statistics

Version 26. The results showed that identification with one’s own country was significantly

stronger than identification with Latin America [t(174) = 6.00, p < .001], with the world as a
whole [t(174) = 3.07, p < .001], and South America [t(174) = 2.69, p = .008]. Identification with

one’s own country did not differ significantly from identification with one’s locality/town or
region (see Fig. 2 for means and standard errors).

3.1.2 Differences Due to Sex

A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted with sex as independent

variable and the scales as dependent variables. The multivariate test was significant for sex [F(7,
165)

= 2.21, p = .036, ηp2 = .086]. However, the univariate analyses showed that there was a

significant sex difference on only one scale; trust in international bodies. The women scored
significantly higher than the men (2.19 vs. 1.88) [F(1, 171) = 4.58, p = .034, ηp2 = .026].

3.1.3 Correlations between the Scales in the Study

The seven scales were correlated with each other. The highest correlation was found between

South American entitativity and identification and civic engagement and awareness (Table 1).
Trust in national institutions correlated significantly with only two out of six other scales.

The most significant correlation (p =.48) was found between the scales measuring “South
American entitativity and identification” and the one measuring “civic engagement and
awareness”. This finding falls in line with previous research on European identity (McLaren,

2007; Siapera 2004) that directly correlated phenomena such as media awareness on EU issues
and the formation of European transnational identities. This result holds up even though a
distinction was not made in the scale between awareness of national affairs and awareness of

transnational affairs. These items were both included here within a single, broader category of

“awareness”. When running a correlation between an “awareness” scale, which is a mean of
items specifically pertaining to the awareness of South American affairs, and the scale intended

to measure SA entitativity and identification, the correlation did not differ significantly (p =.49).
Another significant correlation (p =.39) is also a reflection of previous arguments regarding

other possible measurements “for the degree of transnational social integration and for the sense
of community among strangers” (Risse, 2010, p. 43), namely that between “South American

entitativity and identification” and “trust in people from different countries in South America”.
22

Emilio L. Del Pupo

The expected correlation between lower levels of trust in national institutions and entitativity

of and identification with a transnational imagined community did occur, but was not significant
(p =-.003). This does not confirm the expected negative correlation between both scales based

on previous research (Castano, 2008; McLaren, 2007). In fact, the low levels of trust in national

institutions gathered from the responses (with a mean of 89.5% distrust among respondents)
are to some extent mirrored by low levels of trust in some of the regional bodies, namely

Unasur5 (12.9 %) and Prosur (7.6%). Only Mercosur boasts a relatively higher percentage of

trust among respondents (32%), but this is overshadowed by the percentage of respondents who
feel undecided about the body (35.1%). Indecisiveness was also relatively high towards the two
previously mentioned bodies (41.5% for both), which should indicate low levels of awareness
measures, such as respondents reportedly feeling they receive enough information on these
bodies. However, no significant correlations between awareness and international institutional
trust scales were found.

The absence of significant differences due to sex, except where women scored higher than

men on “trust in international bodies”, does not reflect the findings from European identity

research. Within this field, a “gender gap with regard to European identity” is a given, with
findings reporting that “[m]en are on average more likely to feel attachment to Europe than

women”. However, significant differences due to sex in the scale measuring South American
entitativity and identification were not found.

The analysis of the findings also fared positively for the assumption that Risse’s (2004)

marble cake model of multiple collective identities would be appropriate for the study of South
American identities. As mentioned before, this falls in line with what had been proposed by

Santos (2013). The results showed that among those who said they belonged very much to the

country where they lived, 59.1% also experienced that they belonged very much to South

America. This supports the idea that Brazilian national identities are by and large non-exclusive,
i.e. that these identities allow for a degree of South Americanness.

3.2 Qualitative Results
3.2.1 Feelings that first comes to mind when thinking of South America

Two qualitative items were included in the survey in order to proceed with an analysis of short

written answers provided by the respondents. The first qualitative query was “When you think
of South America, what feeling comes first to your mind?” While going through the responses
(n = 168) and conducting thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) using NVivo Release 1.5,
it was observed that 55 respondents reported explicitly negative feelings when thinking of South
America (“Decepcionado”, “Tristeza). Meanwhile, 32 reported explicitly positive feelings

(“Amor”, “Calorosidade”) towards SA, and 20 respondents made direct references to features

of collective identity (“Autoidentidade, todos nós compartilhamos de mesma história”). In
addition, 13 felt “distancing” and a lack of union (“Distanciamento”), five expressed a need for

improvement (“Poderia ser melhor”) in the region. Finally, four respondents expressed desires

for further union (“Seria ótima a união desses países.”), and four respondents felt neutral or

indifferent towards the region (“Indiferença”). Thinking of SA evoked negative feelings as
diverse as pity, concern and sadness. Most of these feelings were related to a perceived level of

underdevelopment or to civil/political disorder across the region, which actually led to some

overlap with two other prevailing perceptions amongst respondents, that SA is
24

Emilio L. Del Pupo

underdeveloped/ridden with poverty (n = 20), and that SA is embroiled in socio-political chaos
(n = 14).

On the other hand, a remarkable number of respondents (n = 20) made direct links to features

of belonging and shared identity, such as feelings that SA is their home or that the region has

its own, collective identity. Positive feelings were also present (n = 16), although they were
outweighed by the aforementioned negative ones. Also relevant to the idea of SA as an

imagined community, several respondents (n = 9) perceived SA to be a sort of unit or to

represent unity as a feeling. On the other hand, more references were made (n = 20) to the
differences between nations and peoples across the region. Another feature of the responses to
the first qualitative question was that relatively few respondents (n = 4) had no feelings towards
the region or saw it with indifference. This could bode well for the argument that SA is not an

altogether empty qualifier, even though it holds starkly different meanings to different people.
References were also made to pride (n = 7), either towards the region as a whole or towards

one’s own country in particular. Finally, references were made to a perceived
historical/existential struggle (n = 6). This struggle is interpreted here to stand for a struggle
against socioeconomic inequalities, and also a struggle for political liberties or representation.
3.2.2 Attitudes regarding the Future of South American Integration

The second qualitative question was “What’s your opinion on the future of South America as

an integrated community?” Analysis and coding of the responses (n = 168), using NVivo
Release 1.5, showed that 65 of the respondents hold negative prospects for future endeavors
concerning South American integration (“não acredito que a América do Sul poderá ser uma
comunidade integrada”), 45 of the respondents viewed the future of this process in a positive
manner (“Uma forte chance de se tornar uma comunidade mais fortalecida e independente”),
15 expressed not having an opinion or enough knowledge on the subject (“Nunca pensei nisso,
não tenho opinião formada”), and six, while not necessarily holding negative or positive views
towards this project, claimed that such an effort would be gradual and transpire over a long
period of time (“Esse futuro, se possível algum dia, está muito distante”).

Among the prospects taken as negative, most references (n = 17) pointed at the unlikeness

(“Improvável”) of the process, with differences and lack of cohesion among countries (“Difícil,

muitas diferenças econômicas e políticas”) as the most recurring explanations (n = 6). Among

positive perspectives on the future of South American integration, the most references (n = 9)
were related to development (“Tem chances de desenvolverem juntos”), with a particular focus

on socioeconomic development and lessening of socioeconomic inequalities (“Teríamos menos
25

Emilio L. Del Pupo

diferenças sociais”). The findings gathered from the thematic analysis of the qualitative
responses led to the observation of some prevailing trends amongst respondents. For example,
the feelings attached to SA seem prevailingly negative (n = 35).

As regards the second qualitative question, respondents held mostly (n = 57) negative

opinions on the future of South American integration. Still, on this more skeptical side of the

responses, a number of respondents (n = 14) reported that if such a process was ever to take

place, significant political, economic, and social changes needed to occur; others (n = 6) saw
integration as a process that would take place, only gradually over a long period of time; and

others still (n = 4) stated that even if such a process was ever to take place, it would bring about
little to no significant change to countries in the region, especially as regards socioeconomic
development. Recurring themes on the negative side of prospects for South American
integration revolved around corruption and/or mismanagement; political polarization; and
economic barriers to social integration.

On the other hand, a significant number of respondents (n = 24) held explicitly positive views

regarding the future of the South American integration process, particularly its future as an

integrated community. On a similar note, respondents (n = 21) also held the opinion that, if
[further] integration was to take place, it would bring about positive changes to countries in the

region and to the region as a whole. Some of the respondents even made direct mentions of SA
becoming a global “superpower”.

Direct references made to the clearness of the geographical boundaries of South America

(“União sem olhar para cima da linah do equador”) suggest that the case is different from what
previous research on the entitativity of the European Union as a transnational community points
out, namely that “the lack of clear geographical boundaries also weakens any effort by the EU
to be perceived as a real entity” (Castano, 2004, p. 55).The reality of fuzzy boundaries in South
America might be more institutional than geographical or cultural in nature, due to the plurality
of regional bodies and agreements, and diffuse memberships in said arrangements.

A notable number of respondents (n = 16) had no formed opinion on the matter. Among

these, some respondents also stated that they did not know enough about the process to be able
to form an opinion.

4. Discussion
4.1 Summary of Findings

Throughout the progress of this study, it has been repeatedly made clear that comparative

theory-building has plenty to offer to the study of transnational identities. Of course, where
peculiarities and particularities are due, some of the research on European identity, particularly

as regards the entitativity of the European Union as an imagined community, might not provide
researchers with the most suitable measurement tools to assess similar phenomena in a South

American context. The EU is in a different stage of institutional depth, while at this point, South

American leaders cannot yet seem to decide if they even want to follow the same path of
integrational policies that go beyond trade agreements. Nevertheless, as proposed by previous

research (Duina, 2009), even trade agreements such as the Mercosur, with no explicit intention
of fomenting transnational collective identities, end up inciting such feelings, at the very least

in the hearts and minds of the elites directly involved in the process. This process arguably takes
place through the logic of the relationship between agency and structure.

As this study has shown, to some extent, feelings of South Americanness have managed to

“hit home” in different forms and with varying intensity, at least as far as this Brazilian sample

was concerned. The discourse and policy of state national elites from various countries in the
region have manifested themselves to the region’s citizens in one way or the other, be it on their
passports or on the license plates on their motor vehicles, or when the media displays summits

of regional leaders. All of these manifestations are argued to make South America more real as

a community in the minds of its peoples. This reflects of what was argued by Duina (2009, p.

152), “those meetings generate significant media attention — they are discussed in front-page
articles in national newspapers and top-of-the-hour radio and television newscasts”. To a
correlated extent, these phenomena also make South American citizens feel closer to other
strangers across borders within this imagined community, in the Habermasian sense.

4.2 Implications of the Study

The study of identities has clear implications for policy making at a regional (if not only
national) level especially where contentions of democracy and participation of transnational
citizenship are implied (cf. Risse 2004a, 2004b, 2010).

As regards the particular subject of peace, mediation, and conflict research, the peaceful

potential of transnational imagined communities has been vastly explored by very distinct areas
28

Emilio L. Del Pupo

of science. In anthropology for instance Douglas P. Fry has recently nodded in an article
published on Nature (2021) to “the development of an overarching socio-political identity” as

being “a notable feature of peace systems” (p. 6). It is also hypothesized by Fry in this and in

previous works (cf. Fry, 2012) that “an overarching common identity in addition to local
identity” is one of the factors that promotes “peace within dynamic peace systems” (p. 3). In

sum, as the title suggests to Fry collective identities stretching across societies leads these
societies to “avoid war and build positive intergroup relationships”.

Further implications for not only peace but also conflict and their relation to transnational

identities has been explored from a sociological point of view as well. Francesco Duina dwells
into this dual significance in depth in a book chapter entitled “Identity Construction in the EU,
NAFTA and Mercosur: Opportunities for Peace and Conflict” (2009). By referring to “peace”
in the sense of “stability within and across countries”, Duina goes over examples of regional

organizations standing in the way of threats to democracy and interstate violence, going as far
as saying that “the strongest evidence comes from Mercosur” in the maintenance of democratic
stability, using several incidents involving coup attempts in Paraguay as historical examples.

4.3 Limitations of the Study

A distinction that is absent and that could have been relevant particularly to the issue of the

content of this identity is the one put forward by Bruter (2004), namely the distinction between
what he calls civic and cultural political identities. However, civic identification at a

transnational level seems weak amongst Brazilians in comparison to EU citizens. The only truly
active transnational institution in SA to which Brazil still belongs and which pertains the

slightest numeral degree of trust within the sample is Mercosur. This trust might in addition be

explained by the historical relevance of state-elite discourse and also some symbolism
pervasive in the daily lives of Brazilians, such as mandatory Mercosur car plates or the presence
of the organization’s name on Brazilian passports (Fig. 4). The many references made by

respondents to historical and cultural heritage when thinking of SA would indicate
identification with SA mostly on cultural terms, a cultural collective identity.

29

Emilio L. Del Pupo

Fig. 4. Mercosur-issued Brazilian car plate and passport. Research has linked the presence
of institutional symbols in daily life to cognitive aspects of identity-building (Laffan,
2004)

Meinhof (2004) has presented issues with assessing identification measures using “closed-

ended survey” which might mislead respondents and not have the same potential of more open

conversation, such as in-depth interviews. In her study, the author “found an almost total
absence of either positive or negative European identity markers in the spontaneous narratives”
of the subjects interviewed. The finding that European identity was not evoked by subjects

“unless specifically thematised in the interviews” (p. 240) points to a possible limitation of this

study, namely the question of whether respondents would even bring up South America as an
identifier at all if it was not mentioned to them beforehand.

The sample is not sufficiently wide for generalizing attitudes across the whole nation. Brazil

is very obviously a relatively large country with a large and diverse population spread far and

wide across a vast landmass. Nevertheless, drawing from the words of social psychologist
Emanuele Castano (2004), a certain degree of generalization is expected and acceptable in

social psychology “when investigating basic psychological processes”, and furthermore “it
seems reasonable to assume similarity between” (p. 46) this sample and the rest of the Brazilian
population.

4.4 Suggestions for Future Research

Future research should try and gather a more diverse sample, for instance from different nations

in SA. Another aim for future research could be to carry out in-depth interviews more in line

with what some authors in the field have suggested. Not evoking the idea of SA as an option
30

Emilio L. Del Pupo

for identification should also be considered due to previously perceived implications that this

identification might not even come up at all if not evoked by the interviewer (such an in

interviews conducted in a study by Meinhof, (2004) wherein the author “addresses some of the
implications and problems that the “absence of Europe” as self-identification in our data has

for research on European identity” [p. 278]). This could in theory mean that many subjects
would not even bring up South America in the first place, when asked to identify themselves.

Experimental psychological research into cognitive features of symbols should also be

incentivized. It would be relevant for transnational identity research in South America to have

data on the cognitive impact of recurring symbols in the daily lives of some South American
citizens, such as Mercosur car license plates and passports. This falls in line with previous
enquiries into what researchers have labeled “the cognitive dimension of identity building”

(Laffan, 2004, p. 94), and a literature search was not able to pinpoint that any research of the
sort has been conducted in South America as of now.

9. Qual sua opinão para o futuro da América do Sul como uma comunidade integrada?
Hoje, não acho viável. Primeiramente, os países deveriam amenizar (já que resolver está complicado) os
graves problemas internos, que são de diversas naturezas sociais, políticas, econômicas, etc.
Nada
Crescimento
Sem opiniao
Incerto .
Não vejo o necessário para um crescimento integrado
Confiança
Acho difícil. Mentalidades muito diferentes. Além disso, continente muito rico e cada um quer o melhor para
si.
Não tenho uma opinião formada sobre esse assunto.
Cooperação e aprofundamento das integrações
Em minha opinião é necessário muito conhecimento e evolução para que possa ser considerada uma
comunidade integrada fazendo conexão com outras comunidades
Tem chances de desenvolverem juntos
Acredito que se queremos conquistar mais, precisamos de maior união e ela vai acontecer.
Junto com a barreira da linguagem, o Brasil se comporta como não parte da América do Sul e acho muito
difícil que seja possível essa integração. Seria mais fácil entre os outros países da América do Sul
Unida com o proposito de crescer econômicamente
Não muito prospero
Confesso que não sei qual seria a melhor saída.
Caso a polarização política se fortaleça, a realidade ideal de uma comunidade integrada se afasta cada vez
mais.
Foi desmantelado esse sentimento
Explorada ao limite
Nunca parei pra pensar nisso, então no momento, não tenho uma opinião formada.
Nunca pensei nisso, não tenho opinião formada
Incerteza
Com união governamental poderiam se tornar super potências mundiais
Crescimento
Esperança de melhores condições de vida e respeito
Que nunca teremos de fato uma utopia, a paz absoluta é inalcançável.
Seríamos uma potência mundial.
não acredito que a América do Sul poderá ser uma comunidade integrada
É um sonho que dificilmente trará o esperado futuro próspero, por conta de problemas sociais (principalmente
criminalidade e desigualdade), problemas econômicos e principalmente corrupção.
Pode dar certo, mas necessita maiores esforços
Não vejo muita integração, talvez uma “manutenção” das organizações já existentes.
Em hipótese alguma deve ocorrer
Sem opinião formada
Coletivismo é lixo
Acho que há pouca integração, ainda mais no atual governo. Deve haver mais diálogo e busca de pontos em
comum entre as nações
Falta mais união entre povos, menos política e mais miscegenação
Não tem futuro
Capitalismo dificulta integração.
Não tenho opinião formada sobre.
Incerteza
Minhas projeções não são positivas dado a situação político economica do Brasil, da Argentina, na Venezuela,
etc
Os países Sul Americanos não tem muitas comunidades integradas nem internamente, quem dirá em nível
continental.
Muitas vitórias
Não sei
Deveriam ser mais unidos
Improvável
Não vai acontecee

44

Emilio L. Del Pupo
Uma colcha de retalhos. A integração poderia ser interssante em vários aspectos, mas isso vai de encontro a
interesses externos. Desunidos somos mais interessantes.
Não vai melhorar enquanto as pessoas não fizerem melhor
Capitalismo e existência de mercado forte fortificando o laço entre os países
Deveria ser integrada desde o início, porém, acho algo difícil de acontecer em um futuro próximo.
Acho difícil
Precisa melhorar muito
Nenhuma
Sem opiniao
Quando se tem uma política de responsabilidade tudo flui bem.
Sem futuro
Promissor
Ainda é muito nova essa ideia
Muito boa, crescimento para todos
Stop-and-go.
Sou bastante a favor, mas acredito que não há vontade política nas lideranças atuais - é preciso muita
mudança nesse sentido
Juntos somos mais fortes
Utópica
Um futuro imprevisível
Torcendo para que governos nacionalistas caiam pra que aconteça
Prosperidade
Não sei se funcionaria
Nenhum
Acho isso ainda bem difícil, pois há grandes divergências políticas entre os países, em especial o Brasil em
relação aos paises vizinhos atualmente.
Não vejo grandes mudanças. Mas acredito que uma colaboração maior seria beneficial a todos.
Não sei
Penso que será muito bom para a região se essa integração se der de fato.
Desuniao
Acho que há falta de interesse dos governos.
Um sonho a ser realizado.
Distante, falta muito para isso.
Não dará certo devido a interesses políticos de cada país.
Riqueza cultural
Quase impossível
Pouco chances
Podemos ser uma comunidade integrada, desde que não seja um regime político socialista ou comunista como
na Venezuela.
Dificlmente acontecerá
Promissora
Ainda conseguiremos nos relacionar como amigos.
Fraca
Difícil pois existem muitas diferenças econômicas e políticas..
Seria o ideal
Pocuo promissor. Não estamos buscando integração, infelizmente.
Gostaria
Uma forte chance de se tornar uma comunidade mais fortalecida e independente
Ter mais empregos, ter alimentação mais barata. Ter os Povos mais Unidos principalmente o mais Pobres
Integrada nos teríamos muitas chances de enfrentar o poderio norte-americano e europeu.
Nao vejo uma integração
Força e pujança
Necessária para sobreviver
União.
Não vejo essa possibilidade num futuro próximo, tendo em vista as divergências de cunho ideológico e
político, diferenças socio-econômicas e culturais, além da pressão dos interesses econômicos.
Caso haja de fato essa integração na América do Sul o futuro é muito promissor e com muitas possibilidades
no campo da tecnologia, conhecimento e inovação.

45

Emilio L. Del Pupo
É possivel, mas depende de todos nós.
Temos um longo caminho a percorrer ainda, por conta de desigualdades sociais e econômicas
Será a alternativa mais viável para tornar os paises sul americanos mais fortes.
Com os governos de direita e populistas que tenho visto o futuro comum é muito difícil.
Pouco provável
Não há possibilidade de uma comunidade integrada
Fortalecimento dos países
Não creio
Não acredito numa America Latina integrada
Impossivel
Parcialmente nos próximos 40 anos.
Fico i decisa sobre o futuro da América do Sul. Alguns países são socialistas caysando muota pobreza e
sifrumento ao povo.
Maior independência e com isso melhora de economia em geral
Nas relações comerciais talvez possa existir algum elo, mas poucas relações sociais.
Melhoria econômica
Acredito que há grandes oportunidades, se tivermos governos decentes com senso de comunidade que não é o
caso do Brasil hoje
Muito dificil
Não acredito numa America Latina integrada
Pouco provável devido a falta de coesão das massas, consecuentemente fora das pautas políticas de medio e
baixo escalão
Sou favorável a uma união, formação de um bloco latino Americano.
Nula
Não acho que consigam
Não vejo união
Uma boa alternativa para fortalecer os países
Meu desejo é que se integre mas, desconfio disso
Utópica
Precisa melhorar a questão pulitica partidária investir na efucação.e divisão de renda.
Seria uma grande potencia se aproveitasse todo seu capacidade
Será uma necessidade!
Esse futuro, se possível algum dia, está muito distante
Não vai acontecer pq não é de interesse global
Espero que não só a América Latina, mas o mundo se integre mais
Enquanto a maioria dos governos forem de direita e extrema-direita, as perspectivas de um continente
integrado e com soberania politica e social, as perspectivas são nulas.
Precisa se fortalecer
Inexistnte
Não sei responder essa
Nao tenho uma opinião formada
Incerto
Difícil de acontecer
Acho que não iria dar certo,por questões políticas e socio-economica
Union
Acho q conseguiremos nos unir, após muitas lutas
Um sonho dostante
Tenho medo de virarmos Cuba ou Venezuela
Muito fificil fe integrar
Poucas chances atuais de ocorrer
Muito importante essa integração
Incerto
Certa vez eu li na internet que na América do Sul "somos um povo sem pernas, porém que segue
caminhando". É isso que eu sinto. Apesar de todo o nosso passado de exploração, estamos seguindo em frente
e buscando alternativas para nos tornamos uma comunidade. Embora criar esse sentimento de pertencimento
seja extremamente difícil.
É a única saída frente ao neoliberalismo

46

Emilio L. Del Pupo
Somente a união poderá nos tornar mais fortes e desenvolvidos, sendo uma estratégia indispensável para
superar a dependência
Fim da xenofobia
acredito que as tendencias de integração são essenciais para o desenvolvimento das nações sul america nas,
principalemnte por haver uma história parecida com problemáticas políticas semelhantes em ambito local e
gloca: recursos naturais, ondas neoliberais, indicies de pobreza e distribuição de renda, consequencias de
