Abstract:
It is predicted that over the next 30 years, the world population will increase by 25 per
cent, and the global food demand will more than double. Food production is intertwined
with, and dependent on, biodiversity and the ecosystem services that it provides. Yet,
Earth’s biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate. Ironically, non-sustainable
agriculture is the largest single factor driving the alarming decline. Achieving and
sustaining food security thus appears to be at odds with conserving biodiversity.
Aligning biodiversity conservation efforts with food security goals is therefore
essential. This is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity and meeting it will
likely require multipronged strategies across several spheres. This thesis focuses on the
potential role of international law in overcoming the apparent incompatibility of
biodiversity conservation with food security.
The realisation of many human rights is dependent on biodiversity and ecosystem
services. This is especially true in the context of children’s and future generations’
rights. The link between the right to food and animal-mediated pollination is
particularly evident; 75 per cent of the world’s most important food crops are reliant
on pollinators. Pollination, a keystone ecosystem service, is also of indispensable value
to global biodiversity; it is a necessary step for the reproduction of 90 per cent of our
planet’s plants. Legal means of safeguarding animal-mediated pollination can therefore
be considered a key aspect of both achieving food security and conserving biodiversity.
As the decline in pollinators is a global concern, legal measures at the global level are
appropriate.
Both international environmental law and international human rights law, when
examined separately, appear to lack teeth. However, considering them as interrelated
and complementary to one another can serve to amplify the positive impact of both
areas of law. In this thesis, pollinator conservation under international environmental
law and the right to food under international human rights law are first examined
separately. After these comprehensive analyses, the two branches of international law
are brought together, and the key aspects of the complex relationship between
pollinator conservation and the right to food are analysed. The analysis indicates that
minimising trade-offs and maximising synergies between the two areas of international
law can facilitate a win-win situation by enhancing both biodiversity conservation and
food security. It is illustrated that through harnessing these synergies, international law
can potentially be a powerful tool for safeguarding pollinators and the vital pollination

i

services that they provide. This approach can contribute to the reconciliation of
biodiversity conservation with food security.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
1.1.1. The Issue of Rising Food Demand Coupled with Declining Biodiversity
At the time of writing, there are close to 8 billion people on Earth.1 By 2050, the world
population is predicted to have increased by some 25 per cent, meaning nearly ten billion
people will be living on this planet.2 In that same 30-year period, the global demand for
food is predicted to more than double.3 In other words, the indication is that not only will
there be more people, but the average amount of food consumed by individuals will
increase. The predicted rise in consumption is based on foreseen income rises in
developing countries and is likely to drive the growth in global food demand more
significantly than the expected population growth.4 Furthermore, rising incomes are
predicted to particularly increase the demand for animal-based foods, the production of
which requires more resources than plant-based alternatives.5
While food demand is rising, Earth’s biological diversity, or biodiversity, is declining at
an unprecedented rate.6 Biodiversity is defined in Article 2 of the Convention on
Biological Diversity (CBD) as follows:
the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial,
marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part:
this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems. 7

Scientific evidence of the imperative role of biodiversity for both our planet and humanity
is rapidly mounting. As biodiversity declines, many risks to humanity either emerge or
grow.8 The current rate at which the variability among living organisms is decreasing is

highly likely to have a multitude of consequences at the local, national, regional and
global levels. Indeed, conserving biodiversity is considered fundamental for achieving
most of the United Nations’ (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).9
In this context, one of the most acute and tangible risks to humanity stems from the
dependency of the world’s food systems on biodiversity.10 The production of both plantand animal-based food is intertwined with, and dependent on, the multitude and diversity
of species that populate the ecosystems in which the food is produced.11 More
specifically, food production is dependent on ecosystem services, i.e., “the conditions and
processes through which natural ecosystems, and the species that make them up, sustain,
and fulfil human life”.12 At the same time, agricultural expansion is already directly and
significantly threatening biodiversity.13 Indeed, as noted by David R. Boyd, the current
UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment, “[a]griculture is the largest
single factor in the destruction of ecosystems and the decline in biological diversity”.14
The predicted increases in global food demand will likely exacerbate the issue. This
complex relationship whereby more food production leads to increased loss of
biodiversity, coupled with a growing demand for food, will lead to more and more
unstable ecosystem conditions. Such a relationship between food production and
biodiversity paints a grim picture that can be likened to a biological positive feedback
loop spiralling towards chaos.15 Accordingly, the decline in biodiversity will likely lead
to less food or less diverse food being produced, even as proportionally more land area is

devoted to food production. Therefore, our planet’s capacity to meet the increasing food
demand will likely diminish.16 This poses a significant risk to food security.17

1.1.2. Pollinators are Key to Combatting a Socio-Ecological Crisis in the Making
Whilst there are many links between food security and biodiversity,18 this thesis focuses
on a keystone ecosystem service of indispensable value to both food security and
biodiversity, namely pollination.19 Simply put, “[p]ollination is the transfer of pollen
between the male and female parts of flowers to enable fertilization and reproduction”.20
Pollination is a necessary step for the reproduction of 90 per cent of our planet’s plants,21
and is described as “one of the most important mechanisms in the maintenance and
promotion of biodiversity and, in general, life on Earth”.22 Pollination is facilitated by
wind, water and, in the majority of cases, animals.23 Animals that facilitate pollination
are called pollinators, and range from invertebrates such as bees, flies, moths, butterflies
and beetles, to vertebrates including bats, birds and primates.24 Bees are seen as the most
important group of pollinators,25 but pollinator diversity is crucial for the maintenance of
biodiversity,26 as well as for the resilience of global crop pollination services.27 Whilst
some bees are managed, the bulk of pollinator species are wild.28

Seventy-five per cent of the world’s most important food crops are to some extent reliant
on pollinators.29 Pollinators not only increase the quantity of food, but also improve the
quality; for example, crops mediated by pollinators provide micronutrients which are vital
to human health.30 Although difficult to measure, the estimated global annual value of
animal-mediated crop pollination is several hundreds of billions of United States (US)
dollars.31
Due to a multitude of anthropogenic stressors,32 our planet’s vital pollinators are declining
at an alarming rate. In North-West Europe and North America, wild pollinators have
declined in occurrence, diversity and abundance. Whilst lack of data makes it difficult to
measure declines in other regions of the world, the available data indicate that this is a
global phenomenon.33
Over the past 50 years, global agriculture has become some 300 per cent more reliant on
pollinator-dependent crops.34 If pollinator decline continues, and no alternative means of
pollination is found,35 farmers will be forced to reverse this trend and shift to staple crops
that are not pollinator-dependent.36 Staple crops such as, inter alia, potatoes, rice, and
corn, tend to be energy-dense but nutrient-poor.37 The over-consumption of these crops
is already partly responsible for both the worldwide rise in obesity and various diseases
linked to diet.38 This global health crisis is likely to be aggravated in the event of a shift
to more staple crops.39
In the worst-case scenario, whereby pollinators were to become extinct, the impacts on
both food security and biodiversity would likely be devastating. The decline in pollinators
thus poses a global socio-ecological crisis. Legal means of safeguarding animal-mediated

pollination is therefore a key aspect of both achieving food security and of conserving
biodiversity.

1.1.3. The Potential Role of International Law in Facilitating a Solution
Acknowledging that achieving food security for all of humanity in an equitable and
sustainable manner is among the greatest challenges we face,40 and considering the above,
the expansion of non-sustainable agricultural systems to meet the growing need for food
would appear to be at odds with conserving biodiversity. A key part of facilitating a
sustainable future is therefore to find ways and means of overcoming the seeming
incompatibility of the two goals of food security and biodiversity conservation.
As will be shown, food security is a key element of the right to food; a universal human
right that is protected under international human rights law (IHRL). Biodiversity
conservation, in turn, falls under the realm of international environmental law (IEL).
Thereby, under international law, States are obligated to both ensure food security and
conserve biodiversity. In this thesis it is argued that international law, when aptly utilised,
has a vital role to play in overcoming the apparent incompatibility between achieving
food security and conserving biodiversity. Specifically, tackling the issue through
building on synergies and addressing tensions between IHRL and IEL is advocated. Such
a strategy is considered to have the potential to amplify the positive impact of both areas
of international law and thereby concurrently contribute both to the protection of
biodiversity and to the achievement of food security. The aim is to illustrate that, from an
international law perspective, the two goals need not be incompatible.

1.2. Research Questions, Delimitations and Structure
Overcoming the incompatibility between achieving food security and conserving
biodiversity is likely to require multipronged action across, inter alia, the legal, political
and scientific spheres. The analysis in this thesis is, however, limited to the potential role
40

of international law in meeting this challenge. More specifically, it examines how
harnessing synergies between instruments from the fields of IEL and IHRL can facilitate
desirable developments at the global level. To narrow it down further still, the analysis
covers the relationship between pollinator conservation under IEL and the right to food
under IHRL. The aim is to analyse how synergies between these two sections of
international law can be utilised to simultaneously enhance pollinator conservation,
thereby also fostering overall biodiversity, and to advance the right to food, thereby
promoting food security. To this end, the research questions which this thesis aims to
answer are the following:
1) What is the potential of pollinator conservation under IEL to support the
realisation of the right to food under IHRL?
2) To what extent can the right to food under IHRL be applied as a legal tool to
support pollinator conservation?
In relation to the first research question, it should be noted that there is considerable
ambiguity surrounding the analytical approach according to which environmental
degradation affects the realisation of human rights.41 As noted by Dupuy and Viñuales,
the approach “could imply that, from a human rights perspective, environmental
protection has only instrumental value in that it is but a contribution to the respect of such
rights”.42 Notwithstanding the importance of this debate, in the context of human rights,
whether or not nature has an intrinsic worth remains an unanswered question.43 Since the
focus of this thesis is on the synergies between human rights and environmental
protection, it is a debate considered to be beyond the scope of the present analysis and
will not be further examined.
This thesis consists of five chapters. Comprehensive analyses of both pollinator
conservation under IEL and the right to food under IHRL are prerequisites to addressing
the research questions. Therefore, following this introduction, said areas are scrutinised
in chapters two and three, respectively. These two chapters thus form the necessary

background against which the main analysis can take place. In chapter four, the
relationship between the two areas of international law is examined and both research
questions are addressed. Furthermore, in the context of harnessing synergies between
pollinator conservation under IEL and the right to food under IHRL, the added value of
a) the UN recognising the human right to a healthy environment, b) applying a human
rights-based approach to pollinator conservation, and c) considering the relationship
between pollinator conservation and the right to food within the sustainable development
framework, is examined. Finally, in chapter five, the conclusions drawn from the analysis
are presented.44
In analysing the nexus between pollinator conservation and the right to food, this thesis
brings together two branches of international law which, when examined separately,
seemingly lack teeth. IEL is characterised by fragmentation and lacks effective
implementation and enforcement.45 The impact of IHRL, in turn, is impaired by issues
such as non-compliance, ambiguity and inconsistency.46 This thesis aims to discuss,
through the example of pollinator conservation and the right to food, whether the positive
impacts of IEL and IHRL can be bolstered by identifying and harnessing synergies
between the two branches of international law, thereby facilitating a win-win situation
whereby environmental protection is enhanced and human rights are advanced.
Notably, non-State actors, particularly corporations, are increasingly considered human
rights duty bearers.47 Similarly, although corporations are not legally bound by IEL
treaties, legal standards are emerging whereby the legitimacy of corporations’ conduct
can be determined against normative benchmarks rooted in IEL.48 The duties, as well as
opportunities, of corporations in relation to the protection of biodiversity are particularly

a case only available in Spanish and discussed in sub-chapter 4.3.2, only considered sources available in
English, Swedish and Finnish.

topical.49 However, these debates are beyond the scope of this thesis and the analysis is
therefore limited to the obligations of States.

1.3. Method and Sources
Applying the legal dogmatic research method, the sources of international law are used
for this thesis’ analysis. Pursuant to Article 38 (1) of the Statute of the International Court
of Justice, the sources of international law are the following:
a.

international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly
recognized by the contesting states;

b.

international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;

c.

the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;

d.

judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the
various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law. 50

Whilst the first three sources listed by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) are primary,
the last one is secondary, hence the word “subsidiary”. Secondary sources of international
law are those that implement and interpret primary ones.51 This thesis’ analysis is based
on a variety of legal sources; both primary and secondary. The most important primary
sources used to analyse pollinator conservation and the right to food are the CBD and the
International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR or the
Covenant), respectively.52 Said treaties are those dealing with the respective topics most
comprehensively, and they are examined in accordance with the general rules of
interpretation as laid down by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.53
Additionally, treaties other than those already mentioned, general comments adopted by
treaty monitoring bodies, resolutions, statements, guidelines and various other documents

adopted by well-established and qualified international institutions are utilised.54 Reports
of UN Special Rapporteurs, particularly those of the UN Special Rapporteur on human
rights and the environment, are made use of throughout this thesis.55 Moreover, the
analysis utilises judicial and quasi-judicial decisions as well as the work of legal
academics and jurists. Lastly, since IEL is largely based on science, this thesis necessarily
frequently refers to scientific studies.
In its analytical study on the relationship between human rights and the environment, the
Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) identifies three main
approaches used to analyse the relationship between human rights and the environment.56
According to the first approach, “the environment is a precondition to the enjoyment of
human rights”.57 In line with the second approach, human rights can be used as tools to
protect the environment and address environmental issues.58 Lastly, according to the third
approach, which is deemed more ambiguous than the other two,59 human rights and the
environment should be integrated under the concept of sustainable development.60 These
approaches, which, importantly, are capable of coexisting,61 are adopted in this thesis’
analysis, as is reflected in the research questions. They will therefore be examined in
further detail in chapter 4.

N.B. Although soft law instruments are not immediately binding upon States, they can be just as effective
as binding instruments in terms of addressing international issues. Furthermore, over time they can
crystallise into hard law. On the integral role of soft law, see Shelton 2009.

2. Pollinator Conservation Under International Environmental Law
2.1. Pollinator Decline: A Global Concern
Threats to pollinators include, but are not limited to, climate change, pesticides, habitat
loss, parasites, impacts of non-native species, invasive diseases, declining flower
resources and light pollution.62 When considering the overall threat landscape, it is
notable that the different drivers of decline may take place concurrently, thus intensifying
the pressure on pollinators.63 Indeed, two or more separate, non-lethal threats may act in
concurrence, thus creating lethal circumstances.64
The decline in pollinators is, as previously noted, a global phenomenon. At the same time,
crops and other plants are reliant on pollinators globally. Furthermore, pollinator decline
drivers, as so many biodiversity challenges, are often of a transboundary nature and
therefore cannot be controlled by any one State. The decline in pollinators is therefore by
definition a global concern, and effectual conservation of pollinators, like so many
components of biodiversity, is thus only possible through international cooperation.65
Ergo, legal measures at the global level are appropriate to address the issue.

2.2. Legal Bases for International Cooperation to Address Pollinator Decline
Approaching the issue of pollinator decline through international cooperation is not only
a matter of practicality, but also an application of the duty of international cooperation.
The duty to cooperate is a general principle of public international law. It has support in
the general practice of States,66 and is present in several provisions of the Charter of the
UN.67 In his separate opinion on the MOX Plant case, Judge Wolfrum of the International
Tribunal for the Law of the Sea notes that the duty to cooperate “balances the principle

of sovereignty of States and thus ensures that community interests are taken into account
vis-à-vis individualistic State interests”.68
In terms of addressing pollinator decline, legal bases for international cooperation can be
found in both IHRL and IEL. In the context of this thesis, it is particularly notable that
the ICESCR proclaims the duty to cooperate.69 Often, the duty to cooperate merely plays
a supporting role in the protection of human rights.70 However, the duty is triggered by
certain types of environmental harm that affect human rights.71 John H. Knox, former UN
Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment, has left no doubt that the full
realisation of the right to food is dependent on biodiversity and ecosystem services.72 As
aforementioned, pollination is an ecosystem service of particular significance to the
realisation of the right to food.73 Ergo, the decline in pollinators affects the enjoyment of
the right to food and therefore triggers the duty of international cooperation.
The duty to cooperate is a central element of IEL.74 It is laid down in soft law instruments
such as the Stockholm Declaration on the Human Environment (Stockholm Declaration)
and the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (Rio Declaration).75 As noted
by Craik, the duty to cooperate has been ubiquitously recognised in treaties adopted after
the adoption of these declarations, and it is widely recognised by judicial bodies as a
fundamental principle of IEL.76 Judge Wolfrum has gone as far as calling it “the
overriding principle”.77 In terms of addressing pollinator decline, it is particularly relevant
to note the presence of the duty to cooperate in the provisions of the CBD. The need for
global cooperation for the protection of biodiversity is stressed in the instrument’s
preamble, whilst Article 5 obligates States Parties to the convention to “as far as possible

and as appropriate cooperate with other Contracting Parties […] for the conservation and
sustainable use of biological diversity”.78 Like many other IEL treaties, the CBD does,
however, acknowledge that the “particular conditions and capabilities” of its Parties
differ.79 In other words, the need for international cooperation does not imply that all
Parties are expected to take identical measures to protect pollinators, rather, regional and
national differences should be given due regard.
The purpose of the present chapter is to analyse what States have done to fulfil their duty
of international cooperation in addressing pollinator decline. Sections of IEL that are
relevant to the conservation of pollinators, with particular emphasis on the CBD, are
examined.

2.3. Exploring the Breadth of IEL Treaties Relevant to the Protection of Pollinators
2.3.1. With a Myriad of Threats Comes a Diverse Range of Relevant Treaties
Some groups of pollinators are subject to their very own instruments, such as the
International Convention for the Protection of Birds and the Agreement on the
Conservation of Populations of European Bats.80 The relevance of these to pollinator
conservation is self-explanatory. Although their relevance may not be as straightforward,
there are several other treaties within the scope of IEL which, either directly or indirectly,
contribute to the conservation of pollinators.
As previously noted, pollinators face a multitude of threats which, especially in
combination, can be lethal. As a result of the myriad of threats, the relevant legal
framework is diverse. To effectively and comprehensively address pollinator decline,
threats to pollinators and the various instruments addressing these threats should be
considered not only separately but in combination. An extensive review of how IEL as a
whole works from a pollinator conservation perspective would therefore be of value.
Alas, the scope of this thesis does not allow for such a review. Instead, the approach taken

is to identify and analyse key treaties of relevance, with the intention to demonstrate the
breadth of IEL instruments that do, or can, play a role in pollinator conservation. The
treaties discussed here should therefore not be regarded as an exhaustive list. In the
subsequent analysis, different drivers of pollinator decline are used to identify relevant
IEL treaties. By identifying treaties that regulate different threats to pollinators, both the
multitude of threats and the extent of the relevant legal instruments can be addressed
through a coherent framework. Each of the following sub-chapters examines a particular
risk to pollinators and the IEL instruments relevant to addressing that risk.

2.3.2. Indirect Pollinator Conservation Through the Climate Regime
Climate change is a major driver of global biodiversity loss.81 Pollinators are particularly
vulnerable to this phenomenon,82 and climate change driven loss of pollinators is
expected to accelerate.83 The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
and instruments adopted under the auspices of it,84 particularly the Paris Agreement,85
therefore have the potential to channel important contributions to the conservation of
pollinators through the facilitation of action primarily intended to mitigate climate
change.86

2.3.3. Instruments Applicable to the Conservation of Pollinator Habitats
Habitat loss, largely attributable to land-use change, is another key driver of biodiversity
decline globally.87 The impacts of habitat loss on pollinators are adverse.88 IEL treaties
such as the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl

Cultural and Natural Heritage (World Heritage Convention),90 the Convention on the
Conservation of Migratory Species and Wild Animals (Bonn Convention),91 and the
Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Bern
Convention),92 are relevant to the conservation of pollinator habitats. The Ramsar
Convention covers wetlands “selected…on account of their international significance in
terms of ecology, botany, zoology, limnology or hydrology”.93 Wetlands may hold key
forage sources for bees.94 Sites that may be important pollinator habitats are protected by
the World Heritage Convention,95 which considers, inter alia, “precisely delineated areas
which constitute the habitat of threatened species of animals or plants of outstanding
universal value from the point of science or conservation” to be “natural heritage”.96 The
Bonn Convention covers migratory species throughout their range, and some pollinator
habitats, such as that of the Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), are explicitly
covered.97 The Bern Convention “aims […] to conserve wild flora and fauna and their
natural habitats”, with “[p]articular emphasis […] given to endangered and vulnerable
species”.98 It covers, inter alia, several species of bat.99

2.3.4. Pesticide Regulation is Crucial to Pollinator Conservation
Pesticides have repeatedly been pointed out as one of the most detrimental threats to
pollinators.100 A growing body of scientific research indicates that neonicotinoids, i.e.,

“nicotine-related insecticides”,101 are particularly harmful to the ecosystem services on
which our food production depends.102 Since this thesis focuses on food security, it should
be noted that the pesticide industry, which is worth hundreds of billions of US dollars,103
consistently suggests that its products are essential to food production.104 However, whilst
pesticides can be agriculturally beneficial,105 the services performed by pollinators are
likely to be more pivotal to global food production than pesticides.106 Furthermore, the
pollination services provided by bees have been shown to outperform pesticides in terms
of both production and profitability of crops.107 Bees both increase food production and
improve food quality.108 Boyd has stated that “[p]esticides jeopardize the right to food by
harming pollinators and contaminating soils”.109
Nevertheless, use of pesticides hazardous to pollinators continues to be widespread.110
Within the scope of IEL, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants
(Stockholm Convention) and the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent
Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade
(Rotterdam Convention) have the potential to protect pollinators from pesticides.111 As
of 2019, the Stockholm and Rotterdam Conventions cover 18 and 35 pesticides,
respectively.112 Although the pesticides covered are among the most harmful ones, in
numerical terms they constitute the tip of the iceberg.113 Several actors are calling for
stronger pesticide regulating instruments at the international level.114 Specifically from a

pollinator conservation perspective, the banning of neonicotinoids at the international
level has been called for.115

2.3.5. Indirect Conservation of Pollinators Through the Conservation of Plants
Many plants and pollinators engage in mutualistic interactions, meaning that a decline of
either party will affect the survival of the other.116 The close-knit relationship between
plants and pollinators makes the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) highly
relevant to the conservation of pollinators.117 In the context of this thesis it is particularly
notable that the IPPC mission statement is “[t]o secure cooperation among nations in
protecting global plant resources […] in order to preserve food security [and] biodiversity
[…]”.118

2.3.6. Relevance of the Regulation of International Trade in Endangered Species
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
(CITES) regulates the commercial trade of species in danger of extinction.119 CITES
currently covers some pollinators, including birds and butterflies,120 making it a relevant
instrument from a pollinator conservation perspective. The treaty may also contribute to
pollinator conservation indirectly through the regulation of trade in species which, when

native pollinators.

2.4. Pollinator Conservation Through the Convention on Biological Diversity
2.4.1. The Overarching Global Framework for Pollinator Conservation
As shown in the previous sub-chapters, there are many IEL treaties that may contribute
to pollinator conservation through addressing different threats. However, one IEL treaty
clearly stands out in terms of applicability to pollinator conservation. As will be shown,
the CBD is the international regulatory instrument that fundamentally governs the global
framework of pollinator conservation.
The relationships of interdependency between pollinators, plants and ecosystems are
complex. In simple terms, however, biodiverse ecosystems with many plant species
sustain a diversity of pollinators, while the biodiversity of ecosystems is equally
dependent on the services performed by pollinators.121 The CBD is an instrument that
addresses both aspects of this relationship, as it protects pollinators both explicitly, most
notably through the auspices of the International Pollinator Initiative,122 and implicitly
through the general protection of biodiversity. Therefore, in the context of this thesis, the
CBD is particularly relevant and a more detailed analysis of its role in pollinator
conservation is warranted.

2.4.2. Scope of the CBD in the Context of Pollinator Conservation
The CBD is an ambitious treaty. It is the international conservation agreement with the
widest scope.123 To date, it has 196 Parties,124 making it nearly universal.125 Almost every
country in the world has ratified the CBD, with the notable exception of the United States

of America. Thus, the treaty facilitates global cooperation for the protection of
biodiversity. Indeed, the importance of cooperation is, as aforementioned, recognised in
the CBD.126
With the general goal to encourage actions which will lead to a sustainable future, the
CBD’s three main objectives are the following:
1. conservation of biodiversity;
2. sustainable use of biodiversity; and
3. fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources.127
The terms used within the CBD are defined in Article 2.128 In the present context, it is
essential to note that ““[b]iological resources” includes genetic resources, organisms or
parts thereof, populations, or any other biotic component of ecosystems with actual or
potential use or value for humanity”.129 Pollinators are biological resources with actual
value for humanity,130 and references to biological resources in the CBD should therefore
be interpreted as applicable to pollinators.
Pursuant to Article 7, Parties are obligated to “as far as possible and as appropriate”, inter
alia:
(a) [i]dentify components of biological diversity important for its conservation and
sustainable use having regard to the indicative list of categories set down in Annex I;
(b) [m]onitor […] [these components] […] paying particular attention to those requiring
urgent conservation measures and those which offer the greatest potential for sustainable use;
[and]
(c) [i]dentify processes and categories of activities which have or are likely to have significant
adverse impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, and monitor
their effects […]131

126

See CBD, Preamble & Article 5.
CBD, Article 1. N.B. The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable
Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (hereinafter Nagoya Protocol) was adopted in 2010 to
facilitate implementation of the CBD’s third objective, see Nagoya Protocol, 29.10.2010. In the context of
pollinators, the protocol is, for instance, relevant to the access and benefit-sharing of bee genetic resources,
see Aizen et al./ FAO 2021, p. 59.

Pollinators fit into several categories amongst those listed in Annex I, inter alia,
threatened species and species of agricultural value.132 Moreover, as previously
discussed, habitat loss poses a major threat to pollinators, and therefore the category of
habitats containing large numbers of threatened species is relevant to pollinator
conservation.133 From a long-term food security perspective and in line with Article 7 (b),
pollinators should be given particular attention. Indeed, the “critical importance” of
conserving and sustainably using biodiversity in order to meet the growing need for food
is noted in the CBD.134 The importance of pollinators to sustainable food production is
discussed in chapter 4.2.
Article 8 covers in-situ conservation,135 i.e., the conservation of components of
biodiversity in their natural habitats.136 Several of the provisions of Article 8 are relevant
to pollinator conservation. In particular, Parties are obligated to, “as far as possible and
as appropriate”:
[r]egulate or manage biological resources important for the conservation of biological
diversity whether within or outside protected areas, with a view to ensuring their conservation
and sustainable use[.]137

In light of the fact that “[p]ollination is one of the most important mechanisms in the
maintenance and promotion of biodiversity and, in general, life on Earth”,138 it is
indisputable that, pursuant to the above provision, Parties to the CBD are obligated to
protect pollinators.
Under Article 8, other key provisions from the perspective of pollinator conservation are
those obligating Parties to “promote the recovery of threatened species, inter alia, through
the development and implementation of plans or other management strategies”, and to
“[d]evelop or maintain necessary legislation and/or other regulatory provisions for the
protection of threatened species and populations”.139 Although there is some uncertainty
as to the extent of pollinator decline, the evidence indicates that, worldwide, pollinators

are declining rapidly.140 Moreover, as noted in preambular paragraph 9 of the CBD,
“where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full
scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or
minimize such a threat”.141 In accordance with the precautionary principle and pursuant
to Article 8, Parties to the CBD should both promote the recovery of pollinators and take
necessary legislative measures to protect them. Indeed, as argued by Drivdal and van der
Sluijs, given the crucial importance of pollinators to both global food security and
biodiversity, a stronger and broader application of the precautionary principle to
pollinator conservation is urgently needed.142
Lastly, Article 8 also obligates Parties to “[w]here a significant adverse effect on
biological diversity has been determined pursuant to Article 7, regulate or manage the
relevant processes and categories of activities”.143 As the maintenance of biodiversity is
dependent on pollinators, this provision may, for instance, be interpreted as to obligate
Parties to regulate the use of such pesticides that have significant adverse effects on
pollinators.
Article 9 covers ex-situ conservation.144 Ex-situ conservation, as opposed to in-situ
conservation, “means the conservation of components of biological diversity outside their
natural habitats”,145 and may therefore be applicable in the case of domesticated bees.146
Pursuant to Article 10, Parties are obligated to, “as far as possible and as appropriate”,
inter alia, “[a]dopt measures relating to the use of biological resources to avoid or
minimize adverse impacts on biological diversity”.147 Article 14 contains more specific
provisions related to the obligation to adopt measures; it requires States Parties to perform
environmental impact assessments (EIAs) “of [any] proposed projects that are likely to
have significant adverse effects on biological diversity”.148 Although consideration of
biodiversity in EIAs is highly complex,149 systematic assessment and mitigation through

the EIA approach, when applied, may be key to avoiding or minimising adverse impacts
on pollinators.150
Article 12 covers obligations related to research and training. Parties are, inter alia,
obligated to:
[p]romote and encourage research which contributes to the conservation and sustainable use
of biological diversity, particularly in developing countries, inter alia, in accordance with
decisions of the Conference of the Parties taken in consequence of recommendations of the
Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice.151

Article 18, in turn, lays down that Parties are obligated to:
promote international […] scientific cooperation in the field of conservation and sustainable
use of biological diversity, where necessary, through the appropriate international and
national institutions.152

Public education and awareness are covered by Article 13, pursuant to which Parties are
obligated to:
(a) [p]romote and encourage understanding of the importance of, and the measures required
for, the conservation of biological diversity, as well as its propagation through media, and
the inclusion of these topics in educational programmes; and
(b) [c]ooperate, as appropriate, with other States and international organizations in
developing educational and public awareness programmes with respect to conservation and
sustainable use of biological diversity.153

As argued by Morgera, all of the CBD’s provisions are legally binding.154 Thus, the
question is not whether States should implement the obligations arising from the
convention, but rather how.155 The above analysis indicates that Parties to the CBD are
obligated to protect and conserve pollinators. Moreover, Parties have obligations to
promote research and scientific cooperation in the field of biodiversity conservation, as
well as promote awareness of the importance of conserving biodiversity. The following
sub-chapters cover what has been done under the auspices of the CBD to meet these

2.4.3. The International Pollinator Initiative: A Catalyst for Pollinator Conservation
Efforts Worldwide
Pollinators were first given priority by the Parties to the CBD in decision III/11 on the
conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity, adopted during the
third Conference of the Parties to the CBD in 1996.156 Decision III/11 established a
programme of work on agricultural biodiversity, and prioritised agriculturally important
components of biodiversity, including pollinators.157 Consequently, in 1998, a Workshop
on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Pollinators in Agriculture with Emphasis on
Bees was held in São Paolo, resulting in the São Paolo Declaration on Pollinators, in
which the suggestion of an International Pollinator Initiative was first put forward.158
Based on the recommendations of said declaration, the CBD’s Subsidiary Body on
Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice proposed the establishment of an
International Pollinator Initiative.159
Thus, in 2000, with an increasing sense of urgency to address the global decline in
pollinators, the International Initiative for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of
Pollinators (International Pollinator Initiative – IPI) was established through Decision V/5
during the fifth Conference of the Parties to the CBD.160 The IPI was established “as a
cross-cutting initiative within the programme of work on agricultural biodiversity”.161 Its
purpose is the following:

to promote coordinated action worldwide to:
(a) [m]onitor pollinator decline, its causes and its impact on pollination services;
(b) [a]ddress the lack of taxonomic information on pollinators;
(c) [a]ssess the economic value of pollination and the economic impact of the decline of
pollination services;
(d) [p]romote the conservation and the restoration and sustainable use of pollinator diversity
in agriculture and related ecosystems.162

The IPI is facilitated and coordinated primarily by the Food and Agriculture Organization
of the UN (FAO).163 In collaboration with key experts, FAO and the Secretariat of the
CBD prepared a Plan of Action for the IPI (POA) which was adopted in 2002 through
decision VI/5 at the sixth Conference of the Parties to the CBD.164 The four central
elements of this original POA were assessment, adaptive management, capacity building
and mainstreaming.165 Much was accomplished during the first phase of the IPI. Among
other things, the main threats and causes of pollinator decline and the impacts of this on
food production were identified, the economic value of pollinators was assessed, and
several important tools were developed to facilitate pollinator conservation efforts.166
The second phase of the IPI commenced in 2018. At its thirteenth meeting, the
Conference of the Parties to the CBD requested the development of an updated plan of
action.167 Hence, at the following meeting, such a plan was adopted through decision
14/6.168 The overriding objective of the Updated Plan of Action 2018-2030 for the
International Initiative on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Pollinators (POA 2.0)
is as follows:

163

23

to promote coordinated action worldwide to safeguard wild and managed pollinators and
promote the sustainable use of pollination functions and services, which is a recognized vital
ecosystem service for agriculture and for the functioning and health of ecosystems. 169

The actions that POA 2.0 aims to facilitate the implementation of “can be applied at the
regional, national, subnational and local levels”.170 More specifically:
[t]he updated Plan of Action builds on the first phase, and taking into account decision
XIII/15, orients the emphasis towards mainstreaming pollination concerns into policy,
developing and implementing measures on the ground to support the conservation and
sustainable use of pollinators, addressing risks, building capacity and sharing knowledge on
multiple levels to integrate pollination considerations into farming, land use and other
management decisions, and focusing collaborative research on emerging issues and
prevailing needs.171

Hence, the four central elements of POA 2.0 are:
1. enabling policies and strategies;
2. field-level implementation;
3. civil society and private sector engagement; and
4. monitoring, research and assessment.172
In the context of this thesis, the following statement in POA 2.0 is particularly important:
[p]ollinator-friendly measures have the potential to increase productivity and sustainability
and contribute to the long-term viability and profitability of food production systems. Their
wider use could be a transformative agent by fostering sustainable practices among
agricultural sectors.173

Despite it lacking legal force, the IPI has catalysed pollinator conservation efforts
worldwide. Indeed, the IPI has brought “pollinators to the forefront of agricultural policy
internationally”.174 Today, there is a considerable number of initiatives for pollinator
conservation at the international, regional and national levels. FAO’s Global Action on
Pollination Services for Sustainable Agriculture is a key initiative at the global level.175

Through said initiative, FAO works with an array of partners from various sectors to push
forward the pollinator agenda. Another notable example of an international initiative is
the Coalition of the Willing on Pollinators, more commonly known as Promote
Pollinators.176 Through Promote Pollinators, countries from across the globe collaborate
and share knowledge with the purpose of spurring action to protect pollinators.177
At the regional level there are currently five major pollinator initiatives, namely the
Brazilian, African, European, North American and Oceania ones.178 Initiatives operating
at the national level include the National Pollinator Strategy for bees and other pollinators
in England, the Dutch Pollinator Strategy and the Honey bee and pollination continuity
strategy (Australia), to name but a few.179 According to the Intergovernmental SciencePolicy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES),180 “[t]here is no doubt
that these integrated actions and strategies can lead to policy change with the potential to
influence pollinator management on the ground”.181 This is already happening in the
Netherlands; thanks to the Dutch strategy bee populations are steady in urban
environments across the country.182

2.4.4. The Promotion of Science and Awareness for Pollinator Conservation
With the objective “to approach science and decision making for the conservation of
biodiversity and ecosystem services, human well-being and sustainable development”,183
IPBES was established in 2012.184 The establishment of IPBES can be seen as an
application of States’ obligations under the CBD to promote research and scientific
cooperation in the field of biodiversity conservation.185 IPBES’ debut global assessment

report was titled “Pollinators, Pollination and Food Production”.186 Pollinators have
consequently become a major talking point globally.187
In 2017, following a proposal from Slovenia and “[a]cknowledging the urgent need to
raise awareness at all levels and to promote and facilitate actions for the protection of
bees and other pollinators in order to contribute to their health and development […]”,
the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring the 20th of May as World Bee
Day.188 This can be seen as an application of States’ obligation to raise awareness of the
importance of biodiversity conservation, and to cooperate in doing so.189 In a notable
national example of awareness-raising, Finland’s national broadcasting company Yle
launched a pollinator campaign, Pelasta pörriäinen, calling upon Finns to take concrete
measures to save pollinators.190 The campaign was highly successful in both raising
awareness about pollinators and increasing enthusiasm to protect them.191

2.5. Safeguarding Pollinators Through IEL: Key Considerations
The environmental rule of law is crucial to addressing biodiversity decline.192 Evidently,
pollinator conservation under IEL is complex and multifaceted. As previously noted, in
order to comprehensively address pollinator decline, it is crucial that IEL covers all
threats to pollinators. At least as important, however, is that collaboration between the
relevant treaty regimes takes place to avoid fragmentation and optimise pollinator
conservation. The importance of future collaboration between the chemical and
biodiversity regimes has, for instance, been emphasised.193 Moreover, in POA 2.0,
“[promoting] coherent policies across sectors and cross-cutting issues” is listed as one of
the activities needed to implement the IPI.194

The CBD has the potential to facilitate the conservation of Earth’s biodiversity, but has
been criticised, inter alia, due to its breadth and ambiguous language.195 Koivurova, for
instance, argues that the CBD’s status as binding upon nearly every State comes at the
expense of its substantive content.196 In a similar vein, Izaguirre argues that the
instrument’s “comprehensiveness waters down its obligations and complicates its
implementation”.197 Moreover, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms that can be
used to compel States Parties to fulfil their CBD obligations.198 Indeed, the biodiversity
regime is plagued by massive implementation and enforcement gaps.199 The deficiencies
of the CBD are demonstrated by the fact that, almost 30 years after its adoption, “[n]one
of the global goals for the protection of life on Earth have been fully met”.200
Anthropogenic stressors are still causing snowballing declines in biodiversity and an
estimated eighth of the species living on our planet are currently threatened with
extinction.201 The situation is grave, and scientists believe that we, humans, are causing
the ongoing sixth mass extinction.202 Unless urgent action is taken, the decline in
biodiversity is predicted to accelerate.203 Robinson argues that “[b]iodiversity law – both
internationally and nationally – is manifestly inadequate to conserve the Earth’s legacy
of biodiversity”.204 Furthermore, he stresses that “[u]nless human laws safeguard nature,
humanity itself reaches the extinction threshold found in other species”.205 Humanity thus
has no choice but to step up.
The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), expected to be adopted at the
second part of the fifteenth Conference of the Parties to the CBD in the spring of 2022,206
represents a major opportunity for the international community to take the necessary steps
towards “living in harmony with nature” by 2050. The first draft of the GBF was

published in July 2021.207 It “sets out an ambitious plan to implement broad-based action
to bring about a transformation in society’s relationship with biodiversity and to ensure
that, by 2050, the shared vision of living in harmony with nature is fulfilled”.208 With four
long-term goals for 2050 as well as several corresponding milestones to be assessed in
2030,209 the first draft of the GBF holds a lot of potential to facilitate the action needed to
protect and restore Earth’s biodiversity. However, it should be noted that the goals are
highly ambitious and reaching them will not be an easy task. Nevertheless, during the
first part of the critical conference, which was held online in mid-October 2021, the
Kunming Declaration, in which governments pledge to, inter alia, “[e]nsure the
development, adoption and implementation of an effective post-2020 global biodiversity
framework”, was adopted.210
The non-binding IPI and the regional and national initiatives that it has catalysed appear
to be successful in raising both awareness and willingness to engage.211 According to
FAO, “[t]he [IPI] has led to significant and noteworthy progress”. 212 However, in terms
of necessary policy changes and measures to address pollinator decline, pollinator
initiatives at the European Union (EU) level, to provide a regional example, have not
borne fruit.213 Recent data indicates that despite a plethora of initiatives aimed at
addressing the decline in pollinators, they are still declining at alarming rates.214
However, it should be noted that many pollinator initiatives are still in their infancy, and
their importance in addressing pollinator decline in the long-run should by no means be
disregarded. The lack in application of behaviour-change theories has been pointed out
as a major underlying reason for the implementation gap in pollinator initiatives.215
Addressing this gap is likely to be key in mitigating the loss of pollinators.216 In the
context of the need to address implementation gaps, it is notable that one of the key aims

included in the first draft of the GBF is “to facilitate implementation”.217 Another aim put
forward which is highly relevant in the context of this thesis is that “to promote synergies
and coordination”.218
In the context of strengthening the implementation of IEL, it is notable that the UN
Environment Programme (UNEP) is currently conducting the Fifth Montevideo
Programme for the Development and Periodic Review of Environmental Law
(Montevideo Programme V).219 Montevideo Programme V builds on the four previous
ten-year intergovernmental programmes aimed at promoting, developing and
implementing IEL.220 A key element which was recently introduced to the latest
programme is its digital backbone, namely UNEP’s Law and Environment Assistance
Platform (UNEP-LEAP).221 Although still a work-in-progress, UNEP-LEAP has the
potential to facilitate strengthened implementation of IEL, inter alia through enabling
Member States and various other stakeholders to request technical legal assistance via the
platform’s Clearing House Mechanism.222
Notwithstanding the importance of enhancing synergies between treaty regimes within
IEL and strengthening the implementation of pollinator initiatives at the regional, national
and local levels, there is also reason to explore the potential added value of utilising
synergies with treaties in other branches of international law. In the context of pollinator
conservation, IHRL may be a particularly useful complementary branch of international
law. Specifically, the right to food may be a valuable tool to support pollinator
conservation. This is discussed in detail in sub-chapter 4.3. As a clear understanding of
the right to food under IHRL is a prerequisite for such a discussion, the right is defined
and analysed in the following chapter.

3. The Right to Food Under International Human Rights Law
3.1. The Legal Basis of the Right to Food in IHRL
The right to food was first recognised by the international community in the landmark
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) of 1948.223 Article 25 (1) of the UDHR
lays down that “[e]veryone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health
and well-being of himself and of his family, including food […]”.224 In itself, the UDHR
is not a legally binding treaty. However, the instrument’s legal status has evolved since
its adoption, and nowadays it is considered that at least some of the rights proclaimed in
the UDHR are a part of customary international law.225
In 1966, eighteen years after the adoption of the UDHR, the right to food became
enshrined in the legally binding ICESCR. Pursuant to Article 11 (1) of the ICESCR,
everyone has the right “to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family […]
including adequate food […]”.226 Hence, the right to food is also referred to as the right
to adequate food, and the two terms will subsequently be used interchangeably.
Notably, although the wording “for himself and his family” may seem to imply that the
above provision is applicable only to a specific category of peoples, this is not the case.
The ICESCR’s supervisory body, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights (CESCR or the Committee) clarifies this, stating in its General Comment No. 12
that the right to adequate food “applies to everyone”.227 Moreover, pursuant to article 2
(2) of the ICESCR, the rights proclaimed in the Covenant must “be exercised without
discrimination of any kind”.228 Ergo, the right to adequate food is, like all human rights,
universal.

In addition to proclaiming the right to adequate food, the ICESCR recognises “the
fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger”.229 In the Rome Declaration on
World Food Security, adopted at the World Food Summit in 1996, “the right of everyone
to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and
the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger” was reaffirmed.230
Besides the ICESCR, the right to food is recognised, either explicitly or implicitly, in
several other IHRL treaties.231 Other international treaties that proclaim the right to food
include, but are not limited to, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Convention on the Rights of the Child
(CRC) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).232
Moreover, regional instruments, such as the Additional Protocol to the American
Convention on Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
(Protocol of San Salvador), the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child
and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of
Women in Africa, recognise the right to food.233 Nevertheless, the ICESCR remains the
IHRL treaty which deals the most comprehensively with the right,234 and it is therefore
the focus of the subsequent analysis.

3.2. Food: A Precondition for the Enjoyment of Other Fundamental Human Rights
The right to adequate food is inseparably linked to human dignity and is of critical
importance for the full enjoyment of all other human rights.235 First and foremost, it is
inextricably linked to the right to life, for without adequate food a human cannot survive.
In its General Comment No. 6 on the right to life, the Human Rights Committee (CCPR),
i.e., the body of independent experts that monitors the implementation of the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),236 recognises this, noting that pursuant
to the duty to protect life, States are obligated to take appropriate measures to, inter alia,
address widespread hunger and malnutrition and ensure access to food.237
Just as the right to life cannot be realised without food, it is not possible for individuals
to obtain the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health without adequate
food. The connection between the rights to food and health is recognised, inter alia, by
the CESCR. In its General Comment No. 14 on the right to the highest attainable standard
of health, the Committee clarifies that “the right to health embraces a wide range of socioeconomic factors that promote conditions in which people can lead a healthy life, and
extends to the underlying determinants of health, such as food and nutrition […]”.238
These prominent examples of the rights to life and health clearly demonstrate the
fundamentality of the right to adequate food.
Yet, despite the fundamentality and legally binding nature of the long-established right,
the right to food framework only gained what Strakos and Sanches refer to as “significant
legal attention in the international arena” around 30 years after the adoption of the
ICESCR, and almost half a century after the right was first recognised in the UDHR.239
Indeed, it was not until the World Food Summit in 1996 that State leaders committed to
realising the right to food.240

3.3. Key Developments in Defining the Right to Food
The above-mentioned General Comment No. 12 was the first major development in the
elaboration of the normative content of the right to adequate food.241 It was adopted in
1999 in response to a request made by political leaders at the 1996 World Food
Summit,242 with the aim of identifying “some of the principal issues which the Committee
considers to be important in relation to the right to adequate food”.243 Soon after the
adoption of General Comment No. 12, “in order to respond fully to the necessity for an
integrated and coordinated approach in the promotion and protection of the right to food”,
the mandate of the first UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food was created by the
UN Commission on Human Rights,244 and Jean Ziegler was appointed. Another landmark
development came in 2004 when FAO endorsed the CESCR’s interpretation of the right
to adequate food in its Voluntary Guidelines to support the progressive realization of the
right to adequate food in the context of national food security (Right to Food
Guidelines).245 The Right to Food Guidelines were adopted with the goal of encouraging
more States to realise the right to adequate food in practice.246 According to Ziegler et al.,
the adoption of the guidelines “was an important step, because [it] reaffirmed a solid
commitment to the right to adequate food and agreed on an internationally accepted
understanding of the right”.247
Building on these key developments, in the sub-chapters that follow, the normative
content of the right to food is untangled and the State obligations arising therefrom are
examined.

3.4. Untangling the Normative Content of the Right to Food
3.4.1. Availability, Accessibility, Adequacy and Sustainability
Drawing on the CESCR’s elaboration on the normative content of the right to food,248
Olivier De Schutter, former UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food, has concisely
defined the right to food as follows:
the right of every individual, alone or in community with others, to have physical and
economic access at all times to sufficient, adequate and culturally acceptable food that is
produced and consumed sustainably, preserving access to food for future generations.249

The core content of the right, according to the CESCR, implies the following:
[t]The availability of food in a quantity and quality sufficient to satisfy the dietary needs of
individuals, free from adverse substances, and acceptable within a given culture; [and]
[t]he accessibility of such food in ways that are sustainable and that do not interfere with the
enjoyment of other human rights.250

Four elements are thus encompassed in the right to adequate food. These are availability,
accessibility, adequacy and sustainability. Availability refers to individuals’ possibilities
of feeding themselves, either directly from natural resources or from a food market.251
Accessibility entails physical and economic accessibility.252 Whilst physical accessibility
refers, quite literally, to the physical access of individuals to adequate food, economic
accessibility, in simple terms, means that individuals can afford to buy adequate food.253
The adequacy element refers to the quality of food; for food to be adequate it must “satisfy
the dietary needs of individuals, [be] free from adverse substances, and [be] acceptable
within a given culture”.254 Lastly, the sustainability dimension of the right to adequate
food implies the accessibility of food not only for present, but also future generations.255

Closely related to, but not synonymous with, the right to adequate food is the concept of
food security. For the purposes of this thesis, a clear understanding of the signification of
this concept is necessary. Therefore, in the following sub-chapter, food security is defined
and the concept’s relationship with the right to adequate food is clarified.

3.4.2. The Relationship Between the Right to Food and Food Security
FAO´s first official definition of food security was “[t]he availability at all times of
adequate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food
consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices”.256 According to the
High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition of the Committee on World
Food Security (HLPE), the original definition reflected the then prevailing perception that
the primary reasons for hunger were the unavailability of sufficient quantities of food as
well as global price instability.257 Over the past five decades, however, the understanding
of food insecurity and the underlying causes of it has evolved, and food security has thus
been redefined several times.258 In the 1996 World Food Summit Plan of Action, food
security is defined as existing “when all people, at all times, have physical and economic
access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food
preferences for an active and healthy life”.259 Five years later, FAO added the word
“social” to this definition.260 With this addition, the following definition of food security
was officially reaffirmed in the 2009 Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security:
[f]ood security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access
to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an
active and healthy life.261

This definition of food security is the most authoritative and commonly used one.262 It
established the four original pillars of food security, i.e., availability, access, utilisation

and stability.263 The availability of food is dependent on the production and distribution
of food that is adequate in terms of both quantity and quality.264 The access dimension of
food security refers to physical and economic availability.265 Food utilisation means the
best possible use of food to ensure the satisfaction of the dietary needs of individuals.266
Lastly, food stability refers to the constancy of availability, access and utilisation.267
Either explicit or implicit recognition of these four pillars of food security can be
identified within legal interpretations of the right to adequate food.268 The CESCR
explicitly refers to food availability and accessibility in General Comment No. 12.269
Furthermore, it mentions dietary needs,270 which according to the HLPE corresponds to
utilisation.271 Lastly, the Committee refers to the obligation of States to ensure adequate
food even in times of severe resource constraints,272 which the HLPE deems
correspondent to stability.273 The link between these four pillars of food security and the
right to adequate food was reinforced by FAO in its Right to Food Guidelines.274
With the emergence of the SDGs and a deepened understanding of the need to transform
our food systems to meet them, two additional dimensions of food security have come to
be recognised as essential to food security, namely agency and sustainability.275
According to the HLPE, these additional dimensions “flow directly from the principle of
the right to food”, and are implicitly present in the most authoritative definition of food
security.276 The agency dimension of food security refers to individuals’ capacity to
choose what they eat, what food to produce themselves and how to produce, process and
distribute it, as well as the ability of individuals to participate in policy and governance
processes of relevance to food systems.277 Agency is profoundly linked to the right to

adequate food, as well as other human rights.278 The importance of agency to the
realisation of the right to adequate food is reinforced in the Right to Food Guidelines:
States should promote and safeguard a free, democratic and just society in order to provide a
peaceful, stable and enabling economic, social, political and cultural environment in which
individuals can feed themselves and their families in freedom and dignity. 279

Moreover, the need for inclusive processes in the development, implementation and
monitoring of right to food strategies is explicitly referred to in the Right to Food
Guidelines.280
The final dimension of food security, i.e., sustainability, implies providing food security
for present generations in such a way that it does not compromise the provision of food
security for future generations.281 It differs from the stability dimension in that it implies
a more long-term outlook.282 Sustainability is recognised, inter alia, in the Right to Food
Guidelines, as vital to the realisation of the right to food:
States should consider specific national policies, legal instruments and supporting
mechanisms to protect ecological sustainability and the carrying capacity of ecosystems to
ensure the possibility for increased, sustainable food production for present and future
generations, prevent water pollution, protect the fertility of the soil, and promote the
sustainable management of fisheries and forestry.283

As noted by the HLPE, “[t]he six dimensions of food security […] are all interconnected
through a complex web of relationships”.284 Indeed, all the pillars must be addressed
concurrently in order to ensure food security.285
Notably, the definitions of the concepts of food security and the right to adequate food
are significantly similar.286 Moreover, when comparing the right to adequate food
elements with the pillars of food security, it is evident that there is a considerable amount
of overlap. Nevertheless, the two concepts should not be confused. According to the

OHCHR, food security “is a precondition for the full enjoyment of the right to food”.287
In other words, achieving food security is an integral part of the realisation of the right to
food.288 However, as emphasised by Mechlem, “fully realising the right to food is a wider
and more encompassing objective than achieving food security”.289 Furthermore,
although food security carries a considerable legal weight, it is not legally binding and
therefore does not impose obligations.290 As highlighted by Strakos and Sanches, “[t]he
[right to adequate food] adds the vital element of accountability to food security”.291
The elements of both the right to adequate food and food security are further discussed in
sub-chapter 4.2, in which the crucial importance of safeguarding pollinators in order to
address these elements is brought to light.

3.5. State Obligations Arising from the Right to Food
3.5.1. The Classification of State Obligations
Originally, the human rights obligations of States have been divided into positive and
negative obligations. The initial perception was that economic, social and cultural rights
were positive, i.e., “vague and resource-demanding rights subject to progressive
realisation”, whilst civil and political rights were viewed as negative, i.e., “precise and
cost-free, capable of immediate implementation”.292 Such dichotomy is now long
considered outdated and alternatives to the traditional notion have evolved. The most
prominent alternative is known as the tripartite typology of obligations. Although
originally elaborated by Shue in 1980,293 the tripartite typology was popularised by Eide
in 1987.294 According to the tripartite typology, States bear three types of human rights

obligations; to respect, protect and fulfil.295 Another noteworthy alternative to the
traditional division of human rights obligations is known as the quadruple typology.296
Elaborated by van Hoof in 1984, it differs from the tripartite typology in that instead of
the obligation to fulfil it includes the obligations to ensure and to promote.297 The
understanding of the nature of State obligations is elevated by the more nuanced tripartite
and quadruple typologies.298
Although originally adopted to describe State obligations arising from the right to
adequate food, the tripartite typology has subsequently become the most common
approach used to classify human rights,299 and is described as a “bridge-builder” between
economic, social and cultural rights, and civil and political rights.300 Indeed, the approach
illustrates that positive and negative elements are encompassed in both sets of rights.301
The applicability of the tripartite typology to all human rights reflects their universality,
indivisibility, interdependency and interrelatedness.302
Notably, the tripartite typology is employed by the 1998 Maastricht Guidelines on
Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Maastricht Guidelines), which were
agreed upon by an independent group of experts with the goal of facilitating
understanding and determination of violations of economic, social and cultural rights.303
In Guideline 6, the obligations to respect, protect and fulfil are described as follows:
(1) [t]he obligation to respect requires States to refrain from interfering with the enjoyment
of economic, social and cultural rights.
(2) [t]he obligation to protect requires States to prevent violations of such rights by third
parties.

(3) [t]he obligation to fulfil requires States to take appropriate legislative, administrative,
budgetary, judicial and other measures towards the full realization of such rights. 304

It is, furthermore, laid down that “[f]ailure to perform any one of these three obligations
constitutes a violation of such rights”.305 Lastly, it is noted in the Maastricht Guidelines
that the obligations to respect, protect and fulfil each consist of what are known as
obligations of conduct and obligations of result.306 These obligations are described in the
Maastricht Guidelines as follows:
(1) [t]he obligation of conduct requires action reasonably calculated to realize the enjoyment
of a particular right.
(2) [t]he obligation of result requires States to achieve specific targets to satisfy a detailed
substantive standard.307

The tripartite typology is widely applied by the CESCR to guide States in their
implementation of the ICESCR.308 Specifically in the context of the right to adequate
food, the CESCR specifies that the obligation to respect requires States to refrain from
taking measures that prevent existing access to adequate food.309 According to Ziegler,
“[t]he obligation to respect the right to food is effectively a negative obligation, as it
entails limits on the exercise of State power that might threaten people’s access to
food”.310 The obligation to protect, in turn, means that States must take measures to
guarantee that individuals are not deprived of their access to adequate food by other
individuals or by enterprises.311 The obligation to protect is thus of a positive nature,312
and it essentially means that States are required to prevent such deprivation through
passing and enforcing laws.313 Pursuant to their positive obligation to fulfil,314 States are

required to take on a more proactive role in the realisation of the right to adequate food.315
According to the CESCR, the obligation to fulfil, in the context of the right to adequate
food, incorporates two sub-obligations, namely those to facilitate and to provide.316 In
accordance with their obligation to facilitate, States are required to “pro-actively engage
in activities intended to strengthen people’s access to and utilization of resources and
means to ensure their livelihood, including food security”. Ensuring food security is thus
considered to fall under the realm of the obligation to fulfil.317 Lastly, the obligation to
provide means that States bear the duty to provide individuals or groups with adequate
food when they, for reasons beyond their control, are unable to do so themselves.318

3.5.2. Obligations Pursuant to Articles 2 & 11 of the Covenant
Article 2 of the ICESCR lays down the nature of States Parties’ general legal
obligations.319 These are applicable in relation to each of the rights enunciated in the
Covenant. The first paragraph of Article 2 reads as follows:
[e]ach State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually and through
international assistance and co-operation, especially economic and technical, to the
maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full
realization of the rights recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means,
including particularly the adoption of legislative measures.320

In its General Comment No. 3 on the nature of States Parties’ obligations, the CESCR
reaffirms that “[t]he principal obligation of result reflected in article 2 (1) is to take steps
“with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized””.321
This includes the right to adequate food. 322

The Committee highlights that whilst in the English version of the Covenant, States
Parties are obligated “to take steps”, the undertaking in the French version is “to act”
(“s’engage à agir”), and in the Spanish one “to adopt measures” (“a adoptar medidas”).
In the full meaning of the phrase, States are therefore obligated to take steps towards the
progressive realisation of the right to adequate food “within a reasonably short time after
the Covenant’s entry into force”. The Committee further clarifies that the “[s]uch steps
should be deliberate, concrete and targeted as clearly as possible towards meeting the
obligations recognized in the Covenant”.323
Regarding the concept of progressive realisation, Ziegler emphasises that it “cannot be
used to justify persistent injustice and inequality”.324 Rather, it means that States should
take immediate steps towards the full realisation of the right to adequate food.325 This is
made clear in the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Limburg Principles), in which it is clarified
that the phrase imposes an obligation on States to “move as expeditiously as possible
towards the realization of the rights”.326 Moreover, the concept of progressive realisation
implies the principle of non-retrogression, meaning that States are prohibited from taking
any deliberately retrogressive measures, i.e., measures that reduce the level of protection
that has already been achieved.327 An example of a deliberate retrogressive measure is
rescinding a law that affects the rights proclaimed in the Covenant.328
Pursuant to the provisions in Articles 2 and 11 relating to the duty to cooperate,329 States
Parties, depending on their resources, are obligated to receive or to provide.330 The
wording “to the maximum of its available resources” in Article 2 (1) should be
interpreted, in accordance with the Limburg Principles, to mean that “States parties are
obligated, regardless of the level of economic development, to ensure respect for
minimum subsistence rights for all”.331 This was reaffirmed in the Maastricht Guidelines

and by the CESCR in General Comment No. 3.332 In the case of the right to food,333 the
minimum core obligation of States is to ensure that everyone under its jurisdiction is free
from hunger.334 Importantly, the fulfilment of a minimum core obligation should not be
regarded as the conclusion of the realisation of an economic, social and cultural right.
Rather, it should be viewed as a first step.335
Although Article 2 (1) emphasises the need to adopt legislative measures in order to fully
realise the rights proclaimed in the Covenant, this does not imply that laws suffice. The
weight of legislative action is noted in the Limburg Principles, but the obligation of States
to use all appropriate means is also emphasised.336 Appropriate means, according to the
Limburg Principles, “[include] legislative, administrative, judicial, economic, social and
educational measures”.337
Pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 2, States are prohibited from exercising the
rights proclaimed in the ICESCR with any kind of discrimination.338 According to the
Limburg Principles, the prohibition of discrimination is an immediate duty.339 Indeed, as
emphasised by Ziegler, “discrimination in access to food […] cannot be justified under
any circumstances”.340
As already noted, Article 11 of the Covenant proclaims the right to adequate food and
recognises the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger.341 It is of particular
interest in the context of this thesis that the second paragraph of Article 11, recognising
the right to freedom from hunger, obligates States Parties to take measures:
[t]o improve methods of production, conservation and distribution of food by making full use
of technical and scientific knowledge, by disseminating knowledge of the principles of
nutrition and by developing or reforming agrarian systems in such a way as to achieve the
most efficient development and utilization of natural resources.342

Although States are afforded a certain degree of discretion in their methods of
implementing the right to adequate food, all Parties to the ICESCR are obligated to “take
whatever steps are necessary to ensure that everyone is free from hunger and as soon as
possible can enjoy the right to adequate food”.343 The obligations arising from the right
to adequate food will be further examined in sub-chapter 4.3 in relation to using the right
as a legal tool to support pollinator conservation.

3.6. The Justiciability of the Right to Food
Economic, social and cultural human rights, including the right to adequate food, appear
to have a “reputation” for being non-justiciable. This is largely due to the perceived
vagueness of such rights.344 Although right to food litigation is uncommon,345 according
to FAO, “there is nothing inherent in the right to food that dictates its non-justiciability at
the national level”, and “[a]ll levels of obligations regarding the right to food can be and
have been found to be justiciable”.346 An oft-cited regional human rights case
demonstrating the justiciability of the right to adequate food is the Social and Economic
Rights Action Center and the Center for Economic and Social Rights v. Nigeria (Ogoni)
case.347 In the Ogoni case, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights
(African Commission) considered a communication involving the violation of wideranging rights, including the right to food.348
The entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR) in 2013 represents a landmark development in
the advancement of accountability for violations of the rights proclaimed in the
ICESCR.349 A new complaints procedure for economic, social and cultural rights was

established by the OP-ICESCR, making the rights proclaimed in the ICESCR quasijusticiable at the international level.350 Today, claims that economic, social and cultural
rights are non-justiciable are not tenable.
Pollinator conservation under IEL and the right to food under IHRL have been analysed
in chapters two and three of this thesis, respectively. In the following chapter, the two
sections of international law are brought together with the aim of identifying and
analysing potential synergies between them that may be utilised in order to concomitantly
enhance food security and pollinator conservation.

4. Utilising International Law to Reconcile Pollinator Conservation with
Food Security
4.1. Charting the Relationship Between Human Rights and Environmental
Protection
4.1.1. Identifying the Connection in International Law Instruments
A relationship between IHRL and IEL has been recognised virtually since the latter field
of law emerged in the late 1960’s.351 At the 1972 UN Conference on the Human
Environment, held in Stockholm, the intrinsic link between environmental protection and
human rights was first officially recognised by the international community. The
conference resulted in the Stockholm Declaration which proclaims, inter alia, that the
environment is “essential to [man’s] well-being and to the enjoyment of basic human
rights [including] the right to life itself”, and that “[t]o defend and improve the human
environment for present and future generations has become an imperative goal for
mankind”.352 The Stockholm Declaration was the first step towards the global recognition
of the human right to a healthy environment, the added value of which is discussed in
sub-chapter 4.1.2. Principle 1 declares the following:
[m]an has the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life, in an
environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being, and he bears a solemn
responsibility to protect and improve the environment for present and future generations. 353

In proclaiming the responsibility to protect and improve the environment not only for
present, but also future generations, the Stockholm Declaration also introduced the
dimension of intergenerational equity. In the context of this thesis, the principle of
intergenerational equity is of particular importance, and it will be further discussed in
sub-chapters 4.2 and 4.3. Principle 2 of the Stockholm Declaration is also highly relevant
in the present context:

351

[t]he natural resources of the earth, including the air, water, land, flora and fauna and
especially representative samples of natural ecosystems, must be safeguarded for the benefit
of present and future generations through careful planning or management, as appropriate.354

The 1980’s saw the connection between human rights and the environment become
enshrined in legally binding instruments. Indeed, the African Charter on Human and
Peoples’ Rights (Banjul Charter), which was adopted in 1981, proclaims that “[a]ll
peoples shall have the right to a general satisfactory environment favourable to their
development”.355 The Protocol of San Salvador, adopted in 1988, includes a more specific
articulation than the Banjul Charter; in addition to proclaiming the right of individuals
“to live in a healthy environment”, it lays down that States have the duty to “promote the
protection, preservation, and improvement of the environment”.356
A noteworthy example of an international human rights agreement, as opposed to the
above-mentioned regional ones, which explicitly refers to the environment, is the 1989
CRC, pursuant to which States are obligated to “[take] into consideration the dangers and
risks of environmental pollution” when realising “the right of the child to the enjoyment
of the highest attainable standard of health”.357
Notwithstanding these provisions, “the right to a healthy environment remains limited
within the core international human rights treaties”.358 Importantly, however, although
IHRL instruments adopted prior to the Stockholm Declaration do not include explicit
references to the environment, they have been progressively, or teleologically,
interpreted.359 Such interpretation, which has been done by both human rights treaty
bodies and regional human rights mechanisms, enables the recognition of environmental
dimensions of older human rights instruments.360 For instance, the UDHR proclaims that
“[e]veryone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms
set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized”.361 The “order” referred to is generally

interpreted as to cover environmental issues.362 As will be detailed in subsequent sections,
it is through such progressive interpretation that the environmental dimensions of the right
to adequate food can be identified and utilised. The recognition of environmental
dimensions of human rights treaties through teleological interpretation is referred to as
“greening” of IHRL.363
The link between human rights and environmental protection can also be identified
through the examination of environmental instruments.364 A notable example of an
environmental treaty which recognises the link between the environment and human
rights is the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in DecisionMaking and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus Convention).365 The
Aarhus Convention recognises that “adequate protection of the environment is essential
to human well-being and the enjoyment of basic human rights, including the right to life
itself”.366 Moreover, it recognises that “every person has the right to live in an
environment adequate to his or her health and well-being, and the duty […] to protect and
improve the environment for the benefit of present and future generations”. 367 The Paris
Agreement is another prominent example of an IEL instrument in which the relationship
between human rights and environmental protection can be identified. Indeed, it
acknowledges “that climate change is a common concern of humankind” and that “Parties
should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their
respective obligations on human rights”.368 Lastly, in the context of this thesis, it is also
notable that the link can, to a lesser extent, be identified in the CBD, which affirms that
“the conservation of biological diversity is a common concern of humankind”, and
recognises the critical importance of conserving and sustainably using biodiversity for,
inter alia, meeting the food demand of the increasing world population.369 Although the

CBD does not explicitly refer to human rights, the recognition of the importance of
biodiversity to meeting food demand can be interpreted as an implicit reference to food
security, and therefore ultimately to the right to food.
Evidently, as can be concluded from examining IHRL and IEL instruments, human rights
and environmental protection are closely interrelated. Yet, since the conference in
Stockholm in 1972, the exact nature of the relationship between human rights and
environmental protection has been the subject of intense debate.370 Notably, twenty years
after the adoption of the Stockholm Declaration, another declaration was adopted at the
Rio Conference on environment and development.371 As noted by Francioni, the Rio
Declaration “substantially departed from the idea of a link between human rights and
environmental protection”.372 Principle 1 of the Rio Declaration proclaims that “[h]uman
beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development”, adding that “[t]hey are
entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature”.373 Francioni highlights
the absence of human rights language in this wording, criticising the lack of progress in
developing the link between human rights and environmental protection.374 Nevertheless,
several actors have since significantly contributed to elucidating the connection between
human rights and the environment. Key actors and their contributions are highlighted in
the following sub-chapter, in which the evolving jurisprudence on the relationship
between human rights and environmental protection, which has pathed the way towards
the UN formally recognising the human right to a healthy environment, is discussed.

4.1.2. Towards Universal Recognition of the Human Right to a Healthy
Environment
Charter-based UN human rights bodies, such as the UN Human Rights Council (HRC),
produce material that plays an important role in terms of the guidance it provides to
various actors, including States.375 In addition to their resolutions, statements and studies

on the relationship between human rights and the environment, the charter-based human
rights bodies have established so-called special procedures which in turn has enabled the
production of a significant amount of material on the subject.376 The Ksentini report of
1994, mandated by the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection
of Minorities and named after former Special Rapporteur Fatma Zohra Ksentini, is a
prominent example of such a document.377 The Ksentini report is a comprehensive
document elaborating the interconnection of human rights and the environment. It is
described by the OHCHR as “a landmark precedent” that resulted in one main conclusion;
that environmental rights are parts of existing human rights.378 The Special Rapporteur
also highlighted that environmental issues are global and that they not only threaten planet
Earth but “the whole of mankind, as well as future generations”.379 Furthermore, she
emphasised that several international human rights instruments “should be implemented
from an ecological standpoint”.380 Moreover, in the context of this thesis, it is notable that
Ksentini remarked on the crucial importance of a healthy environment to food security
and the right to food.381
The HRC has adopted several resolutions on human rights and the environment.382 In
resolution 16/11 that was adopted in 2011, its first resolution of this kind, the HRC
identifies the following key elements of the relationship between human rights and the
environment:
that sustainable development and the protection of the environment can contribute to human
well-being and the enjoyment of human rights [;]
that environmental damage can have negative implications, both direct and indirect, for the
effective enjoyment of human rights [;]
that, while these implications affect individuals and communities around the world,
environmental damage is felt most acutely by those segments of the population already in
vulnerable situations [;]

that many forms of environmental damage are transnational in character and that effective
international cooperation to address such damage is important in order to support national
efforts for the realization of human rights [; and]
that human rights obligations and commitments have the potential to inform and strengthen
international, regional and national policymaking in the area of environmental protection and
promoting policy coherence, legitimacy and sustainable outcomes[.]383

Pursuant to resolution 16/11, the OHCHR conducted an analytical study on the
relationship between human rights and the environment.384 The “study examines the key
components of the relationship between human rights and the environment”.385 Indeed, it
provides its readers with a concise overview of synergies between the two fields of
international law. In 2012, just a few months after this study was made public, the
mandate for the UN Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating
to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, more commonly
referred to as the Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment, was
created,386 and John H. Knox was appointed. The creation of this mandate clearly
demonstrates the importance of furthering the understanding of and utilising synergies
between human rights and environmental protection.
In resolution 46/7, adopted in early 2021, the HRC reaffirms the importance of protecting
the environment for the enjoyment of, inter alia, the right to adequate food, recognising
that the decline in ecosystem services may ultimately have a negative impact on the
effective enjoyment of all human rights.387 Moreover, the crucial importance of
exercising human rights for the protection of the environment is recognised.388 In the
context of this thesis, it is of particular interest that the HRC stresses the need to “[build]
synergies in the protection of human rights and the protection of the environment”.389

Human rights treaty bodies have also made notable contributions. Specifically, both the
CESCR and the CCPR have recognised the importance of a healthy environment for the
realisation of the human rights under their respective jurisdictions.390 In the context of
realising the right to adequate food, for instance, the CESCR refers to the importance of
adopting appropriate environmental policies.391 In 2018, the CCPR, in turn, clarified in
its General Comment No. 36 on the right to life that pursuant to their obligation to protect
life, States should take appropriate measures to address, inter alia, environmental
degradation, as it may interfere with individuals’ enjoyment of the right.392 Moreover, the
CCPR emphasises that “[e]nvironmental degradation, climate change and unsustainable
development constitute some of the most pressing and serious threats to the ability of
present and future generations to enjoy the right to life”.393
Increasingly, UN human rights bodies are not only acknowledging, but emphasising the
intertwinement of human rights and environmental issues. The existence of an intrinsic
link is echoed by the African, Inter-American and European human rights systems.394 The
Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR), for instance, has recognised that the
link is “undeniable”.395 Gradually, these regional human rights systems have, through
innovative and dynamic interpretation,396 identified a variety of ways in which
environmental issues relate to human rights, thereby clarifying the environmental
dimensions of the rights in question.397 Both the IACtHR and the African Commission
have paid particular attention to the relationship between the environment and indigenous

and tribal peoples’ rights.398 The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has, in turn,
especially focused on the impacts of environmental pollution on human rights.399
Relying on its General Comment No. 36 as well as the jurisprudence of the regional
human right courts, the CCPR made a landmark decision in the 2019 case Portillo
Cáceres v. Paraguay. In said case, for the first time in the CCPR’s jurisprudence it
specifically and unequivocally recognised that a State’s failure to address environmental
harm can constitute a violation of its obligation to protect the right to life under Article 6
of the ICCPR.400 It is anticipated that this decision may contribute to furthering the
recognition of the crucial importance of addressing environmental issues as a key aspect
of human rights protection.401
The evolving jurisprudence on the relationship between human rights and environmental
protection, and the greening of IHRL, has paved the way towards the global recognition
of the human right to a healthy environment. As of 2021, over 155 States recognise a right
to a healthy environment.402 Moreover, evidence demonstrates that the legal recognition
of such a right has helped improve the environment’s health.403 Boyle argues that global
recognition of the right to a healthy environment “would make more explicit the
relationship between the environment, human rights, and sustainable development, and
address the conservation and sustainable use of nature and natural resources”.404
Importantly, however, and as noted by Knox, notwithstanding the clear advantages of
recognising the human right to a healthy environment, explicit recognition of such a
human right is not a precondition for applying human rights to environmental

protection.405 Indeed, this is demonstrated by jurisprudence as discussed above.
Moreover, referring to the right to a healthy environment in the context of environmental
dimensions of human rights “does not change the legal content of obligations that are
based on existing human rights law”, and nor will global recognition of such a human
right.406 Nevertheless, in 2018 the former Special Rapporteur on human rights and the
environment emphasised that the time has come for the UN to formally recognise such a
human right.407
In the autumn of 2020, over 1100 organisations came together to call upon the UN to
formally recognise the human right to a healthy environment.408 Then, in early 2021, a
joint statement, in which governments were invited to support the call for the global
recognition of the right to a healthy environment, was delivered at the 46th session of the
HRC.409 69 States signed the statement, thereby expressing their intent to proceed with
negotiations towards a resolution proclaiming the right to a healthy environment.410 The
following is an extract from the statement:
[t]here is a global consensus on the degradation of the environment and the consequences it
has on human life. We are all reminded by the current pandemic that the dignity, life, and
health of all humans must be both protected and promoted without any discrimination. It is
our belief that a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment is integral to the full
enjoyment of human rights. Therefore the possible recognition of the right at a global level
would have numerous important implications on what we leave to our future generations.

According to Arnold Kreilhuber, Acting Director of UNEP’s Law Division at the time,
the statement “represents an unprecedented level of support for the global recognition of
the right to a healthy environment and a commitment to proceed with the process of
formalising this recognition”.411 During that same HRC session, 15 UN agencies,
including UNEP and the OHCHR, issued a joint statement in which they “declare that the
time for global recognition, implementation, and protection of the human right to a safe,

clean, healthy and sustainable environment is now”.412 Then, on World Environment Day
in June 2021, over fifty UN experts issued a joint statement, “[calling] on States to take
urgent and timely action to recognize and implement the right […] as a vital response to
the current multi-faceted environmental crisis”.413
All the above developments, from the adoption of the Stockholm Declaration almost 50
years ago, to the statements recently signed by organisations, experts and States, paved
the way to the HRC, at its 48th session, formally recognising “the right to a clean, healthy
and sustainable environment as a human right that is important for the enjoyment of
human rights”.414 This milestone resolution, adopted without any opposing vote, means
that the human right to a healthy environment is now unambiguously established at the
global level. Its adoption has been widely applauded, including by the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet,415 and Boyd has emphasised the
“life-changing potential” of this “historic breakthrough”.416 Notably, the resolution
reaffirms, inter alia, the importance of environmental protection to the realisation of the
right to adequate food, as well as the impact of the decline in ecosystem services on the
effective enjoyment of all human rights.417 Moreover, it “[e]ncourages States […] [t]o
[build] synergies between the protection of human rights and the protection of the
environment”, as well as “[t]o adopt policies for the enjoyment of the right to a clean,
healthy and sustainable environment as appropriate, including with respect to biodiversity
and ecosystems”.418
In the context of this thesis, it is notable that healthy and sustainably produced food,
healthy ecosystems and biodiversity, all constitute substantive elements of the right to a
healthy environment.419 According to UNEP, one of the major reasons why a healthy
environment should be a human right is the impact of biodiversity decline on the

adequacy of food.420 Although not a legally binding instrument, it is anticipated that the
historic resolution will catalyse action to address environmental degradation, including
biodiversity decline.421 This is reflected in that the current Special Rapporteur on human
rights and the environment recommends that the GBF explicitly acknowledges the right
of all individuals to a healthy environment, since biodiversity and ecosystems constitute
a key part of such a right.422 Yet, the first draft of the GBF does not do so.423 Another
important benefit of the UN formally recognising this human right is that it may bolster
arguments in lawsuits involving human rights and environmental protection.424
30 years ago, Shelton argued that future international recognition of a human right to a
healthy environment would contribute to resolving the relationship between human rights
and environmental protection in a way that advances both goals. 425 Today, it is clearer
than ever that the recognition of such a human right is a necessary step towards harnessing
the synergies between human rights and environmental protection; both of which are
crucial to a sustainable development, as will be discussed in sub-chapter 4.1.5. At the
time of writing, however, it remains to be seen whether the UN General Assembly, of
which all 193 UN Member States are members, will follow in the footsteps of the HRC
and adopt a similar resolution, thereby achieving universal recognition of the right to a
healthy environment.

4.1.3. Establishing Links and Defusing Tensions
The above analysis illustrates that the synergistic conception of the relationship between
human rights and environmental protection is widespread. Indeed, as phrased by Anton
and Shelton, “the protection of the environment and the promotion of human rights are
increasingly seen by many as intertwined, complementary goals”.426 In the mind of
Christopher Weeramantry, former vice president of the ICJ, the link between human

rights and environmental protection was so obvious already in the 1990’s that he wrote
the following in his separate opinion in the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project case:
[t]he protection of the environment is […] a vital part of contemporary human rights doctrine,
for it is a sine qua non for numerous human rights such as the right to health and the right to
life itself. It is scarcely necessary to elaborate on this, as damage to the environment can
impair and undermine all the human rights spoken of in the Universal Declaration and other
human rights instruments.427

Nevertheless, it should be noted that not all scholars have always encouraged linking the
two issues.428 In 1991, Shelton acknowledged that there are arguments both for and
against establishing a strong link between human rights and environmental protection and
underlined the importance of recognising both synergies and conflicts. She emphasised
that human rights and environmental protection represent “different, but overlapping,
societal values”.429 Furthermore, Shelton recognised that the strength of the link varies
according to the context:
[t]he two fields share a core of common interests and objectives, although obviously not all
human rights violations are necessarily linked to environmental degradation. Likewise,
environmental issues cannot always be addressed effectively within the human rights
framework, and any attempt to force all such issues into a human rights rubric may
fundamentally distort the concept of human rights.430

Although the above was written 30 years ago, the points are still valid. In 2011, Anton
and Shelton noted that some authors have argued that the value systems of human rights
and environmental protection are so incompatible that conflict is a more probable
outcome than mutual reinforcement.431 In their relatively recent book, Dupuy and
Viñuales, too, emphasise that there is not always a strong link between the two issues.432
Moreover, they argue that the relationship between human rights and environmental
protection is not a conflict free one. Pointing to the wording of the Stockholm
Declaration,433 Dupuy and Viñuales emphasise that “[the] synergistic conception has

deeply influenced international practice”.434 This is reflected in that, despite its
comprehensiveness, the OHCHR’s analytical study failed to include any clear references
to potential conflicts between human rights and environmental protection; indeed, all
three of the approaches put forward are synergistic. Recognising and addressing conflicts
between the two areas of international law is necessary if one is to successfully utilise
potential synergies. Dupuy and Viñuales identified three types of tensions that can arise
from the relationship between human rights and environmental protection. These are
tensions between the pillars of sustainable development, tensions between conservation
and the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples, and tensions between environmental
interventionism and human rights.435 Applying a human rights-based approach (HRBA)
to biodiversity conservation has promising potential to defuse such tensions. Therefore,
the added value of employing such an approach is discussed in the following sub-chapter.

4.1.4. Applying a Human Rights-Based Approach to Pollinator Conservation
In its resolution 46/7 on human rights and the environment, the HRC calls upon States to
apply an HRBA to biodiversity conservation and encourages them to take such an
approach into consideration in the GBF.436 It is promising that the first draft of the GBF
lays down that the framework “will be implemented taking a rights-based approach”.437
This sub-chapter examines the added value of applying an HRBA to pollinator
conservation.
The UN Sustainable Development Group defines the HRBA as follows:
a conceptual framework for the process of human development that is normatively based on
international human rights standards and operationally directed to promoting and protecting
human rights. It seeks to analyse inequalities which lie at the heart of development problems
and redress discriminatory practices and unjust distributions of power that impede
development progress and often result in groups of people being left behind. 438

In the context of biodiversity conservation, HRBAs can be described as follows:
[the integration of] rights norms, standards, and principles into policy, planning,
implementation, and outcomes assessment to help ensure that conservation practice respects
rights in all cases, and supports their further realisation where possible. 439

An HRBA can thus be understood as a tool used to harmonise conservation with human
rights, thereby defusing potential conflicts between the environmental and social pillars
of sustainable development.440
For example, the designation of protected areas for biodiversity conservation has left, and
continues to leave,441 many indigenous and tribal peoples displaced, thus violating several
of their fundamental human rights, including the right to food.442 Such action, i.e., the
removal of indigenous and tribal peoples from their traditional lands, is known as
“fortress conservation”.443 The premise for fortress conservation is based on the erroneous
assumption that in order for conservation efforts to succeed, humans cannot live in the
designated areas.444 Applying an HRBA to conserving biodiversity can defuse such
conflicts between biodiversity conservation efforts and the rights of indigenous and tribal
peoples.445
Environmental human rights defenders (EHRDs) constitute another particularly
vulnerable group in the context of biodiversity conservation. EHRDs are defined as
follows:
individuals and groups who, in their personal or professional capacity and in a peaceful
manner, strive to protect and promote human rights relating to the environment, including
water, air, land, flora and fauna.446

Often indigenous or tribal peoples themselves,447 EHRDs are increasingly threatened,
attacked and murdered because of the work they do to protect the environment.448 For
instance, EHRD Homero Gómez González was murdered near the Monarch Butterfly
Biosphere Reserve in Mexico, in January 2020.449 He died because he was trying to
protect the pollinators’ habitat. The employment of an HRBA is of utmost importance
from the perspective of protecting EHRDs and increasingly, various actors are calling for
the placement of EHRDs at the centre of biodiversity conservation.450
In early 2018, Knox presented the Framework Principles on Human Rights and the
Environment to the 37th session of the HRC.451 These sixteen principles summarise the
principal human rights obligations that relate to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy
and sustainable environment.452 In the context of the importance of applying an HRBA
to biodiversity conservation, it is notable that the fourth principle highlights that “States
should provide a safe and enabling environment” for EHRDs.453 The fifteenth principle,
in turn, which is the framework principle that is most firmly based in the CBD,454
reaffirms the importance of States complying “with their obligations to indigenous
peoples and members of traditional communities”.455 According to Morgera, the fifteenth
principle “reflects the cross-fertilization between [IHRL] and international biodiversity
law”.456 Knox’s sixteenth and last principle is also relevant to this discussion; “States

should respect, protect and fulfil human rights in the actions they take to address
environmental challenges and pursue sustainable development”.457
The knowledge and ability of indigenous and tribal peoples is crucial to successful and
cost-efficient biodiversity conservation.458 Notably, this is recognised in the CBD;
indeed, Parties are obligated to:
[…] respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and
local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and
sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application [; and]
[p]rotect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional
cultural practices that are compatible with conservation or sustainable use requirements. 459

The importance of indigenous peoples’ knowledge is also recognised in the Nagoya
Protocol.460 Moreover, “the need for […] the full and effective participation of indigenous
peoples and local communities in the implementation of the framework” is acknowledged
in the first draft of the GBF.461 In the context of defusing tensions between indigenous
peoples’ rights and biodiversity conservation, it is notable that Victoria Tauli-Corpuz,
former UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, indicated to the
IACtHR in the Kaliña and Lokono Peoples v. Suriname case that “[IEL] and [IHRL]
should not be considered separate, but rather interrelated and complementary, bodies of
law”.462

EHRDs, in turn, play a vital role in the promotion and protection of human rights that
depend on biodiversity and other elements of the environment.463 It is therefore
considered crucial that an HRBA is applied, not only from the perspective of safeguarding
the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples as well as those of EHRDS, but also for the
effectual conservation of biodiversity.464 In the context of this thesis, applying an HRBA
to relevant aspects of pollinator conservation is considered necessary to maximise the
potential of pollinator conservation under IEL to support the realisation of the right to
food under IHRL.
Gilbert is among those advocating applying an HRBA to natural resources
management.465 He clarifies the basis of an HRBA to the management of natural
resources as follows:
[a] human rights-based approach to natural resources management is not based on any
specific human rights treaty, or any specific provision, but rather emerges as part of an
enlarged approach to different elements of human rights law scattered across different treaties
and instruments.466

He further provides a proposition for an HRBA to natural resources management.467
According to his proposal, such an approach is comprised of the overarching principles
of the right to self-determination over natural resources and of non-discrimination and
equality, as well as several fundamental, participatory, cultural and environmental rights
and fundamental freedoms.468 In the context of this thesis, it is notable that he lists the
right to food as one of the relevant fundamental rights.469 The sum of relevant provisions
constitutes a strong legal foundation upon which an HRBA to natural resources

464
N.B. The benefits of the HRBA approach to biodiversity conservation are particularly evident in the
context of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which has manifested the interconnectedness between
planetary and human health. In the Amazonia, for instance, the COVID-19 pandemic has both aggravated
the loss of biodiversity and further reduced the protection of indigenous peoples and their human rights,
prompting calls for an HRBA to both facilitate the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent
future pandemics. On this, see Tigre 2021; Gruetzmacher et al. 2021.
465
See Gilbert 2018. N.B. As previously explained, pollinators are biological resources, which in turn
constitute a category of natural resources. Therefore, arguments advocating an HRBA to natural resource
management are applicable in the context of pollinator conservation.

management can be supported.470 The right to self-determination, proclaimed in common
Article 1 of the ICESCR and the ICCPR, lays down that “[a]ll peoples may, for their own
ends, freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources”. 471 This is one of the most
obvious examples of a reference to natural resources in an IHRL provision and it
demonstrates the pertinence of an HRBA to the management of natural resources.472
According to Boyd, “States should apply a rights-based approach to all aspects of
conserving, protecting, restoring, using and benefitting from healthy ecosystems and
biodiversity”.473 Not only does the employment of such an approach clarify States’
obligations, but it, inter alia, “catalyses ambitious action” and “empowers people to
become involved in designing and implementing solutions”.474 In a similar vein, Gilbert
argues that “[t]he contribution of a human rights-based approach to the protection of
natural resources is manifold”.475 In his view, one of the key benefits of employing such
an approach is the facilitation of civil society engagement in natural resources
litigation.476 This clearly demonstrates the added value of utilising IHRL in the context
of pollinator conservation, as does the potential of IHRL to establish links between the
many silos of IEL.477 Indeed, an HRBA can serve as a valuable tool in transcending the
fragmentation of IEL.478 Addressing the fragmentation issue of IEL is, as discussed in
sub-chapter 2.5, crucial to optimising pollinator conservation, thereby increasing its
potential to support the realisation of the right to food.
Boyd and Keene recently wrote that “[i]n addition to being morally and legally required,
human rights-based conservation is the most effective, efficient, and equitable path
forward to safeguarding the planet”.479 In line with their statement, the above analysis
does, indeed, indicate that employing an HRBA is absolutely necessary if we are to
successfully protect biodiversity and thereby safeguard the human rights that are
dependent on it – the right to food included.

Notably, and in relation to the analysis conducted in sub-chapter 4.1.2, the global
recognition and implementation of the human right to a healthy environment “can be a
powerful tool to mainstream biodiversity and embed a rights-based approach across
policies and processes”.480 The employment of an HRBA, in turn, is anticipated to
catalyse the necessary action to protect biodiversity.481 As noted by Boyd, “history
demonstrates […] the powerful role of human rights in sparking transformative societal
changes”.482 It is therefore crucial that the GBF incorporates such an approach.483
Notwithstanding the evident importance of an HRBA in the context of pollinator
conservation and the right to food, the application of such an approach should not be
regarded as an all-encompassing, nor a flawless, solution.484 Juanatey has examined the
potential value of an HRBA as a tool to address environmental issues that negatively
affect the right to food.485 Her research indicates that there are gaps in the approach in
this context.486 In light of her findings, she proposes sustainable development as a
complementary framework to the HRBA.487 Against this background, the added value of
considering the relationship between pollinator conservation and the right to food within
the sustainable development framework is explored in the following sub-chapter.

4.1.5. Employing the Sustainable Development Framework
A joint report published by the OHCHR and UNEP in 2012 highlights that “human rights
and the environment […] both form integral and indivisible parts of sustainable
development”.488 Moreover, it emphasises that “[w]ithout integrating human rights and
environmental protection, sustainable development and the green economy will not
succeed”.489 Recalling the third analytical approach identified by the OHCHR, whereby
human rights and the environment should be integrated under the concept of sustainable

development,490 the added value of considering the relationship between pollinator
conservation and the right to food within the sustainable development framework is
examined in this sub-chapter.
Sustainable development is defined in the influential 1987 Report of the World
Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future (Brundtland
Report) as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs”.491 In 2015, the UN adopted the
seventeen SDGs,492 intended to carry on the momentum generated by their predecessors,
the eight Millennium Development Goals.493 Each SDG is accompanied by both a number
of targets, set to be reached by 2030, and indicators. Four goals considered particularly
relevant in the context of this thesis are:
•

SDG 2: “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote
sustainable agriculture”;

•

SDG 12: “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns”;

•

SDG 15: “Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems,
sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land
degradation and halt biodiversity loss”; and

•

SDG 16: “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development,
provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive
institutions at all levels”.494

All the SDGs “are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of
sustainable development: the economic, social and environmental”.495 As emphasised by
Scharlemann et al.:

because decisions and actions to advance any one SDG will likely affect the achievement of
the others, we need a better understanding of the interactions between SDGs, in particular
trade-offs, synergies and unintended consequences.496

Moreover, harnessing synergies between the SDGs and addressing them concurrently is
likely to be more cost-efficient.497 2030, the year when the SDGs are supposed to be met,
is not that far away. Approaches that consider, and contribute to, multiple SDGs at the
same time are likely to enhance both the effectiveness and efficiency of action taken to
address the goals.498
The question of whether sustainable development is a legal objective has been marked by
considerable ambivalence.499 Referring to the definition of the concept contained in the
Brundtland Report as cited above, Barral argues that “[t]hough symbolic, this definition
remains relatively unhelpful when it comes to providing clues for the legal
characterization of the notion”.500 The concept was brought into the legal sphere by the
adoption of the Rio Declaration in 1992.501 Despite not being legally binding, the
principles contained in the Rio Declaration are, as emphasised by Barral “formulated in
strong legal terms”.502 Following the conference in Rio, the legal status of the concept of
sustainable development has evolved and strengthened. As noted by Juanatey,
international legal scholars have used the concept innovatively, and it is now considered
to have transcended its previous status as a legal norm into its own branch of international
law.503
International sustainable development law (ISDL) is defined as follows:
the body of legal principles, treaties and legislation, and also legal instruments, which govern
the area of intersection between social, economic and environmental law for sustainable
development.504

Together, IEL, IHRL and international economic law are considered to constitute the
three dimensions of ISDL.505 From this perspective, the international law instruments
addressing pollinator conservation (IEL) and the right to food (IHRL) contribute to
addressing the ISDL pillars. One could compare these instruments to a set of tools that,
when utilised in a synergistic way, could contribute to coherently meeting the SDGs. As
argued by Kreilhuber and Kariuki, “[t]he rule of law is […] critical to the achievement of
sustainable development objectives”.506 Robinson emphasises that in order to realise the
SDGs, the environmental rule of law must be strengthened by States, both domestically
and internationally.507 Notably, the global nature of both IEL and IHRL make these legal
arenas well suited to complement and reinforce one another. The added value of ISDL is
that it brings together the three branches of international law, thus providing the
foundation for balance between them.508 As argued by Juanatey, “sustainable
development may work as a factor of convergence, as it provides a framework that
includes both human rights and environmental protection and that considers the needs of
future generations”.509 And, as emphasised by Ituarte-Lima, given the negative impact of,
inter alia, biodiversity loss on the enjoyment of human rights, “[i]t is now more urgent
than ever to act effectively upon the connections between environmental and human
rights law”.510
The added value of considering the relationship between pollinator conservation and the
right to food within the sustainable development framework is clear. The interconnected
nature of environmental protection and human rights necessitates that the issues are
addressed concurrently. As emphasised by the OHCHR and UNEP, sustainable
development’s “three pillars are indivisible and can only progress if all are considered in
a mutually-reinforcing manner”.511 The sustainable development framework, with the
structures created by the SDGs and ISDL, provides coherence and therefore has the
potential to facilitate concurrent action, including from a legal standpoint, towards
multiple goals in a balanced way. Notably, the relationship between the SDGs and the

GBF, when the latter is adopted, is intended to be a mutually reinforcing one,512 and
therefore the added value of both frameworks may be amplified.
Given the need to address sustainable development in an integrated way, minimising
trade-offs and maximising synergies between pollinator conservation and the right to food
would appear to be crucial. Indeed, as highlighted by the Swedish International
Development Cooperation Agency, “[u]nderstanding and acting upon synergies between
biodiversity and human rights can play a key role in the transformations required for
sustainability”.513 In light of the recognised need to harness synergies between pollinator
conservation and the right to food, the potential of pollinator conservation under IEL to
support the realisation of the right to food under IHRL is examined in the following subchapter. Thereafter, in the last sub-chapter of this thesis, the extent to which the right to
food under IHRL can be applied as a legal tool to support pollinator conservation is
analysed.

4.2. Safeguarding Pollinators to Realise Future Generations’ Right to Food

The OHCHR emphasises that “environmental protection must be ensured to protect
human rights and sustain and improve human well-being”.514 This is reflected in the first
framework principle on human rights and the environment, which lays down that “States
should ensure a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment in order to respect,
protect and fulfil human rights”.515 Among other threats to human rights, the loss of
biodiversity is highlighted by the OHCHR as a prominent one.516 Moreover, as noted in
sub-chapter 2.2, it is evident that the full realisation of the right to food is dependent on
biodiversity and ecosystem services.517 Recalling the first analytical approach identified
by the OHCHR, according to which “the environment is a precondition to the enjoyment

of human rights”,518 in this sub-chapter, the potential of pollinator conservation under IEL
to support the realisation of the right to food under IHRL is examined.
In order to illustrate the importance of effectual pollinator conservation to the realisation
of the right to food, it is necessary to analyse the normative content of the right in relation
to pollinators and the pollination services that they provide to our food systems. Thereby,
it is necessary to recall the definitions of the right to adequate food and food security:
the right of every individual, alone or in community with others, to have physical and
economic access at all times to sufficient, adequate and culturally acceptable food that is
produced and consumed sustainably, preserving access to food for future generations.519
[f]ood security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access
to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an
active and healthy life.520

Recalling the analysis in sub-chapter 3.4.1 of this thesis, four elements are encompassed
in the right to adequate food, namely availability, accessibility, adequacy and
sustainability. Food security, in turn, as discussed in sub-chapter 3.4.2, is comprised of
six pillars: availability, access, utilisation, stability, agency and sustainability. When
breaking down the right to adequate food and the concept of food security into these
components, it becomes clear that the contribution of pollinators and the crop pollination
services that they provide is manifold. Moreover, as will be shown, parallels can be drawn
between pollinators and several of the Right to Food Guidelines. As highlighted in POA
2.0, “[p]ollinator-friendly measures have the potential to increase productivity and
sustainability and contribute to the long-term viability and profitability of food production
systems”.521 Notwithstanding the importance of the indirect way in which pollination is
key to ensuring food security and safeguarding the right to food, through it being essential
for the maintenance and promotion of biodiversity,522 which in turn underpins our food
systems,523 the subsequent analysis focuses on the direct ways in which pollination is of

fundamental importance in this context. As will be shown, safeguarding pollinators is
vital to addressing all elements of both the right to adequate food and food security.
Firstly, pollination is vital to the availability of food. As highlighted in the introduction
of this thesis, seventy-five per cent of the world’s most important food crops are to some
extent reliant on pollinators.524 Simply put, it is highly likely that without pollinators food
would not be available to all, because not enough food would be produced. Closely related
to this is the importance of pollination to the accessibility of food. As previously noted,
the accessibility element of food entails both physical and economic accessibility.525 The
same argument used to justify the importance of pollination to the availability of food is
applicable in the context of the physical accessibility of food. As for the economic
accessibility of food, the importance of pollination becomes evident when considering
that animal-mediated crop pollination has been valued at several hundreds of billions of
US dollars.526 In one study, the annual monetary value of a single pollinator was estimated
at 120 US dollars.527 In the absence of pollinators, food prices are likely to rise as a result
of increased food production costs.528 Such a development would entail that less people
could afford nutritious and sufficient food, thus deepening inequalities between the rich
and the poor. Conserving pollinators is therefore crucial from the perspective of ensuring
economic access to food. In the context of the economics of pollination, it is notable that
an estimated 500 billion US dollars is spent annually by governments on subsidies with
potentially adverse effects on biodiversity.529 This is between five and six times the
amount spent on protecting biodiversity.530
Pollination is also key to ensuring the agency dimension of food security. As noted above,
in the absence of pollinators, a plethora of foods will either no longer be possible to
produce, or production will be decrease considerably, and/or the cost of producing them
will rise. Thereby, the capacity of individuals to choose what they eat, what food to

produce themselves and how to produce, process and distribute it will weaken
significantly. These capacities are all essential ingredients of the agency dimension.531
The elements of utilisation and adequacy are also largely dependent on pollination; crops
mediated by pollinators provide micronutrients which are vital to human health.532 As
previously explained, if the decline in pollinators continues, there will be a shift in the
production and thereby consumption of crops; nutrient-poor crops will replace nutrientrich ones. For instance, fewer pollinators means less nutritious foods such as fruits,
vegetables and nuts.533 The effects of this are likely to be felt the most in regions that are
already vulnerable to micronutrient deficiencies.534 Guideline 10 of the Right to Food
Guidelines covers nutrition.535 In the context of the importance of safeguarding
pollinators to ensuring the utilisation and adequacy dimensions, it is particularly notable
that “States should take measures to maintain, adapt or strengthen dietary diversity”, “are
encouraged to take steps […] to prevent […] unbalanced diets”, and “are encouraged to
involve all relevant stakeholders […] to increase the production and consumption of
healthy and nutritious foods, especially those that are rich in micronutrients”.536 In order
for States to fully realise the right to adequate food, it is thus considered essential that
pollinators are safeguarded so as to satisfy the dietary needs of individuals, which the
CESCR clarifies is a core part of food adequacy.537

Pollination, performed by a diversity of pollinators, is crucial to the resilience of global
crop production.538 Thereby, pollination is fundamental to the stability dimension of food
security. Similarly, the sustainability dimension of the right to adequate food and of food
security, implying access to food not only for present, but future generations, is also
highly relevant to this discussion. As previously noted, the Right to Food Guidelines
recognise that protecting ecological sustainability, as well as the carrying capacity of
ecosystems, is key to the realisation of the right to food.539 UNEP recently emphasised
that “food security is threatened by the loss of pollinators”.540 Indeed, the effects of
pollinator decline on food production are already being felt.541 However, as emphasised
by UNEP and the OHCHR, “[b]iodiversity loss […] has severe intergenerational
repercussions for children and for future generations, who will inherit the irreversible
results of environmental degradation”.542 Maintaining biodiversity and protecting
pollinators is key to the transition to sustainable agriculture.543
Notwithstanding the significance of the threat that pollinator decline poses to the food
security of present generations, particularly children,544 it is primarily future generations’
right to adequate food that will be jeopardized if pollinators are not successfully
conserved. Indeed, the degradation of nature poses a major risk to the realisation of
adequate food for future generations.545 Given the mounting evidence of the importance
of pollinators to global food security, it is reasonable to conclude that effectual pollinator
conservation is a prerequisite to future generations’ ability to enjoy the right. Therefore,
it is essential that intergenerational equity is considered in measures to safeguard
pollinators. In the context of advancing the right to food, Hilal Elver, former UN Special
Rapporteur on the right to food, highlights, inter alia, the need to increase the attention

given to future generations and to invest in agroecology.546 Importantly, however, the
needs of future generations should not be used to justify violations of present generations’
right to food.547 In this context it is notable that the first draft of the GBF lays down that
the framework “will be implemented […] recognizing the principle of intergenerational
equity”.548
In the words of Walker, “[t]here can be no more doubting the need for pollinators if
humans are to be fed adequately”.549 This sub-chapter has shown that conserving
pollinators, and thereby maintaining crop pollination services, is, indeed, essential to
safeguarding food security and to the realisation of the right to adequate food, especially
in the context of safeguarding future generations’ ability to enjoy said right. Huang, Tu
and D’Odorico emphasise that “[t]he collapse of plant-pollinator networks is highly
irreversible and therefore addressing the human drivers of pollinator decline is of great
importance to […] ensure food security”.550 In light of the irreversibility of damage in
this context, it is evident that the realisation of future generations’ right to adequate food
depends on precautionary and preventive measures taken by States today to safeguard
pollinators.
Guideline 8D of the Right to Food Guidelines emphasises, inter alia, the following:
States, taking into account the importance of biodiversity […] should consider specific
national policies, legal instruments and supporting mechanisms to prevent the erosion of and
ensure the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources for food and agriculture[.]551

It can be concluded that pollinator conservation through IEL, if and when effectual, has
the potential to directly and significantly support the realisation of the right to adequate
food. If global pollinator conservation efforts are, on the other hand, fruitless, the risk of
food insecurity and jeopardization of future generations’ ability to enjoy the right to
adequate food looms large. As discussed in sub-chapter 2.5, current measures under IEL

to address the decline in pollinators have so far proven to be insufficient in the sense that
pollinators are still in rapid decline.552 However, this does not mean that the potential of
pollinator conservation under IEL to support the realisation of the right to adequate food
should be disregarded. Rather, the insufficiency of IEL in this respect should be addressed
in order to strengthen the impact of it. As noted by Strakos and Sanches:
the historical development of the concept of food security shows how the way forward to end
hunger and malnutrition requires political and legal engagement rather than complicated
technical solutions.553

Notably, applying behaviour-change theories could help close the implementation
gaps.554 Moreover, the GBF has the potential to catalyse the necessary action to address
the lack of implementation. At the same time, the language of IHRL itself can be utilised
to protect components of the environment that are preconditions to the realisation of
human rights. Within IEL, the weakness of enforcement mechanisms to ensure
accountability constitutes a crucial gap in terms of addressing the urgent biodiversity
crisis.555 The framework of IHRL can facilitate ways of holding States and other actors
accountable.556 As emphasised by Boyle, using human rights to protect the environment
“may serve to secure higher standards of environmental quality”.557 Against this
background, in the following sub-chapter, the extent to which the right to adequate food
under IHRL can be used as a legal tool to support pollinator conservation is analysed.

4.3. The Right to Food as a Legal Tool to Support Pollinator Conservation
4.3.1. Future Generations as Rights-Holders?
The ICESCR was adopted prior to the Stockholm Declaration and makes no explicit
reference to the environment.558 However, as previously discussed, progressive
interpretation allows for the recognition of environmental dimensions of the rights

proclaimed in it. Thereby, environmental dimensions of the right to adequate food can be
identified, thus creating the possibility to use the right as a legal basis for environmental
protection. In this sub-chapter, recalling the second analytical approach identified by the
OHCHR, in line with which human rights can be used as tools to protect the environment
and address environmental issues,559 the extent to which the right to adequate food can be
applied as a legal tool to support pollinator conservation is analysed.
Knox emphasises that “the obligations of States to respect human rights, to protect human
rights from interference and to fulfil human rights apply in the environmental context no
less than in any other”.560 Similarly, UNEP and the OHCHR highlight that “failure to take
action to prevent biodiversity and habitat loss” constitutes a violation of States’
obligations to respect, protect and fulfil human rights.561 In the previous sub-chapter, it
was established that failure to safeguard pollinators will primarily jeopardize future
generations’ ability to enjoy the right to adequate food. From a moral perspective, it is
clear that “present generations have a compelling moral obligation” towards future
generations to halt the decline in biodiversity.562 However, looking at the issue from a
legal perspective is, unsurprisingly, not as straightforward.
In this context, the greening of IHRL and the growing body of case law wherein human
rights have been used as legal tools to protect the environment, as discussed in sub-chapter
4.1.2 of this thesis, is notable. However, as emphasised by Pirjatanniemi, these
developments have not considered the rights of future generations.563 Given the
recognition that the decline in pollinators predominantly threatens future generations’
ability to enjoy the right to food, a key question in evaluating the extent to which the right
to food can be applied as a legal tool to support pollinator conservation, is thus whether
future generations, in a strictly legal sense, are considered rights-holders.
According to Brown Weiss, “[i]ntergenerational equity calls for equality among
generations in the sense that each generation is entitled to inherit a robust planet that on
balance is at least as good as that of the previous generations”.564 In 1989, she famously

argued that the moral obligations of present generations to future generations can be
morphed into legally enforceable obligations, emphasising that intergenerational equity
is deeply rooted in international law.565 In line with this argument, provisions in several
IHRL instruments can be interpreted as implicit references to future generations. For
instance, the first sentence of the preamble of the UDHR reads that “recognition of the
inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human
family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world”.566 Notably, the very
same wording is found in the first sentence of the ICESCR’s preamble.567 Brown Weiss
highlights that the wording “of all members of the human family” extends the
proclamation to encompass all generations, including those not yet born.568 Moreover, the
principle of non-discrimination, in Article 2 (2) of the ICESCR,569 can be interpreted as
extending the rights proclaimed in the Covenant to future generations.570 Indeed, as
highlighted by Slobodian, “[i]ntergenerational equity is based on the principle of
nondiscrimination”.571 She argues that future generations are especially vulnerable to
discrimination, as they, literally, lack a voice.572 In accordance with the eleventh
framework principle on human rights and the environment, “States should establish and
maintain substantive environmental standards that are non-discriminatory, nonretrogressive and otherwise respect, protect and fulfil human rights”.573
Another important point to be made when considering whether future generations can be
considered rights-holders is that the division between present and future generations is
not as sharp as one might think.574 Whilst it is true that many of those who will be the
most severely affected by our present (in)actions may not have been born yet, children
are born every day and as soon as a child is born, that human being indisputably possesses
human rights. Future generations may thus be considered as part of a continuum.575

In the specific context of the right to food, and as previously noted, the CESCR has
clarified that the sustainability dimension of the right to adequate food implies the
accessibility of food not only for present, but also future generations.576 Thus, future
generations can be considered rights-holders in relation to the right to food, and States
therefore bear the duty to meet their obligations to future generations. As highlighted by
Lewis, “future generations are theoretically capable of possessing human rights, and […]
the obligations of States under human rights law should be considered to extend to future
impacts”.577 In practice, however, there are several legal barriers to overcome. Indeed,
recognising that future generations possess human rights is one thing; operationalising
their rights within the context of a legal order is another.578

4.3.2. Overcoming Legal Obstacles to Operationalise Future Generations’ Rights
Firstly, as future generations have no voice of their own, the question of who would have
legal standing to be a plaintiff representing them is evident.579 As highlighted by
Pirjatanniemi, “[w]ithout a guardian with legal standing, access to justice remains only a
fiction for future generations”.580 A second issue is that the human rights legal framework,
as emphasised by Lewis, “is not well equipped to facilitate claims for future harm”.581
Indeed, the standard procedure is that first a human rights violation occurs and then a
claim is brought – not the other way around.582 Thirdly, there is the issue of the collective
nature of the rights of future generations.583 IHRL is characterised by a personal-injurybased approach.584 This approach gives rise to the so-called link requirement. As
emphasised by Dupuy and Viñuales:

[t]he scope for environmental protection in all existing rights, as interpreted by their
respective adjudicatory bodies, is conditioned upon the establishment of a “link” between
environmental degradation and the impairment of a protected right.585

Francioni argues that the individualistic approach “is ill-suited to addressing […] the
diffused effects that [environmental] degradation has on society as a whole”.586
According to Dupuy and Viñuales, it is doubtful that there is much room for integrating
the rights of future generations within such an approach.587
Environmental liability litigation as a means of remedying biodiversity loss is, despite its
promising potential, surprisingly uncommon.588 Human rights-based biodiversity
litigation appears to be even rarer. However, in a lawsuit of particular relevance in the
context of this thesis, namely José María Villalta Flórez-Estrada v. Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock, the Supreme Court of Costa Rica ordered the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock to conduct a scientific study on the effects that the use of
neonicotinoid pesticides may have on health, biodiversity and the environment in the
country.589 The court further ruled that if the study found risks of serious damage to
health, biodiversity or the environment, then the ministry must adopt corresponding
measures.590 The ruling of this landmark case was based on the impact of neonicotinoids
on honey bees as evidenced by, inter alia, scientific studies from the EU and the US, and
the serious risk that the decline in honey bees poses to food security.591 It was considered
that this issue, if left unaddressed, may ultimately jeopardize the right to food of Costa
Rican citizens.592 The José María Villalta Flórez-Estrada v. Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock is a promising legal precedent because it shows that the right to food can be
leveraged to compel a State to take concrete action towards safeguarding pollinators.
However, to the best of the present author’s knowledge, the rights of future generations

were not explicitly referred to in this case.593 This is unsurprising; at the time of writing,
the occurrence of plaintiffs taking legal standing for specifically future generations’ rights
within the sphere of human rights-based biodiversity litigation appears to be very
uncommon.
Notably, in the context of applying human rights as legal tools in order to protect the
environment for the sake of future generations, parallels can be drawn to the relatively
recent surge in climate change litigation cases,594 where increasingly, plaintiffs are
applying human rights arguments.595 In such human rights-based climate litigation cases,
plaintiffs have represented the interests of future generations, and in several jurisdictions,
this has resulted in establishment of the existence of obligations to future generations.596
Notwithstanding the extent of the challenges posed by the legal obstacles discussed
above, it would therefore appear that they are surmountable.
It is beyond the scope of this thesis to examine all relevant case law in the context of using
human rights as legal tools to protect the environment for the sake of future generations.
Therefore, acknowledging that there are other important and relevant legal precedents,
the subsequent analysis focuses on the landmark State of the Netherlands v. Urgenda
Foundation (Urgenda) case, which is a prime example of successful application of human
rights as legal tools in order to protect the environment for the sake of future
generations.597 The aim of the subsequent analysis is thus merely to determine whether
applying the right to food as a legal tool to protect pollinators for the sake of future
generations could, in theory, have a successful outcome.
In the Urgenda case, initiated in 2012, the Urgenda Foundation, a non-governmental
organisation, together with 886 formal co-plaintiffs, sued the Dutch government for not
doing enough to live up to its climate commitments, claiming, inter alia, that the

government’s negligence constituted a violation of several human rights of present and
future Dutch citizens.598 After seven years of litigation, the Supreme Court of the
Netherlands ruled in 2019 that the decision of the lower courts could be upheld,
reaffirming that the Dutch State must cut its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to at least
25 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020.599 This case is widely accredited for being a
trailblazer.600 The District Court of The Hague stated the following in its judgment of 24
June 2015:
the possibility of damages for those whose interests Urgenda represents, including current
and future generations of Dutch nationals, is so great and concrete that given its duty of care,
the state must make an adequate contribution, greater than its current contribution, to prevent
hazardous climate change.601

This is evidence that actio popularis claims, i.e., claims “[alleging] general human rights
violations unconnected to any specific victim applicant”,602 in the context of the impact
of environmental degradation on future generations’ human rights can be admissible.
Although largely based on Dutch law, the Urgenda case is also considered relevant from
an international law perspective.603 The judgment clearly establishes that pursuant to their
obligations arising from Articles 2 and 8, on the rights to life and respect for private and
family life, of the European Convention on Human Rights, States Parties have a positive
obligation to take appropriate measures to address climate change.604 It is notable that the
Urgenda case did not concern a specific action of the Dutch government, but rather its
inaction.605 The historic judgment transformed Dutch climate change policy.606 This
clearly demonstrates the potential added value of utilising human rights as legal tools to
protect the environment. Lambrecht and Ituarte-Lima highlight that the case was

“innovative in operationalising legal concepts and principles in a climate change
context”.607
In an online webinar held in March 2021, David R. Boyd, UN Special Rapporteur on the
environment and human rights, and César Rodríguez-Garavito, Faculty Director and
Chair of the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice at the School of Law at New
York University, discussed whether human rights-based biodiversity litigation is
emerging.608 In discussing the success factors behind the historic Urgenda case, they
noted that the combination of IEL (in this case the UNFCCC), IHRL (in this case the
rights to life and respect for private and family life), a strong scientific background (in
this case a report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and the
existence of State commitments to take action (in this case provisions in the Paris
Agreement) constitutes the recipe necessary for successful litigation. Based on this
insight, one could argue that, hypothetically, if plaintiffs in country X were to initiate a
lawsuit claiming that, pursuant to their obligations arising from future generations’ right
to adequate food, State X is not doing enough to protect pollinators, successful claims
could depend on a recipe made up of the following elements:
1. the CBD (IEL element);
2. the right to adequate food (IHRL element);
3. the IPBES609 report on pollinators (strong scientific background element); and
4. provisions in the forthcoming GBF610 (existence of State commitments to take
action element).
The preliminary elements outlined above provide the framework for further analysis of
the potential of leveraging future generations’ right to food to compel a State to do more
to protect pollinators. When comparing the Urgenda case to the hypothetical case as

outlined above, it is notable that the right to life (Urgenda case) and the right to food
(hypothetical case) are, as discussed in sub-chapter 3.2, both fundamental rights,
inherently linked to human dignity. Given the fundamental nature of both these human
rights, coupled with the fact that the right to food is a precondition of the right to life, it
seems reasonable to argue that such a hypothetical lawsuit should not be regarded as any
less urgent than a lawsuit concerning a violation of the right to life itself.
It is interesting to note that the positions of the regional human rights courts regarding
whether actio popularis claims can be considered admissible differ greatly, with the
ECtHR’s position being far more conservative than those of its Inter-American and
African counterparts.611 In the context of examining the possibility of using the right to
food as a tool to protect the environment, it is notable that in the Ogoni case, the African
Commission clearly stated that it was in favour of actio popularis.612 However, despite
the possibility of public interest litigation in some regional human rights courts, it seems
unlikely that plaintiffs taking legal standing on behalf of future generations in these courts
would prevail.613 As argued by Pirjatanniemi, “[t]heir interests are simply too abstract for
the legal regimes to cope with”.614 Notably, however, at the time of writing there is an
unprecedented case pending before the ECtHR. In September 2020, four children and two
young adults from Portugal filed a lawsuit against 33 countries which are considered to
be the major GHG emitters in within Europe, claiming that inadequate GHG emissions
reductions are violating their right to life.615 Much is at stake and the outcome is critical;
if the plaintiffs are successful, the case will set a revolutionary precedent on human rightsbased climate litigation in a regional human rights court. Recalling that future generations
may be considered part of a continuum, this case is highly relevant in the context of future
generations rights; indeed, the principle of intergenerational equity was referred to in the
application.616 The mere fact that the ECtHR has deemed this case admissible is evidence
of how an increasing sense of urgency can change the direction of jurisprudence, and that

such a change in direction, in comparison to the generally slow pace in which
international law is developed, can happen quite quickly.
Notwithstanding the apparent limits and the uncertainty regarding the possible future
positions of the regional human rights courts in this context, the Urgenda case is evidence
that operationalising future generations rights, through actio popularis claims and by
invoking, inter alia, the precautionary principle, is possible. Furthermore, the fact that the
HRC has now formally recognised the human right to a healthy environment is likely to
strengthen any future lawsuits wherein in is argued that failure to prevent environmental
degradation constitutes a violation of a State’s duty to realise the human rights of future
generations. Indeed, as highlighted by Boyd, constitutional recognition of this right has
been used in several cases that, whilst not the primary target of the case, nevertheless
have produced outcomes beneficial to biodiversity.617
As previously noted, given the mounting evidence of the need to safeguard pollinators to
realise the right to adequate food, a broader and stronger application of the precautionary
principle to pollinator conservation is warranted.618 Regarding environmental standards,
Knox clarifies that States should take precautionary measures to protect against harm,
particularly when there are threats of serious or irreversible damage. 619 In the Urgenda
case, the District Court of the Hague found that there was sufficient scientific evidence
of the need to reduce GHG emissions to justify compelling the Netherlands to take
adequate action to prevent irreversible climate change.620 As highlighted in sub-chapter
4.2, in the event of plant-pollinator networks collapsing, the damage is highly
irreversible.621 Moreover, the sufficiency of the scientific evidence of pollinator decline
as well as the severity of the negative impact of such a collapse on food security and
biodiversity has been stressed multiple times in this thesis. In terms of using the right to
food as a legal tool to compel States to adequately address the decline in pollinators, there
is thus little room for doubt that invoking the precautionary principle is warranted.

Pursuant to their obligations arising from the right to adequate food as proclaimed in the
ICESCR, States have a positive obligation to take measures to protect pollinators. Indeed,
as emphasised by UNEP and the OHCHR, “States […] have the duty to take meaningful,
effective and urgent action to […] address the direct drivers of biodiversity loss”.622 The
human rights duties arising from the decline in biodiversity are, as emphasised by Boyd,
“legally enforceable obligations, not policy options or mere aspirations, reflecting
existing commitments pursuant to [IHRL]”.623 Recalling the outcome of the Urgenda
case, hypothetically, if a “right-to-food-based” lawsuit claiming that, on the basis of
intergenerational equity, a State is not doing enough to protect pollinators were to be
initiated, successful litigation may result in a court ordering the State in question to take
adequate and concrete action towards protecting pollinators. Such action could, perhaps,
include taking legal measures to protect pollinator habitats, banning or limiting the use of
pesticides that are harmful to pollinators, or committing to spending more on protecting
pollinators, and less on subsidies that are harmful to them. As affirmed by the CESCR in
its General Comment No. 12, “the right to adequate food […] [requires] the adoption of
appropriate […] environmental […] policies”,624 and as illustrated by the Urgenda case,
a State’s negligence and inaction can be considered a violation of human rights.
It can be concluded that a State’s failure to take adequate action to conserve pollinators
can constitute a violation of their obligations arising from the right to adequate food of
future generations. In theory, then, future generations’ right to food can be used as a legal
tool to support pollinator conservation. The José María Villalta Flórez-Estrada v.
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock case demonstrates that it is possible to use the right
to food as a legal tool to protect pollinators. The extent to which specifically future
generations’ right to food can be used as a legal tool so safeguard pollinators remains
unclear. However, it is promising that legal precedent, as exemplified by the historic
Urgenda case, clearly indicates that in national courts it is possible to successfully use
human rights as legal tools to protect the environment for the sake of future generations.
It remains to be seen whether the regional human rights courts will follow suit.
Nevertheless, the legal precedent set by human rights-based climate litigation, at the very

least, opens the possibility of leveraging future generations’ human rights in biodiversity
litigation. Invoking the principles of precaution and intergenerational equity appears to
be key to successful litigation in the context of taking legal standing for future
generations. Indeed, the former principle is the sine qua non to preserve biodiversity for
future generations.625
A key point to be made when considering the possibility of future human rights-based
biodiversity litigation invoking the principle of intergenerational equity is that IHRL is
flexible. In the words of Pirjatanniemi:
[e]ven the fiercest critics of the international human rights jurisprudence tend to admit that
human rights law has shown incredible ability to adjust itself to new circumstances. This
phenomenon is, in fact, well exemplified by the way that environmental concerns have been
integrated into the body of human rights law.626

Gilbert predicts with confidence “that IHRL will play an increasingly significant role
when it comes to the protection and conservation of biodiversity”.627 Based on the above
analysis, it does not seem far-fetched to anticipate the wider application of human rights
as tools to protect specific components of biodiversity. On the contrary, it seems a
legitimate prognosis, especially given the emerging human rights-based climate litigation
trend, that a surge in human rights-based biodiversity litigation may not be far behind.
Given the potential of human rights to strengthen accountability, such a development
would certainly be warranted, because, as emphasised by Boyd and Keene, “the human
rights of children and future generations depend on the rapid implementation of
transformative biodiversity conservation measures over the next three decades”.
Christmann argues that the decline in pollinators poses such an urgent crisis that it
deserves a similar level of attention as climate change.628 Given the insight that writing
this thesis has given her, the present author aligns herself with this opinion. In the face of
a socio-ecological crisis that, if not adequately addressed, is likely to have far-reaching
and dire consequences for our descendants, innovative legal approaches are needed. The
time to act is now.

5. Conclusions

“In our time, man's capability to transform his surroundings, if used wisely,
can bring to all peoples the benefits of development and the opportunity to
enhance the quality of life. Wrongly or heedlessly applied, the same power
can do incalculable harm to human beings and the human environment.”

The above is an extract from the preambular paragraphs of the Stockholm Declaration.
Whilst written almost fifty years ago, the message it conveys is arguably even more
critical today. The severity of the threats posed by anthropogenic environmental
degradation to human rights has never been more apparent. However, whilst human
activity is the very thing that is driving our planet, and humanity with it, to the point of
destruction, we also have the power to change direction towards a world where humanity
can flourish whilst respecting and conserving nature’s diversity.
Safeguarding pollinators is crucial to both conserving biodiversity and achieving food
security. Recognising this, I have examined the relationship between pollinator
conservation under IEL and the right to adequate food under IHRL. This thesis has
illuminated how pollinators link the two seemingly incompatible goals of food security
and biodiversity conservation. In doing so, this thesis has brought together two branches
of international law that, when considered separately, lack teeth. The analysis has
illustrated that through bringing the two branches of international law together,
identifying synergies and defusing tensions between them, one can construct a
combination of IEL and IHRL that has the potential to bite.
In chapter two, I analysed the extent to which pollinators are protected under IEL. The
analysis, although anchored in science, demonstrated that a broader and stronger
application of the precautionary principle to pollinator conservation is warranted. Indeed,
notwithstanding the uncertainty as to the extent of pollinator decline, there is enough
scientific evidence to suggest that pollinators are declining worldwide and that, if left
unaddressed, this trend is likely to have a significant negative impact on both biodiversity
and food security, on a global scale. Although the CBD is considered the principal IEL
treaty in the context of pollinator conservation, due to the multitude of threats to
pollinators, the relevant legal framework is diverse. Given the importance of safeguarding
86

pollinators, it is considered vital that IEL should adequately cover all threats to
pollinators, and just as important that cooperation and collaboration between the relevant
instruments takes place in order to minimise fragmentation.
Pursuant to their obligations arising from the CBD, States are obligated to protect and
conserve pollinators. Despite all of the CBD’s provisions being legally binding, due to
the lack of enforcement mechanisms the biodiversity regime is plagued by huge
implementation and enforcement gaps. The non-binding IPI and the regional and national
pollinator initiatives, for their part, are considered valuable in the context of promoting
action to safeguard pollinators, but at the time of writing they do not appear to have been
implemented adequately. The deficiencies of both the CBD and the initiatives are
demonstrated by the fact that pollinators are still declining at alarming rates. These
implementation gaps urgently need to be addressed.
The third chapter of this thesis covered the right to food under IHRL. It illustrated that
realisation of the universal right is of critical importance to the enjoyment of other
fundamental human rights, including the right to life itself. The right to food is proclaimed
in several international and regional IHRL treaties. Out of these, the treaty dealing most
comprehensively with the right to food is the ICESCR. Availability, accessibility,
adequacy and sustainability are the four core elements encompassed in the right to food.
These elements are closely intertwined with the six pillars of food security, i.e.,
availability, access, utilisation, stability, agency and sustainability. To ensure food
security, all these pillars must be addressed. The concept of food security is closely related
to, but not synonymous with, the right to food. Accountability is the most important
characteristic that distinguishes the two; whilst the right to food imposes legal obligations
on States, food security does not. Although economic, social and cultural rights have often
been argued non-justiciable, today, such claims are not tenable. Indeed, all levels of
obligations of the right to food have been found to be justiciable.
In chapter four, the sections of IEL and IHRL as analysed in chapters two and three were
brought together. Prior to addressing the two main research questions of this thesis, the
relationship between IEL and IHRL was charted, and critical aspects of the relationship
were examined for the purpose of granting the reader a comprehensive overview of the
many elements that come into play. In the context of minimising trade-offs and

87

maximising synergies between pollinator conservation and the right to food, the global
recognition of the human right to a healthy environment is considered to be a
breakthrough and it will likely bolster any future human rights-based biodiversity
litigation. The employment of an HRBA and the application of the sustainable
development framework are both considered critical to harnessing synergies between
pollinator conservation and the right to food, thereby reconciling biodiversity
conservation with food security.
The potential of pollinator conservation under IEL to support the realisation of the right
to food under IHRL was analysed in sub-chapter 4.2. I illustrated, through breaking down
both the concept of food security and the right to food into the elements discussed in
chapter 3, that without pollinators and the vital pollination services that they provide, the
risk to global food security and the threat to future generations’ right to food would loom
large. Therefore, pollinator conservation under IEL, if and when effectual, has the
potential to directly and significantly support the realisation of the right to food.
Recognising the demonstrated insufficiency of the CBD and the pollinator initiatives to
tackle the rapid decline in pollinators, I suggested turning to IHRL for aid and using the
right to food as a legal tool to support pollinator conservation.
In the last sub-chapter of this thesis, I sought to answer the question of to what extent the
right to food under IHRL can be applied as a legal tool to support pollinator conservation.
Although the analysis was not able to conclude with a definitive answer to this question,
it has shown that the right to food can be leveraged to protect pollinators. Given my
finding that it is primarily future generations’ right to food that will likely be jeopardized
unless pollinators are effectually conserved, an inevitable question in examining the
extent to which the right can be used as a legal tool to protect pollinators was to establish
whether future generations can be considered rights-holders, and if so, whether
operationalising their rights in the context of a legal order was theoretically possible. In
addition to the rather clear-cut moral duty to future generations to conserve pollinators, I
found that human rights obligations to future generations also apply in a legal sense.
However, the extent to which operationalising future generations’ right to food in the
context of the impact of pollinator decline on said right remains unclear. Nevertheless,
the analysis illustrated that, given the legal precedent set by human rights-based climate
change litigation, in theory, “right-to-food-based pollinator litigation” on behalf of future
88

generations could be successful. For this to occur, however, there are several significant
legal obstacles to surmount, and it would be naïve to underestimate the challenges posed
by them. Even so, innovative legal approaches to solve the world’s most complex
environmental issues, including the pollinator crisis, are called for. Utilising the power of
human rights, including through leveraging human rights in environmental litigation, can
bring benefits to both human beings and the planet.
I noted in the introduction to this thesis that the analytical approaches used to analyse the
relationship between human rights and the environment are capable of coexisting. Having
now conducted the analysis, I not only reaffirm that they can coexist, but think that they
should, as they can all bring added value to the complex equation that is the relationship
between pollinator conservation and the right to food. It is through the sum of
complementary approaches that synergies can be harnessed. Indeed, successful
reconciliation of biodiversity conservation with food security will be a tapestry woven by
many threads.
In comparison to climate change, the biodiversity crisis has been given little attention.
This needs to change. 2020 was supposed to be a milestone year for international action
on biodiversity. However, the biodiversity conference plans were, like so many others,
thwarted by the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. And so, the international community
still has significant opportunities ahead to take the necessary steps towards protecting
biodiversity, thereby safeguarding future generations’ right to food. With the Kunming
Declaration now adopted and the adoption of the GBF just around the corner, States and
other stakeholders need to stand ready to turn their ambitious commitments into concrete
action.
The vision of a world without pollinators is abysmal. Time is not on our side, and just as
in the context of the climate emergency, the sheer urgency of the situation should
galvanise humanity into action. The protection of pollinators must be prioritised if
biodiversity conservation is to be reconciled with food security; it is imperative that they
are safeguarded if humans are to live in harmony with nature. This thesis has
demonstrated that utilising the potential power of international law by harnessing
synergies between pollinator conservation under IEL and the right to food under IHRL
can play a vital role in facilitating this. Indeed, considering IEL and IHRL as intertwined

89

and complementary to one another can serve to amplify the positive impact of both areas
of law.
Based on this thesis’ analysis, it seems reasonable to conclude that, from an international
law perspective, it is possible to reconcile biodiversity conservation with food security.
The tools needed to do so are in our hands. We just need to find the creativity, courage
and determination to use them. Given that the pollinator crisis, if not adequately
addressed, may ultimately jeopardize our descendants’ right to life, as it will almost
certainly jeopardize their right to food, we must ask ourselves whether to bee, or not to
bee, for that is the question.
