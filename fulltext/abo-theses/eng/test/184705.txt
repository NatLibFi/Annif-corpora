Title: Understanding the relevant skills for data analytics-related positions:
An empirical study of job advertisements

Supervisor: Asst. Prof. Jozsef Mezei

Abstract:
The shift to the Fourth Industrial Revolution and digitalization had made it challenging
for jobseekers to predict the labor market and meet the expectations of companies. The
thesis studies data-related positions, which are predicted as emerging occupations and for
which demand accrues. Data-related positions experience a lack of common consensus
regarding the definition of professions. Furthermore, the number of data companies is
expected to rise and the shortage of field experts is expected to affect the economy of
companies and the economy as a whole. In addition, data technologies and tools are
rapidly evolving, and the role and the utilization of data in organizations becomes critical
for staying in the market.
Derived from problems, the thesis aims to answer how skill requirements have changed,
what the current skill requirements are, and how skill requirements vary across countries
and across industries. The thesis studies Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer,
Data Consultant, Data Manager, Business Analyst and Business Intelligence positions in
Finland, Denmark and Poland, by web scraping of job advertisements from the
Indeed.com job portal. Furthermore, Quantitative Content Analysis has been applied for
the study, and the Python programming language has been utilized as a tool for the text
analysis.

The findings show that data-related positions have experienced considerable changes in
skill requirements, and emerging and disappearing skills can be predicted. Moreover,
while the top occurring skills across countries are the same, the variations increase with
the decrease of frequencies of skills in advertisements. Finally, the advertisements have
been categorized into Marketing and Financial domains, and the results show that the
most in-demand skills are the same in both domains, whereas for less frequent skills the
variation increases. Furthermore, skills that are relevant to only a particular domain can
be observed. The findings are supposed to contribute to the lessening of a rising skill gap,
to support defining the data-related professions, as well as to assist in up- and re-skilling
for the data-related occupations.

1. Introduction
1.1 Problem Definition

The rapid pace of digitalization brings challenges that need to be addressed. Different
from previous technological shifts in society, the emerging Fourth Industrial Revolution
creates vagueness for students to forecast and to qualify for the labor market (Koh,
2020). As a result, the skill gap has a rising trend caused by the discrepancy in required
and possessed skills by supply and demand sides of the labor market, respectively (Koh,
2020). In other words, employees experience difficulty in finding suitable candidates
who meet their requirements. This thesis will study the mentioned issue from the
perspective of data-related positions. Skill shortage in data-related professions serves as
a potential obstacle to progress in industry of data and to the speedy reception of
innovations that are driven by data (European Commission, 2020). In 2020, in the EU
and the UK there were already almost half million data-related positions for which
employers were not capable of finding suitable candidates, but this number has the
potential to reach over 1 million positions (European Commission, 2020). Therefore,
the emerging issue in the labor market in terms of both hard and soft skills derived by
automation in society creates concerns, and data-related positions are such occupations
that will be investigated in this thesis.
Moreover, the factor that makes the problem specific to the data-related positions is the
non-existence of the approved standards on the definitions of professions (Miller,
2014), and field’s specialists’ reference to their personal interpretations while defining
the professions is a common phenomenon. In his book Developing Analytic Talent:
Becoming a Data Scientist, while describing the data analyst profession, Granville
(2014) mentions that the description is his viewpoint, and he argues about manners in
which others define data-related professions. Moreover, in related academic literature,
such as Granville (2014), authors devote particular sections to differentiating two or
more data-related positions. Therefore, such cases indicate that the differentiation
between these similar positions still needs to be studied, and may be challenging and
uncertain for different stakeholders as it lacks common consensus. Several studies, such
8

as Gardiner et al. (2018), De Mauro et al. (2018), Verma et al. (2019) and Jiang and
Chen (2021), have been published in journals, in which skills for some of the datarelated positions have been analyzed, and the authors of these studies state the nonexistence of a unique definition of these occupations.
By 2025, it is estimated that there will be a transformation in 40% of the main skills of
the employed population, and half of the all employees will encounter the necessity of
re-skilling (World Economic Forum, 2020). Neither statistical estimations nor studies
exist that would indicate the need for up-skilling in future occupations themselves (e.g.
data-related positions). Nevertheless, there is no particular reason to consider future
occupations, including data-related professions, as exceptions within the general trend.
Therefore, changes in the skills requirements in future occupations, such as data-related
positions, remain challenging as well and need to be studied and addressed. For
instance, in the research done on big data skill requirements by Gardiner et al. (2018),
the authors state the need for new research on skill analyses by stating that their
research illustrates only the current picture.

1.2 Motivation

Although a definitive picture of future jobs and skills is unattainable, data from the
labor market depict that data-related positions, such as data scientist and data analyst,
are among the foremost of occupations for which demand accrues (World Economic
Forum, 2020). Based on 2020 statistics, almost 6.6 million of all employees in the
European Union (EU) are data professionals (European Commission, 2020). This is
3.5% of the total workforce, which is an increase from 3% in 2017 (European
Commission, 2020). Currently, this share may not be considered as a significant
proportion of the total number of employees, however, the increasing trend is evident.
For instance, until 2025, the number of data-related professionals is expected to rise
above 7% per year (European Commission, 2020).
Nowadays, the significance of the data field increases even more. Combined with the
digital shift’s effect on the labor market, lockdowns and recessions caused by the
pandemic have expedited significant changes (World Economic Forum, 2021). The
9

changes in automation, life and work styles during the pandemic resulted in rising data
volumes (Sheng et al., 2020), an important factor contributing to the rise of data-related
occupations. Moreover, an increase in the utilization of artificial intelligence in different
factories and departments of companies, as enforced by requirements of pandemicrelated regulations, has been another reason that has caused shifts in the labor market
(McKinsey, 2021).
On the one hand, digitalization together with the Covid-19 pandemic have resulted in a
several hundred percent increase in the number of available online courses and
enrollments (Udemy, 2020, Coursera, 2020), which has generated more opportunities
for learning and acquiring skills. On the other hand, the rise in the number of such
available courses may indicate the rise in available choices for learners, which may
generate information overload. Therefore, learners should be properly informed and be
capable of recognizing their own information and skill needs based on their personal
objectives and career plans. In this regard, as mentioned above, such uncertainties need
to be resolved.
While analyzing data is one of the core tasks in most of the data-related positions,
particularly related to the data analyst position as the name suggests, being able to
analyze data starts to be encompassed in other occupations as well. The data gathered
from job advertisements for nine different occupations in EU countries show that the
“Accessing and Analyzing Digital Data” skill was ranked second, accounting for
around a 30% share across the most required skills in 2020, whereas an average share of
any skill was only 13% (Skills Panorama, 2020). Shares may vary depending on the
country; e.g., the same skill in Finland only appeared in 12% of advertisements, below
the EU average (Skills Panorama, 2020). Although this statistic alone does not depict
any particular pattern regarding data-related positions, a trend may mean that the skill to
analyze data surpasses data-related occupations. In other words, this instance on the
data-analytics skill may refer to the shifts in the skills requirements and job
occupations, as noted above.
On the one hand, the number of data companies has risen in the last few years and
forecasts show that the same trend will continue (European Commission, 2020). On the
other hand, as mentioned above, the skill mismatch and shortage of skilled labor are
expected to rise. However, such mismatches or shortages not only affect individual
10

jobseekers, but also companies by preventing them from efficiently distributing
resources, which results in lower total efficiency (European Investment Bank, 2019). In
other words, the issue indirectly influences the economic performance of companies.
The existence of appropriate skills at the proper time is crucial for being able to
compete in the market, to innovate and attract investments (European Commission,
2016). In addition, companies’ costs that are linked to training and recruitment
operations rise because of a higher turnover of employees. As a result, a high share of
the unemployed population further impacts the economy negatively (European
Investment Bank, 2019).

1.3 Research Questions

Firstly, while the expectation of technical skills from employees is one part of the skills
requirement, nowadays, soft skills constitute another component that companies expect
in their employees, and they need to be addressed as well (Koh, 2020). Therefore, this
thesis will study employers’ current requirements in the labor market for data-related
positions from the perspective of both hard and soft skills.
Secondly, as noted above, specific evidence that in data-related jobs employees will not
need to re- and/or up-skill does not exist. There have already been several studies
conducted, e.g., Gardiner et al. (2018), in which some data-related positions have been
analyzed and the authors claim that there is a need to study these professions in the
future. Consequently, although some of the relevant positions are currently emerging,
the thesis aims to find changes in requirements in the labor market for the positions that
have been studied previously.
Thirdly, digitalization, together with globalization and stimulated by the current
pandemic situation, generates opportunities for remote work and studies. However,
online courses provided in another country may not meet the labor market requirements
of the country in which an individual aims to work, or in contrast, skills gained in the
home country may not fulfill requirements of employers located in another country. To
study this hypothesis, the thesis will examine skill requirements for the data-related
positions from different countries' perspectives. At the same time, statistics show that
11

the share of companies that use big data varies depending on the country (Eurostat,
2021). Therefore, in this thesis, three different countries which have comparatively
higher, lower and average levels within the EU in terms of the number of enterprises
that utilize big data will be studied. On this basis, in descending order, Denmark,
Finland and Poland have been selected for this study (Eurostat, 2021).
Finally, it is known that domain knowledge is one of the crucial skills that a data
professional should possess (Granville, 2014), and one of the requirements recruiters
expect from candidates when filling data-related positions (Verma et al., 2019, Gardiner
et al., 2018). Moreover, statistics show that the level of analyzing big data (i.e., its
utilization) varies depending on the field the enterprises operate in (Eurostat, 2021).
However, scientific knowledge of requirements for the same positions in different
industries does not exist. For instance, even if the requirement to have domain
knowledge in transportation or real estate industries can be possibly found in each
industry’s advertisements, the studies on how skill requirements other than domain
knowledge vary for the same profession in the transportation and real estate field.
To address the above-mentioned four points, the following research questions have
been formulated:
1) What are the most important skills organizations look for when hiring data
professionals?
2) How have the skills required by companies for data-related positions changed in the
last 5-10 years?
3) How do data-related technical and soft skills vary across different countries?
4) How do data-related technical and soft skills vary across different industries?

1.4 Thesis Structure

The initial chapter serves to define the problem and domain specific challenges,
discusses cruciality of the problems that need to be addressed, as well as research
questions that arise from problems and consider previous studies in the field.
12

The following chapter, Chapter 2, presents a role of data in organizations, particularly,
in decision-making; analytics, its different types (i.e. Descriptive, Predictive and
Prescriptive) and its connection with Business Intelligence; practical cases from
industrial applications of data; benefits of and obstacles to shifting to data-driven
decision-making. Moreover, the chapter reviews how different tools and concepts that
relate to data and big data evolve, and presents background information on the previous
studies conducted in the subject.
Chapter 3 discusses the methodology and techniques selected for the study, data
collection and analysis processes, and defined stages for answering each research
question. The next chapter, Chapter 4, presents the result of analysis for each selected
profession. Changes in skill requirements, in-demand skills in the current market,
country specific variations, as well as industry based differences are presented in
Chapter 4.
Chapter 5 discusses the results of analysis, endeavors to present common trends (e.g.,
among positions, countries), interpretations and practical implications of the findings in
regards to data domain and problems in the domain. Moreover, Chapter 5 presents the
limitations of the study and a potential guide for future studies. Finally, Chapter 6,
conclusion chapter, summarizes the research, emphasizes main points and generalizes
findings as answers to research questions.

2. Literature Review
2.1 The role of data in organizations: data driven decision making

As discussed above, the rise in the number of data companies, volume of data, and
especially the accruing demand for data-related positions and data analysis skills in
various other professions generate an essential need for understanding the value and
role of data in organizations. To begin with, within this subject, the term “data-driven”
can often be encountered in different frameworks (Kenett & Redman, 2019). A
company can be considered data-driven if it continuously endeavors to make improved
decisions both by the organizational members and responsible groups at all levels of the
organization (Kenett & Redman, 2019).
Moreover, the organizations, regardless of type, market or industry in which they
operate, as part of their natural activities, select options regarding different processes,
procedures or operations. For instance, such options may be about deciding which
customers or markets to target, which advertisement channels to use, which pricing
strategy to apply or which skills to prioritize in the recruitment process. Considering
that these and other possible activities not listed are the operational basis of the
companies’ businesses, the success of a particular company in a competitive market can
be logically linked to the business decisions. While utilizing available data in decisionmaking does not eliminate uncertainty completely, the use of existing data provides the
capacity to reduce uncertainty (Kenett & Redman, 2019).
Intuition, together with data, are a source for insights which generate an opportunity for
making beneficial decisions and for acting accordingly (Jain et al., 2015). Such an
approach allows companies to allocate their limited resources efficiently (Jain et al.,
2015). Therefore, nowadays, for the most prosperous organizations, it is data-driven
information and knowledge that serve as a source for making decisions rather than
reliance on beliefs, views, sentiments and experience (Marr, 2015). For instance,
different top performing companies in their respective industries, such as LinkedIn or
Procter & Gamble, utilize the same approach (Jain et al., 2015).
If decision science is a one component of using analytics for impact, data science is
another component, claim Jain et al. (2015). Although the appropriate technical skills
14

for analyzing data are crucial, insights gained from data analyses tend to become less
useful without applying the corresponding soft skills. These two components together
enable the results of data analysis to affect organizational success via transforming the
findings into positive action (Jain et al., 2015). Therefore, the accruing demand of data
science positions, as described in the introduction section, can be tied to a rising
demand by companies to the data science component of the analytics for impact.
However, if data scientists possess the appropriate soft skills, then the decision science
component becomes fulfilled too. Indeed, data extraction is only one step, after which
analysis and interpretation of data should be provided for the responsible members,
groups or departments within the organization, while ensuring that outcomes are
coherent and practical by referring to initial specifications of the project (Kudyba,
2014). Moreover, prevalent challenging factors such as excessive usage of technical
language or information’s relevance should be considered in the communications
between the decision makers and data experts (Kudyba, 2014). Therefore, data-driven
decision-making in the organization surpasses technical skills and steps of data analysis
(e.g., mining of data, data cleaning), and encompasses soft skills, intuition, extraction of
useful insights from analyzes and appropriate communication to the decision makers.
Organizations, including different staff of businesses, who are unacquainted with
predictive analysis and modeling are likely to experience challenges in staying in the
market, as claimed by Maisel and Cokins (2014). However, in their book Decision
Support, Analytics, and Business Intelligence, Power and Heavin (2017) state that an
ample number of organizations consolidated computerized decision support both into
organization’s casual operations and for monitoring productivity.
Since the environments in which organizations operate are affected by technological
advancements, the rise of data volume and globalization, and become more challenging,
the need for better decisions rises even more (Power & Heavin, 2017). Addressing the
challenge can contribute to the diminishing of risks in uncertainties (Maheshwari,
2015).

15

2.1.1 Big Data and Business Intelligence

The term “big data” can be defined as to originate and control big data volume, which
are hard or impossible by utilizing the customary database systems (Power & Heavin,
2017, Kenett & Redman, 2019). The concept is generated from the rising volume of
data by every action taken by individuals and organizations (Marr, 2015). Increasing
data volume gives an opportunity for obtaining insights in commerce (Marr, 2015).
Furthermore, in addition to the data volume, big data is frequently defined by its
velocity and variety (Jain et al., 2015, Power & Heavin, 2017). Variety refers to the data
form, the existence of the unstructured data (e.g., movie, picture), whereas velocity
refers to high rate of the streaming or processing (Jain et al., 2015, Power & Heavin,
2017). The strong emphasis should be made not only on the volume of data (Marr,
2015). Instead, a crucial factor is a capacity of analyzing sophisticated data sets, which
was impossible in the past, in particular, analyzing unstructured data (Marr, 2015). In
fact, high volume data may be valueless, if implementation of analytical operations and
other technological advancements (e.g., cloud computing, newer data analytics
methods, software systems) are neglected (Marr, 2015).
Another frequent term utilized in the domain is Business Intelligence (BI). Business
intelligence encompasses procedures ranging from collection of data to accessing data
through user interfaces covering the graph or just reports, including cleaning and
storage of data (Jain et al., 2015). Thereafter, insights that benefit business can be
obtained from BI deliverables (Jain et al., 2015). Moreover, after analytics have been
realized, testing should be performed to achieve the evidence on the causative
relationship (Jain et al., 2015). Although exploitation of big data can be performed for
finding relationships between variables that exist in data, better outcomes can be
achieved by comprehending causative relationships or causation (Kenett & Redman,
2019). Big data is directly concerned with the BI (Kenett & Redman, 2019). Referring
to the definition of big data (i.e., volume, variety, velocity), the storage and
representation of data become challenging within the BI with traditional tools (Kenett &
Redman, 2019).
The decisions that are given within an organization can be split into two categories:
operational, which are commonplace targeting to increase efficiency, and strategic,
16

which affect the course of the organization (Maheshwari, 2015). Firstly, utilization of
BI in strategic decision-making may contribute in both generation of potential
scenarios, by considering various conditions, and ideas from trends or templates for the
decision-makers (Maheshwari, 2015). Secondly, from the perspective of decisionmaking about operations, the automation can be achieved through creation of the
models that analyze the historical data, which as a result endows a higher level of
efficiency (Maheshwari, 2015). Power and Heavin (2017) define tactical decisions as
well, which are less complex than strategic decisions, happen less frequently than
operational decisions and are the responsibility of the middle level management.
Different from strategic decisions, tactical decisions neither require large amounts of
information nor are affected by incomplete information (Power & Heavin, 2017).
Exploitation of big data and BI can be observed in different fields, including cyber
security, financial services, health sector and transportation planning (Power & Heavin,
2017, Maheshwari, 2015 ). However, regardless of the industry or application domain
of mining and analytics, a significant factor for success is defining a problem, which
deserves the opportunity cost of time spent and other expenses (Maheshwari, 2015).

Figure 1. Big Data’s role within the decision support. (Power & Heavin, 2017, p. 60)

17

Power and Heavin (2017) define a subsequent model of decision-making, which is
shown in Figure 1. The roles of big data and BI have been integrated into the model .
Firstly, as Figure 1 describes, data that serve as an input can be both structured and
unstructured, whereas the source of data can be variegated. Secondly, an initial stage of
the model is the Intelligence, to which big data analytics has been consolidated. In the
Analytics step, the above described different steps of BI (e.g., collection of the data,
creation of the visuals, reports) can be applied, which at the end create valuable
information and knowledge. However, decision-makers should be informed about the
problem and needs that are the foundation of the analyses. In the Design stage, the
possible decisions are constructed on the found options, by referring to the previous
stage. Moreover, different Decision Support Systems (DSS), which can be domain
specific modeling, predictive analytics and different related tools, can be utilized both
in the Design stage and in the stage Choice. decision-makers, who have the minimum
role within this model, may be supported by DSS. In general, in all three stages, it is
possible to achieve the application of the decision support (Power & Heavin, 2017).
In other words, new information and knowledge can be created from any types of data
that are collected from different sources. Such information or knowledge enable
obtaining better insights that match with the business objectives and predefined
problems. As a result, the final decision regarding the actions to be taken can be
determined (Power & Heavin, 2017).

2.1.2 Prescriptive and Predictive Analytics

A crucial factor that assists in decision-making and, thereby, in attaining the targets by
organizations is the exploitation of the data analytics within organizations
(Tekinerdogan et al., 2019). Different authors and studies define various categories of
such analytics, such as reporting, prescriptive and predictive analytics (Power &
Heavin, 2017); descriptive, diagnostic, prescriptive and predictive analytics;
prescriptive and predictive analytics (Tekinerdogan et al., 2019, Deshpande et al.,
2019). Although any category of such analytics can be utilized in a way that would
contribute to decision-making, prescriptive and predictive analytics, which will be
discussed in this part, are defined to support decision support systems (Power &
18

Heavin, 2017). The response on what action needs to be taken (i.e. prescriptive) and
what may occur (i.e. predictive) can be provided with the analytics (Tekinerdogan et al.,
2019). Moreover, prescriptive and predictive analytics are less utilized by organizations
than other kinds of analytics (Cao & Duan, 2017). While having BI can be considered
as a reactive state of organizations, organizations should shift to the forward-looking
state of the organization, which is predictive analytics (Minelli et al., 2013). Building
predictive models can be one of the opportunities and reasons for organizations to
utilize big data (Marr, 2015).
As illustrated in Figure 2, descriptive analytics can be considered as initial analytics,
which tries to understand data and patterns. Thereafter, diagnostic analytics can be
deployed, which aims to find the reason for a particular occurance. However, different
from the following stages of the analytics (i.e., predictive, prescriptive), both analytics
depend on and study the previous actions and patterns. Moreover, while both
descriptive and diagnostic analytics have restraints on forecasting the proceedings, the
latter two (i.e., predictive, prescriptive) concentrate on the future (Deshpande et al.,
2019).

Figure 2. Analytics (Deshpande et al., 2019, p. 74)

One of the outcomes of analytics is business intelligence (Power & Heavin, 2017).
Predictive and prescriptive analytics are crucial instruments in generation of the
decision support systems, and such analytics are the main responsibilities of the data
19

scientists (Power & Heavin, 2017). As the name suggests, predictive analytics is
utilized in forecasting of actions or consequences (Power & Heavin, 2017). Firstly,
predictive analytics may be referred to as an advancement of business analytics, which
also requires more sophisticated skills (Jain et al., 2015). In other words, different from
business analytics, which is a more straightforward analysis of historical data,
predictive analytics requires more resources, including time, skills and advanced tools
(Jain et al., 2015). Moreover, in contrast to business analytics, predictive analytics may
recognize the paramount variables that are capable of providing a better outcome for the
business (Jain et al., 2015).
However, predictive analytics not only involve business stakeholders, but also
information technology professionals and managers (Power & Heavin, 2017). More and
more inclusion of predictive analytics in operational decision-making and tasks,
especially in large and medium-size organizations is observable (Power & Heavin,
2017). Regardless of industry, application of predictive analytics may contribute to the
capability of quickly reacting to variations in an organization's internal and external
environment (Power & Heavin, 2017). For instance, predictive analytics has been
applied in a credit lending recommendation, optimization of a supply chain and
marketing recommendations of the companies in the web pages based on the customer’s
behaviour (Kenett & Redman, 2019, Minelli et al., 2013).
Secondly, by acting beyond predictive analytics and by generating an enlarged border
(Deshpande et al., 2019), prescriptive analytics also depicts probable product of a
particular decision (Cao & Duan, 2017). Prescriptive analytics affords providing a
response on how an organization should act (Cao & Duan, 2017). Prescriptive analytics
cultivates datasets with high volume and, as a result, generates recommendations that
can be employed in decision-making (Power & Heavin, 2017). In other words, while
predictive analytics ensures businesses with the forecasting outcome and relies on
descriptive analytics, prescriptive analytics ensures businesses with the deterministic
outcome by relying on both descriptive and predictive analytics (Deshpande et al.,
2019). Nevertheless, organizations may achieve stirring analytics machines or
instruments only by deploying both prescriptive and predictive analytics concurrently
(Deshpande et al., 2019). Prescriptive analytics can be applied to the above given
sample applications of predictive analytics, such as in forecasting behavior, healthcare

20

domains, better offerings to the users (e.g. in services), city traffic, as well as
instantaneous response to the customers (Deshpande et al., 2019).
As described in Figure 3, different organizational regulations and rules, as well as data
that are available for defined objectives, initiate and formulate data aggregation and
suitable format for the further analysis. A process can be realized either manually by
human labor or automatically by softwares. Furthermore, the insights are generated in
the next stage (i.e. descriptive) based on recorded available data. Descriptive stage
arranges the further analysis, which are predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics,
sequentially. Moreover, databases should be renewed permanently by referring to the
decisions generated from prescriptive analytics. While the continuous renew process
ensures that a created model is distinctive and recent, the feedback generated based on
analytics of each stage contributes to achieving the most desired outcomes and
decisions (Deshpande et al., 2019).

2.1.3 Industries

21

Utilization of big data, as well as application of different components and kinds of datadriven decision-making (e.g., business intelligence, descriptive, predictive, prescriptive
analytics), are not limited to one or few industries (Marr, 2015). The usage of big data
can be observed in a variety of domains, such as healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing,
finance or retail (Marr, 2015, Power & Heavin, 2017). However, different businesses
may benefit from big data by utilizing various methods (Marr, 2015, Power & Heavin,
2017). For example, while sales companies strive to possess and utilize big data on their
customers' behavior, manufacturing companies attempt to collect data on production
and use it for optimization of operations (Marr, 2015). In finance, big data is utilized for
detection of fraud, risk management or refining customers’ experience, whereas in
security, it is used to prevent hacker and intentional attacks (Power & Heavin, 2017).
Big data in transportation is used in instantaneous management of traffic planning,
whereas in healthcare, it is used in the prevention of explosion of diseases (Power &
Heavin, 2017).
The usage of data-driven decision-making (e.g., predictive, prescriptive analytics,
business intelligence) can be observed in human resource management, in which data
are collected and are used both from human resource operations and other functions
(Sousa et al., 2019). For instance, in the recruitment process, analytics is used to
analyze video interviews conducted with candidates (Sousa et al., 2019). Predictive and
prescriptive analytics are applied for deciding which positions should be filled in which
location (Sousa et al., 2019). Furthermore, by being one of the most frequent analytics
that is used in human resource function, predictive analytics is applied in employee
turnover forescations; in identifying a most suitable candidate by assessment
automating; in employee engagement by modeling with different variables, such as
absenteeism (Nocker & Sena, 2019). Application of analytics and, in general, datadriven decision-making in human resource management may create an opportunity for
having customized support for each member of an organization and may contribute in
improving an organization’s performance, including the rise of innovations, sales, and
customers’ satisfaction (Nocker & Sena, 2019). However, critical factors (e.g., skills,
data accessibility, precise approach), which will be discussed in the next section, exist
that should be considered for becoming successful in application of analytics (Nocker &
Sena, 2019). Finally, in either industry and technique, ethical frameworks of application
should be considered (Nocker & Sena, 2019).
22

The application of decision support systems and analytical models, including
descriptive and prescriptive analytics, can be observed in the agricultural field as well.
For example, utilization of analytical models for crops, including models objecting
schedule planning, fertilizers planning or determination of crop species or soil moisture
can be noticed. Furthermore, the application can be observed in the meteorological
estimations, climate changes, diseases spread and detection of weeds. Variety of data
sources, including sensors, data generated from drones or satellites, can be exploited.
However, collection of data, and, especially, incorporating different data and variables,
a need for continuous upgrades (i.e. time sensitiveness), lack of skills and infrastructure,
data security and high dimensionality of data are the challenges that are faced in the
application of such analytics and decision-making in agriculture (Tantalaki et al., 2019).

2.1.4 Benefits and Barriers

The role of given decisions in an organization's success in the market, ability to
compete and general performance is not a new phenomenon (Elgendy et al., 2021). To
measure the quality of decision is arduous (Power & Heavin, 2017). Yet, some
performances of companies, such as financial, may indicate the quality of decision
(Power & Heavin, 2017). For example, the research conducted by Cao and Duan (2017)
indicates that successful companies in the market, different from companies that
underperform in the market, succeeded in formulating a stronger data-driven
organizational environment. Moreover, Cao and Duan’s (2017) study depicts that such
successful

companies

exploit

descriptive

and

predictive

analytics

more

comprehensively and are more probable to have business decisions that are data-driven.
The selection of more rational solutions can be achieved by shifting to data-driven
decision-making, which in turn causes better outputs (Elgendy et al., 2021).
Data can be considered as one of the assets organizations have and generate value from,
if organizations have an appropriate strategy, understanding and knowledge of how to
exploit data for the benefit of the organization (Maheshwari, 2015). Having the right
strategy, knowledge and utilization methodology can allow benefiting from existing
opportunities in the market and adjusting to potential threats (Maheshwari, 2015). As a
result, the competitive advantage for the company can be originated (Maheshwari,
23

2015). However, sources of mentioned benefits regarding using data-driven decisionmaking can be generated owing to several specific advantages that are produced, both
directly and indirectly (Power & Heavin, 2017). For instance, data-driven decision
making generates an opportunity for making decisions faster, which increases
productivity of workers, and for better comprehending a business and its environment in
which decisions are made; more opportunities for the communication and cooperation
of decision-makers by distributing the factual informations and analyses; can cause to
the growth of the agility that assists to respond quicker and readily to all kind of
changes and stakeholders, as well as to trust (Power & Heavin, 2017, Maisel & Cokins,
2014).
Moreover, the existence of data-driven decision making gives an opportunity for
removing the barrier of limitation of individuals’ mind in terms of cognitive potential
and incompetence in processing high volume of information (Elgendy et al., 2021). Yet,
considering the high volume of data, which is one of the indicators of big data,
companies need to integrate appropriate technologies, formulate right questions and
objectives, and to define a strategy for being able to generate value and benefit from big
data (Maheshwari, 2015). For instance, investing in data-driven decision-making’s
components profit organizations in achieving higher productivity by reduction in costs
and/or targeting and enlarging the customer base (Power & Heavin, 2017).
Nevertheless, the usage of data-driven decision-making systems may be without any
positive consequence for the business or may even prompt negative consequences
because of inappropriate design and construction of the system (Power & Heavin,
2017). Furthermore, organizations should have appropriate data-driven culture in order
to be able to attain a competitive advantage by utilizing analytics (Power & Heavin,
2017, Maisel & Cokins, 2014).
Managers mostly have information on big data and the perspectives it generates, and are
conscious that an organization is abundant with data, whereas they dispossess a concept
on how to exploit it (Marr, 2015). Therefore, the challenges businesses encounter are
not the absence of data, but incapability to use and to take benefit from data (Marr,
2015). However, Maxwell et al. (2016) suggest that both culture and processes,
including collection of data and their analysis, are crucial for achieving success.
Acquiring and accessing data is one of the obstacles for business intelligence, as it is

24

affected by privacy, security policies, skills for the steps it involves in collection,
existence of appropriate data warehouses, systems and documentation (Williams, 2016).
Sleep et al. (2019) claim that managers should initially construct insights on
organization's actual capabilities, should understand what makes an organization
assimilating and having data-driven decision-making, and measures should be taken
within the organization to accelerate data usage in the organization. The level of usage
of big data and adoption of data-driven decision-making within an organization are
affected by both internal and external environments of organization. Firstly, usage level
is affected by markets a company operates in and industry, which define the size of the
customer base or transactions. From a marketing perspective, if a company operates in a
business-to-consumer market, then it has larger volumes of data that are generated from
high levels of transactions because of their operational nature. However, business-tobusiness companies have less customer base and transactions, and they rely more upon
specialists’ personal knowledge and relationships. Yet, the volume of data that is
generated from the operations affects only likelihood of success rather than serving as a
barrier. Secondly, exploiting data-driven decision-making may generate an advantage
for businesses in competitive markets. However, the degree of competitiveness of the
environment may affect the level of adoption of data-driven decision-making, as in
dynamic environments companies are more in need of obtaining insights on customers
and competitors; making better decisions for staying in the market; innovating or
leading in the market. Meanwhile, internal culture and environment factors should be
considered that contribute to exploitation of data and data-driven decision-making.
Firstly, leaders and senior managers’ role in communication and in reinforcement of the
role of data, technology and data-driven decision-making’s advantages within an
organization should be considered. Secondly, communication and collaboration
between different functions of organizations, which give an opportunity for making data
available and taking benefit of data in different manners, are involved. Furthermore, an
organization's structure and complexity of firm influence data sharing; departmental
cooperation and aims of innovating in the market; having appropriate resources and
expertise in organization; having culture striving for achieving better outcomes rather
than being satisfied with the current situation.
The findings of Maxwell et al. (2016) show that understanding data-driven decisionmaking not only varies in organizations’ level, but also within the frameworks of
25

organizations. Such differences among organization’s members derive from denoting
data and data-driven decision-making within an organization differently rather than
having a unique definition and conception (Maxwell et al., 2016). A challenge should
be addressed by executives and seniors (Maxwell et al., 2016). Nevertheless, together
with the opportunities created and advantages provided by data-driven decision-making,
a successful decision-making also requires creativity, act of trusting in the uncertainty
(Maisel & Cokins, 2014), formulation of ethical framework (Nocker & Sena, 2019),
investment in skills and selection of the compatible and appropriate technological tools
(Sleep et al., 2019).

2.2 Age of big data and AI - evolution from spreadsheets to cloud computing

In the previous section, big data and its role in organizations, in particular in analytics
and decision-making, have been described. Components of big data (i.e. volume,
velocity) indicate need for and availability of machines and arrangements that provide
capability to work with, such as to retain or process, big data (Deshpande & Kumar,
2018). The need arose because of the capacity and working mechanism of traditional
computers, which are able only to operate based on predefined scripts (Deshpande &
Kumar, 2018). Although machines may even have a strong processing power
(Deshpande & Kumar, 2018), they are able to perform algorithms or rules that are
defined by individuals to accomplish specific tasks (Marr, 2019). Therefore, limited
intelligence of machines was serving as a barrier in the complex problems’ solving
(Marr, 2019), and a need for a “thinking” machine, which would be able to respond in
instant, unknown situations and would continuously learn, existed. (Deshpande &
Kumar, 2018).
2.2.1 Artificial Intelligence

The exhibition of smart behavior, and independent self-learning and operating capacity
of machines or computers referred to as AI. In a fundamental model, AI forecasts
results or resolve by utilizing some rules obtained from data. The application of AI can
be observed even in the late 1990s. For example, in the postal services in the United
26

States, AI has forecasted the handwritten characters based on the predefined rules.
However, such application of AI has been considered as limited to the simple tasks, in
which rules were possible to formulate and transform to algorithms. In other words,
current complex application areas of AI, such as face recognition or autonomous
vehicles, would be impossible to realize by the rules and algorithms defined by
individuals. Instead, similar to the human beings’ learning from experience, the
contemporary AI constructs the rules itself (i.e. unsupervised learning) or just with the
assistance of human beings (i.e., semi-supervised, supervised learning) (Marr, 2019).
For instance, visual or textual analysis, and understanding, recognition and reproduction
of machines can be considered as some of achievements in AI application. From the
perspective of businesses, in general, customer insights and interactions, automation of
business operations or processes, and providing customers with products and services
that are more intelligent or smart can be considered as some of the benefits or
opportunities generated by AI (Marr, 2019).
Nonetheless, regardless of the application domain and benefits generated by AI in
different domains and aspects of life, there are two factors that enabled the
developments and applications of AI. Firstly, a factor is the existence of big data with a
high volume of data generated, earlier mainly from the internet and also from the IoT
later on (Deshpande & Kumar, 2018). Big data enables the appearance of technologies,
so does AI (Marr, 2019, Deshpande & Kumar, 2018, Engelen, 2019). Secondly, another
factor is the feature that empowers creation of value from big data, computational
power (Marr, 2019, Deshpande & Kumar, 2018). In other words, collection,
safekeeping, processing or analysis of big data have computation power requirements,
which are met with advancements of technological solutions, such as cloud computing,
distributed computing (Marr, 2019).
2.2.2 IoT

IoT can be defined as a connected network, either wireless or wired, of devices or
elements that possess capacity to be linked to other devices while having chips,
detectors and processors (Chaudhuri, 2018, Engelen, 2019). Such devices can range
from household items to utility grids, from traffic lights to automobiles (Engelen,
2019). The devices’ components enable them to continuously collect data from their
27

own environment or context while also providing a possibility to control the devices
and of conversion of data to information (Chaudhuri, 2018).
However, the components of devices serve only to the first level (e.g. data collection) in
reaching objectives, whereas several more components and levels exist that construct
the whole value of IoT. In a broad level, firstly, connection or communication of the
devices that serve to change data between each other can be provided, e.g. by allocation
to each device a unique internet protocol address (Chaudhuri, 2018). Secondly, with the
objective of the gathered data to be transferred, stored and processed for providing
practical exploitation, cloud and edge computing notions should be elaborated (Xhafa &
Sangaiah, 2020, Chaudhuri, 2018).

2.2.3 Data storage and processing

To recall, velocity and volume are characteristics that big data possess. Therefore, to
store, transform and process big data requires an appropriate infrastructure, including
appropriate hardware and software systems. Without comprehensive proceeding to the
past, in a general level, cloud and cluster computings, and processing stacks are three of
such definitive infrastructure parts, which enable data operations (Kaisler et al., 2019).
In cluster computing, processing of data is realized by a series of linked computers,
which increase computing power. Task is distributed among several machines, and the
parts of clusters or machines are connected with each other via Local Area Network
(LAN). Although the connection mode may mostly cause geographical limitations in
cluster computing, the possibility of scaling the power by increasing or reducing
devices or nodes, in contrast to computer systems with high powers, generates
advantages from cost perspective (Valeev & Kondratyeva, 2021, Kaisler et al., 2019).

2.2.3.1 Cloud Computing

No single definition exists for cloud computing, yet, ranging from individuals to
business use different cloud services and/or applications, e.g., in the storage and share
28

of personal data in Google Drive, customer relationship management of businesses
(Murugesan & Bojanova, 2016, Power & Heavin, 2017). Kaisler et al. (2019, p.5)
define cloud computing as “. . . maturing technology in which an IT user does not have
to physically access, control (operate) or own any computing infrastructure other than,
perhaps, workstations, routers, and switches, and, more recently, mobile client devices”.
In other words, computing resources are supplied when there is need, which can be
defined as information technology resources’ utilization services that are provided to
the organizations or individuals (Cirani et al., 2019).
Cloud services can be provided by a particular organization for any kind of users (e.g.,
governments, individuals), which is referred to as the public cloud, or it can belong,
managed and provided by the organization itself for its own use, which is defined as the
private cloud (Murugesan & Bojanova, 2016). Another type is the hybrid clouds, which
are distributed over publIc cloud and private cloud, and usage of either of them depends
on the application objective (e.g. security concern) (Murugesan & Bojanova, 2016,
Kaisler et al., 2019). Furthermore, Cirani et al. (2019), Kaisler et al. (2019), and
Murugesan and Bojanova (2016) define that there are three primary categories of
service models or cloud services, which are Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), Platformas-a-service (PaaS), Software-as-a-service (SaaS), whereas, in general, a list of more
services (e.g., Database-as-a-service, Security-as-a-service, Testing-as-a-service) can be
defined. For instance, while IaaS supplies resources as a service that enable users to
arrange and execute software or operating systems, PaaS provides the service of
deploying an application in the platform, and to utilize, for instance, the defined
libraries or languages within a platform (Murugesan & Bojanova, 2016). SaaS provides
the opportunity to deploy an application in the cloud, which can be supplied to clients
(Cirani et al., 2019, Murugesan & Bojanova, 2016). In other words, depending on
business objectives and needs, different services or combinations of services can be
provided by cloud computing.
On the one hand, cloud computing has generated several benefits for users. Firstly, as
its initial objective, such computing has made it attainable for organizations and
individuals to access the resources that they may need for reaching individual or
business objectives, but could not be provided because of high costs, and it has
contributed to users’ achieving of economies of scale (Kaisler et al., 2019). Secondly,
since users may need different levels of computation powers at different times, cloud
29

computing benefits users by its scaling capability based on needs, which is also
profitable from an expenses perspective (Murugesan & Bojanova, 2016). Furthermore,
cloud computing provides an opportunity for collaboration, data sharing and analysis,
self-fixing, ever-present access to data and system, supports the usage by broad range of
platforms (e.g., workstation, laptop) and holds immense resources (Murugesan &
Bojanova, 2016). Characteristics and benefits of cloud computing (e.g., economical,
scalable, powerfulness) have been reasons for its implementation in big data analysis
(Cirani et al., 2019).
On the other hand, some limitations of cloud computing can be observed. For instance,
the chance of getting responses in limited speed or slowly (i.e. latency) , security and
privacy concerns, and the requirement of having constant quick access to the network
are limitations that cloud computing still has (Murugesan & Bojanova, 2016). The
limitations have started to serve as barriers for IoT as well. For example, IoT’s
application in different fields frequently requires possession of real-time response for
benefiting from IoT (Cirani et al., 2019). Furthermore, other restraints, such as high
latency, insufficient power, limitation of energy or resources in devices for transmission
of data, need for continuous proper connection to network and security have generated a
need for a solution to overcome these constraints, which has become fog computing
(Cirani et al., 2019, Murugesan & Bojanova, 2016, Qin, 2018).

2.2.3.2 Fog Computing

Above mentioned issues, such as higher overcharge, possible overloads, security and
privacy concerns, intractability of operation and complication of the techniques in cloud
computing have been settled with the emergence and integration of fog computing. The
essence of the concept is the networks’ decentralization, and employing a model that
implicates terminal nodes and deploys their power, which is the distributed computing.
As a result, local clouds exist that are managed, inspected and authorizations are
controlled by utilizers, which resolve the privacy and security challenges. Fog
computing incorporates edge devices (e.g. router), which are distributed throughout the
network and located near the source of data. Furthermore, such edge devices enable
storage of both corresponding software and data, which enable the processing of data
30

locally. Subsequently, such edge devices empower the extensive utilization of Internet
of Things or IoT (Qin, 2018).
All of aforementioned advantages have originated from functions of fog computing and
its service model or general architecture, which are device, fog and cloud layers. For
instance, it allows the operations on data before the transmission of data to the cloud,
such as storage of data or preprocessing of data, while ensuring that such operations and
storage cause low latency and real-time response. Yet, cloud computing can still be
employed for further improvements in the automation or machine learning model, and
then the outcome should be renewed on the local edge level processing of data. In other
words, fog computing is an extension of cloud computing, and the introduction of fog
computing does not impede usage of cloud computing. Instead, the deployment of cloud
benefits IoT by long-term updates on local level data processings and long-term data
storages (Qin, 2018).

2.3 Content analysis of job advertisements

Research conducted by Gardiner et al. (2017) centralizes the same subject area by
analyzing big data related job postings and with the aim of finding skill requirements in
advertisements. In the research, the term “big data” has been utilized to collect data.
Data has been limited to only those advertisements in which “big data” keyword exists
in a title. Furthermore, several big data experts worked on categorizing the terms by pile
sort method to different defined categories. As noted in the research, instead of
traditional pile sort method they used “consensus based pile sort” method, which is
defined as “. . . a collaborative approach that attempts to pool expertise of informants
through implementation of a face-to-face consensus-seeking collaborative protocol,
which places emphasis on sharing knowledge across informants during concept
formation” (Gardiner et al., 2017, p. 380). However, as noted in the introduction chapter
of the thesis, one of the problems in the subject is the existence of subjective
interpretations. Therefore, the usage of pile sorting methodology in the case of study of
Gardiner et al. (2017) means that no guarantee that subjective interpretations have been
circumvented. In other words, utilizing experts' knowledge, even if just in skill
31

categorizing rather than in defining data-related positions, may cause questioning and
impede completely solving a referred problem.
Another similar research is conducted by De Mauro et al. (2018), in which data from
job advertisements have been collected in 2015 and analyzed, aiming to support a
narrowing gap of skill mismatch. Data have been collected by web-scraping from
Dice.com, and limited only to the job advertisements that have a term “big data” either
in their content or in title. The research found business analyst, big data developer, big
data engineer and data scientist as associated occupations in the big data field, owing
both to suggestions of experts and analysis of text. Moreover, as a next step, skills have
been retrieved and categorized into nine main skill categories. Thereafter, each skill
category has been matched to one or more job occupations out of the above mentioned
four occupations.
In the same subject, another research has been conducted by Verma et al. (2019), in
which data and business analytics-related roles have been explored from a required
skills perspective. In total, four related positions have been explored, which are data
scientist and analyst, business intelligence and analyst in advertisements in the United
States. Data, in this research, have been collected by using web scraping from the job
portal Indeed.com. Thereafter, the existence of skills, which belong to the defined skill
category, in collected data has been verified. A study of Aasheim et al. (2015), in which
study programs of various universities have been investigated to determine the content
and skills provided to students of data scientist and analytics field, is a basis for
defining categories and skills in a study of Verma et al. (2019). Apart from finding skill
categories and skills within these categories for each job occupation, comparative
cruciality of each skill category for each occupation has been visualized. Moreover,
another valuable insight gained by confronting similar couple job categories among
them. As a result, data scientist and analyst, and business intelligence and business
analyst professions have been found as being similar.
However, even if the objectives of these studies more or less are the same, neither any
justification behind selection of particular job titles for the studies nor common and
matching conclusions of the studies exist. For example, in the research conducted by De
Mauro et al. (2018), a data analyst position has been found and referred to a job family
category of data scientist. Therefore, the analysis of required skills has been
32

investigated from the data scientist perspective only. However, in the study of Verma et
al. (2019), two out of four investigated professions are data scientist and data analyst. In
other words, different from the study of De Mauro et al. (2018), the two positions have
been analyzed seperetely. Furthermore, in both of the studies business analyst and data
scientist positions have been examined. Taking into account the existence of a two year
gap (i.e., 2015, 2016-2017) between data collection of these two studies and the market
difference from which data have been collected, observing possible changes in skill
requirements can be reasonable. Yet, fundamental matchings can be expected to exist.
Although for the business analyst profession an outcome is almost the same,
considerable differences exist in the studies’ findings for the data scientist profession.
For instance, the study of De Mauro et al. (2018) shows that coding skills are not
required from data scientists, whereas Verma et al.’s (2019) research depicts
programming skills as the most crucial skills for data scientist positions.
The most recent study of the subject has been conducted by Jiang and Chen (2021), in
which authors have a different approach than previous studies. In a study, apart from
finding required skills, with the aim of finding the required skills and determining
whether those skills are satisfactory, authors have analyzed courses, which students
took as a part of the graduate certificate. The research as well has studied the US
market. Data collection can be divided into two parts. For the first, market analysis, part
of study, in total seven occupations have been selected. EDISON Data Science
Framework, which was developed in 2017 as a part of a project that aimed to speed
formation of the profession, has been the only basis for the selection of seven
professions. As a result, data scientist, data science engineer, data science architect, data
science researcher, data analyst, big data analyst and business analyst have been
selected as professions for study, and “Indeed.com” as a source for data. For skills that
have been used in analysis, a list of all skills that are available in LinkedIn has been
generated. In addition, more than one hundred data-related concepts from another
source has been added to the list. Second part is a collection of skills data from courses,
which has been executed manually by authors from almost 250 different graduate
certificate programs. Moreover, labor of authors has been directed to gathering data
from course descriptions based on a collected skill list. The Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tools have been applied to extract skills from collected course data.

33

Research conducted by Jiang and Chen (2021) is different in its approach to the subject,
in which authors also studied skills provided in courses. In general, several factors exist
that Jiang and Chen (2021), different from previous studies, considered and studied,
which provide more insights. Firstly, the existence of a basis for choosing job titles can
be observed in the study of Jiang and Chen (2021). Yet, for this purpose, authors have
referred to the past project (i.e. 2015-2017 years). Secondly, different professions have
been compared with each other with the proper visualizations, which provides insights
on similarities among analyzed occupations. Being informed about relationships among
positions may contribute to lessening of uncertainty while having the desire to shift to a
different job, as noted also by authors. For instance, the same model has been built by
LinkedIn, in which the system compares a selected position with the similar positions
and returns output on skills matches. Yet, some ambiguous skills exist in the research,
which are difficult to comprehend meanings, such as “process” and “tool” keywords.
Moreover, positions such as data scientist, data analyst and business analyst have been
analyzed both by Jiang and Cheng (2021) and in most of the previous research that are
characterized above. Although some skills are unclear, as noted above, comparing other
skills is still possible. For instance, skills such as SQL, Excel, Organization and
Reporting for data analyst positions exist in the studies of both Jiang and Cheng (2021)
and Verma et al. (2019). Secondly, data scientist positions have been analyzed by Jiang
and Cheng (2021), Verma et al. (2019) and De Mauro et al. (2018). The studies of
Verma et al. (2019) and De Mauro et al. (2018) have already been described above for
the data scientist profession, in which noticeable mismatches can be identified.
However, from the perspective of the same occupation, findings of Verma et al. (2019)
and Jiang and Cheng (2021) almost conform. For example, skills such as Python, R,
Statistics, Teamwork and Design can be noticed in both studies. One reason may be the
selection of the data scientist by De Mauro et al. (2018) as a job family that
encompasses four different positions. Lastly, business analyst positions have been
analyzed by Verma et al. (2019) and De Mauro et al. (2018), in which most of the
findings match, and by Jiang and Cheng (2021). For business analyst positions skills
such as Project Management, Team, Analytics, Management and Testing conform with
at least one of the previous studies. Yet, in general, a considerable number of skills exist
that either mismatch or are labeled differently in the studies, which make it difficult to
conclude on a profession. Moreover, an underlying meaning of skills, such as
34

“analytics”, “testing” or “design” keywords, may vary in different studies. Therefore,
although obtaining some concluding observations from these studies, especially for
technical skills, is possible, the scale of outcome and generalization are not at a
satisfactory level that would provide clear insights.

35

3. Methodology
3.1 Methodology Selection

One of the problems that is specific to data-related positions is the non-existence of
approved standards on definition of professions (Miller, 2014). Stakeholders and
authors, such as Granville (2014) who defines the positions in his book Developing
Analytic Talent: Becoming a Data Scientist, reference to their personal interpretations
while describing or defining data-related professions can be observed. Moreover, in the
studies, researchers endeavor to concentrate on differentiating the similar data-related
professions (Granville, 2014). In other words, there exists no common consensus, and
the existence of these problems in the study domain has motivated the decision to avoid
qualitative study techniques, such as interviewing. Different from quantitative studies,
qualitative studies and study techniques research how meaning or sense is framed,
designed and elucidated by individuals (May, 2002). Therefore, exploitation of
qualitative research techniques (e.g., interview, focus groups) could potentially question
the validity of the research and impede generalization of the findings, because of the
possible personal and varying interpretations of interviewees. Consequently, having
more diverse and less data with qualitative methods (e.g. interviews) than other
techniques may limit the possibility of obtaining valid findings in this domain.
Furthermore, the research questions guided the selection of research methodology and
techniques. Firstly, previous studies in the domain, which aimed to define skill
requirements, selected job advertisements and content analysis as a data source and
research method, respectively. This thesis also aims to answer the question as to how
skill requirements change in the labor market, which will be accomplished by
comparing the findings with results of previous studies. Therefore, the same data source
and method (i.e., job advertisements and content analysis) will be implemented with the
aim of making the comparative findings more valid. Secondly, the selected source,
methodology and technique enable answering the question as to how skill requirements
change by country. Finally, since one of the research objectives is to define current
requirements on the demand side of the labor market, and since it is vacancy postings
that represent requirements from candidates, the job advertisements can be considered

36

as a primary source for the job-seekers in resolving whether to become a candidate for
the particular position. Therefore, utilizing a job portal as a data source and content
analysis as a study method may offer higher possibilities for illustrating real market data
and their usage in the analysis.

3.1.1 Content Analysis

The utilization of content analysis can be observed not only in quantitative, but also in
qualitative methods. However, it was initially designated to be performed in a
quantitative way, and currently the quantitative treatment is more diffused (Macnamara,
2018).
Different from the quantitative method of content analysis, qualitative content analysis
studies meanings and engages in interpretations (Macnamara, 2018). In qualitative
content analysis, inductive, deductive or both approaches can be involved in the
technique (Macnamara, 2018). However, White and Marsh (2006) define the inductive
and deductive approach as belonging to qualitative and quantitative content analysis,
respectively. Approaches in qualitative content analysis engage more in interpretations
rather than statistical examinations and may study elements such as attitude, emotions,
metaphors and other contextual factors (Macnamara, 2018).
In quantitative analysis of content, statistical techniques are deployed, and include
calculation of the frequency and proportion, as well as other statistical measures (e.g.,
mean, median) (Macnamara, 2018). However, utilization of a combination of both
quantitative and qualitative content analysis is the mainly supported approach
(Macnamara, 2018, White & Marsh, 2006). Nevertheless, objectives of each approach
in content analysis vary (White & Marsh, 2006). Therefore, the research questions can
be considered as the main factors that define the approach in this study.
Referring to the research questions of this thesis, quantitative content analysis is
selected to be conducted rather than qualitative content analysis, which would
concentrate on illustration of the phenomena that are constantly placed in a specific
environment (White & Marsh, 2006). The generalization of findings and predictions is
the most common goal of quantitative content analysis (White & Marsh, 2006). The
37

research questions of this thesis are uninvolved in the contextual interpretations.
Instead, frequency technique has been utilized, which is a quantitative approach in
which more objectivity is represented, and the findings are intended to be generalized
and to offer replicability (White & Marsh, 2006).

3.2 Data Collection

Chapter 3.2 presente selected source of data, tools, approaches in queries and output
of the data collection process. Figure 4 illustrates the whole data collection process,
including time, tools and technique in each data collection step.

Figure 4. Data Collection Process

38

3.2.1 Data Source

For selecting a job site to conduct data collection, several criteria have been considered
including the need for permission for the data collection via web scraping, the
popularity of the webpage for being able to collect sufficient amounts of data and the
complexity structure of the web. As a result, Indeed.com has been determined to be
suitable and has been selected as a source of data for the study.

3.2.2 Tools and Techniques

Web scraping has been used for data collection. Web scraping entails utilizing a
programming language or a particular software for gathering data from the websites’
single or several pages (Ignatow & Mihalcea, 2018). In this study, the Python
programming language and the Beautiful Soup web scraping library, that can be used to
retrieve data from HTML and XML files, have been selected (Richardson, 2004). The
Beautiful Soup library is less complicated and easy to use, and an efficient way of
collecting data for the projects owing to its contribution in time-saving (Richardson,
2004).
Furthermore, a Python function has been coded for collecting the links of each main
page that include several jobs advertisements, the link of each advertisement and the
whole content that exists in each job post’s link. Common Python libraries have been
utilized, including “numpy”, “pandas” and “time”, and the study specific libraries, such
as “BeautifulSoup” and “Requests”.
The collected data include the description of the job advertisements and titles related to
the study objectives, and the company name, to avoid duplication and possible usage in
answering the research question on industry-level variations of skill requirements.

3.2.3 Selection of Job Titles

39

The data have been collected for eight different positions, i.e. data consultant, data
architect, data manager, data scientist, data engineer, business analyst, business
intelligence analyst, data analyst professions. The titles have been gathered from three
different sources. Firstly, the previous studies conducted in the field have been sources
that are expected to enable answering the research question on the change in the skill
requirements. Secondly, the source is a The Future of Jobs report of the WEF (2020), in
which there are job titles under the data and AI job category. Lastly, the job titles have
been collected from LinkedIn’s (2020) career explorer portal, where professions are
defined based on LinkedIn platform’s users’ profiles and are available for the US
market’s data.
Although the preplanned number of position titles to be used in the data collection and
analysis was larger, including big data analyst, data science engineer or data science
architect, the broad matching to the search queries in Indeed.com and low occurrence of
some job titles compelled decreasing the number of the search titles. For instance,
instead of using both data science architect and data architect, and data science engineer
and data engineer, only data architect and data engineer have been used in the search
query, since the search output of the latter includes the results that would appear by
using the former (e.g., data science engineer). Moreover, the titles that are not directly
related to the data-related positions, such as artificial intelligence specialist that appears
in the mentioned WEF report, and the positions that have insufficient number of job
advertisements, such as data technician that appears in the LinkedIn source, but which
have the search output less than nine job posts in Indeed.com, have been removed from
this study’s titles’ list.

3.2.4 Time, Query and Outcome

The data have been collected three times: in November 2021, which encompassed all
the advertisements that were active in November (e.g., posted a day before, a month
ago), and in December 2021 and January 2022, which have embodied advertisements
that have been posted after the initial running of the web scraper (i.e. data collection).

40

In the initial data collection process, the approach was the presence of the search titles
(e.g, data scientist, data engineer) either in the title or in the content of the job
advertisements. However, the existence of the considerable number of unrelated
professions caused the change of the approach by limiting only to the job
advertisements that hold the name of the professions in their title, as described in Figure
4. For instance, in the initial strategy, for the data scientist query in Poland, since the
query was the term “data scientist” in jobs’ content, the unrelated job advertisements,
such as full-stack software developer or front-end developer, have been collected, and
only 55% of the collected advertisement have held the “data scientist” term in their title.
As a result, 2658 job posts have been collected for the eight different titles and three
countries. The amount of collected data varies both by country and job title. In general,
for job positions the number of the collected job advertisements can be ordered as
Poland, Denmark and Finland in the descending order. The number of job
advertisements collected for each data-related profession per country can be seen in
Table 1.

3.3 Analysis
The analysis stage of the data can be divided into three stages based on their objective
and tools. The initial analysis has been conducted with the objective of defining the
change in the skills requirements, whereas the next stage aims to define the current skill
requirements in the market and country-level variation in skill requirements. Stage 3
aims to define industry-level variations in skill requirements. The whole data analysis
process, including objectives and techniques of each stage, can be seen in Figure 5.

42

Figure 5. Data Analysis Process

3.3.1 Stage 1 - Change in Skill Requirements

As a first step to answer the research question as to how the skill requirements in the
market have changed, a list of the skills from previous studies’ findings has been made.
In total, there are six positions that match with the titles selected in this thesis, i.e.
business analyst, business intelligence, data analyst, data architect, data engineer, data
scientist, professions from the studies conducted by Verma et al. (2019) and Jian and
Cheng (2021).
In the next step, by using skills that are collected from the previous studies as inputs for
the PhraseMatcher function of the Matcher class of Spacy library, the matches within
each job description have been found. However, the existence of a single term or skill in
a job description multiple times has been disregarded as a higher general frequency of a
skill. Instead, the frequency has been calculated in a binary manner: either the term

43

exists in the single job description or not. Furthermore, for ensuring the validity of the
comparison, the collected skill lists have not been changed in any manner, such as by
excluding some terms.

3.3.2 Stage 2 - Current Skill Requirements

The second stage of the analysis aimed at determining the current skill requirements in
each selected country. Since the usage of the skills that are only retrieved from previous
studies may limit the scope of the findings and generate validity concern, the manual
retrieval of the additional skills from the job descriptions has been conducted. In other
words, both the skills from previous studies and skills that have been found by
examining the frequent words have been used in the analysis process.

3.3.2.1 Stage 2.1 - The Manual Frequency Analysis

To describe the process, the description and job title data have been retrieved for each
profession and country. In the following step, the descriptions have been tokenized (i.e.
splitting the whole description into a list of words) followed by the removal of the stop
words in English and in the language of each country (i.e., Finnish, Polish) and
dismissal of the skills that have been collected from previous studies (i.e. used in the
Stage 1).
As the next step, the CountVectorizer class of the Scikit-learn library has been applied,
which has generated a column for each word, defined job descriptions as raws and the
values as frequencies. The same approach has been applied to define frequencies based
on bigrams and trigrams. Yet, for each word or N-gram in the job description,
frequency values have been limited to the unit in case when the word’s occurrence in
the description has been more than one. Finally, the sum of the values in each column
(i.e. word as a column) returns the frequency of a word for the whole dataset.

44

3.3.2.2 Stage 2.2 - Unification of the Skills and Final Frequency

After obtaining the skills via the frequency analysis, the words that are in different
forms, while possibly having the same meaning, have been combined into single skills.
For instance, the words “teams”, “cooperation”, “teamwork”, “collaboration” and
“collaborate” have been replaced with a “team” skill, “leadership” keyword replaces
the “leader”, “leading” and “lead” words, or “artificial intelligence” term is replaced by
“AI”. As a consequence, less duplication and more accurate frequency result per skill
can be obtained. Otherwise, if a keyword “teamwork” in a job description would not
count as an existence of a team skill in that job, or if the frequency of a “teamwork”
keyword in the dataset is low, then it could be missed.
In the next step, the PhraseMatcher function has been used with the retrieved and
thereafter combined skills from the frequency analysis (i.e., Stage 2.1, Stage 2.2) as
inputs. However, if for a job title the skills from previous studies have been skipped (i.e.
titles do not exist in previous studies), then the skills from the previous studies (i.e.
skills of Stage 1) have been used for matching as well. In other words, the skills that are
obtained via the frequency analysis and the skills that are retrieved from previous
studies, but which have been considered informative, have been utilized to produce and
display the final results for each profession and country. The step presented in the
“Skills & Unification of the skills” box of Stage 2 in Figure 5.

3.3.3 Stage 3 - Domain-level Differences

In the final analysis, aiming to answer the research question “How do data-related
technical and soft skills vary across different industries?”, categorization of the job
advertisements based on industry has been implemented. The analysis has been
conducted on a combined dataset of all professions. However, business analyst and BI
analyst positions have been excluded to minimize possible bias, which could be caused
by the difference of belonging of two domains to substantially different job families.
For example, the healthcare industry could mostly consist of data science positions,

45

whereas finance-related advertisements could be mostly in the business analyst job
posts.
Firstly, retrieval from the job description of the bigrams that hold the word “industry”
has been tested. In the process, the possible industries have been collected from the
WEF’s The Future of Jobs report. Afterwards, Gensim-api, which receives a word as an
input and returns words that commonly occur with an inputted word, has been applied.
However, the satisfactory level of frequency for industry-level categorization of the
jobs has been unattainable, except for the financial industry. Secondly, a similar search
has been conducted on the companies’ names, yet, the classification based on the
domain has remained unachievable.
In the third and final trial, the categorization has been conducted on the titles of the
positions. As a result, two domain-related words, “finance” and “marketing”, have been
detected in a comparatively sufficient number of job titles, and a new dataset has been
created for each domain that consists of job advertisements having the respective
domain words in their title (e.g. marketing data analyst, financial data scientist). Finally,
the skills retrieved in Stage 1 and Stage 2 have been applied on the new datasets for the
frequency analysis in the same manner.

Table 2. Changes in skill requirements - Data Scientist
In total 284 job advertisements have been collected for the data scientist profession. As
Table 2 illustrates, the skills such as Python, R, Team, Statistics, Design and Computer
Science have been analyzed for data scientist positions in both selected previous
studies. In particular, Python skill requirement has a rising trend and has dramatically
increased in the last three years, almost doubling from 47% to 88% between 2019 and
2022. Team skill is another increased requirement in the last three years, whereas,
different from Python skill, it had a slight rise and remains constant in the last one-two
years. On the contrary, the frequency of R, Statistics, Design and Computer Science
keywords has decreased both in 2019-2021 and 2021-2022.
On the one hand, Machine Learning, SQL and Analytics keywords have a rising trend
in the last one-two years. On the other hand, the terms such as Technical, Engineering,
Problems, Projects and Models have decreased since 2020 or 2021. Table 2 presents
changes in skill requirements. Shades of green in the tables presents increased
frequency of skills compared to the previous studies and red presents decreased
frequency of skills.

4.1.2 Current Market Requirements

In all three countries, Python, Team and Machine Learning (ML) are the most
appearing skills for data scientist job advertisements with 80%, 72% and 70%
frequency, respectively. Python skill occurs about 40% more in Poland and Denmark
than in Finland, and Team and ML skills exist around 15% less in advertisements of

48

Finland. However, frequencies of the mentioned top three skills are approximately the
same in Poland and Denmark.
Furthermore, SQL and R languages’ frequencies differ across countries, whereas both
of them appear in 45-60% of the advertisements in Poland and Denmark. However,
both SQL and R are less required skills in Finland with 30% and 25% frequency,
respectively. Statistical skill is more required in Poland (45%) than in Denmark (27%),
and least demanded in Finland (19%). Nevertheless, skills that are defined as
Programming, Drive, Artificial Intelligence (AI) are almost the same in all three
countries, which have 45-50%, 40-45% and 31% frequency, respectively.
In addition, Management, Communication, Engineering, Mathematics, Innovative,
Cloud, Research and Tensorflow are the skills that appear in one-third of
advertisements in at least one country. The soft skill Innovative appears the same in
Finland as in Denmark and comparatively more in Finland than Poland, whereas
Management skill has higher frequency in Poland and Denmark. Moreover, in less
frequent skills the variation between countries rises, e.g., Hadoop only exists in Poland
(21%), AWS (around 19%) in Finland and Poland, comparatively higher Leadership
requirement in Denmark (21% against 16-17%),

Communication in Poland 40%,

Finland 31% and Denmark with 20% frequency, or Pytorch appears only in Finland in
one-fourth of the advertisements. Table 3 shows skills, which occur in more than 20%
of advertisements, and their respective frequencies for data scientist positions.

4.2.1 Changes in Requirements

For data analyst positions 397 job advertisements have been collected. Among the skills
that appeared in both of the previous studies, the Team and SQL skills have
considerably increased, that is, from 57% to 80% and from 47% to 57% frequency,
respectively. However, Reporting and Excel skills have a decreasing trend in the last
three years, whereas the Design keyword has remained constant.
Different from the data scientist profession, in data analyst positions, R programming
language’s frequency has doubled to 20% in three years. Moreover, the frequency of
keywords such as Management, Analysis, Analytics and IT have risen from 2020-2021,
as shown in Table 4. Manage, Design and Statistics keywords have remained almost
constant with 21%, 31% and 20% frequency, respectively. However, a considerable
number of skills have decreased in the last few years, such as Leadership has
diminished 7% and it is currently in 10% of advertisements, Communication has
decreased from 48% to 40% frequency, Projects from 62% to 36% or Documentation
has decreased from 20% to 14% frequency.

Table 4. Change in Skill Requirements - Data Analyst

4.2.2 Current Market Requirements

Table 5 shows top market requirements for data analyst positions in Poland, Denmark
and Finland. The Team skill is a most in-demand requirement for data analyst positions
in all three countries with an average 86% frequency. Moreover, SQL is among the top
three required skills, which appears in 54-55% of advertisements in Poland and
Denmark, and in 79% of contents in Finland. Management skill has a 50-60%
frequency across countries and it is the second most required skill in Poland (60%). The
frequency of Drive is 40-60% and it is in the second and fourth position in Denmark
and Finland, respectively. Noticeably, Python programming language requirement,
which is the third most in-demand skill that exists in 65% of advertisements in Finland,
is almost twice more in Finland than in Denmark or Poland.
The Excel hard skill exists in almost half of the advertisements in Poland and among the
top required skills, whereas its frequency in Denmark is 30% and 12% in Finland.
Communication soft skill is equally demanded in Finland and Poland with 44%
frequency, and it is slightly less required, 31%, in Denmark. Moreover, Innovative and
Reporting keywords appear in all countries with close frequencies, and Tableau and
Technical keywords appear approximately in the same proportion of advertisements in
Finland and Poland.
However, as with the data scientist profession, with the decline of frequencies the
variations in countries’ skill requirements rise. For instance, R language exists in 23%
of advertisements in Denmark, 17% in Poland and twice more in Finland, or Power BI
in 44% of contents in Finland, 27% in Denmark and it is missing in Poland. The
diversity and range of the soft skills vary more as well, as presented in Table 5.

4.3 Data Engineer
4.3.1 Previous Researches

Data engineer positions have been studied by Jiang and Cheng (2021) as well, and
within this thesis 539 job advertisements have been collected. Table 6 shows change in
skill requirements for the data engineer profession. The most required skills that Jiang
and Cheng (2021) have found in their study, such as Team, Python, SQL or Cloud, have
an increasing trend. Most of the rising top skills and a Software keyword have increased
slightly, whereas some of them have considerable rise, e.g., Cloud appears in 50% more
contents, SQL exists in 20% more job posts than one or two years ago.
However, skills that comparatively less appeared in the previous research have declined
in the last one-two years. For example, Computer Science and Systems keywords exist
in twice less job advertisements, or keywords such as Engineering, Engineer, Technical,
Design and ETL have a considerable decline in frequencies.

Table 6. Change in Skill Requirements - Data Engineer

4.3.2 Current Market Requirements

Current skill requirements for data engineer positions are presented in Table 7. The
Team skill is the most required skill in all three countries for data engineer position, and
particularly higher in Denmark, with 95%, and in Poland, with 76% frequency.
Furthermore, Python, SQL skills and Cloud keyword appear in top four skills, which
have comparatively higher frequencies in Poland, followed by Denmark and Finland.
Cloud technologies, such as AWS or Azure that exist in around 30-40% of job
advertisements, are also among the top appearing skills. Communication is another skill
that exists in all countries with frequencies ranging between 20-30%.
However, differently from Finland, Technical and Engineering keywords have higher
occurrences in Poland and Denmark. Another difference is Spark, which is present in
41% of advertisements in Poland, 20% in Finland and 18% in Denmark. Noticeably,
variation between countries exists in the bottom appearing skills, such as Management

56

skill and Innovative keyword appear twice more in Poland and Denmark than in
Finland, or the frequency of the hard skills, including Java or Hadoop, varies as well.

Table 7. Current Market Requirements - Data Engineer
4.4 Data Architect
4.4.1 Previous Researches

In total, 142 job advertisements have been collected for a data architect position, which
is the lowest second based on the number of appeared job posts. Similar to data
engineer positions, top appearing skills have a rising trend for the data architect
profession as well, whereas the number of such skills is relatively low. For instance,
Team, Cloud skills, IT, Architecture, Technology and Services keywords’ frequency
has increased. Particularly, the term Cloud has risen almost 50% and it has appeared in
61% of advertisements.
However, a considerable number of skills exist that have a decreasing demand, such as
SQL has decreased by 5%, Python has decreased around two times, Computer Science
has diminished more than twice, Engineering keyword’s appearance was 58% while it
is currently 37%. SQL and, in particular, Python skills that have increased in other
positions (e.g. data engineer, data scientist) have become less required skills for the data
architect position from 2020-2021, as illustrated in Table 8.

Table 9 shows current market requirements for the data architect profession. Different
from statistics of the previous positions, Team skill appears less, in around half of the
advertisements, in Finland, whereas it is a most required skill with the substantial
frequencies in Poland and Denmark. However, several terms, including Technical and
Design, exist in at least half of the advertisements in all three countries. Computer
Science has less frequency in Poland and Denmark, which is missed in job posts of
Finland.
In Finland, Cloud and Azure cloud computing platform are the most required skills,
which appear in two-third of job contents, while in Poland and Denmark they are
among most frequently observed skills that follow soft skills, such as Team and
Management. SQL skill has a frequency between 40-50%, with the lowest counts in
Denmark. Yet, in Poland and Finland, except for the data scientist position in Finland,
SQL appears in more advertisements for previously presented positions than for data
architect.
Azure skill is relatively less required in Poland and Denmark, with 40% and 48%
frequency respectively, than in Finland. However, Python, which is missed in
advertisements of Finland, appears more in jobs’ content of Poland with 38% frequency
than Denmark with 24% frequency. AWS is twice more demanded in Finland (47%)
than in Poland. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence exist in around 33% of job
advertisements in Finland and Denmark, which is almost twice more than in Poland.
Generally, with the lower frequency the variation between countries rises.

Table 9. Current Market Requirements - Data Architect
4.5 Business Analyst
4.5.1 Previous Researches

Most of the collected data, 661 job advertisements, belong to the business analyst
profession. Team skill, Design and Documentation keywords have been analyzed both
by Verma et al. (2019) and Jiang and Chen (2021) for business analyst positions. While
Team skill has risen from 64% to 84% between 20199 and 2021-2022 years, Design
and Documentation terms had a decreasing trend between 20199 and 2021, and 20212022 years.
As presented in Table 10, other terms have mostly a decreasing trend, either since 20202021 or 2019. For instance, one of the rising skills is Management that appears in 10%
more advertisements than one or two years ago. However, skills such as
Communication, Interpersonal, SQL or Reporting have decreased. Particularly, the soft
skill Leadership has declined in a considerable frequency, from 28% to 9%, which is
one of the less frequent skills in a list.

Table 10. Change in Skill Requirements - Business Analyst

4.5.2 Current Market Requirements

In all three countries, soft skills, including Team, Management, Communication and
Drive, are the most required skills for business analyst positions. Yet, these skills in
Finland’s job posts have relatively less frequency except Communication with 41%
frequency that is higher than in Denmark 36%, whereas most of the mentioned soft
skills are most demanded in Poland.
Noticeably, Technical keyword in all countries and Engineering in Finland have more
than a 20% frequency, and, in particular, Technical keyword has a high frequency in
Poland, which exists in almost half of the advertisements. As Table 11 shows, different
from previously presented professions, technical skills have a lower appearance in all
countries. For example, Python and Tableau have less than 10% frequency in vacancy
requirements, SAP around 10%, Power BI less than 20% with the highest in Finland
(18%). Comparatively higher frequent hard skills are Excel, which appears in
approximately one-in-four job advertisements, and SQL in Poland and Finland with the
27% and 21% frequency, respectively.

Business intelligence is the second most appearing title during data collection, and 398
job advertisements have been collected. In business intelligence positions, all hard and
soft skills that have been previously analyzed by Verma et al. (2019) have decreased,
except R programming language, for which frequency has risen by 4%, to 11%. Table
12 presents changes in skill requirements for business intelligence positions.
Particularly, Design, Communication, Reporting, Data Warehouse and Leadership have
decreased around two times, Excel skill is required almost three times less (20%),
Manage, Statistics and Implementation keywords four times and Problem-solving above
six times less frequent. SQL and Team skills, which have a rising trend in most of the
professions, have decreased as well for the business intelligence positions.

4.6.2 Current Market Requirements

SQL, Power BI and Team skills are the most demanded skills in the labor market for the
business intelligence positions in all three countries, as presented in Table 13. In
particular, SQL in Poland and Team in Denmark exist in around 80% of advertisements.
SQL appears in one-in-two vacancies in Finland and Denmark, Team in half of the

67

contents in Finland and Poland, and Power BI has 40%, 50% and 60% frequency in
Finland, Poland and Denmark, respectively. Moreover, Azure appears in 22-28% of job
advertisements, and Management skill exists in around one-third of the job
advertisements in almost each country.
Tableau and Python skills are more required in Finland and Poland than in Denmark,
whereas Excel is in a relatively higher demand in Denmark (23%) than in Poland (20%)
and missed in the requirements in Finland. ETL’s frequency is more than twice in the
advertisements of Poland than Finland, whereas in Finland AWS is relatively more
required for business intelligence positions than in Poland or Denmark. Advertisements
in Denmark have Power BI and Excel more common in their descriptions while having
less Python and R programming languages than in Finland and Poland. Yet, the
occurrence of the R programming language is less than 15% in all countries, as shown
in Table 13.

Table 13. Current Market Requirements - Business Intelligence

4.7 Data Consultant
Data consultant is one of the positions that has not been analyzed in previously
mentioned two studies. Yet, 86 job advertisements have been collected for data
consultant positions. Team keyword, which exists in three-in-four advertisements in
Finland and Poland, and in almost all job posts in Denmark, is one of the most frequent
skills for a data consultant position. Yet, in Finland the term Independently occurs in
one out of two vacancy advertisements, as can be seen in Table 14.
Moreover, Management in Poland and Finland, and Passionate in Finland appear in half
of the job advertisements. SQL has a frequency ranging between 37-42% and Cloud
ranging between 35-52% frequency across countries. Similar to the business

69

intelligence profession, AWS exists in more job posts in Finland than in Denmark or
Poland, whereas it is more required for data consultant positions in Finland with 50%
frequency. However, different from Finland, Innovative appears in more than 40% of
jobs’ content in Poland and Denmark.
On the one hand, programming languages, including Python, R and Java, are more
demanded in Poland and have been missing from the content of advertisements in
Finland and Denmark. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence appears only in
Denmark with the 27% frequency, and Machine Learning is highest in Finland with
38% frequency.

4.8 Data Manager

Another position that has neither been analyzed by Verma et al. (2019) nor by Chian
and Cheng (2021) is a data manager, for which 149 job posts have been collected. As

71

Table 15 shows, soft skills, such as Team and Management, are highest in-demand
skills in all three countries with the frequencies ranging from 70% to 96%.
Communication and Drive are the other most demanded soft skills in Poland and
Denmark, whereas demanding Leadership skill is more common in Finland. In all
countries, in approximately one-third of the vacancies a term Technical appears.
Demand for a Leadership skill is almost equal in all countries, which has around a 4050% frequency, whereas the term Drive appears twice more frequently in Denmark or
Poland than in Finland. Among hard skills, C is four times more required in Finland
(23%) than in Poland or Denmark, whereas R programming language is relatively more
demanded in Poland (14%) than in Finland (7%) or Denmark (4%).
However, generally, the top ten demanded skills and appeared keywords are related to
the soft skills rather than hard skills. For instance, some of the common hard skills of
the other positions, such as SQL and Python that have 10-25% and 8-15% frequency,
respectively, or Cloud term that has around 15% frequency, are less frequent for data
manager positions. Table 15 presents most frequent skills for data manager positions.

Table 15. Current Market Requirements - Data Manager

4.9 Industrial-level Differences in Skill Requirements
The categorization of data-related positions into two different fields, based on their
titles, has been succeeded. As a result, 34 and 27 advertisements have been classified as
belonging to the financial and marketing domains, respectively. In two different domain
levels, frequency of skills, particularly, hard skills, including SQL, Python, R, Tableau
and Power BI, are almost equal. Yet, terms and skills can be observed, such as SAP,
Data Warehouse, Computer Science and Programming, that are 10%-20% more
demanded in the financial domain. In contrast, skills such as Excel, Machine Learning
and Cloud are 10-20% more frequent in the marketing field.
On the one hand, Technical and Computer Science keywords are more common in the
financial domain. On the other hand, IT and Engineering terms are more frequent in the
marketing field. Moreover, can be observed skills and terms that are domain specific,
e.g. Google Analytics in the marketing domain has 26% frequency, which is completely
missed in the financial field.
In terms of soft skills, the variations are comparatively higher. For instance,
Management appears in 65% of the contents in finance-related positions while it exists
in less than 20% of marketing-related advertisements, or a term Innovate is three times
more frequent in the financial domain, which appears in one-third of the
advertisements. Table 16 presents the most common skills for data-related positions in
each domain.

5. Discussion

The problems in the domain are a rising skill gap, need for re- and up-skilling, and the
non-existence of common consensus for different data-related positions and the
differentiations between the positions. As a result, research questions have been
formulated owing to the existing problems.
Firstly, one of the research questions aims to answer how the skill requirements have
changed in the labor market for data-related positions. The results show that either since
2020-2021 or 2018-2019 there have been significant changes in the requirements for
various skills in professions. Although for different positions shifts in the requirements
may vary for different skills, some skill trends exist that are observed in most or all
positions, which have previously been studied with those skills.
On the one hand, there are skills that have a decreasing trend in most or all positions.
For instance, Excel skill that has previously been studied for the data analyst and
business intelligence professions has a diminishing trend in both positions.
Communication and Leadership skills have been analyzed for data analyst, business
intelligence and business analyst positions and have a decreasing trend in each position.
Statistics skill has been previously included in data scientist, data analyst and business
intelligence positions, and the result of current studies shows that in each profession the
demand for it has declined.
On the other hand, some skills have a rising tendency in all or most of the positions. For
example, Management has increased in both data analyst and business analyst positions,
or Team has decreased only in the business intelligence profession. The Cloud keyword
has been studied for data engineer and data architect positions, and in both of them the
frequency increases, which can be possibly tied to the rise of big data and cloud
computing, as discussed earlier in the Literature Review chapter.
Yet, skills can be observed that are missing common trends in all positions, especially
programming languages. Demand for Python has a rising course in data scientist and
data engineer professions, whereas it declines for data architect positions. The
frequency of R programming language rises for the data analyst and business
intelligence professions while decreases for the data scientist positions. In half of the

75

positions, which are data scientist, data engineer and data analyst professions, SQL is
more required than before, whereas for the data architect, business analyst and business
intelligence professions demand is in a decline.
Noticeably, the Computer Science, Engineering and Technical keywords’ occurrence
has decreased in all positions, in which the keywords have been previously analyzed.
The trend may be interpreted as a lessening emphasis on technical and engineering
background during the recruitment for data-related positions, which in turn may
generate an opportunity for the labor force to shift from declining occupations to
emerging occupations, as discussed in the Introduction chapter.
Nevertheless, the analysis of changes in skill requirements has been performed only by
encompassing the skills that have been selected in the previous studies for each
occupation. Some skills might be skipped, which may impede the full picture. In other
words, the findings about changes in requirements may be influenced by the choices of
authors of the previous studies rather than by the non-existence of skills in the jobs’
content at the time.
Secondly, another research question aims to determine current skill requirements in
labor markets. Therefore, additional analyses have been conducted to retrieve the skills
that have been uninvolved in the previous studies. Based on the findings of the initial
thesis question (i.e. change in skill requirements), fuzzy predictions about disappearing
skills can be made. For example, SPSS, SAS, Microsoft Office or Microsoft Word have
relatively low frequency in the previous studies and the frequencies continue to
decrease for all positions. However, predicting emerging skills, similar to the
intractability for students to predict the labor market problem of the domain, remains
challenging. Moreover, trustworthiness of predictions may be questioned due to the
uncertainty of the reason for the skills’ non-inclusion in the previous studies, which can
either be the choice of authors or the lack of skills or their unpopularity. Although
Verma et al. (2019) provide a list of all applied skills in the analysis, the authors present
the most frequently occuring skills only by category, making it impossible to derive the
frequency of a particular skill from a skill category when needed for comparison
purposes.
Nonetheless, different from previous studies, the keywords Cloud, AI, Mathematics and
Deep Learning appear in data scientist jobs, and R and Python in business analyst and
76

business intelligence professions. Furthermore, results show that Power BI and Tableau
in business analyst, business intelligence and data analyst positions, as well as Azure
and AWS in data engineer and data architect professions are required skills, which
differs from findings of the previous research. Hadoop and Spark skills, which can also
be part of fog computing, can be predicted as emerging skills as well. Both skills have
been missed in the previous studies and are observable in some positions, including data
scientist, data engineer and data architect professions, in this study. Yet, the correlation
of Hadoop, Spark, Cloud or related terms with IoT, big data or AI has not been
analyzed in this thesis. Hadoop skill, which is in relatively high demand for data
scientist, data engineer and data architect positions and is predicted as an emerging
skill, may also indicate the rise of predictive analytics. Pathak et al. (2018) suggest that
Hadoop is one of the arisen technologies that enable predictive analytics. As discussed
in the literature review section, such a possible trend may be consistent with the
findings of Power and Heavin (2017), who found more inclusion of predictive analytics
in the operational decision-making and tasks over time
Another observed new trend is the inclusion of sub-skills of in-demand skills in job
content. For instance, Keras and Pytorch are the libraries of Python that can be used in
machine learning or AI. In addition, based on the analysis, the use of the keyword
Cloud is rising, and AWS and Azure, which are cloud platforms, can also be observed
in the findings. The trends can also be interpreted as a transition towards unique and
comprehensive tools and narrower specialization requirements than were cases with a
more general description of skills for professions. In contrast, for positions such as
business intelligence, in which almost all skills have a decreasing trend rather than
having a rising frequency for a noticeable number of skills, predicting a shift to
unification is impossible. However, in such occupations (e.g. business intelligence)
exist emerging skills (e.g. Python, Tableau, Power BI) that can be attributed more to a
drastic change rather than to transition to the unique tools.
Although no profound analyses have been conducted, at a general level, some positions
tend to have more common skills with each other. For instance, recruiters for data
architect, data consultant, and to some extent data engineer professions most often use
database and cloud platforms (e.g., Azure, AWS, SQL) in job description. Tools such as
Power BI and Tableau mostly exist in business intelligence and data analyst positions,
and Team, Python and SQL skills are in the top five skills for data scientist, data
77

engineer and data analytics professions. Recall that the findings of Verma et al. (2018)
show that the data scientist profession is similar to the data analyst profession, and that
business analyst positions are similar to business intelligence positions. Different from
the study of Verma et al. (2018), findings of the thesis show similarities between data
analyst and business intelligence professions based on the top occurring skills in jobs’
content. Moreover, in the thesis, the frequencies of hard skills are less for a business
analyst, which impedes the profession’s inclusion in the comparison. In the findings of
Jian and Cheng (2021) too, business analyst is a profession that has most uncommon
skills with other professions. In addition, Jian and Cheng (2021) found that data
scientist, data science engineer and data architect professions have more concurrent
skills, which corresponds with findings of the thesis for data consultant and data
engineer professions.
Positions (e.g., business analytics, data manager) can be observed that generally have
relatively lower frequencies for the top skills, or most of the skills that have a high
frequency are soft skills. One interpretation of this observation may be that the level of
the common consensus about the meaning of these positions or titles is low compared to
other professions. Another may be that wider range of the tools available for
accomplishing the responsibilities of these positions, which results in the distribution of
the frequencies across various hard skills.
Generally, knowledge of disappearing skills may contribute to appropriate utilization of
resources by individuals and organizations, and focus on common, evolving skills and
sub-skills within them, as mentioned above. In addition, having knowledge about
similarity of data-related positions and the skills required for them can potentially
support obtaining a higher relevancy rate in information retrieval (i.e. vacancies) and
support filling positions thereby. One of the domain specific problems is the subjective
interpretation of data-related positions, and being acquainted with the skills related to
each profession may also contribute to recruiters labeling positions correctly.
Thirdly, another research question aims to detect differences in the skill requirements at
the country level. Generally, in almost all positions the top three-five skills in each
country are nearly the same. Yet, there are some considerable variations in different
positions, such as for the data scientist position R, Python and SQL skills have
relatively less frequency in Finland, whereas Python and SQL occur comparatively

78

more in the advertisements of Finland for the data analyst profession. While for data
engineer positions requirements are about the same, for data architect positions there are
noticeable differences, such as Azure and AWS are comparatively more in Finland than
in Poland or Denmark, or Python’s frequency is relatively more in Poland than in
Finland or Denmark. Tableau and Python are less required in Denmark, whereas Power
BI and Excel, which are in a higher demand for the business intelligence position, are
completely missed in Finland.
On the one hand, for business analyst, data consultant and data manager positions
countries have a common representation: having soft skills or terms with more
frequencies than technical tools. On the other hand, in terms of hard skills, which also
have less frequency, the variations exist between countries for these positions, except
for a business analyst profession that has almost the same occurrence for most of the
tools across countries. Considering that data consultant and data manager positions are
two out of the three less data collected job positions, and have almost only soft skills as
high frequent skills and have considerable variation in the hard skills, they can be
interpreted as professions that are more abstract or have not reached the maturity level
for having a common understanding.
Nevertheless, not only for data consultant and data manager positions, but also in
almost all the other positions with the fall of frequency the variations between countries
rise. Therefore, in addition to the above mentioned country-level differences in high
frequent skills for each position, possessing the less frequent skills that are specific to
the country may be more helpful to fulfill the demand in one market than another. In
other words, the country specific less frequent skills may be a source of a skills gap, and
possibly generate an advantage in a labor market.
Lastly, the research aims to answer how the skill requirements vary across different
domains, for which it has been succeeded to analyze only financial and marketing
domains. Similar to the findings of the country-level analyses, the top demanded skills
in both domains are almost the same, whereas with the fall in the frequency the
variations rise. For example, while Machine Learning and Cloud occur more in the
marketing domain, SAP and Computer Science are more frequent in the content of
vacancy advertisements in the financial domain. Furthermore, skills may exist that are

79

completely or mostly relevant to the operation in one domain, such as Google Analytics
that is used in the marketing field.
Knowing such differing skills (e.g. SAP) may possibly be an assisting factor either in
domain-level specialization or for individuals and enterprises to define a gap that needs
to be fulfilled to shift to data-related professions from another position and with a
different background. Yet, the analyses and findings mostly serve as a directive since
the number of collected advertisements for each domain is around 30, which have been
retrieved from all collected positions that have “data” in the title (e.g. data scientist, data
engineer) rather than from a single profession’s advertisements. In other words, there is
a possibility that the domain-level variation in skill requirements is caused by the
variations in the positions that belong to each domain rather than the domains
themselves.

5.1 Limitations

Firstly, as noted earlier, it is indefinite whether the skills, which have been evaluated as
emerging or rising skills within this study have not been selected in the previous studies
at all or they have been included, but not presented because of low frequencies.
Secondly, advertisements have not been limited to only job advertisements that have
content in English. Therefore, frequencies can be affected by the number of job posts in
English, and the order of skills may be affected by how a particular skill is defined in
that language. For instance, a possibility exists that technical skills are defined the
same in each language while soft skills are not, such as whether both Python and
Management are the same both in English and Finnish may influence their respective
frequency.
Thirdly, although quantitative analysis has been selected as a most proper methodology
based on the problem and research questions, meaning of terms, particularly soft skills
and general terms, may be misinterpreted. For instance, whether the term Management
refers to the soft skill or to the management of data (i.e. data management). Although
other ambiguous terms (e.g., systems, implementation) have been disregarded, they
have been retained in presentation of results for possible usage in future studies.
80

Interpretation of interrelation of most soft skills have been missed as well, because of
the focus of the study. Moreover, stopwords have been removed and have not been
considered, which may be another source of misinterpretations. For example, it is
uncertain whether both Python and R programming languages are required or either of
them (i.e. OR statement), or if a skill is a preference or a requirement. In other words, if
a skill exists in a job description, it has been supposed to be a requirement.
Furthermore, some domain or study specific limitations can be mentioned. For instance,
for some of the positions (e.g. data consultant) a number of collected advertisements are
considerably low either in general or per country, which may affect validity of the
findings and their representativeness. The same approach refers to the domain-level
differences as well, for which only around 60 jobs’ content have been collected.
Moreover, the study considered advertisements as representative of organizations’
requirements in terms of skills, whereas the advertisements' correspondence with the
organizations’ actual expectations can be questioned.
Previous studies, which are the basis for the analyses of changes in skill requirements,
are not conducted in the markets that are selected for this study. Therefore, changes in
skill requirements may be an outcome of the country-level variations rather than actual
change over time, as findings of this study also show that country-level variations can
be observed in skill requirements for data-related positions.
Finally, as mentioned above, potentially, the domain-level differences in skill
requirements can be caused by the differences in positions that belong to each domain
rather than the domains themselves.

5.2 Future Research

In this thesis one, the demand side of the labor market has been studied. Being able to
collect data on skills of the supply side of the labor market, to analyze and compare
with the demand side may potentially further contribute to resolving a skill gap.
Furthermore, as noted earlier, future studies may focus on analyzing several different
industries, for being able to illustrate a complete picture and a comparison of skill
81

requirements. A possible option is the usage of the job portal that indicates an industry
in which companies operate.
Moreover, future studies may investigate how different skills that occur in data-related
positions are correlated. For example, how programming languages Python and R are
correlated, or what correlations cloud technologies (e.g. Azure, AWS) have. Future
studies can be particularly useful in generating findings on whether changes and
differences in requirements are due to differences in responsibilities in different time
frames, countries or domains, or skills are just substitutive. For example, in the case of
the substitutive, the rise of one skill and fall in another skill may mean a shift to that
rising skill.
Future studies may also explore how skills requirements vary depending on experience,
degree requirements or seniority levels (e.g., entry-level, senior). Findings may further
contribute to organizations, institutions and individuals for entering the labor market or
for developing within the data field by referring to the findings. Moreover, research
may study other positions (e.g. other future occupations), and centralize a labor shortage
and a shift to emerging roles in studies.
Finally, in this study, the countries have been selected based on the number of
enterprises that utilize big data in the country. Future studies may detect and ground a
categorization that more thoroughly represents the development of the data field.

82

6. Conclusion

The thesis has aimed to contribute to the lessening of a rising skill gap, to support
defining the data-related professions, as well as to assist in up- and re-skilling for the
data-related occupations. Four research questions have been formulated that fully or
partly and directly or indirectly contribute to the solution of the listed problems.
Thesis initially defines the role of data in enterprises and industries, and how different
tools, systems and concepts that are directly or indirectly related to a data field have
been evolved. Moreover, the Literature Review covers previous similar studies, from
which results have been obtained for skill requirements of selected professions,
conducted in the domain for some of the data-related positions.
In total, eight dara-related positions have been selected for the study, and data have
been collected from Indeed.com job portal during 2021-2022. Quantitative content
analysis has been selected as a methodology of the research, and the analyses, including
data collection, have been realized by using Python programming language.
Firstly, the research question has aimed to define changes in skill requirements in the
last 5-10 years. The oldest study that could be utilized in the thesis for finding changes
has been published in 2019, which caused the study to investigate changes for a
maximum three-four years. Although depending on position different trends can be
observed in skill requirements, results can be summarized as that either since 20202021 or 2018-2019 professions have experienced considerable changes in different
skills requirements, and there are some common trends that have been observed in most
or all positions. Furthermore, some skills have been interpreted and predicted as
disappearing and emerging skills based on the findings.
Secondly, the findings of a research question that aimed to define current skills
requirements in the market have been presented along with the results of a research
question on how skills requirements vary between selected countries, and discussed by
aligning the research question on changes in skills requirements. The findings of this
research question depict the current market requirements for each selected data-related
position, as well as enable comparing relations between different professions, predicting
emerging skills and obtaining skills that are common and most frequent in occupations.

83

In addition, approaching current market requirements from the perspective of three
countries has enabled answering a third research question that has aimed to find how
the skills requirements differ in three countries: Denmark, Finland and Poland.
Countries that have been selected have comparatively higher, lower and average levels
within the EU in terms of the number of enterprises that utilize big data. In general,
with decreasing frequency country-level variations rise, and top occurring skills in each
country are mostly the same. Yet, for some professions country-level differences in
some particularly high frequent skills have been detected.
Lastly, one of the research questions has aimed to answer how the skills requirements
vary for positions in different domains. During analyses, only around 70 job posts have
been succeeded to categorize into finance and marketing domains. In general, results
show that top demanded skills in both domains are almost the same and relatively
higher variations exist in less demanded skills in each domain, whereas some domain
