Title: Management Control Systems as a Tool for Trust Building in a Context of Acquisitions
Supervisor: Jean Claude Mutiganda
Abstract: This thesis investigated if management control systems (MCs) can be used as a
tool in the thrust-building process during an acquisition. The primary focus was to
investigate culture, motivation, MCs and trust (the thematic fields of the thesis)
individually, but more importantly, how they together form the building blocks of the
trust-building process. Earlier research indicated that trust building as a part of MC design
is limitedly studied. The aim of the thesis was to describe the purpose of MCs in an
acquisition context, and to investigate how trust could improve the chances of a
successful integration. Its empirical aim was to investigate how Finnish managers deal
with trust-related issues during acquisitions. It also aimed at providing guidelines for
managers in a real-life context.
This thesis used institutional logics for describing organizational culture, and the scenarios
that may arise, when several cultures meet during an integration stage. How can trust be
fostered to maximize chances of an outcome, where the strengths of the separate logics
are merged into a new, inclusive one? To analyze how trust is handled by Finnish
managers, data were gathered from an online survey with 29 respondents and semistructured interviews with two managers.
In this thesis, trust was seen as a dynamic process starting with calculative trust and
gradually developing into affective trust. Trust proved to be an end-result of a long
communicative and transparent approach, but calculative trust did not seem to be a wellknown phenomenon among managers. In the trust-building process, the abovementioned four fields all played a decisive role. Culture proved more deeply rooted than
anticipated in the organization: organizational culture can be changed with time and great
effort, but national culture is hard to affect. If management grasps the impact of culture, it
may have a positive effect on the motivation of the workforce; understanding employees’
needs enables the design of an MC that considers the organizational background.
Many aspects presented in this thesis are useful for the creation of trust in an acquisition
context. However, managers´ limited understanding of MCs as a concept leads to a
situation, where the potential is unlikely to be fully utilized. Managers failed to
comprehend how academic findings may be implemented in their work. It was also
suggested that MCs should be seen as a set of processes, since this concept is better
understood by practitioners.
Further research should involve more interviews from a specific industry, to allow for
proper comparisons between similar organizations. It would also be worthwhile analyzing
the impact of national culture, e.g., as a comparison between Finland and Sweden.

1. Introduction

1.1 Background
Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are a strategic choice, which provides organizations with a
significant means for growth (Bansal, 2016) and value creation (Schade, 2013). According to Porter
(1997), strategy is a company’s way of positioning itself towards customers and against
competitors, by creating competitive advantages and by utilizing resources in an efficient manner.
Strategy-related questions can hence include both company-external and company-internal
matters, both of which can be relevant for an M&A context. However, due to its focus on
management control systems (MCs), this thesis will deal with company-internal aspects.
The expectations on an M&A are usually high; synergies are believed to result in a stronger market
position or more efficient management. Nevertheless, many M&As fail to reach the goals that
have been set for them; various studies from the last fifty years report success rates of only 20-30
percent (Moschieri and Campa, 2014; Slangen, 2006; Dikova and Sahib, 2013, Bansal, 2016). Eccles
et al. (1999) indicate that one reason for this may be overpricing, whereas Čirjevskis (2020) and
Bansal (2016) stress cultural incompatibility, and in doing so, emphasize the human impact on
M&A success. Also in this thesis, focus will be on human aspects, as its aim is to analyze MCs as a
tool for improving trust building during the integration stage of acquisitions. According to Bansal
(2016), trust is an insufficiently studied variable in the M&A integration context.
As far as the term M&As is concerned, mergers refers to two or more independent companies
consolidating so that at least one of them loses its autonomy. Acquisitions means purchasing a
company, either on a minority or majority basis (Schade, 2013). In this thesis, focus will be on
acquisitions, although the academic literature often treats the two concepts together. The M&A
process is usually considered to consist of three phases: a pre-merger phase, a transaction phase
and a post-merger integration phase. As the integration phase is where the acquiring company’s
managers meet the employees of the acquired entity, this phase sets the natural scene for
studying how trust is created and shown by management.

Systematically and efficiently managing processes within organizations is the task of management
accounting, with MCs as one of its tools. MCs have over time grown into complicated organisms
for collecting and analyzing past and present data to create e.g., visions and strategies
(McNamara, 2009; Guinea, 2017). In other words, MCs can be said to provide the organization
with techniques and processes for achieving certain goals (Flamholz et al., 1985). According to
Long (2018), managers use control mechanisms to communicate expectations, provide feedback,
and reinforce employees' work performance so that resources are distributed and used effectively
and in agreement with the objectives of the organization, for instance during an M&A integration.
According to Merchant and Van der Stede (2007) and Malmi and Brown (2008), a distinction
between strategic control and MCs can be made; whereas the focus of strategic control lies
outside the organization (e.g., on competitors and stakeholders), MCs aim at controlling factors
within an organization. In this thesis, the term MC refers to systems dealing with intraorganizational control.
According to Malmi and Brown (2008), MCs are a set of traditional accounting tools (e.g.,
budgeting and other financial measures), administrative controls (e.g., organizational structure
and administrative systems) and socially based mechanisms (e.g., organizational values and
culture), which partly lay the foundation for the phenomena analyzed in my thesis. In an
organization, several of these controls are simultaneously present. In the past decades, an active
discussion has been conducted concerning how the net of controls should be viewed: as a fully
integrated system or as a more loosely knit network of more independent control nodes forming
an agile package (Dermartini and Otley, 2020; Grabner and Moers, 2013)? In a recent study,
Demartini and Otley (2020) argue that MCs do not need to be labelled as fully system or fully
package but can rather be regarded as a continuum with “system” and “package” as opposite
poles. The tightly integrated system MC traits provide the organization with tools for control and
surveillance, whereas the loosely integrated package pole is likely to foster creativity and
innovation. Most organizations need both, and the challenge is to reach the optimal ratio. For this
thesis, Demartini and Otley’s (2020) model seems useful, as both surveillance and innovation are
potentially important for a successful integration.
When trying to regulate the behavior of agents on different hierarchical levels, a successful MC
needs to consider the concept of motivation. In this context, a distinction between intrinsic and
2

extrinsic motivation must be made. According to Kuvaas et al. (2017), who quote Deci, Connell,
and Ryan (1989), intrinsic motivation is built on “the desire to perform an activity for its own sake,
to experience the pleasure and satisfaction inherent in the activity”. Extrinsic motivation, in
contrast, is “the desire to perform an activity with the intention to attain positive consequences
such as an incentive or to avoid negative consequences such as a punishment” (Deci and Ryan,
2000 cited by Kuvaas et al., 2017). During many decades, organizations focused on reward systems
that provided employees with incentives to work in the interest of the owners or the highest levels
of management, instead of prioritizing their own concerns. This is illustrated in the classical agency
dilemma, also known as the principal-agent problem (cf. Eisenhardt, 1989). In more recent times,
it has been acknowledged that a successful control system must also consider intrinsic motivation
(Malmi and Brown, 2008). Based on this outlook, MCs can be depicted as a continuum stretching
from coercive to enabling: if the promotion of effectiveness is too strongly emphasized, creativity,
flexibility, and eventually also motivation and trust, may be lost. This type of coersive MC aims at
imposing individuals to complying with the rules of the organization. An enabling MC, on the
contrary, seeks to provide individuals with empowering methods. As I see it, empowering
employees is closely related to showing them trust. According to Adler and Borys (1996), enabling
MCs should make organizations less vulnerable to negative effects of formalized control, but they
may also weaken the control quality. This means that a constant balancing occurs between
extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, and also between coercive and enabling MCs.
In a recent study, Malmi et al. (2020) criticize the agency dilemma, and especially the mechanistic
controls based on extrinsic motivation and the assumptions that employees are individually
motivated and likely to work hard for monetary rewards. These are traditional Anglo-Saxon
preferences, and in Scandinavia, the situation is different (Malmi et al., 2020). This should also be
considered in the MCs, whose design can be claimed to be culturally dependent, in the light of
Malmi et al.’s (2020) research. Cultural issues are however not limited to national cultures;
differences between organizations in the same country also exist and they are also crucial for the
M&A integration. According to Hofstede (2012), culture can be defined as “the collective
programming of the mind that distinguishes the members of one group or category of people
from others”. Malmi et al. (2020) see culture as “the values, beliefs, preferences, and assumptions
that provide the basis for interaction and shared understandings among group members, and
which differentiate one group of people from another”. In this thesis, culture refers to the
3

collective programming of the mind of the employees in a certain organization, which
distinguishes them from employees in another organization. The reason for this distinction may
then lie in national or organizational culture, or in both.
The encounter of several organizational cultures also means the existence of parallel institutional
logics. According to Haveman and Gualtieri (2017), “institutional logics are systems of cultural
elements (values, beliefs, and normative expectations) by which people, groups, and organizations
make sense of and evaluate their everyday activities and organize those activities in time and
space”. Although institutional logics are by no means restricted to one organization – CarlssonWall et al. (2016) mention governance logic, business logic, professional logic and sport logic as
examples, all of which are not limited to certain organizations – different organizational cultures
can certainly be seen as different institutional logics, as they have all supplied their contexts with
sense-making cultural elements. The question is what happens when the different logics meet in
the acquisition context. Carlsson-Wall et al. (2016) report that whereas early research (DiMaggio,
1983 as cited by Carlsson-Wall et al., 2016) found that multiple logics co-exist during the transition
times, later studies (Lounsbury, 2007; Reay and Hinings, 2005 as cited in Carlsson-Wall et al., 2016)
report that parallel logics may exist for much longer, either openly or under the surface. Gerdin
(2020) reports that the introduction of a new institutional logic may lead to avoidance, dismissal
or agreement, and the result may be anything from resistance to creative friction. It obvious that
careful management of questions relating to institutional logics is of great importance of a
successful integration. Related to the concept of parallel institutional logics in a context of
management accounting and M&As are also so-called vernacular accounting systems (VAS), i.e,
the native MC used by the acquired company until replaced by a new, global one (Goretzki et al.,
2018). According to Goretzki et al. (2018), a global MC that aims at replacing a VAS must be
attractive for the employees, so that they remain motivated. Only then it may outperform the VAS
and become accepted within the new entity.
The integration stage of an acquisition is in other words a crucial and vulnerable process, which
must be controlled for e.g., motivational factors and efficiency. A vital, but not very wellresearched, factor in this context is the role of trust (cf. Bansal, 2016). Audi et al. (2015) define
trust using the definition of Rousseau et al. (1998), who claim that “Trust is a psychological state
comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions
4

of behavior of another”. Väisänen et al. (2020) see trust as a combination of reliability,
competence and benevolence, i.e., a belief that another party wants to do good. Väisänen et al.
(2020) stress that if the relationship between the managers and the employees is based on mutual
trust, managers may implement controls systems that are designed to orientate employees
towards performing better rather than to controlling potential opportunistic behavior. Audi et al.
(2015) go as far as to claim that increasing the role of trust might reduce the need for external
monitoring, which in turn may save costs and make the organization more flexible. Audi et al.
(2015) further claim that a focus on management is crucial for understanding trust in an
organizational context, as managers steer the strategic work. This means that the relationship
between individuals both on different and equal hierarchical levels is important for the design of
MCs.

1.2 Aim of the thesis
Despite vast research within some of the fields related to this thesis, several aspects remain only
partially understood. Firstly, only scarce research has been conducted on MCs as a package, and
also on MCs as a whole (Gerdin, 2020). Secondly, Gerdin (2020) reports limited research
concerning co-existing institutional logics. Thirdly, Väisänen et al. (2020) and Bansal (2016) state
that research on the role of trust in an MC context is limited, whereas Long (2018) argues that
some research has been conducted in the field of trust, but almost nothing has been published
concerning how trust is built in practice.
With its starting point in these research gaps, my thesis contributes to the discussion on how MCs
can be used for fostering trust during the integration stage of an acquisition, i.e., in a context,
where parallel institutional logics are likely to exist. Secondly, this research aims at providing more
knowledge about the role of trust for creating enabling MCs, with special focus on how trust is
generated.
Hence, the aim of this thesis is to investigate if MCs can be used to improve trust building in an
acquisition context. Moreover, it explores what aspects of previous research that relate to these
processes by concentrating on the role of culture, motivation, MCs and, lastly, trust. The empirical
5

aim of the thesis is to investigate how Finnish managers deal with trust-related issues during
acquisition processes, and it also aims at providing some guidelines for managers in a real-life
context.
The leading research question can be formulated as follows: How can MCs be used to improve
trust building during the integration phase?
It can be divided and specified into the following sub-questions:
1) What aspects contribute to the creation of enabling MCs and to trust building during the
integration stage of an acquisition?
2) How do Finnish managers improve trust building during the integration process?
3) What should managers do to improve trust building during an integration?
The first question is tested in the literature review, e.g., based on an overview of previous
research. Question number two is tested in the empirical part, i.e., through an online survey and
semi-structured interviews. The last question aims at providing policy implications based on the
study as a whole.
As far as the limitation of the research is concerned, three choices have enabled the study to stay
within focus and the given frames of a master’s thesis. Firstly, I chose to analyze my research topic
from the management’s perspective, as managers can be seen as the active parts in the design of
the MCs. The second limitation is my choice to target only Finnish managers in the empirical part.
This choice was made since trust as an interpersonal phenomenon is likely to be connected to
culture. Therefore, the research becomes more transparent if the starting point is placed within
one national culture. Moreover, I have only investigated acquisitions, although the academic
discussion mostly covers M&As as an entity.

1.3 Structure of the thesis
The thesis is structured as follows: After the introduction follows chapter 2, a review of previous
literature, opened by a description of my theoretical framework. Research themes of interests are
culture, motivation and MCs, which are presented in their own sub-chapters, the last one also
containing aspects on the central topic of trust. Chapter 3 provides the methodology of the
6

empirical part, i.e., it illustrates the chosen methods: an online survey and semi-structured
interviews, and places them in their academic context. In chapter 4, the results of the survey and
the interviews are presented and analyzed against the theories provided in chapter 2. Finally,
chapter 5 concludes all the previous chapters in a summarizing discussion and presents the
meaning of the findings in a broader context. In chapter 6, a Swedish summary is provided.

2. Literature review

2.1 Theoretical framework – an overview
This thesis has its starting point in the leading research question: How can MCs be used to improve
trust building during the integration phase? For the literature review, this research question can
be narrowed down to the following: What aspects contribute to the creation of enabling MCs and
to trust building during the integration stage of an acquisition?
This approach builds on the presupposition that MCs may be formed to have qualities that allow
trust to be built between different parts of the new organization, although employees come from
different organizational cultures and interpret their reality through different institutional logics.
The careful use of a suitable MC is one of the central means for an organization to guide, motivate
and lead employees into using resources to meet the organizational goals. What attributes does
such a “suitable” MC have? Today, many organizations are organic and horizontal, and the
personnel is autonomous, and therefore, an MC with enabling characteristics must be considered
an attractive alternative. This argumentation is based on the concept of intrinsic motivation, i.e.
the notion that individuals perform their best when engaging in sense-making activities. After an
acquisition, employees may perceive that these sense-making activities are threatened by the
introduction of a new organizational culture, with new institutional logics, at least if the new
culture is not introduced in a good way. What methods can then be used for creating enabling
MCs that allow employees to be steered at least partially by intrinsic motivation, also in times of
partly coinciding institutional logics? In this thesis, the use of organizational trust is considered a
potential solution. If management generates and communicates trust, and promotes trust building
between different parts of the organization, it seems likely that the different institutional logics
would be able to interact more genuinely. This might also raise the chances of improvements and
synergies, as the different institutional logics can merge into one and take advantage of each
other, instead of continuing to live their own lives either openly or under the surface (cf. CarlssonWall et al., 2016 on decoupling, structural differentiation and compromising accounts, all of which

8

will be presented in chapter 2.2.3). In chapter 2, previous research on the topics culture,
motivation, MCs and trust will be presented, with a focus on their role in an acquisition context.

2.2 The impact of culture
Carefully acknowledging and handling cultural issues is of vital importance for a successful
integration (Malmi et al., 2020). Culture is a construct, i.e., an intangible product of human
imagination, and serves as a means for better understanding phenomena in the real world, and
people’s relations to these phenomena (Hofstede, 2012). As became evident in the introduction,
culture is what separates a group of people from another, be it based on geographical affiliation
(national culture) and socially formed groups, for instance within an organization (organizational
culture). The difference between organizational and national culture is of particular importance in
the context of post-acquisition integration.
In the following subchapters, the terms national and organizational culture will be more closely
examined, as both must be considered accordingly in the design phase of an MC, especially in the
context of acquisitions, where two or more cultures meet. These cultures, may they be national or
organizational, must be seen a s a likely base for the institutional logics of the acquiring and the
acquired organization. During the integration, a solution must be found for how to deal with these
parallel logics within the new entity. Moreover, the role of trust in this process will be more
closely considered.

2.2.1 The impact of national culture
As membership in a national culture is usually established from birth and members are socialized
into their national cultures from early childhood, it is very difficult for any MC to profoundly
change any traits rooted here (Hofstede, 2012). According to Hofstede (2012), national culture
affects profound aspects of human existence, e.g., values and belief systems. Different models
have been used to illustrate the classification of national cultures into clusters and groups, the
most famous one being Hofstede’s model based on traits such as individualism/collectivism,
9

uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and masculinity/femininity. Although rightly criticized for
being simplistic, these classifications can to some extent be used for investigating how far from
each other two organizations from different national cultures are expected to stand.
Slangen (2006) has investigated cultural aspects of M&As with focus on cross-border acquisitions.
Before this article, only a small number of studies had tested the impact of cultural distance
statistically or researched cross-border acquisitions at all. Based on this limited research, no
consequent conclusion had been made: some studies found that a large distance concerning
national cultural has a negative impact on the result of the acquisition, others reported a positive
correlation. Also, Dikova and Rao Sahib (2013) and Shi et al. (2016) announce mixed results of
acquisition studies that investigate the effect of cultural distance, referring to one group of studies
that indicates a negative correlation between cultural distance and acquisition performance, and
another group showing the opposite. Slangen (2006) positions himself between these two
categories, arguing that the mixed findings can be explained through the level of post-acquisition
integration. He specifies the argument by the level of desired integration; if an acquisition should
be tightly integrated into the acquirer’s business, differences in national cultures may be harmful,
whereas an acquired unit that has been given much autonomy is less likely to be subject to
problems due to cultural differences. If integration must be rigid, it calls for clear and well-planned
communication (Slangen, 2006).
In Dikova and Rao Sahib’s (2013) study, a main finding is that an acquiring company with a
background in domestic M&As does not benefit from cultural distances due to the misapplication
of the lessons learned. Earlier research has assumed a correlation between experience in domestic
and cross-border acquisitions, since the implementation of national deals has been seen as a
steppingstone (Dikova and Rao Sahib, 2013). Even if the experience from domestic M&A may not
be applicable to cross- border M&As, earlier experience from international deals correlates with a
higher sensitivity for avoiding inappropriate generalization errors (Dikova and Rao Sahib, 2013). A
general conclusion seems to be that differences in national culture can be seen as favorable, if
integration is limited and the acquired company can select and adopt procedures and policies that
can be considered attractive or useful. In Slangen’s (2006) argumentation, cultural distance is
hence not the decisive aspect for the success of an integration.

10

What does the existence of several national cultures mean for the design of an MC? According to
Malmi et al. (2020), much research has been conducted on the relationship between MC practices
and national or cultural settings. At least partial consensus seems to exist on the fact that
individuals from dissimilar backgrounds have different preferences and reactions concerning MC
practices; actions that seem beneficial in one setting may prove to be ineffective in another. To
keep in mind is also the assumption that traits with their origins in national cultures cannot be
easily changed (Hofstede, 2012). Already this insight seems to indicate that a global MC may be
problematic.
As far as MCs and national culture are concerned, Egbe (2018) reports that MCs have traditionally
been designed in the headquarters and from there, they have been vertically transferred to
subsidiaries or acquisitions. The aim has been to avoid conflicts and uncertainty by concentrating
control to the uppermost levels in the hierarchy, with the aim of ensuring that the behavior of the
separate parts is compatible and that everyone works towards the same goals (Egbe, 2018). This
practice may lead to a situation, where subsidiaries are pressured to adopt structures that have
been designed in the headquarters. In practice, the question is to what degree the structures are
in fact adopted, and to what extent the subsidiaries or acquired organizations continue to follow
their own institutional logics (cf. decoupling in chapter 2.2.3). As this type of top-down control is
designed mainly for efficiency and coordinating purposes, it tends to become quite technical and
formalized, building on control mechanisms such as budgets, performance evaluation systems,
formal investment appraisals and decision-making processes (Egbe, 2018).

2.2.2 The impact of organizational culture
According to Malmi and Brown (2008), organizational culture is often described using Flamholtz et
al.’s (1985) definition: “the set of values, beliefs and social norms which tend to be shared by [the
organization’s] members and, in turn, influence their thoughts and actions”. Malmi and Brown
(2008) stress that although culture provides an organization with a context, and at least partly lies
beyond the control of managers, it also needs to be viewed as a control system as it can be used
to regulate behavior. Hofstede (2012) also claims that organizational culture can at least partly be
changed.
11

Malmi and Brown (2008) report that organizational culture can influence employees in three main
ways: through values, symbols and clan control. Value, one of the most profound shared qualities
in a national culture, can in an organizational context be seen in mission and vision statements.
The subordinates adhere to the organizational values in different ways; individuals may be
recruited based on their values or employees may be socialized into having their values changed
to fit the organizational equivalents. Employees may also decide to actively act in alliance with
organizational values, even if they do not feel personal attachment to them. Even though values
are the deepest fundament of a culture, Hofstede (2012) argues that differences regarding
organizational culture are most clearly seen on a more superficial level, in symbols and clan
control.
Cultural symbols are often visible expressions, i.e., artifacts; the workspace design or a certain
dresscode are typical examples (Schein, 1997 as referred to by Malmi and Brown 2008). An open
plan office may signal a wish for communication and collaboration and is obviously an attempt to
control the behavior of the employees. The concept of clan control relates to the notion of
organizations consisting of several distinct subcultures or micro-cultures, i.e., “clans”. Employees
are gradually exposed to socialization processes that introduce them to certain skills or values of a
certain profession or organizational unit.
As symbols and artifacts refer to a more superficial level than values, it is natural that they are
more quickly internalized (Hofstede, 2012). Both Hofstede (2012) and Malmi and Brown (2008)
represent the classic notion that organizational culture can be both created and changed.
Hofstede (2012) further stresses that individuals are voluntary members of an organizational
culture. Although most organizational cultures have developed rather unconsciously, they have
been created by someone, and have been further developed by managers and other members of
the organization throughout the years. Therefore, it may be worthwhile monitoring and
attempting to change them, given that enough money, time and managemental resources are
available (Hofstede, 2012). For this reason, I find it feasible to argue that the design of a new,
global MC must address what organizational culture should be fostered; this question will be
further elaborated on in chapter 2.4.
Modern research has acknowledged that the integration of an acquisition is a complex
phenomenon that requires more careful and sensitive handling than top-down orders. Shi et al.
12

(2016) stress that an acquiring company, whose organizational culture and image are perceived as
positive and attractive is likely to experience less resistance within the acquired company during
the integration. In previous research, multilevel factors have been identified to affect the
formation of an organizational culture, including organizational structure and practices, employee
homogeneity, social interaction, leadership, and workgroup influence (Ostroff et al., 2003).

2.2.3 Institutional logics
In the introduction, institutional logics were defined as cultural elements that provide people and
groups with sense-making systems for their everyday activities. In an acquisition context, two or
more logics are likely to meet. For this type of occurrence, Besharov and Smith (2014) report
multiple possible outcomes: conflict, coexistence, or a blending of the logics. Tracey et al. (2011,
as cited in Besharov and Smith, 2014) also mention that multiple logics can either pose a threat to
an organization, or provide it with useful innovativeness. In an acquisition context, I see this as a
decisive factor for whether the integration will succeed.
According to Carlsson-Wall et al. (2016), multiple institutional logics can be divided into logics that
place competing demands on organizations and logics that do not pose such a demand. If the
coinciding logics are compatible from the start, they are unlikely to pose any problem to the
organization or acquisition process. However, if tension exists, the logics need to be actively
managed. Carlsson-Wall et al. (2016) present three main scenarios for this: decoupling, structural
differentiation, and compromising accounts.
Decoupling can be seen as a situation, where an organization is primarily guided by one logic (e.g.,
the old, familiar MC) and only symbolically follows the demands of others (e.g., the one imposed
through the M&A) (Gerdin, 2020; Carlsson-Wall et al., 2016). Carlsson-Wall et al. (2016) report
that decoupling can be either structural (a permanent commitment to one logic only and routine
adherence to another) or situation-specific (a spontaneous solution whenever competing
demands are placed on the organization). Both structural and situation-specific decoupling seems
problematic for an integration context; not only are the different parts of the organization not

13

integrating and instead living their own lives, but they also make intervention difficult for
management, as the resistance is done covertly.
Structural differentiation refers to the division of an organization into several independent subunits, which are allowed to follow the demands of their own institutional logics. The advantage of
this model is a tolerance for heterogeneous organizations, and the possibility to keep stakeholders
happy, but simultaneously this model hinders effective integration of the units, and probably leads
to less than optimal synergies. If an acquisition is made with other aims than tight integration, this
scenario may certainly be worthwhile considering.
Compromising accounts refers to a shared logic for the whole organization, which all parts adhere
to. If this is done optimally, synergies could be obtained and also creative friction and creativity.
Carlsson-Wall et al. (2016) report that designing for compromising accounts means combining
elements of rules, routines and control systems from different institutional logics, so that the
needs of different stakeholders can be met.
It has become evident that MCs could - and should - be designed also for other purposes than
control, as they should also strengthen cooperation and creativity. Egbe (2018) argues that
recognizing such factors also means admitting that certain parts of MCs are socially constructed
and determined by their context, i.e., also in places far from the headquarters. This type of control
is often informal and emphasizes other factors than formalistic mechanisms such as budgets and
monetary bonus systems (Egbe, 2018). A mutually supported MC also minimizes the risk of
decoupling. One tool for creating mutual support for the MC could be the use of trust.

2.2.4 Trust as a component of culture
According to Bansal (2016), an acquisition is one of the most severe changes that an organization
can undergo, and employees often perceive the process as threatening. As employees feel a loss
of security and become vulnerable, the role of trust becomes crucial. Also Audi et al. (2015)
consider trust important in an organizational context: organizational trust has been linked to
employee satisfaction, effort, performance, better teamwork etc.
14

According to Chathoth et al. (2011), employees are at least partly influenced by their national
culture as far as organizational trust is concerned. For instance, representatives of collectivist
cultures are more influenced by group-related factors, whereas individual rewards work better in
cultures, where the collective plays a smaller role. However, organizational culture is also of great
importance for understanding the concept of trust within an organization.
As organizational trust is a complex phenomenon, it is helpful to conceptualize it using different
dimensions of trust: integrity, commitment and dependability (Chathoth et al., 2011). According to
the authors, integrity can be seen as containing elements of fairness and justice, encouraging
openness and truthfulness in the relationships between actors. Chatoth et al. (2011) report a
positive relationship between integrity and organizational trust. The second dimension,
commitment, concerns the actors’ sense of belonging to the organization and their actions within
the organization over time. In other words, commitment involves the organization’s long-term
relationship with the individuals in terms of e.g., confidence in their knowledge and capabilities,
investments in them as employees etc. A high level of commitment relates to a high level of trust,
as has been confirmed in previous research (Chathoth et al., 2011). The third dimension related to
trust is dependability, i.e., how faithful the organization is to its employees in the eyes of the
employees themselves. This is influenced by the support given by the organization in times of
crises, e.g., in acquisition processes, but also in how the organization guides its employees
towards improved skills and capabilities. An increased perception of dependability has been
proved to lead to a higher level of organizational trust (Chathoth et al., 2011).
In chapter 2.4.3, the concept of trust will be further discussed, and then with focus on its role for
creating enabling MCs. As enabling MCs need to consider the concept of motivation, this topic will
first be presented.

2.3 The role of agency problems and motivational factors
A well-handled integration is one of the corner stones of a successful acquisition. This, in turn, is
partly dependent on the relationship between people on different hierarchical levels in the
organization. This dilemma can be illustrated through the agency theory, which explains the
15

relations between the principal and the agent(s). The model is based on the assumption that all
individuals seek to maximize their own interests. As a result, a conflict of interest can arise
between principal (for instance, top management) and agent (e.g., middle management or
employees), if the decisions made by the agent do not simultaneously match the interest of the
principal. The model can also be applied to relationships outside the organization, for instance
between the company and their shareholders, but as the focal point of this thesis is on MCs, the
company-internal mechanisms are of interest. In the organization, measures must be taken to
minimize the risk of agents acting in their own interest. One such measure can be MCs, for
example in the form of reward systems.
If top management (principal) wishes to steer employees (agents) by the means of rewards, two
factors must be fulfilled. Firstly, the agents must be willing to exchange something for receiving
the reward that will be given to them. Secondly, this exchange must exceed the agents’ own
production costs in terms of money, time, effort, joy etc. The agents have several alternatives
concerning their actions, all of which come with different gains and alternative costs. This means
that the reward offered should be so attractive that the agents are likely to choose this option.
Seen from an agency theory perspective, the integration stage of an acquisition can result in a
conflict between parties with different access to certain information. Managers, especially those
from the acquiring company, aim at efficiently restructuring the acquired organization, with
certain information at hand and with their own aims. Within the target company, people most
likely want to keep sense-making tasks and procedures, preserve systems, and cultures that they
have found efficient etc.; that is, they are likely to defend their own institutional logics, which may
even result in decoupling, as described in chapter 2.2.3.
The integration of acquisitions is complex and requires a demanding workload of the people
involved, sometimes in the form of tasks that go against their own interests. Systems that
motivate individuals to continue implementing the synergy-related work also after the completion
of the deal should therefore be generated (Dephampilis 2009). For this reason, motivational
theory is of importance; how can people be motivated to work in the direction of the goals set by
the acquirer?

16

Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation was described in the introduction of this thesis. Traditionally,
management accounting research has been more occupied with analyzing extrinsic motivation,
which for instance can be seen in its interest in monetary reward systems (Malmi and Brown,
2008). In some contexts, this may certainly be of great interest, as less interesting tasks that need
to be effectively performed will always exist, as will employees, who are highly motivated by e.g.,
monetary bonuses. However, in a recent article, Malmi et al. (2020) present interesting findings on
how different cultural regions perceive the relationship between the delegation of responsibility
and incentive contracting. The authors claim that increasing evidence suggests that the principalagent theory and the ideas of monetary compensations that often follow in its wake are biased
towards Anglo-Saxon values and preferences. This statement is based on Hofstede’s (2012)
assumption that US culture is rooted in individualism and achievement values. Therefore, the
agency theory, and especially monetary rewards, may have limited validity in societies with
different cultural traits. In the Nordic and Germanic regions, where the uncertainty avoidance is
higher, individuals are less comfortable with variable pay and tend to prefer stability and certainty
(Malmi et al, 2020). For this reason, incentive contracting is likely to be less efficient in these
countries when trying to align employees’ behavior to the goals of the organization.
In situations where employees are not very easily steered by external motivators, internal
motivation must be carefully considered. Ryan and Deci (2000) see intrinsic motivation as a
situation, where an activity is done for the inherent satisfaction that comes with it, rather than for
some external consequence of it, e.g., due to pressure or rewards. These spontaneous, often quite
independent behaviors, seem to be conducted for the positive experiences that follow exercising
and extending one’s capacities. According to Lepak et al. (2007), intelligent, flexible and motivated
employees work most efficiently in the long run. Therefore, it could be more profitable to invest in
factors strengthening intrinsic motivation rather than implementing rewards systems focusing on
extrinsic motivation, especially since it may prove difficult to decide what and how much
monetary compensation should be given to optimize its effects (Lepak et al., 2007).
Also Lourenço (2020) reports that the trend has shifted from financial rewards towards more
socially motivated incentives based on e.g., respect and trust. Such non-financial motivators can
be recognition awards, respect or social incentives. However, when trying to investigate what
people in fact perceive as motivating, Lourenço (2020) claims that a problem of so-called
17

hypothetical bias exists; what employees report as motivating, are not necessarily the same
factors that most efficiently steer their behavior when their behavior is studied. In addition to this,
people’s preferences tend to be unstable, volatile, inconsistent and thereby unpredictable. In
other words, it is both demanding and hazardous to build MCs based on employees’ self-reports;
when the MC is finally implemented, the employees may behave in another manner.

2.4 Management control systems
As has been shown in earlier chapters, an acquisition that is integrated optimally without further
control only exists in a perfect world, under optimal circumstances. In a less perfect world,
controls need to be imposed, for instance in the form of MCs. This is done in hope of achieving
better work coordination between superiors and subordinate work, more engagement from the
employees, and overall, positive interpersonal relationships (Long, 2018).
According to Malmi and Brown (2008), who quote Merchant and Van der Stede (2007), MCs deal
with the behavior of employees: “It is people in the organisation who make things happen.
Management controls are necessary to guard against the possibilities that people will do
something the organisation does not want them to do or fail to do something they should do... If
all employees could always be relied on to do what is best for the organisation, there would be no
need for MCS”. In other words, people can be seen as one of the most central components for the
actions taken within the organization. Therefore, any MC that can prevent unwanted human
behavior is more likely to facilitate the implementation of an integration. According to Guinea
(2017), the MC must be modified to fit the activities performed by the organization and its
environment, both in economic and cultural terms, the latter of which was discussed in more
detail in chapter 2.2. Also, the information cost should not be too high; the system must be easily
understood and accepted and should not affect its users’ behavior negatively (cf. chapter 2.3). The
MC also needs to be flexible to changing circumstances, and, obviously, it must create value for
the organization (Guinea 2017).
This means that at least as important as the technical quality of a MC, is its implementation.
Applying such a far-reaching system has long-going consequences for the organization, and
18

management must consider the change in mentality and culture that is required by its employers.
For this reason, it may not be wise to quickly implement the new system top-down, but instead to
focus on cooperation. Instead, Guinea (2017) stresses that training efforts should concentrate not
only on a presentation of the techniques, but also on a change of mentality. A wise
implementation should also consider the risk of giving rise to reactions such as avoidance or
dismissal of the new institutional logics, which could lead to the rise of decoupling, i.e., a situation,
where the employees of the acquired company only symbolically follow the new institutional logic,
while they are primarily still guided by the demands of their original one (cf. chapter 2.2.3). The
optimal solution would in most cases be to land at compromising accounts, i.e., a clash forcing
employees to think creatively and constructively through the creation of productive friction, and
finally, achieve a situation, where the best parts of all logics prevail.

2.4.1 MCs as a system or a package?
As reported in the introduction, it has been lively debated whether MCs should be studied as a
system or a package (Demartini and Otley, 2020; Grabner and Moers, 2013). According to Grabner
and Moers (2013), MCs are regarded as a system when they are seen as symbiotic elements and
the design of the MC considers these interdependencies. MCs are seen as a package, when they
embody all control practices used in an organization, regardless of their possible
interdependencies, and also regardless of whether the design choices of the MC consider
interdependencies (Grabner and Moers, 2013). The package view opens up for more agility, as the
roles of the control mechanisms are not predetermined in the influence they have on each other,
but it is also more chaotic. According to Demartini and Otley (2020), the system view has usually
been seen as the preferable choice. This may be due to the seemingly well-designed structure, but
in practice, many MCs have proven to be of more pragmatic origin (Demartini and Otley, 2020).
Therefore, it is difficult to claim that one model would be clearly superior, and initially, both
alternatives must be presented and considered.
In the system view, an MC is seen as consisting of different interdependent elements, and MC
design choices must consider these interdependencies (Grabner and Moers, 2013). According to
Gerdin (2020), most of the research in this field has focused on single mechanisms, or at most on
19

the interconnectedness between two mechanisms, rather than on the complex scenario arising
from a MC as a complete package. (Gerdin, 2020). Further, Malmi and Brown (2008) report that
accounting-based controls and formal aspects have received more research than administrative or
cultural control mechanisms (values, symbols and clan controls, as described in chapter 2.2). In an
ideal situation, different control mechanisms complement each other by mitigating limitations and
thereby optimize the control system, which can also be seen as different mechanisms being
coupled. In other words, MCs viewed as a system must be so carefully designed that all elements
have a defined role, when connected to the others.
The MCs as a package school argues that MCs should depict a complete set of control practices,
regardless of potential interdependencies (Grabner and Moers, 2013). Of these two options, the
system view and the package view, the broader package view certainly seems to be more suitable
for the aim of this thesis, where focus lies more on the MC as a whole, rather than on individual
control mechanisms and their interdependencies.
According to Demartini and Otley (2020), an organization needs an MC that fosters both efficiency
and innovation. In this context, Demartini and Otley (2020) present the so-called coupling theory,
which allows the simultaneous existence of rationality and indeterminacy. A loosely coupled
structure is seen as having organizational elements that can be brought together so that they are
responsive to each other, but still show signs of independency. Tight coupling is seen as promoting
stability, e.g., control and efficiency, whereas a loose coupling produces flexibility, e.g., adaptivity
and innovation. Demartini and Otley (2020) suggest that an optimal coupling is of moderate
strength: in a situation with medium coupling, both efficiency and innovation are endorsed
without either trait becoming too dominant. According to this model, MCs do not have to be seen
either as fully package or completely system but can instead be regarded as a continuum
concerning how tightly integrated the various parts are.
Demartini and Otley (2020) ask for more research especially concerning non-financial performance
measures and performance appraisal mechanisms, i.e., reward systems. This is in line with Malmi
et al.’s (2020) argument that reward systems need to consider also internal motivation. Further,
Demartini and Otley (2020) claim that none-financial measures are more commonly used in the
organization as a whole. This poses an interesting question: if the none-financial performance
measures are the ones that are shared throughout large organizations, challenges concerning the
20

integration stage of the acquisition may appear, as non-financial performance measures are more
likely to be more culture-dependent, and hence also to be affected by e.g., differences between
various institutional logics.
Another crucial aspect is who within the organization that decides on the desired levels of
integration for an MC. Demartini and Otley (2020) claim that this might be a strategical choice
originating from the highest management levels. They also suspect that upper management is
interested in tightly coupled systems and hence a greater degree of central control, as they might
expect to gain coherent and systematic information in this way. For this reason, Demartini and
Otley (2020) propose that more research should be conducted on different hierarchical levels.

2.4.2 Coercive and enabling MCs
As became evident in the first part of this chapter, MCs have traditionally been seen as a means of
steering employees away from unwanted behavior and instead motivate them to complete tasks
that lie in the interest of the organization (Guinea, 2017). The attitudes hidden behind an MC may
be diverse and to some extent, the attitudes also mirror the traits of the organization (Demartini
and Otley, 2020). Concerning the view on management characteristics, two main categories exist:
mechanistic organizations and organic ones (McNamara, 2009).
In a mechanistic organization, as described by Fayol in his classical model some hundred years ago,
the functions of management are planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating and controlling
work and the workforce (McNamara, 2009). As far as lower levels of the organization are
concerned, McNamara (2009) reports that they are often seen as likely to make mistakes and
therefore, foolproof procedures should be designed through a reliable control system. Such
circumstances often foster coercive MCs, i.e., systems relying on extrinsic motivation fostered by
reward systems and punishments. The other side of the coercive MC coin is that it may influence
the employees’ creativity and independency negatively. Moreover, few organizations are purely
mechanistic in today’s world. Already in the 1960s, Burn and Stalker presented the concept of
organic organizations that are more suitable for changing circumstances (McNamara, 2009).
Organic organizations are more flexible and hence less hierarchical, and employees are seen as
21

more motivated to work independently for the goals of the organization. In an organic
organization, employees are likely to perceive coercive control systems as lack of trust from the
management. Therefore, enabling MCs are needed for fostering intrinsic motivation. However,
Ahrens and Chapman (2004) stress that it is important for a successful MC to address contradictive
demands for both flexibility and empowerment on one hand, and for predictability and
centralization, on the other.
According to Adler and Borys (1996), four MC qualities can be claimed to stimulate it into being
perceived as enabling: repair, internal transparency, global transparency and flexibility. In other
words, an enabling MC should allow for errors to be made and openly addressed to foster
organizational learning. Moreover, the users at all levels of the organization should understand
the logic of the MC and its place in the organizational and the business ecosystem, and they
should also have some flexibility concerning how the MCs is used. Both Väisänen et al. (2020) and
Adler and Borys (1996) stress that an additional factor positively affecting the perception of
enabling control is involving managers and employees at all levels of the organization in the design
and implementation of the MC. Arguably, in an acquisition context, where time is often scarce and
the aim is to reduce the uncertainty arising from prolonged integration phases, MCs are managed
on a top down basis and hence, the enabling perception must come from something else than
merely the employees’ involvement.
Although management handles the MCs according to the criteria mentioned above (repair,
internal transparency, global transparency, and flexibility), Väisänen et al. (2020) argue that the
situation is not that easily solved. For instance, both internal and global transparency should
theoretically enhance the commitment of both the managers and employees. In practice, this trait
can also cause competition; a feeling of being measured could cause a negative atmosphere, and
thereby delay the success of the integration. This is especially the case for managers, who may
identify factors in the MCs that they perceive as irrelevant. Therefore, they may lose faith in the
MC.
What approaches can be taken to foster an enabling MC that motivates individuals at different
levels of the organization? One potential solution is the use of organizational trust.

22

2.4.3 Trust as a means of creating enabling MCs
In previous research, two main systems emerge that seem to have potential to foster enabling
MCs: an intelligent utilization of vernacular accounting systems (VAS) during the implementation
of a global MC (cf. Goretzky et al., 2018) and identifying trust as an empowering factor (cf.
Väisänen et al., 2020 and Long, 2018). As I see it, a thought-through use of VAS can also be seen as
related to trust, as it requires the acquiring company to make itself vulnerable to procedures
partly outside its power. Neither of these phenomena has been very thoroughly analyzed in
previous research (Goretzki et al., 2018, Väisänen et al., 2020).

Considering VAS during the integration stage
Adler and Borys’ (1996) model with the four traits fostering enabling qualities in an MC, which was
described in chapter 2.4.2, does not explicitly consider the fact an acquired company usually has
an MC in use at the time of the acquisition, mirroring the organizational culture and the
institutional logics of the acquired firm. This local MC should be noted and considered in the
integration context, as it is often preferred by the employees, and thus it poses a competing threat
to the global MC that should be implemented. The risk for decoupling must be seen as high, at
least if the process is less skillfully handled. Goretzki et al. (2018) refer to these local MCs as
vernacular accounting systems (VAS) and stress that any global MC that aims at replacing a VAS
needs to be enabling rather than coercive if it is to provide the employees with a more attractive
solution than the (competing) VAS. One way of working in this direction is for the acquiring
company to consider the VAS as a positive means or a possibility, instead of as a threat to the new,
global MC that should be implemented. To me, this is in line with the ideas concerning
compromising accounts.
Goretzki et al. (2018) argue that a VAS can be used in three ways during the process of
implementing global MCs. Firstly, the VAS can function as a point of reference when evaluating
the planned global system. Secondly, the VAS can be used for transforming knowledge between
organizations, since it contains expressed and codified knowledge. This means that the VAS can
provide the acquirer and the acquiree with a common language. Thirdly, the VAS can be seen as a
source of negotiation power, i.e., if the global MC does not meet the requirements of the acquired
23

company for instance in terms of trustworthiness, the VAS can be used as a potential defensive
resource. This raises the demands on enabling qualities within the global MCs; if the individuals in
the acquired organization see the global MC as providing them with less attractive control
systems, they may try to return to their VAS. In terms of institutional logics (cf. Gerdin, 2020), this
would correspond to decoupling, i.e., a situation, where an organization is primarily guided by one
logic [the VAS] and only symbolically follows the demands of others [the global MC].
To conclude, a skillfully used VAS can provide the implementation phase of a new global MCs with
a means of working bottom-up, it can stimulate negotiations and compromises between global
and local actors and, hence, make the global system more enabling in an efficient way. As was
stated in chapter 2.2, cultural differences are not necessarily a weakness in an acquisition context
but can on the contrary be beneficial by providing more heterogeneous resources and productive
friction. Making wise use of the VAS may provide a way around a situation, where the acquiring
company strongly imposes the global MC on the acquiree, and instead, compromising accounts
may be achieved.

Fostering trust to promote enabling control
Coercive and enabling traits in an MC were discussed in chapter 2.4.2 with parallels to mechanistic
and organic organizations. According to Väisänen et al. (2020), an MC cannot be defined as
completely coercive or enabling, since employees’ perceptions are often influenced by the
situation. For employees to have a perception of meaningfulness, research has shown that trust is
a crucial aspect; fostering trust between the individuals seems to create an enabling atmosphere
(Väisänen et al., 2020). This goes quite well with Rousseau et al.’s (1998, as quoted by Audi et al.,
2015)) thoughts of trust being a psychological state with the intention to accept vulnerability due
to positive expectations of the other party’s intentions (cf. the introduction of this thesis). As
stated in chapter 2.2.3 on trust as a component of culture, trust is a complex phenomenon and
research within this area of management is also scarce (Long, 2018). Still, a consensus seems to
exist on trust being a desired outcome, and previous research has shown that managers work
actively on creating trust (Long, 2018). According to Schraeder et al. (2014), trust in management

24

situations can be shown differently depending on what aspects of Fayol’s management functions1
they relate to. For the aim of this thesis, the control function is of particular interest.
The trust-related phenomenon to have received the most academic attention is the relationship
between control and trust within management and employee relations. Schraeder et al. (2014)
claim that a central problem of managers today is how they can “give up control without losing
control”. Long (2018) describes the same problematics as a question of optimal balancing between
control and trust with the aim of cooperative behavior among the employees. He claims that too
much focus on formal control, for instance in the form of closely monitored control systems, may
impact employees’ perception on trust negatively, and therefore, it may lead to a less positive
attitude towards e.g., cooperation. This can be the case, even though the control mechanism was
not introduced due to lack of trust between management and employees in the first place
(Väisänen et al., 2020).
As trust is desired but never obvious, one question arises: how is trust generated? Akrout and
Diallo (2017) present a model, where the creation of trust is seen as a three-step process that
moves from calculative trust to affective and finally, behavioral trust. According to this model,
trust in the early stages of relationships often takes the form of calculative weighting of gains and
losses. This means that due to the short history of the relationship, the partners choose to be
vulnerable mainly based on facts. In this way, protection from unwanted risks is perceived. A more
mature relationship, on the other hand, is a result of experienced positive emotions during earlier
interactions. This kind of trust can be compared to the psychological sense of support associated
with a long-term relationship between humans (affection). Behavioral trust is seen in the phase
where the perceived (calculative or affective) trust starts to be visible in the actions of the
partners. Overall, Akrout and Diallo (2017) stress that trust increases the willingness to take risks
but also to invest in the relationship, be it financially, psychologically, or socially.
Akrout and Diallo’s (2017) model indicates that during the earlier stages of a business relationship,
trust can at least partly be built on well-articulated contracts and controls, which convey the

1

Fayol’s classical management functions are planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating and controlling.

25

picture of a trust-worthy partner. Audi et al. (2015) describe the same phenomenon by stating
that consistency is a critical concern in trust. This means that control and trust should not be seen
as opposite poles but rather as an interconnected phenomenon; by following the communicated
controls, a partner proves to be trust-worthy in the eyes of the other partner. This, in turn,
provides a foundation for future development of trust.
How can managers in an acquiring company then act to foster a trust-building process within the
new entity? According to Bansal (2016), employees in this type of a situation are likely to perceive
trust primarily from three mechanisms: communication, training and redundancy policies, all of
which are connected to the internal communication within the organization. Bansal (2016), who
stresses that M&A processes are among the most paramount changes for an organization,
continues by arguing that for the creation of trust in such an insecure surrounding, effective
communication is of foremost importance, as it decreases the sense of disbelief and suspicion
concerning the future. The second factor that has been proved to build trust is cultural training
within the workforce, as it acknowledges the fact that employees come from different
organizational backgrounds and prepares them for shared future (Bansal, 2016). Or in terms of an
institutional logics model: it acknowledges the existence of parallel institutional logics and aims at
achieving compromising accounts. The third factor mentioned by Bansal (2016) involves
redundancy practices, i.e., how clearly management communicates its strategies concerning what
workforce to keep. Bansal (2016) argues that communication per se may not suffice; it needs to be
complimented by efforts with more substance, e.g., cultural training of the staff or conscious focus
on HR functions.
However, transparency should be the focus of all communicational efforts: if the employees
perceive the employer as accountable and accurate concerning its actions, they can build trust in
the organization, despite the fact that negative instances also occur during the integration
processes. When subordinates trust their managers, they seem to be more willing to comply with
their directives, because they believe that management shares the same values and works to
promote also the employees’ interests - and if managers do not, they would be honest about this.
The main aim of building trust can be claimed to lie in guaranteeing a system, where no part needs
to suspect that another party is trying to take advantage of a situation. Also according to Väisänen
et al. (2020), a central aspect for creating trust within an MC context is management’s
26

communication; clearly stating the intention behind the implementation of MCs helps reducing
the risk of employees seeing this as a sign of mistrust. Here, their arguments are quite in line with
those of Bansal (2016).
Luft (2016) also emphasizes that the trend has shifted towards MCs that support innovation and
creativity, which obviously requires higher awareness concerning the value of teamwork.
Evaluating and motivating teams is nevertheless even more complicated than handling individuals.
When trying to influence work conducted in teams with the help of incentives, Luft (2016) reports
several challenges. Firstly, people may have difficulties handling the fact that their results are not
only dependent on their own input, but also on the impact from others. In heterogeneous groups,
a risk exists that high-achievers do not perform optimally, as they know that others are not likely
to reach the same standard. Weaker members of the group, on the other hand, may stop trying,
as they know that they will not reach the set goals, and thereby they lower the results of the
entire group. I also see a risk concerning non-functional behavior, as some members of the team
can see the system as coercive, while others can see it as enabling and it will be up to the team to
make their cooperation work. Obviously, if the MC rewards groups as an entity, these problems
need to be considered. Secondly, as resources are limited, much clever work may never receive
funding or praise, since only a certain percent is rewarded. This may not be in line with optimizing
the goals of the organization from a larger perspective. Thirdly, Luft (2016) reports that systems,
where the reward is relative to the work of others, is particularly demanding in contexts, where
employees must decide both on what work they do, how they do it and how much of it they do.
This is likely to mean that complex work is more difficult to steer by reward systems.
Concerning the role of motivation in teams, also under more complex circumstances, Luft (2016)
emphasizes the importance of trust in the relationship between the employees. She reports that
true reciprocity is most optimally achieved when people have sufficient information about other
employees’ tasks and responsibilities, and when teams work together, face-to-face. This means
that creating an MC that enforces the creation of trust should be a tempting idea.
Luft (2016) concludes by stressing that many components of an MC are two-edged swords, since
they can prompt both constructive and distractive behavior. Moreover, MCs are not only limited
to enforcing the behavior that the mechanism was initially created for, but they can also influence
other types of behavior that the mechanism per se cannot enforce. Nowadays, trust and control

are no longer seen as opposite ends of a continuum; instead, both mechanisms can be used as
alternative or complementary strategies within an organization (cf. MCs as a continuum as
suggested by Demartini and Otley, 2020). Or as Väisänen et al. (2020) see it: too strong a focus on
trust, in the form of very informal controls with little surveillance, may hinder efficiency among
the employees due to a lack of clear and focused instructions.
Although research confirming the importance of balancing control and trust in MCs exists, little is
known about how trust is created in practice. Schraeder et al. (2014) report that almost no
management trainings cover how to create trust. Instead, they claim that methods from related
topics such as communications, conflict and problem solving, teamwork and change management
are used by managers trying to improve their trustworthiness. Bansal (2016) focuses on cultural
training, redundancy policies and internal communication. Long (2018), in turn, reports that also
academic scholars have limited understanding on how managers build trust in practice. In other
words, trust seems to be a salient factor within organizations, which appears as an “unintended
by-product” of other activities. Therefore, Long (2018) stresses that it is crucial to comprehend
how managers actively work to gain the trust of their subordinates in their application of controls.
As managers usually use several control mechanisms, they are also likely to show multiple forms
of trustworthiness, and to build trust in several ways (Long 2018). Gaining more insight to these
complex phenomena could provide a stepping-stone on the way to a better understanding of
management’s agency problematics in the control-trust context. Before turning to this issue in the
empirical part, an attempt to answer the theoretical research question should be made:
What aspects contribute to the creation of enabling MCs and to trust building during the
integration stage of an acquisition?
In chapter two of this thesis, four main themes have been presented: culture, motivation, MCs
and trust. The analysis of previous research within these fields has made it evident that the firstmentioned three are crucial building-stones for the trust-building process.
If the acquisition context means that dissimilar national cultures meet, people’s different
backgrounds need to be considered, as national cultures are almost impossible to change.
Organizational culture, on the contrary, has two important roles: firstly, management can actively
try to influence and design the organizational culture in the new entity, but this requires specific
28

and hard work. Secondly, institutional logics can be used to describe the different scenarios that
arise when cultural elements of different organizations meet in an acquisition context, and what
the outcomes may be, depending on how the parallel institutional logics are handled.
The concept of motivation contributes to creating an enabling atmosphere, if the reward systems
used by the organization considers a wide range of motivating factors. For the purpose of
organizational trust, intrinsic motivation seems to be of particular importance.
Also, the MC itself is of importance. Since trust is a multi-faceted phenomenon, which cannot be
placed in any particular, isolated control element, adopting a more holistic package view seems
most appropriate. A model, where the MC is seen as a continuum could also be considered (cf.
Demartini and Otley, 2020), as this allows for both stronger control and more freedom
simultaneously.
However, these factors all seem to contribute to the creation of enabling MCs and trust in an
intertwined manner. They influence each other mutually, and all factors need to be considered
holistically.

3. Methodology

3.1 Introduction
Methodology can be seen as the academic framework, within which the research is conducted. It
is connected to beliefs, values and philosophical questions concerning what we can measure,
analyze, and draw conclusions from, and with what instruments. In other words, methodology
mirrors ontological (what exists?) and epistemological suppositions (what can we know about
matters that exist?) rather than specific concrete methods. The clearest and most fundamental
methodological division is the one separating quantitative research from qualitative. According to
Ghauri et al. (2020), the former primarily focuses on hypothesis-testing and verification, for
instance with the help of statistics or surveys, whereas the latter emphasizes exploration and
intuition. The difference can also be summarized by claiming that quantitative research primarily
focuses on questions such as how many, how often or how long, whereas qualitative research
analyzes less tangible factors such as feelings, experiences, and thoughts. In other words,
qualitative research can be said to emphasize how individuals interpret their social surroundings
(hermeneutics), instead of finding an absolute truth (positivism).
According to Granlund and Lukka (2017), much research on management control systems has
been criticized for being quite technical and for approaching accounting from a rather formal
perspective. Related to this are also rather mechanistic research practices, which have mainly
aimed at identifying quantitative patterns in large samples. My thesis takes a different approach,
as its aim is to analyze matters from a more human angel, that is by acknowledging the fact that
management control is conducted by people, and that these people and their perceptions and
experiences must be considered. Since human perception is at the heart of this thesis, a
predominantly qualitative approach is the logical choice.
Studying phenomena from a qualitative perspective means that the researcher’s interpretation is
needed to reach a conclusive explanation of the problem, and it also implies that the results of the
research can be generalized only to a small extent (Bryman and Bell, 2011). Conclusions are at
least partly drawn based on subjective judgement, which makes qualitative approaches subject to
30

human bias. In practice, the division between quantitative and qualitative research is not definite;
many grey zones exist, and a scholar can also deliberately choose a research strategy combining
both. One way of doing this is by using triangulation, which means adopting a research approach
containing multiple theoretical perspectives, data sources and methodologies. In this way, the
results are likely to be more reliable and the disadvantages of a specific method are minimized
(Bryman and Bell, 2011). In my thesis, I use a triangulation-inspired method combining an online
survey with semi-structured interviews to mitigate for the shortcomings of these two methods.
The methods used are also in some respects a mixed approach; although my focus is mainly
qualitative, I use a theory-testing approach, which originates in quantitative theories. According to
Bryman and Bell (2011), research mixing quantitative and qualitative traits has become
increasingly popular with time, as have techniques, where quantitative material is analyzed with
qualitative measures and vice versa.
For the analysis of the results from the survey and the interviews, a content analysis approach is
used. According to Palmquist (n.d.), content analysis is conducted using the following stages:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Formulating the research questions
Planning how to collect empirical data
Superficially analysing the data
Identifying units of analysis
Coding the data
Summarizing the results

This is also how my research work was structured, albeit with its starting-point in a theoretical
review of previous research.

3.2 Research quality and ethical aspects
As far as research quality concerns, it has traditionally been measured in terms of validity and
reliability. Both terms are rooted in quantitative research and hence, they focus on the quality of
measurement (Bryman and Bell (2011). As qualitative research does not primarily deal with
measurable facts, it can be questioned if these approaches are relevant for this type of research.
The topic of qualitative assurance within qualitative research has been widely discussed.
According to Bryman and Bell (2011), the crucial question has been how qualitative research is to
31

handle the question of truth. Firstly, it has been questioned whether a truth – or several truths –
about anything at all can be claimed to exist. Secondly, it has been debated whether a researcher
is ever capable of capturing and analyzing any other persons’ truths. Bryman and Bell (2011) claim
that most qualitative researchers nowadays approach these questions pragmatically and place
themselves in the middle of the scale, acknowledging that no universal truth exists for most
qualitative topics, but simultaneously, if they are aware of their potential bias and acknowledge
that their results can often not be generalized, they may be able to say something about some
informants’ truth(s). Another insight of modern qualitative research is the lack of absolute
indicators of quality within this field. However, most qualitative researchers use parallel strategies
to optimize research quality. According to Bryman and Bell (2011), thick descriptions, respondent
validation and triangulation are central methods for this. In my thesis, I mainly focus on
triangulation as a means of securing the research quality.

3.3 Surveys and interviews
To answer the empirical research question of this thesis - How do Finnish managers improve trust
building during the integration process? - an online survey and semi-structured interviews with
Finnish managers were conducted.
Surveys are traditionally used for obtaining quantitative data, but according to Bryman and Bell
(2011), they can also be used in qualitative contexts. Online surveys can be said to be costeffective and quite easy to administer, as they relatively easily target a large number of
participants. However, surveys can be subject to human bias; researchers may focus on areas of
which they have prior knowledge and ignore other more important details. Furthermore,
responses may not represent the real views and opinions of participants, either because the
respondents deliberately omit something or exaggerate something else, or because research has
shown that people do not always behave according to the answers that they provide in surveys
and interviews (Bryman and Bell, 2011). Obviously, this jeopardizes the quality of results.
Contrary to surveys, interviews involve direct interaction between the researcher and
participant(s). Interviews can be divided into structured and unstructured interviews, with a third
32

group of semi-structured interviews in between. In a structured interview, the researcher relies on
a set interview design to generate fixed responses, whereas unstructured interviews enable
interviewees to express their opinions, behavior, and reactions without any control. For this
reason, unstructured interviews are primarily based on open-ended questions. According to
Bryman and Bell (2011), unstructured interviews are best suited for inductive approaches, where
the interviews provide the starting point for the entire study. However, as my thesis has a theorytesting, theory-specifying approach, a semi-structured approach seems best suited; a fully
structured interview would not be different enough to mitigate against the limitations of the
survey, and in a fully unstructured interview, it is possible that the interviewees would not cover
central aspects dealt with in the theory.
Two main disadvantages are connected to interviews. The first one is that they require much
timely resources, as the researcher must organize and conduct the interviews, transcribe, analyze
and report them. Hence, only a limited number of interviews can be conducted within a given time
frame. The second problem is that also interviews are subject to human bias at several stages of
the interview process.
I am aware of the questions concerning the research integrity as presented in The European Code
of Conduct for Research Integrity (2017). Concerning my thesis, the following aspects can be
clarified: Firstly, anonymity of the participants is guaranteed as the survey is fully anonymous and
the answers in the interviews have been anonymized. Secondly, the survey questions and the
interview guide are attached to this thesis in order to open up the problematics from the author’s
point of view (cf. appendix 1 and 2). Thirdly, I know that bias is inevitable in qualitative research.
As it cannot be avoided, the problematics are dealt with by the limitations of the results.

3.4 Practical implementation of the empirical study
3.4.1 The survey
As mentioned in chapter 3.1, content analysis provides the foundation for my qualitative analysis
of the empirical data. This procedure was done as described in this chapter.
33

With a starting point in the theoretical framework, questions were formed to match significant
topics within previous research. All questions could be placed under one of the following four
topics in the literature review: culture, motivation MCs and trust. The survey consisted of 18
questions, 7 of which were multiple choice and the rest open-end questions with unlimited length
in the answers. All questions were obligatory to answer. The order of the questions was set
according to Bryman and Bell’s (2011) recommendation that questions that relate most closely to
the research question should be at the top of a survey. The survey questions are attached in
appendix 1.
The questions were tested on two Finnish persons with experience from M&A processes. The tests
resulted in minor changes and clarifications in the questions, but no questions were omitted or
added. The data obtained from these tests are not part of the empirical data used for the thesis.
The final survey was sent to 50 Finnish respondents within a management position through
SurveyMonkey. Of these, 29 provided relevant answers; the remaining respondents were not in a
management position. The first question related to respondent’s professional background. This
information was used for checking that the respondent had sufficient background knowledge, but
the answers were not coded according to this information. The 29 answers were analyzed
according to the four above-mentioned themes, which can be claimed to form the thematic fields
of my research framework.

3.4.2 The interviews
After having analyzed the answers from the survey, it became evident that some questions
remained superficially handled, because the survey as a method did not provide me with a chance
to ask follow-up questions. To increase the reliability of my findings, I conducted in-depth semistructured interviews with two persons, who have been professionally involved in conducting
M&As. In other words, a triangulation was introduced to mitigate against the superficial quality of
the survey data.
The interview guide for the semi-structured interviews was built based on the questionnaire in the
online survey, and also on the data obtained from the survey. Focus was laid on questions and
34

answers, where the survey data showed significant lack of information. Thematically, the
questions in the checklist covered the same fields as the survey.
The interview guide and its questions were tested on one of the persons that had been used for
testing the online survey. The result of this test was that the internal order of the questions was
altered for the convenience of the interviewee. However, no questions were profoundly changed
or deleted after the test interview. The answers obtained in this interview were not used in the
empirical data.
The interviewees were chosen by means of convenience and elite sampling (Sarajärvi and Tuomi,
2017), as I had access to a well-informed respondent. The checklist for the interview was provided
before the interview to give the interviewees the possibility to reflect upon the questions more
thoroughly. For the convenience of the participants, the interviews were conducted in Swedish,
the shared native language of the interviewer and the interviewees. The interview guide is
attached both in Swedish and in a translated English version (appendix 2). For accessibility
reasons, the quotations from the interviews have been translated into English in the running text.
The original answers in Swedish are found in appendix 3.
The interviews were conducted as telephone discussions based on the questions in the interview
guide. However, the guide only provided a frame, as the discussions developed quite freely. In
other words, the discussion followed the purpose of semi-structured interviews. The calls were
recorded and transcribed for research quality purposes.
The interviews were analyzed based on the four main themes covered in both the survey and the
interview guide: culture, motivation, MCs and trust building. The answers of the respondents were
crosschecked against the information in the literature review and the answers provided in the
survey, in order to keep also the leading research question in mind.
With this triangulated approach combining an online survey with in depth interviews, I received
both width and depth in my empirical data. Content analysis has in my context proven to provide
an apt method for identifying an comparing themes in the theoretical and empirical data.

35

4. Results

Only limited understanding exists on how trust is built on managerial levels within organizations
(Väisänen et al., 2020; Bansal, 2016). Also, trust seems to be a salient factor, which appears as an
unintended by-product of other activities (Long, 2018). This makes analyzing how managers build
trust within their organizations crucial, and this is the foremost aim of my empirical work. My
empirical research question is: How do Finnish managers improve trust building during the
integration process?
This chapter is structured in a way that relies on the four thematic fields: culture, motivation, MCs
and trust, which also provided the theoretical framework presented in chapter 2. Comparisons
between the theoretical chapter and the results from the survey and the interviews will also be
made, both in separate subchapters and, finally, in a concluding presentation of the results from a
triangulation perspective. In this context, the empirical research question will also be answered.
The leading research question (How can MCs be used to improve trust building during the
integration phase?) and the normative research question (What should managers do to improve
trust building during an integration?) will be approached in chapter 5.

4.1 Results from the survey
Culture
As far as cultural factors are concerned, the literature review concluded that both national and
organizational culture provide an important framework for the integration of an acquisition. If
handled properly, both can be used to boost dynamic creativity (Slangen, 2006). An important
distinction between the two is that whereas organisational cultures can be actively created and
changed, national cultures are claimed to be more static and hence their traits must rather be
considered (Hofstede, 2012; Malmi and Brown, 2008).

36

In question 14 of the survey, a multiple-choice question, the majority of the respondents reported
that they have sometimes experienced problems related to different corporate cultures in an
acquisition context. However, almost equally many respondents reported that they have hardly at
all experienced these types of problems. It can be questioned whether the acquisitions have been
this unproblematic, or if the answers mirror the respondents’ lack of knowledge in this area.
Differently formulated: when a problem has arisen, has the manager been able to identify its roots
in cultural incompatibility? Hofstede (2012) argues that it is worthwhile monitoring and actively
aim at controlling an organizational culture, but many managers seem to the lack the tools and
skills for doing this.
Those respondents, who had identified problems related to cultural incompatibility in question 14,
provided more details on their experiences in question 15. The main judgment was that the
problems related to poor communication between management in the acquiring and the acquired
companies, different generations, different mindsets and visions, and a different view on
hierarchical levels:
“Some people have worked at the company for 20 years and changing their view of corporate
culture is sometimes a challenge.” (Account manager)
This quote is an illustration of an instance, where different institutional logics have met, but do
not seem to have been handled in a way that would have resulted in compromising accounts.
Moreover, this manager does not provide an answer that mirrors any interest in seeing solutions
in the institutional logic of the acquired entity, as he is clearly most interested in changing the
views of the others. A clever use of the VAS could perhaps have improved the situation.
Another respondent says:
“After M&A, there is a lack of communication between management and management.” (Head of
development department)
This illustrates that cultural compatibility and measures for strengthening it are phenomena that
can be identified on all hierarchical levels of an organization after an acquisition. Management
needs to consider the employees of the acquired entity, but the management groups of the
acquirer and the acquiree must also work with each other. For creating compromising accounts, I
37

believe this to be vital; only if both logics are thoroughly known, presented and analyzed in
management contexts, their strengths can be utilized.
One respondent also reported problems in financial matters, which is of interest, since M&As
reportedly mostly fail either due to cultural misfit or financial problems (cf. Čirjevskis, 2020;
Bansal, 2016 and Eccles, 1999). However, financial miscalculations etc. are not the focus of this
thesis.
The culture-related problems described in question 15 were reportedly (cf. question 16) handled
mainly by focusing on more discussions and talks:
“Being open, honest and an active communicator.” (Account manager)
“We talked what they should do differend to get better results” (Manager)
Another answer described the realization that an approach dependent on the acquired company
may be needed:
“Handling ways of differentiation” (Owner).
Managers also reported forwarding the problems to a higher management level or an external
consultant. An attempt to resolve the problem was also to increase the monitoring of the
employees.
As far as the handling of different cultures in an acquisition context is concerned, it is difficult to
interpret the answers that mentioned “talk” as a solution to the problems, as they were superficial
and did not provide any information about the contents of these talks. At least, these answers did
not convey a picture of a deep understanding of how parallel institutional logics can be managed
efficiently and in a target-oriented manner. In previous research, Bansal (2016) has also stressed
that communication per se does not suffice; the communication efforts must be based on
thought-through contents. The risk is that through this ignorance, managers are incapable of
taking advantage of the creative and unexpected qualities that may contribute to the
development of the organization, i.e. compromising accounts.

38

The answers that depict forwarding the problems to a third party, such as higher management or
a consultant, also cannot be said to mirror a final solution to cultural problems. These
problematics will be further discussed later in the context of trust building. The most mature
approach presented by respondents seems to be the insight that some inconsistency between the
acquired company and the acquiree must be tolerated if creativity is not to be killed. This is in line
with Slangen (2006), who states that the level of desired integration is decisive for how tightly
integrated an acquisition should be, and also with Carlsson-Wall et al.’s (2016) argument that
structural differentiation may be a solution if integration must not be tight, whereas
compromising accounts are desirable if a strong common culture is the goal.
Parallel institutional logics, the risk for decoupling and compromising accounts as the goal is also
described by Goretzki et al. (2018), as they argue that it is vital to consider both the acquired and
the acquiring company’s corporate culture, in order to mitigate for the risk of resistance within the
acquired company. This way, chances of wanted behavior are seen as likely to increase, as
employees consider their work more meaningful and motivating. In question 17, managers
reported how they considered the acquired company’s original culture. It seems that many of the
respondents did not fully grasp the question, or at least their answers did not contain valuable
information:
“Our company s policy is that everyone is treated equally.” (Director)
“Okay level but some problems” (Team leader)
This phenomenon illustrates the already mentioned dilemma that many managers seem unaware
of the impact of culture in an acquisition context, and also cannot make proper use of the VAS (cf.
Bansal, 2016). However, approximately one third of the respondents provided answers that
indicate a certain familiarity with the problematics. Of these, more than half seem to see a
solution in trying to integrate the acquired company’s culture with their own as efficiently as
possible:
“We have chosen a smooth integration where the acquired company's corporate culture is
gradually transformed to our culture.” (CEO)

39

This is in line with Adler and Borys’ (1996) statement that it is more merciful to finish integrations
as quickly as possible to minimize uncertainty among the employees. However, too tight a
schedule also poses a threat that important factors will not be considered (Guinea, 2017). Among
the respondents, only a few reported answers that show signs of cultural sensitivity, as they
reported only having incorporated traits from the acquired company that were compatible with
the acquirer’s culture, handling the integration gradually and allowing time for the organizational
culture to develop. In doing this, I suspect that they have missed chances of productive friction
and compromising accounts.
In the context of compromising accounts, Gerdin 2020 argues that uncertainty and change may
lead to a development of both products and processes, and also of the organizational culture,
management and cognition. The answers in question 18 indicate that most respondents are not
very thorough in their reflections concerning the positive outcomes of the integration of different
cultures. When asked about positive experiences, they provided the following type of answers:
“Yes we have developed” (Foreign market leader)
It is difficult to believe that managers, who express their answers in this way, actively reflect upon
creative friction in a very thorough manner.

Motivation
In motivational theory and its impact on reward systems, Lourenço (2020) reports a trend towards
considering also other aspects than external motivation boosted by monetary rewards. Factors
that motivate employees intrinsically have also become important, e.g., the use of rewards that
are psychologically or sociologically rooted (Lepak et al., 2007; Lourenço, 2020). Based on the
answers in question 2, a multiple-choice question, the most commonly used rewards system is still
some variant of a bonus program. However, the second place is held by career development,
followed by praise and acknowledgement, the two later being non-monetary rewards. These
results are in line with the trends presented by Lepak et al. (2007) and Lourenço (2020); traditional
bonus solutions still have their place, but managers also use non-monetary systems. Also, in
question 3, managers report that they aim at creating a system that considers motivation. When
40

asked about the qualities of their organizational reward systems, most managers reported them to
be motivating and rewarding, but also challenging. When analyzing the answers, it is clear that
almost all respondents use a combination of both monetary and non-monetary reward systems. In
some cases, only non-monetary rewards are used, whereas only monetary rewards are slightly
more common.

MCs
In the theoretical overview (cf. Long, 2018; Malmi and Brown, 2008 and Guinea, 2017), it was
claimed that in a real-world context, MCs are needed to optimize the chances for an acquisition to
succeed. Such controls need to be imposed for instance in the form of MCs. Moreover, Guinea
(2017) stressed that MCs must suit their organizational context, both in economic and cultural
terms, they must be easily understood and accepted on all hierarchical levels, flexible to changes
and they cannot have too high an alternative cost in terms of negatively effecting the employees’
behavior. If employees experience that they are too tightly monitored, they may perceive the
leadership as coersive or restrictive. This means that control mechanisms should be designed so
that the organization can use them in an enabling manner to foster innovation, efficiency, and
creativity, but simultaneously, the MC should enable the organization to retain control. In this
context, Demartini and Otley’s (2020) so-called coupling-theory was presented: a model that
describes how rationality and indeterminacy can be allowed simultaneously. Adler and Borys
(1996) claimed that four qualities seem to affect how enabling an MC is: repair, internal
transparency, global transparency, and flexibility. Moreover, it was stated that it would be optimal
to implement an MC starting from the lower hierarchal levels (Väisänen et al., 2020; Adler and
Borys, 1996).
This can be compared to the result of the survey in question 7. Here, more than half of the
respondents reported that their MCs are designed on a top management level:
“The control systems are created on the executive level, i.e. by THE top management.” (CEO)
“Highest level.” (Manger)

41

Only a few respondents reported that the creation of the MCs involves lower hierarchal levels of
the organization:
“Middle management level.” (Head of development department)
This is in line with Egbe’s (2018) research reporting that although an including approach is desired
(cf. also Guinea, 2017), in practice, most MCs are implemented top-down, quite quickly. Then,
enabling qualities must be fostered in some other way.
In question 5, a multiple-choice question, the managers were asked how satisfied they are with
their organization’s MCs, and close to two thirds of the respondents reported that they are
satisfied. This should however be compared to the answers in question 6, where managers were
asked if the MCs give them enough information to the steer the work of their employees. More
than half of the respondents perceived that this was the case only to some extent. When
comparing these two questions, the answers are inconsistent; it is difficult to understand how a
manager can be satisfied with a MC that he also perceives as not providing him with sufficient
information. Again, my suspicion concerning these managers’ lack of familiarity with the topic
arises. It is especially problematic that so many managers have not identified any problems with
their MCs, since they might feel too confident in the situation and therefore are less likely to seek
improvement possibilities.

Trust
In the theoretical part of this thesis, the use of trust was presented as a means of creating
enabling MCs, including aspects of how to use the VAS for this purpose. It became evident that for
designing enabling MCs, control and trust should not be seen as mutually excluding qualities but
rather as a continuum along which an MC should be flexible (Demartini and Otley, 2020).
Moreover, it was reported that trust building is a process starting with calculative elements and
over time developing into affective trust, if the process is successful (Akrout and Diallo, 2017).
However, very little research has been conducted in this field, and hence it is difficult to
understand how trust is created and, even more so, to grasp how managers actively create trust
(Long, 2018). In the survey, questions 4 and 8 deal with management’s creation of trust and the
42

role of trust building within MCs. In question 4, a multiple-choice question, almost three fourths of
the respondents reported having control systems that include mechanisms for improving trust
building. This tendency is strengthened by the results in question 8, also multiple choice, where
most managers reported that they have sufficient knowledge on how to create trust. However, in
both questions, a reasonable part of the respondents reported not having given the issues a
thought.
In question 9, managers were asked to choose qualities that they find important for trust building.
The three qualities that were chosen the most were fair, communicative, and knowledgeable.
However, all eleven options were chosen to an extent that cannot be denied. These alternatives
also contained qualities such as monitoring, demanding and goal-oriented, which can be seen as
rather controlling qualities, but also elements that might relate to calculative trust. This gives rise
to the question how these qualities are reflected in the work of the managers, which was the topic
of question 10. Here, most managers were not able to report any concrete examples of how these
trust-building qualities are reflected:
“Quite good” (Foreign market leader)
“I don’t know” (Senior manager)
The managers who reported trust-building examples mentioned taking responsibility for the
workload of the employees, having daily meetings, providing help, showing interest and overall
being fair and communicative. These examples I see as signs of trying to gain affective trust.
According to Long (2018), little is known about how managers learn to work in a trust-building
way. In question 11, managers were asked about this. The majority reports no concrete examples,
which shows either insufficient or tacit knowledge. Among the managers that provided examples
of how they have learnt trust building, the most common answers were through own experience.
This is in line with Long (2018); most managers are not able to describe their trust-creating
processes in a very detailed way.
The second most common group stressed the role of communicative skills for creating trust, and
the last, quite a small, group reported having had some type of training, e.g., leadership courses.
Question 12 was concerned with how the chosen approach correlated with desired results among
43

the employees. Most of the managers did not report systematic follow-ups for this. The few
reported outcomes were lower staff-turnover, higher loyalty and increased self-management.
It seems that the managers in my survey perceive trust building as a positive trait and that they
also see themselves as having these qualities, both in terms of calculative and affective trust.
However, when asked for more practical details concerning the implementation of these traits,
many of them seemed to struggle, and they do not seem to deal with the matter in any
systematical way.
To conclude this chapter, it can be said that based on the answers in my survey, many managers
seem unable to report deeper reflections on topics such as motivation, culture, MCs and trust
building in the context of creating enabling MCs. The result of the survey can be claimed to reflect
previous research quite well. Changing organizational culture is reportedly hard, but often an aim
that has been set for the integration. For motivational purposes, monetary reward systems are
still most common but other solutions are on the rise. MCs are primarily created on the highest
levels within the organization. Trust is mostly a salient factor for managers, and it does not seem
to be systematically handled by the managers in my survey.

4.2 Results from the interviews
Similar to the results in chapter 4.1, also the results of chapter 4.2 will be presented as thematic
entities corresponding to the themes covered in the thesis (culture, motivation, MCs and trust).
The ideas and answers of the respondents will be presented, and whenever possible, compared to
findings from previous research presented in chapter 2. Comparisons between the findings in the
survey and the interviews will primarily not be presented here, but in chapter 4.3, and in the
concluding discussion, chapter 5.
As stated in chapter 3, two semi-structured interviews were conducted to deepen the information
from the survey. Both interviewees have a long history within different types of M&As. Person A
works for a Scandinavian commercial bank with experience in financial M&As, and person B has
several decades of experience from large-scale M&As, foremost in an industrial context. He has for
example been responsible for a one-year-long integration of a cross-border M&A in the telecom
44

sector, and has worked as a consultant within this field. More recently, person B has been active
as a professional member of boards and committees.
Culture
Čirjevskis (2020) and Bansal (2016) have shown that the impact of culture on the success of the
acquisition is often underestimated. Also Person A perceived cultural incompatibility as difficult to
grasp. Simultaneously, he admitted that it is probably not easy to merge several cultures into one
within an integration context. It seems that person A has not been involved in questions relating
to corporate cultures to a very great extent. Person B, on the contrary, seems to have reflected
upon the role of culture for M&As quite thoroughly, both concerning national and organizational
cultures.
As became evident in the theory chapter, national cultures primarily diverge concerning their
values (Hofstede, 2012). Since members of a national culture are socialized into it already as
children, it is hard to have a deep impact on such traits. Person B reflects his own experience by
stating that national cultures are of great importance and that they need to be considered if
several entities are supposed to be merged into one:
Only if you take this simple example of Finland and Sweden: I very well remember
when we were supposed to have one of those integration meetings between the
Ericsson and Nokia product development teams. Those aren’t companies very far from
each other, as far as their operations are concerned or anything. I was a part of it, I was
kind of in charge of the integration, but then this Swedish development manager starts
to tell about what processes they had in their development, in their development
work, we told about our schedules and what budget we had. And when it was the
Finnish guy’s turn, he started to talk – and this was in English, because we had no other
language in common when Finns and Swedes meet... So at that point, he starts to talk
about what technical solutions they had in the pipeline, and why they were superior to
all others... so, you understand that the discussion didn’t last for more than 20
minutes, and then, they didn’t have anything else to talk about.
(Person B, Q1)
This example indicates that differences concerning national cultures should not be
underestimated; although the two companies, Ericsson and Nokia, are operating within the same
industry and even though Sweden and Finland are neighboring countries, the integration process
45

made cultural differences evident; the Finnish representative was much too direct and effective,
which obviously made the Swedish counterpart uncomfortable. This is a textbook example of
Hofstede’s (2012) claim that national cultures must be considered.
Person B continued by illustrating what the Swedish and the Finnish way of working leads to in an
integration setting:
In Sweden, you discuss and try to establish the idea in the organization, and it takes
forever, and then you reach a decision. At that point, everyone is on board, everyone
can accept the decision, but it takes a damned time. In Finland, the boss usually asks
around a bit concerning what people think, and then he makes a decision. Then,
afterwards, the decision has to be established and executed in the organization. It’s
quite a big difference.
(Person B, Q2)
In this context, Person B’s experience with German integrations can also be mentioned, as it
seems to be in line with Malmi’s et al. (2020) claim that individuals from different backgrounds
have different preferences concerning MC qualities:
Something you mustn’t try to implement is getting the Germans to be on a first namebasis; they use Sie and you must respect that. You are called “Herr X” and not “du” or
by your first name. These are occasions, where you need to be careful. There were
many people, who thought that you could... Since we spoke English with each other,
they thought that you could create a relaxed atmosphere by using du.
(Person B, Q3)
This is also yet another illustration of the fact that national culture is profoundly rooted, and must
be considered rather than changed. Making superficial changes such as using English as a lingua
franca does not lead to changes in the national culture; Germans must be met as Germans, and
Swedes as Swedes, if the integration is to continue smoothly.
Concerning organizational culture, Shine (1997) argues that it can be most visible in artifacts such
as the design of the workspace. This topic was also described in person B’s interview:
I had been the CEO there for a while and had just flattened the organization, when Mr.
KMB came to see me. Instead of having three directors reporting directly to me, I had
made it ten. Mr KMB was in charge of the premises, and he had brought a large map of
the office building with him. He wanted to be assigned the task of finding us a new
46

office building. Obviously, I didn’t understand anything – why did he want that? Well,
he explained that in the organizational handbook, it says that each director that
reports directly to the CEO must have three windows in his office. Now when there
were ten such directors, we didn’t have enough windows in our house, and therefore,
we needed to move. […] Mr. KMB was sent home, and I thanked him for his services.
(Person B, Q4)
For B, the Finnish manager, a flat organization seems to have been desired, as he restructured the
organization to minimize the need for middle managers, but in a German context, the effect
became the contrary; if more directors were to report to the CEO, more people also needed
exclusive treatment. This could been seen in the German suggestion concerning a new office
building with the sole purpose of filling the window demands of directly reporting directors.
A question that arose from this, was whether a common organizational culture – a shared
institutional logic – for the new entity is desirable. According to Slangen (2006), post-acquisition
integration is dependent on the level of desired integration: a tightly integrated acquisition is
sensitive to differences concerning culture, whereas an autonomous entity can keep more of its
individual traits. Person B illustrated this by describing a case, where tight integration was the
goal, and by explaining why tight integration sometimes needs to be accomplished:
There are some cases where you can’t really keep something that you have thrown
away, that you kind of leave to live its own life, that would have a value of its own
without integrating it, or without creating a shared culture. Especially not in
organizations that should be able to compete as an entity. Take for instance mobile
phones or computers – there, you can’t have many cultures or company cultures –
everyone has to work in the same direction.
(Person B, Q5)
It seems that person B quite strongly defends the advantages of a tight integration. However,
Demartini and Otley (2020) stress that this is not very easy to accomplish. Is it realistic to create
one shared organizational culture? Person B explains his standpoint:
But as I said, it’s realistic to create a common culture, but it takes time, and it’s
damned much work, and you need to have an integration team that actively works also
with those cultural issues, and, above all, with creating a new, shared strategy.
(Person B, Q6)
47

He continues:
You can have an impact, but it’s tough and hard work that heavily relies on the fact
that you need to create shared values, that are kind of washed clean of all cultural
values. It may be that you respect the individual, that everyone is worth their paycheck
etc. But the challenge is to get both, or all, parties, on board on a journey towards
something better, and to get people on a journey, you should always have a clear goal,
both in times of monetary and financial issues, and concerning the operations.
(Person B, Q7)
Also Person A means that it is not easy to handle cultural differences, and that the handling of
these types of questions requires thorough experience from the day-to-day business life within
the acquired organization.

Motivation
As became evident in the theory chapter, the integration of an acquisition poses requirements
concerning how different partners should be steered in order to maximize the efficiency of the
workforce and in this way meet the goals set for the acquisition (cf. Malmi and Brown, 2008). Both
external and internal motivation were considered, and monetary and non-monetary rewards
systems were discussed.
Traditional management accounting has focused on extrinsic motivation and monetary rewards
(Malmi and Brown, 2008). Both interviewees reported that they have used monetary reward
systems in acquisition contexts. Person B reports the following:
It’s a good idea to appoint the key persons as soon as possible after the integration.
But then, it’s their task to build the organization downwards and appoint their
assistants, and in this way, a register of all key individuals in different parts of the
organization appears. Then, when you know where these key persons are, be they ten
or a hundred, then you offer them different types of bonuses. For example, we had a
kind of twelve-month stay-on-bord bonuses, which were quite generous; people
received more or less half a year’s pay if the stayed for a year. And then, we had a
type, where you, as soon as you got the new budget of the year – then you checked
the individual bonus systems so that the new goals were reflected in the bonus system.
And I mean, the bonus systems that we used in those days, they made up
approximately 40 % of the normal pay.
48

(Person B, Q8)
Also person A mentions monetary rewards to key employees, who stay in the company for a
certain period of time:
Do key persons exist or is there knowledge that you have to guarantee that remains in
the company – and then we also appreciate if there is an agreement for a specific time
or something with these people, to retain such knowledge… I mean, if the acquisition is
based on a certain knowledge that this company possesses, then it often lies in these
persons, and then we also require that this knowledge remains there. Usually, then,
some kind of agreement exists – that the person is to stay for a certain period of time,
in return for, shall we say, some beef; some monetary compensation either in the form
of some remuneration that is paid after this period during which you require that the
person stays. Or then, quite often, we tie these persons through ownership in the
company, that they, so to speak, get some steak in the acquired companies.
(Person A, Q9)
Based on these answers, it seems that monetary rewards are still in active use in integrations
within different industries. However, person B stressed that these bonuses should be restricted to
most valuable employees and that strict requirements must be set to guarantee a high working
quality until the end of the bonus period.
Regarding the intrinsic motivation, person B presented a solution in the form of an integration
team, where both companies were represented by trust-worthy, solution-oriented individuals
from different backgrounds within the organization, regardless of hierarchical belongings:
It certainly is one of the biggest and most important tasks for this kind of an integration
process and for managing an organization. I strongly recommend that you create a
separate integration organization, which is not the same as the line organization. In the
integration team, there are representatives for both parties, and from different levels
of the organizations and they are to manage a structured integration that is well
planned, has a timetable with several smaller goals, and above all, a huge responsibility
in communicating and telling where things are going, what is currently going on etc.
(Person B, Q10)
The appointment of an integration team can be seen as a sign of improving employees’ intrinsic
motivation, as it enables shared responsibilities, and a chance to participate in the integration

49

process. This can be compared to Lourenço (2020), who claims that respect and social incentives
are factors that increase intrinsic motivation.
Person A did not mention any non-monetary reward systems.

MCs:
Long (2018) and Gerdin (2020) have claimed that it is of paramount importance to implement a
new MC wisely, for instance by prioritizing cooperation before quick top-down implementations,
and more engagement from the workforce. According to Goretzki et al. (2018), the aim must be to
minimize the risk for the acquired organization to dismiss the new institutional logics, since a risk
exists that the acquired company may secretly keep their own systems (cf. Carlsson-Wall et al.,
2016 on decoupling). At the same time, it is obvious that an integration needs to be steered
somehow, in order not to lose momentum. Person B says:
Especially when it is multinational, you have to keep it in your hands. But for example,
Nokia has certainly had this type of integrations, or development centers, that have
been quite independent to develop things themselves, but then, they have of course
had clear goals and a task, for instance to develop a new base station, 5 G base station,
or a new display or something like that.
(Person B, Q11)
In other words, the steering is of different strength depending on the aims of the new entity.
Certain industries may also affect what MCs are used; person A in the financial sector reports that
they only use key financial figures for their benchmark and control:
We actually concentrate on cashflow… so in that sense, we check that the company
follows so to say the goals that we have agreed on.
(Person A, Q12)
According to Demartini and Otley (2020), an MC can be seen as a continuum in terms of how
tightly integrated its parts are. One end is set by the so-called MC as a package with a complete
lack of integration, whereas the fully integrated system MC represents the other end. Person B
expresses his view on MCs as following:
50

Well, it has been a question of processes rather than of systems. I mean, there was
almost a handbook on what phases were to be followed up during the integration that
usually lasted at least 6 months, but usually a year. Once I was given the task to
integrate in ten countries during 12 months. I went from place to place like a shuttle,
and I had a secretariat with a very careful system, where the different integration
processes and their milestones were defined. Each week, there was a follow-up of
these milestones, and to these, people made reports.
(Person B, Q13)
Person B sees the integration process as a series of different components with individual goals and
milestones. Demartini and Otley (2020) claim that an optimal coupling should be of medium
strength, since this allows for both efficiency and innovation. In the situation described by person
B, the independence of different processes can be seen as a guaranty of creativity, whereas the
existence of a handbook-like approach can be seen as an effort to keep efficiency strong.
However, it is interesting that not even a top-class integration expert feels comfortable with using
the term management control system. This remark poses a step away from the detailed academic
discussion concerning whether MCs should be seen as a system or a package. If research is to have
an impact on business, a terminology must be used that at least top-class consultants within the
field are comfortable with. It seems that the academic discourse has alienated itself from more
pragmatic contexts.
Another issue presented in the theory chapter was the fact that most MCs have their roots in
upper management levels (cf. Egbe, 2018), which makes it more difficult to integrate internal
motivation on lower hierarchical levels directly, or even have first-hand information concerning
how these employees perceive the situation that management is trying to steer. This is something
that the model with an integration team as described by person B mitigates against:
It doesn’t have to be people on the highest levels of operative management. Instead,
all organizations have influencers that affect the atmosphere of the organization. You
should be able to identify such persons, and involve them in the integration work that
deals with the common structure, and the common goals and the integration. And
these guys, or girls or ladies, whatever they are, they will spread that message. There
should be representatives from both sides, and they must have much power during the
integration, and they should also be shown much trust. And in this way, they show by
example that you can take a shared project forward.
(Person B, Q14)
51

The creation of an integration team can also be seen as a way of creating non-monetary reward
systems. In other words, both the employer and the employees may profit from this approach.
As Goretzki et al. (2018) described, a certain risk exists that the acquired company does not want
to become integrated and hence presents different kinds of resistance:
The management of the acquired entities has tried to fool the principal economically,
for instance by building a straw roof on their house on the expense of the company, or
some other… But I would certainly claim that a common factor is that if the line of
command isn’t clear, if the responsibilities are not clear, then there’s a risk that
somebody starts misleading people in one way or another. So, if you then have an
integrated organization and you for instance have somebody in charge of Europe and
who sits in these local boards, and if the manager for some reasons manages to go
around his own board and this person in charge of Europe, and claims that he has
direct contact with the CEO, then there’s a big risk that he somewhere claims that “this
is something I have already agreed on with the CEO, and this is none of your business”.
Then you don’t really know what to do with these cases. So yes, line of command,
clarity and communication.
(Person B, Q15)
This illustrates that resistance needs consideration from the beginning of the integration process.
A humble approach and a clear division of responsibility seem to handle these problematics at
least to some extent.
Person B also described a successful handling of different approaches:
I sold a Finnish Metso entity to Germany and it certainly didn’t take long before the
Germans had implemented everything and were all happy. But they respected the R&D
work that the Finns had done, and this was the same when Continental bought
Elektrobit – they wanted the technology and the knowhow that these guys possessed,
but they certainly implemented their own report and control systems. Usually it’s the
acquiring entity that appoints a CEO among the locals.
(Person B, Q16)
This can be seen as an example of a solution where the best of both worlds meet – compromising
accounts in terms of institutional logics.

52

Trust:
As presented in chapter 2.4.3, Akrout and Diallo (2017) see trust as an evolving phenomenon
ranging from calculative trust at the beginning of relationships, and then developing into affective
trust, as the relationship evolves and matures. Gradually, trust becomes visible in the behavior of
the agents (behavioral trust). This means that in the beginning of an integration process, trust may
be built on contracts and controls. Person B presents many examples, where contracts and control
were used in the beginning of the integration process. One of these was already presented in the
context of management control systems: the fact that quite specific integration rules were
gathered in something described as an M&A handbook. Another example mentioned by person B
is the effort made by external consultants:
Yes, and they have a high street logo on the documents that they produce in large
numbers – different policy papers etc. – certainly, it added some extra credibility,
because then it wasn’t anything that Nokia or Ericsson or Luxor or someone else had
come up with, but it looked like professional documentation, and it certainly also was.
(Person B, Q17)
This shows that external control mechanisms and contracts are not necessarily the opposite of
trust but can rather be the key for the management to start the trust-building process, as argued
by Audi et al. (2015).
Also person A mentions having official rules and contracts:
Then, there are usually some clauses or paragraphs for a specific time, so that the
former owner has to be around for a certain period of time and so on. Then, things are
not so obvious before the old owner so to say steps out for good, and then some
change may occur.
(Person A, Q18)
This can be seen as an attempt to create calculative trust. Nevertheless, person A admits that
creating such systems is not always easy:
The world changes so much that it is in a way difficult to stipulate on what we will be
doing in five years.
(Person A, Q19)
53

However, the organization should at some point be able to move from calculative into affective
trust, something that is not clearly evident in person A’s answer quoted above. He does not seem
aware of any systematic ways of handling the trust-creating process over time.
According to Bansal (2016), factors that generate trust in an integration context are
communication, training and redundancy policies. Neither of the interviewees commented
training efforts, nor the redundancy policies of the organization. Person B however, strongly
focused on the communication:
I usually say that you have to use information as the fertilizer. It sound nagging, but
you have to keep doing it each week and repeat it… And only when the organization
starts to identify itself in the message, then some integration starts occurring. If you
don’t get them on board, so that they don’t understand the whole picture: where we
are going and why – then subcultures appear and they start resisting this and that.
(Person B, Q20)
This shows that having a transparent approach may have a positive outcome on the integration
process. However, the quotation indicates that the communication efforts are by no means a
quick way to create trust; both patience and time is required. Person B continues:
I come back to the fact that you have to have a clear plan and an enormous
communication effort. You should use communication for fertilizing and talk – and
there must be persons clearly responsible for the integration.
(Person B, Q21)
By having a clear communication strategy, the organization can steer its information in an even
way so that it reaches all levels of the organization. In this way, the organization can at least
partially mitigate against insecurity and distrust. Another crucial factor is the appointment of an
integration team, which enables the governing persons to have a realistic chance of focusing on
the integration work, and hence also to have the time to meet members of the organization. This
is crucial if communication is to be seen as one of the cornerstones of trust building.
However, person B mentions that miscommunication can also occur:
But concerning time and communication you can miss out on quite much... and
through miscommunication, you can screw up the whole thing. It happened in Spain
54

that Nokia’s and Ericsson’s organizations were competing for the same deal within
banking systems and it didn’t take more than ten days after this announcement, and
each of the Spaniards had resigned and disappeared. And it was far away; nobody
within the uppermost levels of management really understood what the matter was,
and nobody had listened to their problems there. The Nokia guys – Nokia was the one
making the acquisition – had been cocky and overconfident and said that now, things
will be done the way we decide.
(Person B, Q22)
This statement provides evidence that underestimating the power of communication may impact
the integration negatively, by resistance from the workforce. For this, person B has several
examples, for instance:
The acquired organization can also start to revolt. Before you make it through the door
to check what is going on, one CEO had signed new employment contracts with his
direct-reporting directors with big severance sums. They had turned everything upsidedown and said that now we remain seated in the boat, we have our contracts and can
wait for Nokia to fire us, and then we just cash in. So yes, it can turn out like this too,
but of course we prosecuted the CEO for faithlessness towards the principal and he
had to remunerate; he was fired immediately, as were his companions.
(Person B, Q23)
Such processes indicate that resistance from the organization may lead to severe delays, higher
costs etc., which may affect the success of the acquisition. This can be compared to Bansal (2016),
who stresses the importance of both calculative and affective trust. Since the Spaniards obviously
had not yet achieved a situation characterized by affective trust, it would have been imperative to
have a system guaranteeing optimal calculative trust.

4.3 Results of the triangulation
The results from the first empirical part of this thesis, i.e., the survey (chapter 4.1), indicated two
problems: firstly, many managers seemed not to have given the topics presented in this thesis
(culture, motivation, MCs and trust building) much active thought. This is in line with the results of
previous research, which reports insufficient theories on how managers deal with such topics in
their everyday contexts (Schraeder et al., 2014; Long, 2018). Secondly, some managers reported
55

having certain positive qualities but failed to provide examples of how they act on these topics.
This is also supported by Long (2018), who states that many of these topics are either limitedly
researched or trained, or also part of the tacit knowledge of experienced managers. The
disadvantage of a survey as the only research method is not being able to ask follow-up questions
nor asking for clarifications. This clearly indicated the need for more in-depth information from
interviews, which were conducted as a second step of the empirical work.
The results from the interviews (chapter 4.2) were two-fold; the first interview provided answers
that to some extent resembled the information from the survey. However, many of the
respondents in the survey failed to report evidence for actively engaging themselves in these
problematics, whereas person A clearly stated that he perceived the topics as both important and
difficult. This shows an awareness of the problematics and may open doors to learning more. It
should also be stressed that person A works within a context of financial aspects of M&As, and,
therefore, has a different approach to the topics than person B in the second interview. Person B’s
long experience from large-scale M&As in different industries was mirrored in his deep
understanding and knowledge concerning the questions and topics presented to him. Person B
was the only one, who did not only provide good answers, but also opened up for deeper
reflections on the topics and their interconnectedness. For these reasons, the answers provided
by person B provide the cornerstones for the empirical results of this thesis.
The results from the survey compared with the results from the two interviews can be
summarized as follows, concerning the four theoretical aspects culture, motivation, MCs and
trust.
In the survey, many managers lacked experience and a deeper understanding concerning how a
shared organizational culture, or a common institutional logic, is created. For instance, “talk” was
mentioned as a solution to potential problematics arising during the integration, but no one
provided information concerning the contents of these “talks”. Bansal (2016) has argued that
communication per se does not suffice; also the contents of the discussions must be strategically
planned. Person A found the merge of several cultures demanding and difficult to grasp and did
not provide any concrete methods on how to deal with the situation. Person B, on the contrary,
provided both theoretical and practical information about the topics and stressed the importance
of culture for a successful integration; national culture must be considered, and organizational
56

cultures can be changed through thorough and long-term oriented work. My empirical findings
concerning culture can be said to fit Hofstede’s (2012) assumptions on national and organizational
culture quite well. The problem is that most managers in my survey, and also to some extent
person A in the interview, did not really have the knowledge to handle these issues. As far as
institutional logics are concerned, the theory provided my analysis with quite a suitable
framework; in many situations described by the respondents, traits of parallel institutional logics,
decoupling, structural differentiation, and compromising accounts could be identified. The model
is also suitable, since it allows for different aims of integrations to be considered – although
compromising accounts may often be the optimal solution, some contexts may also call for
structural differentiation.
The result from the survey indicated that monetary rewards are still a commonly used method for
motivating employees, but non-monetary factors such as career development are also used.
Person A also mentioned monetary reward systems used to keep key persons in the company for
the most critical period of the integration, but he failed to give examples of other reward types.
Initially, also person B concentrated on monetary rewards to specific groups, but he suggested
that an integration team should be appointed for coordinating the acquisition. This, I argue, can be
seen as a non-monetary reward, as it provides employees with power and responsibility. If trust is
to be used as a means for motivating employees, the organization must acknowledge intrinsic
motivation as an important factor.
For the managers in the survey, the role of MCs remained rather unclear, and the most useful
insight was the fact that most respondents reported MCs being implemented top-down. This
confirms Egbe’s (2018) research. Person A in the financial sector reported that they only use key
financial figures for their benchmark and control. This may indicate that a certain industry might
have an impact on what MCs are used, as few other respondents provided similar answers. Person
B explained that he prefers seeing MCs as a process rather than a system. He also mentioned that
specific milestones are defined for different parts of the integration and that these are described
in detail in something that can be compared to an “integration handbook”. This certainly
complicates the lively debate on MCs a system or a package even further. Grabner and Moers
(2013) claim that the system view sees an MC as consisting of many different parts (controls) that
are designed in such a way that they consider each other. In the empirical part of my study, I
57

found no evidence of managers designing controls is such a detailed way. MCs as a package, on
the other hand, are an embodiment of all control practices in an organization, without
consideration of potential interdependencies. This model can at least partially be compared to the
M&A handbook approach described by person B. However, person B’s approach was even more
pragmatic, as he preferred using the term processes instead of management control system. Based
on my empirical findings, it seems that the package view would better correspond to the real
world situation, at least as it was mirrored in my research. Although I have not found any empirical
evidence for it in my material, I still find Demartini and Otley’s (2020) model interesting, as they
argue that MCs can also be seen as a continuum with system and package poles. From a
theoretical perspective, this model seems logical and worthwhile analyzing further. The question
is, how many practicing managers that can identify themselves and their actions with this
somewhat complicated model.
In the survey, most managers reported no examples of how they deal with trust building in their
organization. This may indicate either a lack of familiarity with the topic or tacit knowledge.
Managers seem to have learned to deal with trust-related issues through own experience. Person
A’s role in this context is rather complicated as he is a representative of a financing institute. In his
role, he claims that he works primarily with the highest management teams of the organizations
and not with the entire body of employees. Person A strongly emphasized quantitative controls.
Person B presented several interesting ideas concerning the role of trust. Firstly, the appointment
of the integration team is supposed to anchor the cornerstones of the integration on a broader
level. Secondly, the integration team also has time allocated for dealing with acquisition-related
issues. Thirdly, person B also mentioned external consultants as a way of improving trust through
the use of external benchmarking. In both person A’s and person B’s answers, elements of both
calculative and affective trust can be identified. At the beginning of an integration, or when
required by law or certain industries, rules and contracts are by no means signs of distrust. As
Akrout and Diallo (2017) argue, most new relationships are characterized by calculative trust, i.e.
partners trying to win the other party’s trust by proving themselves reliable when following rules
and agreements. At a later stage, the calculative trust should usually develop into affective trust,
i.e., a situation where less formal rules are needed, as partners sense emotional confidence. Based
on my limited empirical research, Akrout and Diallo’s (2017) model seems quite useful; it
encompasses not only different types of trust, but also allows for the gradual development of trust
58

from one form to another. Yet again, for a business context, the problem seems to be that many
managers are not aware of how complex the phenomenon of trust is. As they may not identify
calculative trust as a type of trust, it also becomes difficult for them to grasp how trust can be
generated at the beginning of a business relationship, e.g., in an acquisition context.
I aimed at a theory-testing approach for my thesis, and when comparing the results from the
entire empirical part with previous research, my results largely confirm earlier findings; most
managers are not able to actively describe how they work to create trust within their organization.
The only exception was person B, with decades of targeted experience in this field. However, he is
not part of the daily life of any specific organization anymore, and it certainly would be profitable
if this kind of knowledge would be available in-house on a broader basis.
To conclude this chapter, an attempt to answer the empirical research question should be made.
The question was: How do Finnish managers improve trust building during the integration
process? Based on the results of the survey and the interviews, the answer is that Finnish
managers try to build trust in quite different and mostly unconscious ways. Most managers in the
survey had not given the topic much active thought, and they presented no systematic methods.
They reported relying heavily on communication, but the contents of the talks and discussions
remained unclear. No-one provided any examples of using the VAS as a starting point, and no-one
talked about how trust changes form over time. Mostly, the managers seemed to aim at achieving
affective trust. Elements of calculative trust were mentioned only in the interviews, and only
person B – a very highly ranked professional – seems to have acknowledged that both calculative
and affective trust have their own place in a management control context.

59

5. Concluding discussion

The leading research question for this thesis was: “How can MCs be used to improve trust building
during the integration phase?”. The question was approached through a presentation of previous
literature concerning the fields culture, motivation, MCs and trust building. The four thematic
fields should not be seen as separate themes, but rather as building blocks for the phenomenon as
a whole. This means that culture, motivation and MCs play an important role for the outcome
concerning trust within the organization. These topics were then compared to empiric material
from an online survey with 29 Finnish managers and two semi-structured interviews with Finnish
managers experienced in acquisition processes. In this concluding chapter, the above-mentioned
themes will therefore no longer be treated separately, but instead the discussion will focus on
how they all influence the trust-building process.
As far as trust building is concerned, trust is connected to integrity, commitment and
dependability (Chathot et al., 2011). According to Akrout and Diallo (2017), trust can be seen as a
process that starts with calculative trust and moves towards affective trust, if the relationship
develops well. Gradually, the calculative and affective trust starts to be seen as behavioral trust
between parties. Calculative trust is usually the dominant type of trust in new relationships
(Akrout and Diallo, 2017). In the survey, calculative trust took the form of managers reporting
their MCs to have qualities such as monitoring and goal-oriented. Calculative trust during the
integration stage was also mentioned in both interviews; person A mentioned key numbers and
the measurable input from key persons, whereas person B mentioned bonus programs and the
use of external consultants as a benchmark. However, no one, perhaps with the exception of
person B, seemed to identify these control elements as creators of trust. Affective trust was
mentioned in the survey in the form of managers describing their MCs as fair or communicative.
Affective trust was not mentioned at all in interview A nor explicitly by person B. However, several
other aspects mentioned by person B can be identified as containing elements of affective trust.
This was particularly the case with the appointment of an integration team with members from
different parts of the organization. This appointment can also be seen as a sign of behavioral trust
as it has already affected the actions taken within the organization. In other words, calculative
60

trust should not be mistaken for supervision, as it can in fact be the first stepping-stone in the
trust-building process.
The relationship between calculative and affective trust can also be reflected in the context of
MCs. Management’s intention may be to create calculative trust by setting clear rules and targets
and systems for following up on these. However, not all employees necessarily perceive the
situation as trust-creating. A situation, which one employee may perceive as enabling or trustgenerating, can be coersive, trust-minimizing, for another. This is in line with Väisänen et al.’s
(2020) claim that no MC is ever fully coersive or enabling, but rather moves in a situationdependent continuum. This can be the result of different organizational or national cultures or
due to different personalities. In this context, it is important to remember Hofstede’s (2012) claim
that national cultures cannot be changed, whereas the organizational culture may be altered, if
much time and effort can be invested in the process. In the answers to the survey, a lack of deeper
knowledge was visible concerning how organizational culture can be managed. Person B
illustrated these problematics on several occasions by giving examples of how careful processes
enabled the change of an organization culture, but when two national cultures met, the cultures
and their representatives needed to consider each other rather than change the other party.
National culture traits are too deeply rooted to be changed by an MC.
According to Demartini and Otley (2020), an MC fostering both efficiency and innovation may be
valuable for an organization. According to the so-called coupling theory, rationality and
indeterminacy can coexist in an MC characterized by a coupling of moderate strength. As I see it,
an MC with these qualities should also have the possibility for employees perceiving systems as
both enabling and coercive.
In previous research, a conscious use of the VAS has been presented as one way of benefiting
from the experience gathered within the acquired entity before the acquisition (Goretzki et al.,
2018). None of the managers in the survey nor in the interviews mentioned this phenomenon.
This may indicate that new entities cannot profit from the advantages of so-called compromising
accounts to a maximum. It seems that the main goal would still be to be to make the acquired
organization part of the acquiring organization as efficiently as possible. Of course, this is
dependent on the goals set for the specific integration; some settings may accept more
61

independent solutions and entities than others. As argued in the theoretical chapter, for some
contexts, structural differentiation may be quite a good solution.
As can be seen, the trust-building process is not easy to grasp nor dependent on one specific
factor. Rather, it should be seen as an evolving process between the parties involved during the
integration of two or more organizations. This further highlights the importance of a transparent
and continuous flow of communication between the managers and the employees. However, the
communication efforts should be based on thought-through contents, in line with the thoughts of
Audi et al. (2015) who stress the importance of cultural training and transparent redundancy
policies. Also Bansal (2016) argues that communication without contents is not enough.
Concentrating on cooperation between contents and communication also reduces the risk of
empty promises of “talk” as a solution, which was mentioned in several of the survey answers. In
this context, it is also worthwhile remembering that trust does not mean agreeing on everything;
trust is rather a question of transparency, creating an atmosphere, where parties can rely on
matters being openly discussed regardless of whether the topics are likely to be perceived as
positive or negative.
One of the questions that arouse in the literature review was whether MCs should be seen as a
system or a package. In the interviews and the survey, it became evident that managers on all
levels of organizations seemed to lack knowledge of the theoretical concepts of MCs. Person B
suggested that the term processes would perhaps be more suitable for describing the procedures
that he had initiated.
This takes us to the policy-oriented research question set for my thesis: What should managers do
to improve trust building during an integration? Based on the results of my study, I argue that
three main factors should be considered. Firstly, an understanding of the concept of trust is
needed; if managers knew that trust in new relationships often takes a calculative form, it could
be easier to approach the topic in a professional way. This may also provide the trust-related work
with more systematical structure, so that managers do not need to see “talk” as the only solution.
Secondly, if managers want to start using trust as a means of enabling control, they have to start
by diversifying their reward systems beyond the traditional monetary rewards that focus on
extrinsic motivation. Acknowledging intrinsic motivation is a prerequisite for organizational trust.
Thirdly, the concept of institutional logics and the outcome of competing parallel logics would help
62

illustrate potential scenarios that may arise. These concepts and scenarios could help managers
understand the existing options in terms of organizational culture after an integration. Insights
from institutional logics could also act as a warning; if everything seems to be going well on the
surface, a risk for decoupling exists. Usually, conscious work and creative friction lead to better
end-results than stakeholders, who pretend to be content on the surface, but do something else
behind the scenes.
To return to the leading research question - How can MCs be used to improve trust building during
the integration phase?: I argue that MCs certainly can be used to improve trust building during an
acquisition. However, for trust to be built, all thematical fields presented in this thesis must be
considered together. Trust is a holistic phenomenon, with tentacles in many directions. Moreover,
the concept of MCs, and especially detailed academic discussions on the topic, do not seem to be
widely spread among Finnish managers. If they are to profit from academic findings concerning
MCs, terminology needs to be rooted in a more pragmatic setting. Managers would certainly also
profit from more in-depth academic knowledge – however, many managers do not report that
they lack familiarity with these topics, and therefore, I see a risk that they are also not able to
identify training needs in this field. Since so little is known about these topics in the business
world, I see great potential for increased, purposeful work on organizational trust.
This thesis has been limited in several ways: firstly, M&As were divided into mergers and
acquisitions, and then focus was laid solely on the latter. This choice was made since an analysis of
both phenomena together would have been too broad. Secondly, this thesis has only focused on
management’s perspective on trust building; a choice made based on management’s tendency to
be the active part in creating the MCs. Thirdly, the thesis was limited by geographically
concentrating on managers from Finland, a decision based on two factors: eliminating the impact
of different national cultures, and for gaining access to interviews from the chosen group.
Further research should involve more interviews from a specific industry, so that proper
comparisons between somewhat similar organizations could be made. It would also be worthwhile
analyzing the impact of national culture as far as trust building is concerned, for instance as a
comparison between Finland and Sweden. As Finns are traditionally seen as more action-oriented
than Swedes, who concentrate more on shared decision-making, it seems logical that this also
would have an impact on how trust is built.

6. Swedish summary
Ledningens kontrollsystem som ett verktyg för att skapa tillit under företagsförvärv
Företagstransaktioner har stor betydelse för en organisations utvecklingskurva. Enligt Porter
(1997) är organisationens strategi ett sätt att positionera sig gentemot kunder och konkurrenter.
Trots att företagstransaktioner är av stor betydelse, verkar många av dem misslyckas (Moschieri
och Campa, 2014; Slangen, 2006; Dikova och Sahib, 2013, Bansal, 2016). En stor del av
misslyckandena kan förklaras med en för hög köpesumma, men Čirjevskis (2020) hävdar att också
kulturella skillnader är en orsak. I min avhandling kommer fokus att ligga på dessa mänskliga
faktorer, eftersom jag analyserar hur ledningens kontrollsystem kan utnyttjas under
integrationsfasen för att skapa tillit inom organisationen. Jag har valt att avgränsa undersökningen
till enbart företagsförvärv, trots att tidigare forskning oftast behandlar förvärv och fusioner som
en gemensam helhet.
Tidigare forskning har bara i begränsad utsträckning undersökt vilken roll tillit spelar under
integrationsfasen av ett förvärv (Bansal, 2016). Speciellt lite är känt om hur chefer och ledare i
praktiken skapar tillit. Frågan om tillit relaterar också till hur en organisation kan stärka de
anställdas inre motivation, något som har fått betydligt mindre uppmärksamhet inom
ekonomistyrning än monetära belöningssystem. Från forskningsfältet kan också rapporteras att en
diskussion under senare år har förts om huruvida kontrollsystem ska ses som ett system eller som
ett paket; ska de enskilda kontrollelementen betraktas som sammanvävda eller autonoma? Med
utgångspunkt i dessa frågeställningar och forskningsluckor lyder min forskningsfråga: Hur kan
ledningens kontrollsystem utnyttjas för att förbättra tilliten under en integrationsfas?
För att man ska kunna analysera forskningsfrågan måste fyra tematiska områden beaktas,
eftersom de alla påverkar tillitsprocessen. Dessa är kultur, motivation, kontrollsystem och tillit.
Kulturens påverkan kan ses i form av både nationell kultur och organisationskultur. Hofstede
(2010) har hävdat att den nationella kulturen är så gott som omöjlig att påverka, vilket innebär att
egenskaper som har sina rötter i denna behöver beaktas snarare än förändras. En
organisationskultur, å andra sidan, kan påverkas och förändras, men då krävs tålamod och
återkommande diskussioner med personalen (Malmi och Brown, 2008; Hofstede, 2012). För att
64

systematiskt motivera de anställda att jobba mot samma mål, behöver man arbeta för att
bibehålla eller stärka deras motivation (Malmi och Brown, 2008; Lepak et al.,2007). När monetära
eller icke-monetära belöningssystem införs som ett led i detta arbete, blir uppföljningen viktig.
Risken är att för starkt fokus på yttre motivation och monetära belöningar inverkar negativt på
faktorer som tillit. Detta berör också den teoretiska frågeställningen om huruvida ledningens
kontrollsystem ska ses som ett system med starkt sammankopplade delar och stark kontroll, eller
som ett lösare sammansatt paket, som tillåter mer kreativitet på bekostnad av kontrollfunktionen.
En möjlig väg att gå är den som föreslås av Demartini och Otley (2020): att se ledningens
kontrollsystem som ett kontinuum, som möjliggör en kombination av kontroll och kreativitet.
Det sista tematiska området, tillit, är också det minst undersökta i tidigare forskning. Enligt Audi
m.fl. (2015), har tillit inom organisationen kunnat kopplas till att medarbetarna känner sig nöjdare,
anstränger sig mer, presterar bättre och arbetar bättre i grupp. Enligt Chathot m.fl. (2011)
omfattar det svårdefinierade begreppet tillit åtminstone dimensionerna integritet, engagemang
och ömsesidigt beroende, vilka alla har bevisats korrelera med förbättrade resultat i
organisationen. Även om starkt fokus på kontroll kan medföra att medarbetarna känner sig
övervakade och begränsade, är det viktigt att minnas att tillit och tydligt uppgjorda och följda
system inte behöver utgöra motsatspoler. Akrout och Diallo (2017) belyser detta genom att
beskriva hur tillit utvecklas från kognitiv till affektiv; i början av ett förhållande bygger tillit på att
parterna följer överenskommelser och visar sig trovärdiga för varandra (kognitiv tillit). Först i ett
senare stadium kan tilliten utvecklas i affektiv riktning, så att parterna litar på varandra utan
formell reglering. Att utarbeta tydliga regler under en integrationsprocess innebär alltså inget
misstroendevotum.
I den empiriska delen av min avhandling skapade jag ett online-frågeformulär med 18 frågor,
uppdelade enligt de tematiska områden som jag beskrev ovan. Enkäten skickades till 50 finländare
i chefspositioner. Svaren från 29 personer var relevanta och analyserades med hjälp av
innehållsanalys så att svaren kodades i grupper bestående av de fyra tematiska områdena. En
enkät når ganska lätt en större grupp respondenter, även under den Covid-19-pandemi som rådde
under tiden för denna avhandling. Begränsningarna för en enkät är bland annat att det är omöjligt
att ställa följdfrågor, och inte heller kan man få bättre förklaringar på ett otydligt svar. För att
stöda svaren från enkäten höll jag därför två semi-strukturerade intervjuer med personer som
65

arbetat med företagstransaktioner. Begränsningarna här är att jag bara kunde intervjua två
personer, och att jag bara fick deras syn på saken. Styrkorna var att det gick att ställa följdfrågor
och närmare bena ut tolkningsbara svar. Denna triangulering innebar alltså att jag kunde minimera
de skadliga konsekvenserna av respektive metod.
Respondenterna i enkäten misslyckades i tämligen stor utsträckning med att visa att de förstått
begreppen kultur, motivation, kontrollsystem och tillit på en djupare nivå. Resultaten från
intervjuerna var tudelade; person A gav svar som likande dem i enkäten, vilket delvis kan bero på
hens professionella inriktning. Person B har en bakgrund som uppenbart lämpade sig för mina
frågor, och hen kunde förklara och ge svar på frågorna på en djupare nivå.
När jag jämförde resultaten från de empiriska undersökningarna med tidigare forskning
bekräftade mina svar tidigare fynd: största delen av ledarna misslyckas i att förklara hur de arbetar
för att skapa tillit inom sin organisation; de som innehar förmågan, har den i form av tyst kunskap.
Det enda undantaget var person B, som har många års relevant erfarenhet av företagsförvärv och
integreringar. Problemet är att experter på denna nivå inte är speciellt många till antalet och att
deras kunskap därmed inte syns i gängse företags verksamhet.
För att återgå till forskningsfrågan: Hur kan ledningens kontrollsystem utnyttjas för att förbättra
tilliten under en integrationsfas?, vill jag poängtera att det är viktigt att betrakta avhandlingens
teman (kultur, motivation, kontrollsystem, tillit) som en helhet. Om man gör detta, hävdar jag att
kontrollsystem kan användas för att förbättra tillit. Det är emellertid viktigt att minnas begreppet
kontrollsystem verkar obekant för många chefer, speciellt om diskussionen går in på nyanser om
system och paket. Om man vill använda vetenskapliga resultat för att förbättra tillitsskapande,
behöver man använda diskurs som yrkesverksamma chefer förstår.

som är hemskt långt ifrån varandra med sin verksamhet eller något. Jag var med där, jag var
liksom integrationsansvarig, men då börjar den här svenska utvecklingschefen och berätta vilka
processer de hade i sin utveckling, i sitt utvecklingsarbete, vi berättade om vilka tidtabeller vi
hade, och vilken budget vi hade. Också när den finska killen fick sin muntur, så börjar han berätta och det här är ju på engelska för vi hade ju inget gemensamt språk när finnar och svenskar
träffas… Så där så började han att berätta om vilka tekniska lösningar som var i pipelinen och
varför de var överlägsna alla andra… Så du förstår ju att diskussionen varade inte mer än i 20
minuter och så hade de inte något mera att tala om”
Q2:
“I Sverige diskuterar man och förankrar. Det tar evigheter och så kommer man fram till ett beslut
och då är alla förankrade, alla är med på det där beslutet, men det tar en jäkla tid. I Finland är det
oftast så att chefen kanske frågar lite vad ni tycker och så tar han ett beslut, och så ska det på
något sätt efter beslutet förankras i organisationen och verkställas. Det är ganska stor skillnad.”
Q3:
“Du ska inte försöka implementera att tyskarna skulle börja dua, utan de niar och du ska
respektera det. Det heter ”Herr X” och inte ”du” eller förnamn, utan det är sådana bitar ska man
liksom passa sig.. Och det var många som trodde att man kunde… även om vi talar engelska med
dem, så trodde de att man skulle kunna liksom göra en sådan där relaxed stämning genom att
dua.”
Q4:
“Jag hade varit VD där då ett tag, så kommer herr KMB efter att jag hade plattat till
organisationen, så att istället för 3 direktrapporterande så hade jag 10 direktrapporterande. Då
kommer fastighetsansvariga herr KMB in på rummet med en stor ritning och säger att han skulle
vilja ha i uppdrag att försöka börja hitta ett nytt kontorshus åt oss. Jag förstod förstås ingenting varför han ville det. Nå, han förklarade att i organisationshandboken så står det att varje
direktrapporterande till vd ska ha 3 fönster i sitt rum. Nu när det är tie, så räcker fönstren inte till
mera i det här huset, vi måste få ett nytt hus. […] Nä, herr KMB fick gå via kassan och jag tackade
för hans tjänster.”

Q5:
“Det finns några saker där du kan inte behålla någonting avslängt, som du liksom låter leva sitt
eget liv. Som har ett egenvärde utan att man integrerar det eller skapar en gemensam kultur.
I synnerhet i sådana organisationer som egentligen ska kunna konkurrera gemensamt. Ta till
exempel då mobiltelefoner eller datorer - där kan man inte ha så många olika kulturer eller
företagskulturer, utan alla måste jobba åt samma håll.”
Q6:
“Det är realistiskt att skapa en gemensam kultur men det tar tid och det är en jädrans massa
arbete och du måste ha ett integrationsteam som aktivt jobbar med också de där kulturella
frågorna och framför allt att skapa en ny gemensam strategi.”
Q7:
“Nog kan man påverka, men det är ett segt och jobbigt arbete som bygger väldigt mycket på att du
måste skapa gemensamma värderingar, som är som är liksom avtvättade alla de kulturella
värdena och värderingarna. Det kan vara vet du att man respekterar individen och alla är värda sin
lön och så vidare. Men utmaningen är att få alla parterna med på en på en resa mot någonting
bättre och för att de ska komma med på en resa så borde man alltid kunna utstaka ett tydligt mål
som är både monetärt, finansiellt och verksamhetsmässigt”
Q8:
“Nyckelpersonerna får man gärna på högsta nivå utse så fort som möjligt efter integrationen. Men
sen så har de ju i uppdrag att bygga organisationen neråt och utse sina medhjälpare och då
kommer det att uppstå också en förteckning över alla nyckelpersoner på alla håll där, och då ofta
när man vet att det finns sådana här nyckelpersoner, är de sen tie eller hundra, så erbjuder man
dem olika typer av bonus. Vi till exempel hade såna här tolvmånaders stay-on-bord-bonusar som
var ganska väl tilltagna, alltså det var ungefär ett halvår lön om du stannade ett år kvar. Och sen
var det sådana där man så fort man fick till exempel resten av årets nya budgeten, sammanslagna
budgeten, så då såg man över de individuella bonussystemen så att de nya målen fanns
återspeglade i bonussystemet. Och jag menar, de där bonussystemen som vi på den tiden hade,
de utgjorde ungefär 40 % av den fasta lönen.”
Q9:
”Finns det nyckelpersoner där, eller finns det liksom som kunskap som man måste säkerställa att
finns kvar i bolaget, och då vill vi ju gärna också se att det finns en tidsbunden eller nån form av
avtal för dom här, för att hålla kvar sådan kunskap… som … jag menar om det här företagsköpet
baserar sig på att det finns en viss kunskap som det här bolaget sitter på, så är det ju ofta i de här
personerna och då säger vi nog att vi liksom förutsätter att den här kunskapen ska hållas där. Och
då är det ju nog ofta liksom något avtal, alltså att personen ska stanna en viss tid och liksom som
motsats till, eller som så att säga beef där det liksom ofta frågan om någon monetär kompensation
antingen i form av ett arvode, som betalas efter den här tiden som man förutsätter att den här
9

personen är. Eller sen, ganska ofta, säger vi nog också att man binder där de här personerna med i
bolagets ägande, att de får en liten steak i det här köpta bolagen.”
Q10:
“Och det är nog en av de största och viktigaste uppgifterna för en sån här integrationsprocess och
en ledning av en integration, och där jag kraftigt rekommenderar att man skapar en egen
integrationsorganisation som inte är samma som linjeorganisationen, utan där är där finns då
representanter för båda parterna och där finns representanter från lite olika nivåer i
organisationen som ska driva en strukturerad integration som är välplanerad, som har en tidtabell,
som har också liksom delmål och som framförallt har ett jättestort ansvar i att kommunicera och
berätta vart man är på väg, vad man håller på med och så vidare.”
Q11:
”I synnerhet när det är multinationellt så måste man hålla i det. Men till exempel, nog har ju Nokia
haft sådana här integrationer eller sådana här utvecklingscentra som har haft ganska fria händer
att utveckla själva saker men då har de ju tydliga mål och en uppgift att utveckla en ny basstation,
5G-basstationen eller en ny display eller något sånt.”
Q12:
”Vi koncentrerar oss på kassaflöde, så vi kontrollerar liksom på det viset att bolaget följer de
målsättningar som vi har kommit överens.”
Q13:
“Framförallt så har det varit processer mer än system, alltså att det fanns nästan en handbok på
vilka faser som ska uppföljas i integrationsarbetet som ju ofta stod om, minimi 6 månader, men för
det mesta tog det ett år. Jag hade uppdrag en gång på att integrera i tie länder på 12 månader. Så
jag fick ju fara som en skottspole över allt då, och då hade jag ett sekretariat som hade ett
minutiöst system där man hade de olika integrationsprocesserna och deras liksom milestones
definierade, och så var det varje vecka en uppföljning på de här milestones, dit de fick rapportera
in.”
Q14:
“Det behöver inte vara de högst uppsatta i den operativa ledningen, utan det finns sådana här
påverkare i organisationer, i alla organisationer, såna här inofficiella influencers som det heter på
engelska, som påverkar stämningen i en organisation. Man borde kunna identifiera sådana och ta
med dem i integrationsarbete som jobbar med den där gemensamma strukturen, och
gemensamma målen och integrationen och de här killarna eller flickorna, damerna, vilka det nu
sen är - de kommer att sprida också det där budskapet. Det ska finnas från båda sidorna
representanter där med och under integrationsfasen så ska de ha en stor makt och de ska kunna
ges mycket förtroende också. Och genom det så visar de genom exemplet att man kan driva en
gemensam fråga framåt.”

Q15:
”De uppköpta enheternas ledning har försökt kusettaa huvudmannen, liksom ekonomiskt också:
bygger till exempel halmtak på sitt hus på firmans bekostnad eller gör några annat…
Men jag skulle säga nog det att det är en allmän grej; om inte line of command är tydlig, om inte
ansvarsfördelningen är tydlig, finns det alltid en risk att det finns någon som börjar liksom kusettaa
på ett eller annat sätt. Så att om du har då en sammanslagen organisation och du har till exempel
en Europa-ansvarig som sitter i de här lokala styrelserna och att om den där VD:n av någon
anledning lyckas kringgå sin egen styrelse och den här Europa-ansvariga, och säger att han har en
direktkontakt med VD:n, så då är då är det fara på torpet redan att han det där hävdar någonstans
att ”men det är han kommit överens med VD:n att det har ni ingenting med att göra” Då vet man
inte riktigt hur man ska göra i sådana fall. Så ja, line of command tydlighet och kommunikation.”
Q16:
”Jag sålde en finsk Metso-enhet till Tyskland och det dröjde inte länge så hade tyskarna
implementerat allting och alla var nöjda och glada, men de respekterade ju det utvecklingsarbete
som finnarna hade gjort och samma var det när Continental köpte Elektrobit, så var det ju också så
att de ville åt teknologin och kunnandet hos de här killarna, men de implementerade nog sina
egna rapporterings- och kontrollsystem. Ofta är det så att den uppköpande enheten nog utser en
lokal som vd.”
Q17:
“I och med det att de hade då highstreet-logo på de dokument som de producerar i massor, där
det kom liksom olika policy papper och det kom det ena och det andra så gav det lite extra
trovärdighet - att det var ingenting som varken Nokia eller Ericsson eller Luxor eller någon annan
hade hittat själv på, utan det såg ut som professionell dokumentation, och det var det också.”
Q18:
“Sen finns ofta också någon form av tidsbundna klausuler, så att gamla ägaren måste sitta sitter
kvar en viss tid och sånt, så då märks det inte heller innan sen förstås gamla ägare så att säga
träder ut helt och hållet, och då kan det hända att det blir någon ändring.”
Q19:
“Världen förändras så mycket att det är liksom svårt att avtala vad vi kommer att göra om 5 år”
Q20:
“Jag brukar säga då redan att man ska gödsla med information, det är tjatigt men man måste
liksom hålla på varje vecka och upprepa det… och sen först när organisationen börjar känna igen
sig i budskapet så sen först börjar det att hända någon integration också. Om man inte får dem
med och förstå helheten: vart vi är på väg och varför vi är på väg, så då blir det sådana här
subkulturer och de börjar motverka det ena och det andra.”
11

Q21:
“Jag återgår till det där, att det måste finnas en tydlig plan och en enorm kommunikationsinsats.
Alltså man ska gödsla med kommunikation och berätta - och det ska finnas tydliga ansvariga
personer som ansvarar för integrationen”
Q22:
“Men gällande tid och kommunikation kan man missa ganska mycket… och med
misskommunikation kan man liksom screw up hela skiten. Det hände i Spanien att Nokias och
Ericssons organisationer höll på att konkurrera om samma affär inom banksystem och det dröjde
inte mer än tie dagar efter den här annonseringen, så hade varenda en av spanjorerna sagt upp sig
och försvunnit. Och det var långt borta, det var ingen av högsta ledningen som egentligen förstod
vad frågan var och ingen hade liksom lyssnat på deras problem där. Utan de där Nokiakillarna, det
var ju Nokia som gjorde förvärvet, hade gått ut och varit kaxiga och sagt att nu ska vi köra så som
vi bestämmer.”
Q23:
“Så kan det hända att den uppköpta organisationen börjar revoltera. Innan man hinner in genom
dörren och ens granska vad det är på gång, så hade en VD skrivit under nya anställningsavtal åt
sina direktrapporterande direktörer med stora avgångsvederlag. Och de hade vänt på det hela och
sagt att nu sitter vi bara här stilla i båten, men vi har våra nya avtal och väntar på att Nokia
kommer och ger foten åt oss… och så cashar ni in det där. Så det kan gå på det sättet också, men
där åtalade vi ju VD:n för trolöshet mot huvudman och han fick ju han fick ju ersätta, alltså han fick
ju foten direkt och det fick ju hans kaverin också”
