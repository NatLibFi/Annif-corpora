Abstract
Artificial noses are analytical instruments inspired by the human olfactory system and have
been applied for qualitative analysis in many industrial fields, agriculture, forestry,
environmental monitoring as well as medical diagnostics. This methodology intends to
differentiate volatile organic compounds and their mixtures based on non-selective chemical
sensors’ responses and suitable data processing algorithms. In the comparison to the
common trial-and-error approach in the synthesis of sensor materials, in this work, it was
attempted to gain a better understanding of signal formation mechanisms in gas sensors and
to build a reliable platform for testing selectivity of sensor materials. The heart of the in-house
built artificial nose was the gas chamber with split flows whose construction was based on
geometry optimisation experiments. The gas chamber contained a filter paper substrate with
casted sensor materials, aluminium and Teflon® blocks and connecting elements. As the
sensor materials, composites of poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) and seven of its derivates
(chloromethyl-,
acetoxymethyl-,
azidomethyl-,
imidazoliummethyl-,
aminomethyl-,
hydroxymethyl- and L-phenylalanine-derivate) with poly(vinyl chloride) (7:3, m:m) were
utilised. Due to the poor repeatability of the casting process and differences of polymers’ sheet
resistances, a problem that a broad range of sensor resistances cannot be measured in
parallel was encountered. However, multilayer drop-casting, reduction of sensor dimensions,
connecting of a constant resistor in parallel or series to the sensor and utilising of copolymers
of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and functionalised EDOTs helped in achieving the
simultaneous measurement of all sensors’ resistances. It was found to be hard to predict the
sensors' responses to different solvents. However, several factors were identified to be
important in signal formation: hydrogen bond formation between an analyte molecule and the
sensor material, the polarity of the analyte and the size of the analyte molecules. The efficiency
of the instrument was demonstrated in the analysis of four organic solvents (methanol,
ethanol, dichloromethane, and chloroform). It was found that a simple classification model
based on the distances between an object and cluster centres can provide 79% accuracy in
the case of the four solvents or 100% accuracy in the classification problem of methanol and
ethanol. The latter can be a promising result for quality control in the spirits industry.

1. Introduction
Artificial nose, also called electronic nose or electrical nose (e-nose), is a device that mimics
the biological olfactory mechanism. The pioneering work in this field dates from the 1960s.
However, a rapid expansion of articles, as well as the term ‘electrical nose’, appeared in the
late 1980s.1
In Figure 1.1, the comparison of human olfactory and an electronic nose system is given. After
entering the nasal cavity, the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) bind to receptor cells in the
nasal epithelium. This process is equivalent to binding of VOCs to chemical sensors in an
electronic nose. The next step in both systems is signal transduction. In biological systems, a
small amplitude current is generated, and the signal is sent to the olfactory cortex in the brain.
On the other hand, in e-nose systems, there are three general transduction mechanisms –
mass, optical and electrochemical transduction.2 The last step is the smell recognition that
takes place in the cortex in the biological systems, while different data mining algorithms can
be utilised in the electronic analogue.3 In contrast to individual sensors, that require high
selectivity, artificial nose technology is not based on lock-and-key recognition. Instead, this
technology intends to obtain non-selective responses from different sensors and in that way
to cover the broadest possible range of VOCs.4

Figure 1.1. Comparison of an electric nose and the human olfactory system
Artificial noses have found applications in many industrial fields for quality control.4 Just in the
food and drink industry, e-noses are a promising tool in the analysis of meat, fish, oils, honey,
fruits and vegetables, milk and dairy products, wine, tea, coffee, beers etc.5,6 Other important
application areas of e-noses are environmental monitoring7, detection of hazardous and
explosive chemicals8 and air quality assessment9. A possible application of artificial noses in
agriculture and forestry10 is also described in the literature.
Since 2000, several articles suggest a possible application of the electronic nose technology
in medical diagnostics.11 This application is based on the detection of the disease-specific
volatile metabolites or metabolic side products in human-related sources such as breath,
sweat, urine, faeces, secretions or blood.12 There are several attempts to utilise e-nose
technology in diagnostics of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder,
lung cancer, tuberculosis and asthma. Besides diagnostic of a disease, monitoring of lung
disease progression is also possible. e-Noses have a potential application for diagnosis of
psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders (schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease,
Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis), diseases of the urinary system (chronic kidney
1

disease, urinary tract infections and haematuria), diseases of the digestive system
(inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer) and other diseases (diabetes, breast
cancer, prostate cancer and eye infections).11
When it comes to sensor technology applied in e-noses, there are several attempts to increase
their selectivity by modifying material morphology or their functionalisation.13 However, the
synthesis of sensor materials is often based on a trial-and-error approach with a lack of
molecule design.14 My hypothesis was that bio-inspired polymer materials could show better
performance in comparison to commonly used chemical sensors based on metal oxides for
biomedical applications. In this regard, the aim of this thesis was to build a reliable platform
for easy and fast testing of selectivity of different sensing materials. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and its derivates were selected as a model system, due to their chemical,
electrical and thermal stability. A robotic arm was employed as an autosampler in order to
facilitate the injection process and to make it more reproducible. A synthetic approach based
on chloromethyl derivate of 3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene was presented along with the
synthesis of one novel material with phenylalanine attached. A gas chamber with a
symmetrically split flow was designed in accordance with the results of geometry optimisation.
The response of 8 different materials was compared on the set of several volatile organic
solvents. The results of this thesis can help in better understand sensing mechanisms and
prediction of selectivity of different sensor materials.

2. Literature overview
2.1.

Signal transduction mechanisms in e-nose technology

Artificial noses and tongues can be seen as an array of chemical sensors that transform
chemical information (the qualitative and quantitative composition of a sample) into a
measurable physical property – analytical signal. We can classify the transduction
mechanisms employed in e-nose technology according to the measurable property (operating
principle) into three groups: mass, optical and electrochemical transduction.
Mass transduction makes use of the piezoelectric effect and crystals so that the analytical
signal is represented as a change of oscillation frequency upon deposition of an analyte to the
sensing material. There are two types of piezoelectric sensors that can be found in e-nose
technology – the quartz crystal microbalances (QCM) and the surface acoustic wave (SAW)
devices. In QCM, the surface of the crystal is coated with a material that should provide
selective binding, such as acetyl cellulose or lecithin membranes.11 The change in the quartz
oscillation frequency (∆𝜈) as a function of the mass of deposited material (∆𝑚) is given by the
Sauerbrey equation:
∆𝜈 = −2.3 ∙ 106 𝜈02

∆𝑚
,
𝐴

Eq (1)

where 𝜈0 is the resonant frequency of the quartz crystal and 𝐴 is the area coated my sensing
material.15 The selectivity of these sensors is controlled by the coating thickness.16
A SAW device consists of two piezoelectric crystals (transmitter and receiver) and a sensing
material coated on a substrate between the transducers. Commonly used piezoelectric
materials are zinc oxide, lithium niobate, lithium tantalate and quartz.17 The difference between
the transmitted and received frequencies depends on the concentration of a gas analyte
adsorbed on the sensing material.18
Optical transduction involves materials whose interactions with light change when an
analyte binds to them. Among this transduction group, fluorescent and photometric sensors
are the most popular.3 A typical optical sensor is fabricated as an ultra-thin layer of sensing
material on an optical fibre tip.19 In the e-nose technology, multiple fibres are combine allowing
simultaneous analysis of numerous analytes.20
Photometric sensors contain solvatochromic pigments such as metalloporphyrins or
metallophthalocyanines. The analytical signal is a consequence of the changes of 𝜋 − 𝜋
interaction between tetrapyrrole rings upon interaction with an analyte, which leads to
broadening, splitting and shifts in the absorbance peaks in UV-Vis spectra.21 Alternatively, a
conductive polymer can be applied as a sensing layer, when its conformational changes or
changes in doping level are monitored with UV-Vis or NIR spectroscopies.14
Similarly, fluorescent sensors consist of fluorescent dyes whose florescent property such as
lifetime, emission wavelength or intensity, is changed after an analyte binding.22 Nile Red is
an example of fluorescent dye immobilised in various polymer matrixes, that differ in polarity,
swelling tendency, pore size, elasticity and so on.23
Finally, in electrochemical transduction, the measured signal can be in the form of different
electrical attributes such as current, potential, resistance, or capacitance. Although individual
gas sensors can measure current or voltage upon an analyte reduction or oxidation (sensors
3

for CO, H2S or SO2), most commonly, a change in resistance of sensors based on metal oxides
and conducting polymers is recorded.13 The materials which resistance changes in interaction
with analytes are called chemiresistors.

2.2.

Sensing materials in chemiresistors

In the previous chapter, several different classes of sensing materials (cellulose derivates,
conductive polymers, metal-oxides, metalloporphyrins, metallophthalocyanines and
fluorescent dyes) were mentioned. In the following text, we will further describe materials used
for the construction of chemiresistors, as the most abundant sensors in e-noses and the most
relevant for this work. The most frequently used classes of sensing materials in chemiresistors
are conductive polymers, their composites and metal oxides.18
Metal oxides are materials used for the construction of the firstly reported artificial nose. 24 A
typical instrument, in addition to sensor materials, often composed of a heating element. The
operational temperature can range from 200 to 500 ○C. Although, SnO2 in n-doped form is the
most widely seen semiconducting material in this technology, oxides of other metals were also
applied, such as zinc, titanium and tungsten.25 The general sensing mechanism of metal
oxides relies on the resistance change due to irreversible reactions of adsorbed oxygen
species (𝑂∙− , 𝑂2− and 𝑂2− ) and the analyte.20 In the absence of an analyte, oxygen from air
adsorbs on the metal oxide surface, according to the equation:
−
𝑂2 + 2𝑒 − → 2𝑂𝑎𝑑𝑠
,

Eq (2)

leading to a decrease in the number of electrons in the conductive band and an increase in
electrical resistance. When the sensor comes in contact with a reducible gas (𝐺), such as
methane or hydrogen, the gas is oxidised, removing the chemisorbed oxygen:
−
𝐺 + 𝑂𝑎𝑑𝑠
→ 𝐺𝑂 + 𝑒 −

Eq (3)

which eventually leads to a decrease in the sensor resistance.
Metal oxides were found to be sensitive to non-polar molecules, and practically insensitive to
humidity, which makes them robust.20 Their main advantage is a relatively fast response to an
analyte, typically 5-30 s, and a short recovery time, 10-70 s, on average. Also, metal oxides
are relatively cheap materials and easy to fabricate. However, metal oxides sensors are prone
to sulphur poisoning. Besides, the blinding of a sensor to other analytes in the presence of
ethanol is also reported in the literature.6
When it comes to conductive polymers, pyrrole, aniline, thiophene, and acetylene, shown in
Figure 2.1, are most commonly utilised as gas sensors.3 The theoretical basis of the
conductive polymers and sensing mechanisms are explained in 2.3 and 2.5, respectively.
There are several advantages of conductive polymers over metal oxides. The conductive
polymers have high sensitivity and operate at room temperature.14 However, the main
advantage of organic polymers over metal oxides is the possibility of changing their selectivity
by modifying their chemical structure. This can be done either by modification of monomers
or by changing the way of polymerisation.13 Furthermore, different doping ions can bring
additional selectivity.14 The main disadvantage of conductive polymers as sensing materials
is the ageing process, due to oxidation of the polymer, leading to the resistance drift.18
Furthermore, the lifetime of these sensors is quite short, usually 9-18 months.6

4

There are also attempts of using proteins as sensing materials in different transduction
systems. Even though the application of proteins can improve the selectivity and sensitivity of
e-noses26,27, there are many technological challenges. Consequently, these sensing materials
are quite rare in commercially available devices to date.4

2.3.

Conductive polymers

All electrically conductive polymers (CPs) have in common the existence of a highly
delocalised π-conjugated network that provides intrinsic electrical conductivity28, as illustrated
in Figure 2.1. Typically, in pristine form, the CPs behave as insulators or semiconductors due
to their low conductivity. However, the conductivity can dramatically be increased by oxidation
or reduction, in the p-doping or n-doping process, respectively. Consequently, in the doped
form, conjugated polymers can achieve conductivities up to 105-106 S/cm.28

Figure 2.1. Structures of common conductive polymers: poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
(A), polyaniline (B), trans-polyacetylene (C) and polypyrrole (D).

Figure 2.2. depicts the process that occurs during the oxidation of polythiophene (p-doping).
The two-electron oxidation proceeds with the first electron removal producing a radical cation
(polaron), and a dication (bipolaron) resulting from the removal of a second electron.29 The
main properties of conductive polymers are closely related to the bandgap (labelled as Eg in
Figure 2.2.) – energy barrier between the valance and conductive band. For example, the
conductivity of the polymer is reversely proportional to the energy of the bandgap.

redox states. Grey arrows represent electron transitions. Adopted from [29].
Among conductive polymers, polythiophenes (PTs) have been extensively synthesised and
tested for various applications in the last decades such as organic electronics, chemical and
biochemical sensors, antistatic coatings, electroluminescent devices, electrochromic
windows, photovoltaics etc.28 There might be several suitable features of PTs30, such as:
1. A good electrical conductivity (typically exceeds 100 S/cm in a doped form);
2. Ease of manufacturing (There are several synthetic approaches, see 2.4).
3. A good thermal, chemical and electrochemical stability of some derivates.
Considering the latter, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) got special attention from
the scientific society, since it belongs to the group of the conductive polymers stable in the
oxidised form.31 Several organic transformations are available in literature applied in the
synthesis of various functionalised PEDOTs.32–40 The synthesis of derivates of
3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) often starts with a formation of a dioxane ring from 3,4dimethoxythiophne, as given in Scheme 1, while other transformations include the changes
in the side chain.

Synthesis of polythiophenes

Several methodologies are employed in the synthesis of PTs. The methods differ in the scale,
cost, regioregularity, distribution of molecular weights of obtained polymers, as well as purity.
The choice of the polymerisation method is usually application-driven.41 For example, metalcatalysed cross-coupling reactions, which can be performed on a large scale, yield polymers
with a narrow distribution of molecular weights and high regioregularity, making them wellapplicable for organic electronics. At the same time, this method is not suitable for biological
applications since the polymers frequently contain heavy metal impurities. Instead, oxidative
polymerisation with biocompatible FeCl3 is preferred.42 Furthermore, electrochemical
polymerisation, although producing biocompatible polymers is not suitable since this method
is mostly applicable on a low scale. However, the facts that polymers are directly attached to
the electrode and that their electrical properties and morphology can easily be controlled,
make electrochemical polymerisation the best choice for analytical applications.43

Electrochemical polymerisation
Electrochemical polymerisation is commonly performed in a three-electrode cell (working,
counter, and the reference electrode) in a solution of the monomer and a background
electrolyte (dopant). Different polymerisation methods (galvanostatic, potentiostatic and
potentiodynamic) and materials for the working electrode (platinum, gold, indium tin oxide
glass, stainless steel etc.) have been successfully utilised.14 Besides the mentioned ones,
other factors that can affect the polymerisation are the concentration of the monomer, choice
of solvent and background electrolyte as well as temperature and stirring.44
The mechanism of electrochemical polymerisation of thiophenes (Th) has been intensively
studied.45 It starts with the dimerisation of thiophene molecules, as shown in Scheme 2. Based
on the fact that the dimer, and later formed oligomers, due to their better resonance
stabilisation, requires lower oxidation potential than the monomer to form a radical cation,
some authors suggested the chain propagation mechanism to explain the polymerisation
process. 46,47 According to the suggested mechanism, the dimer is converted to trimer, then
tetramer, and so on. In other words, the resulting process is a permanent elongation of the
chain based on the successive coupling of the growing chain radical cation and the monomeric
cations.
The previously described mechanism was criticized45 since it was not able to explain
some experimentally observed phenomena, such as the “water effect”. Namely,
3-methoxythiophene, even though more reactive than thiophene, gives the soluble tetramer
as the result of the electropolymerisation in dry acetonitrile.48 Heinze et al emphasised two
reasons why the chain propagation between an oligomer and a monomer is unlikely.45 Firstly,
the rate constant of dimerisation of monomeric radical cations (Th•+) with a value of about 109
M-1 s-1 is several orders of magnitudes higher than the rate constant of coupling of oligomeric
radical cations. Secondly, the rate constant of protons’ elimination from the intermediate σdimer decreases with the increase of the oligomer length due to the resonant stabilizing effect
of a large conjugation. Consequently, they suggested the oligomer-based mechanism that
predicts that dimerisation of the monomeric cations, as the faster process, dominates over
coupling reaction between the monomer and an oligomeric chain even at low monomer
concentrations. In other words, the elongation of the chain follows a geometrical sequence,
forming the dimers, then tetramers, octamers, and so on. The oligomer-based mechanism
managed to explain the “water effect” by the fact that acetonitrile is not strong enough base to
deprotonate σ-dimer, while water is.

Scheme 2. Mechanism of electrochemical thiophene dimerization. At potentials higher than
the so-called oxidation onset potential, the monomers undergo a single electron transfer,
forming the radical cations (Step 1). Two radical species couple at the α-position of the
thiophene ring, giving the doubly charged σ-dimer (Step 2). This is then followed by protons
elimination (Step 3).

Metal-Catalysed Cross-Coupling Reaction
The commonly utilised cross-coupling reactions for thiophenes’ polymerisations are Kumada
and Negishi couplings based on nickel catalyst and the Suzuki and Stille couplings based on
palladium catalyst.43 The mechanism of Stille reaction is given in Scheme 3. The mechanisms
of the other three transformations are similar, including oxidative addition, transmetallation
and reductive elimination.49

Chemical oxidative polymerisation
Chemical oxidative polymerisation is performed in a solution of monomer and oxidant, such
as ammonium persulphate, iron(III) salts, cerium sulphate and hydrogen peroxide.14
Polymerisation is not limited to aqueous solutions, but organic medium and heterogeneous
polymerisations are also used. Furthermore, typically employed oxidant for polymerisation of
EDOT derivates is FeCl3 in organic solvents, such as chloroform. The polymerisation with
FeCl3 follows a radical mechanism and is illustrated in the scheme below.50
Scheme 4. Mechanism of oxidative polymerisation of 3-substituted thiophenes with iron(III).

Oxidative polymerisation is cheap and easy to perform, not requiring expensive catalyst or
cryogenic temperatures. There is no need for the pre-functionalisation of the monomers, in
comparison to the metal catalysed cross-coupling reactions. However, this method suffers
from poor regioregularity of obtained polymers and frequently requires an additional
purification step of the polymer.51,52

Sensing mechanisms in chemiresistors

Even though the origin of CP response to VOCs is not entirely investigated, there are several
proposed mechanisms in the literature.25 They can be summed up as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Chemical reactions;
The change in electrical density upon adsorption of VOCs to the polymer surface;
Polymer swelling;
Conformational changes of the polymer backbone.

Among the previously mentioned mechanisms, chemical reactions are often irreversible. Here,
an analyte is considered to produce irreversible change in the interaction with a sensor
material if the sensor’s resistance cannot be recovered by purging air or an inert gas.
Interaction of a CP with inorganic redox gases, such as NH3, NO2, I2 or H2S, often changes
the doping level in the polymer.14 For example, by oxidation to nitrogen, ammonia donates
electrons to the polymer which results in dedoping of p-doped forms, as shown in Scheme
5.53 Dedoping directly influences the conductivity of the polymer since the number of charge
carriers decreases.
Scheme 5. Dedoping reaction of p-doped polythiophene by ammonia. X is an arbitrary
monovalent doping ion.

Even though chemical reactions as a sensing mechanism are frequently seen in single-sensor
technology, they are not preferable in e-noses. Instead, they are rather undesirable processes,
causing a constant drift in the sensor baseline. Moreover, they can also reduce the sensors’
lifetime.
Adsorption of an analyte on a polymer surface is a common origin of an analytical signal in
gas sensors and represents the first step in signal formation.14 Furthermore, in some
transduction approaches such as quartz crystal microbalance, this is the only sensing
mechanism. Several attempts can be recognised in the literature of modelling the sensor
response originated from an analyte absorption at the equilibrium state or in time. Hwang et
al showed that the Langmuir adsorption isotherm can be used to describe the equilibrium
change of a sensor resistance on the example of a polypyrrole-based sensor for ethanol.54
The Langmuir adsorption process can be expressed as follows:
𝑘1
A + S ⇄ AS,
𝑘−1
where A is an analyte in the gas phase, S is an empty sorption place on the polymer and AS
is the adsorbed analyte, as illustrated in Figure 2.3.

Figure 2.3. Illustration of analyte adsorption to a conductive polymer.

Gardner et al modelled a gas sensor response in time by a system of two partial differential
equations that describes the diffusion of an analyte into the polymer and sorption kinetics.
Even though the authors did not provide an analytical solution, they suggested an
approximative expression for six limiting cases.55
Another possible mechanism of signal formation is polymer swelling. This mechanism is
claimed to be a dominant origin of resistance change for composites of conductive and nonconductive polymer.20 Absorption of a volatile compound in the sensor materials causes the
increase in the volume of the insulating polymer, expending the distance between the
conductive chains and increasing the resistance, as illustrated in Figure 2.4.

10

Figure 2.4. Illustration of a polymer swelling.
Finally, the polymer can undergo conformational changes to make stable interactions with an
analyte. For example, several articles suggest that the sensing mechanism of polyaniline
sensor to small alcohols is based on the formation of hydrogen bonds between the analyte
and polymer, leading to the strengthening of the polymer chains into a linear form, as
illustrated in Figure 2.5.56–58 Due to better orbital overlaps, the linear form has lower electrical
resistance.

Figure 2.5. Conformational changes of polyaniline upon methanol binding
While the previous example was a theoretical model, Perez et al managed to observe
conformational changes of poly(2-phenyl-1,4-xylylene) in a monolayer film upon interaction
with ethanol, hexane, and benzene by IR spectroscopy.59 They assigned the shifts of several
vibrational peaks to the rotation of two σ-connected aromatic rings from a perpendicular to
parallel orientation.

2.6.

Processing of sensor data

Ideally, a sensor’s response in time is a smooth function. However, in practice, a noisy result
is often obtained. To decrease the noise level by smoothing the sensor readings, several filters
are described in the literature.60 Savitzky-Golay filter, which was of particular interest for this
work, is described in the following text.
The main idea behind the Savitzky-Golay filter is that any continuous 𝑘-times differentiable
function can be locally (on a sufficiently small interval) approximated with an 𝑘-order
polynomial.61 Figure 2.6. depicts the smoothing algorithm. For an arbitrary point, labelled
green in the magnified picture, the Savitzky-Golay algorithm selects 𝑀 adjacent data points
on both sides of the point of interest. The algorithm performs a polynomial regression through
2𝑀 + 1 points and replaces the data point of interest with the value of the polynomial. In
practice, the window width, 2𝑀 + 1, and the order of the polynomial used for approximation
are chosen by a user.
11

Figure 2.6. Effect of Savitzky-Golay filter (blue) applied on an arbitrary function (red). For
each point, the algorithm fits a polynomial within the filtering window and replaces the data
point with the polynomial value.

From a sensor response in time, illustrated in Figure 2.7, the resistance change is obtained
during the process of baseline correction. The baseline correction can be either performed on
a filtered or original data set. The resistance change is typically expressed in one of the three
following manners62:
1. Absolute change:
𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙 = 𝑅1 − 𝑅0 ;

Eq (4)

2. Relative change:
𝑅1
;
𝑅0

Eq (5)

𝑅1 − 𝑅0
;
𝑅0

Eq (6)

𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙 =
3. Normalised change:
𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙 =

where 𝑅0 is the resistance of the baseline and 𝑅1 is the resistance of the sensor exposed to
an analyte at the equilibrium state.

aspiration of air/an inter gas, sample and air/an inert gas, in the given order.
The last step in data processing involves a data mining algorithm. This step is extremely
important in achieving the selectivity of an electrical nose. Typically, none of the individual
sensors can provide a good differentiation of examined analytes, due to low selectivity.
Instead, combined response and multivariate analysis enable proper classification of analytes,
under the assumption that the sensors have sufficiently different selectivity to different
analytes. To date, many algorithms have been used. Some of the examples are cluster
analysis, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, artificial neural networks, support vector
machine learning, multilinear regression, decision trees, K nearest neighbours etc.63,64
Principal components analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for the visualisation of large
multidimensional data that are often obtained in an e-nose experiment. The main idea behind
PCA is to project original data points to a lower-dimensional space (usually 2D or 3D) while
keeping the maximal possible variability of the data points, Figure 2.8. Let us assume that we
are dealing with 𝑛 data points (objects), each described by 𝑚 variables, or in other words; we
have 𝑛x𝑚 data matrix (𝑿). Projection of the original data to 𝑘 dimensional space (𝑘 ≤ 𝑚),
means projection of the data points to a set of 𝑘 orthogonal unit vectors that span the projection
space. If we represent the set of the vectors as matrix 𝑾 (loadings), we can obtain values of
projections 𝒁 (scores) according to the formula:
𝒁 = 𝑿𝑾.

Eq (7)

Now, the task of PCA is to find a set of orthogonal unit vectors (𝑾), so that variance in 𝒁 is
maximised. In other words, we would like to find:
1

max 𝑛 𝒁𝑻 𝒁 (maximisation of the covariance matrix),
𝑊

Eq (8)

under condition:
𝑾𝑻 𝑾 = 𝑰 (the projection space is defined by unit orthogonal vectors).

Eq (9)

By applying the method of Lagrange multipliers65 (maximisation of a function under a set of
constraints) on the last two expressions, we obtain:
𝑋 𝑇 𝑋𝑊 = 𝜆𝑊.

Eq (10)

13

Therefore, to find a set of 𝑘 orthogonal unit vectors, so that variance of scores is maximised,
we need to perform eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix of the original data. In order
words, 𝑾 (loadings) is a set of first 𝑘 eigenvectors (ordered by eigenvalues) of the covariance
matrix of the original data.

Figure 2.8. An illustration of principal component analysis utilised to reduce data dimensions
from 3 to 2. The principal component analysis searches for a projection plane that conserves
the maximal variability of original data. In the given example it is the purple plane.

decarbonate (1.4 mL, 6.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was added dropwise to a well-stirred solution and
the reaction was left overnight. THF was removed on a rotary evaporator and the remaining
solution diluted with 10 mL of distilled water. The solution was acidified to pH 4 with 2 M
hydrochloric acid aqueous solution, forming a white precipitate. The product was extracted
two times with DCM (25 mL) and combined organic layers washed two times with brine (30
mL). After evaporation of the solvent, 1.61 g (100% yield) of the product was obtained as a
colourless viscous gum. The crude product was used in the next step without further
purification.

Synthesis of (2S)-2-amino-N-((2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methyl)-3phenylpropanamide (EDOT-Phe)
Step 1:
The synthesis of the compound was inspired by the synthesis of a similar compound reported
in the literature.37 A 5 mL crimp-cap vial was charged with EDOT-NH2 (33.95 mg, 0.198 mmol,
1.0 equiv), N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (60.9 mg, 0.318
mmol, 1.6 equiv), Oxyma Pure® (51.0 mg, 0.359 mmol, 1.8 equiv), DCM (2.5 mL) and a stirring
bar. The vial was sealed and placed in an ice bath. After purging the mixture with nitrogen for
15 min, the solution of (tert-butoxycarbonyl)-L-phenylalanine (105.8 mg, 0.399 mmol, 2 equiv)
in DCM (1 mL) was added dropwise. After stirring the mixture for 1 h, the ice bath was
removed, and the reaction was continued at room temperature. The total conversion of the
starting material was observed after 22 h (TLC, 7:3 Hex:EtOAc). The reaction mixture was
diluted with 20 mL of DCM and the organic layer was washed with 1 M HCl aqueous solution
(3 x 15 mL), saturated NaHCO3 aqueous solution (3 x 15 mL) and brine (15 mL). The organic
layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and the solvent removed on a rotary
evaporator. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, 6:4
Hex:EtOAc). The product was isolated as a white solid (59.9 mg, 72%). TLC: Rf=0.61
(Hex:EtOAc, 6:4, v:v)
Step 2:
The product from the previous step was dissolved in DCM (1 mL) and the solution transferred
into a 10 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Trifluoroacetic acid (0.109
mL, 1.43 mmol, 10 equiv) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was stirred at room
temperature. The total conversion of the starting material was observed after 22 h (TLC, 7:3
Hex:EOAc). The solvent was evaporated giving a bluish residue (42.9 mg). The residue was
18

suspended in saturated NaHCO3 aqueous solution (25 mL) and extracted three times with
DCM (15 mL). The organic layer was washed with brine (15 mL) and dried over anhydrous
sodium sulphate. After removal of the solvent, the crude product (brown solid) was purified by
column chromatography (silica gel, 4:1 DCM:MeOH). The product was isolated as a paleyellow oil (13.84 mg, 30%).
TLC(diastereomers mixture): Rf=0.70 (0.60) (DCM:MeOH, 4:1, v:v). 1H NMR (500 MHz,

Electrosynthesis and electrochemical tests

All electrochemical polymerisations and tests were performed in a one-compartment threeelectrode cell, Figure 3.1, controlled by Autolab General Purpose Electrochemical System
(AUTO30.FRA2-Autolab Eco Chemie, B.V., The Netherlands). The electrolytic cell contained
two Pt sheets with a surface area of 10 cm2 as the working and counter electrode and an
Ag/AgCl reference electrode which is a component of a scan printed electrode (DRP-C11L,
DropSens, Metrohm). A standard Ag/AgCl electrode was not applicable due to small size of
the electrochemical cell. The Pt electrodes were burned, carefully polished with abrasive paper
(1500 mesh) and 0.3 μm alumina slurry, ultrasonically cleaned in deionised water, rinsed with
acetone, and dried in air before each experiment.

Figure 3.1. The three-electrode system employed for electrochemical polymerisations and
tests.
The polymers were electrosynthesised in the acetonitrile solution of Bu4NClO4 and a monomer
with concentrations of 0.100 M and 0.010 M, respectively. The explanation for the background
electrolyte and the solvent choice can be found in 3.2. To avoid the effects of oxygen, all
solutions were purged for 15 min and kept under a slight overpressure of nitrogen during a
cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiment and polymerisation. A CV experiment was done in the
following manner: three cycles were recorded within a proper potential range (as reported in
Appendix C) at a scanning rate of 100 mV·s-1. The bulk polymerisation was done
galvanostatically at the constant current of 2 mA (current density of 0.2 mA/cm 2). The
explanation for the current density choice is given in 3.2. An exception from the previously
described procedure was the electrochemical polymerisation of EDOT-NH2 and EDOT-Phe
(see 4.2 Electrochemical polymerisation).

19

After the synthesis, the polymer films were rinsed with water and acetonitrile to remove the
electrolyte and unreacted monomers/oligomers. To characterise the polymers, the electrodes
were immersed in a fresh 0.100 M acetonitrile solution of Bu4NClO4 and a cyclic voltammetry
experiment was performed. Three cycles were recorded at a scanning rate of 100 mV·s-1 in
the potential window of -1.00 V to 1.50 V.

3.4.

Optimisation of the instrument geometry

PEDOT was used as a model system for optimisation of the instrument geometry. Composites
of the conductive polymer and PVC were prepared by mixing approximately 1 mg of PEDOT
and the appropriate volume of 1.00 mg/mL solution of PVC in THF. The mixture was vigorously
shaken on a vortex in an open vial until the solid residue was obtained (approximately 30 min).
The composites of different weight percentages of the conductive polymer were prepared, i.e.,
50, 60, 70, 80, and 90%. The composites or PEDOT were suspended in 45 μL of THF and the
suspension was drop casted to various substrates (PVC, PMM, PC and ﬁlter paper). The
resistance of the films was measured after prolonged (two weeks) drying. A potentiostat (Ivium
CompactStat.h standard, Ivium Technology, The Netherlands) was used to apply different
voltages (U) and to measure the generated currents (I). The resistance was found as the slope
of the U-I curve.
PEDOT composite (70% of the conductive component) casted on the filter paper substrate
was further studied. The conductive composite was connected by silver conductive paint and
copper wires to a potentiostat (Ivium CompactStat.h standard). A substrate was inserted into
an in-house made single-sensor gas chamber, shown in Figure 3.2, and the chamber was
connected to an air pump (Claypower LP27-12). The pumping speed was 1.25 L/min (the
corresponding applied voltage was 10.0 V). Different solvents were analysed with the
instrument setup under different geometrical parameters, as illustrated in Figure 3.3, in order
to maximise the signal-to-noise ratio. An appropriate voltage (0.150 – 2.000 V) was applied to
the composite, in order to measure the current in the 10 μA range. The resistance was
calculated for every point of the time series according to Ohm’s law. The influence of the
distance between the substrate and the opening for the needle (h) and the angle between the
substrate and the flow (α) were examined. Obtained data files were processed in the MATLAB
R2020a software package.

Construction of an autosampler

A hole with a diameter of approximately 31 cm was made in a PVC plate (47.5 x 47.5 x 0.3
cm). The plate was mounted to four legs (each 26.5 cm in length) and the construction was
attached to aluminium support. The Braccio Robotic Arm was positioned in the centre of the
aluminium support and secured to it via a PTFE block (approximately 2 cm width). Improvised
sampler holders (length: 3.0 x 3.0 x 0.5 cm, diameter of the inner hole: 2.5 cm) was
equidistantly positioned on the circle with a radius of 44 cm. Fine-tuning of the holders’
positions was performed in accordance with the robotic arm.
The arm was controlled by Arduino Braccio Shield and ATmega328P CH340 board. The code
for controlling the arm was implemented in Arduino IDE 1.8.1367 using Arduino Braccio Library
2.0.168 and Servo Library69. The library files were adapted as described in Results and
discussion.

Design of the multi-sensor gas chamber

The gas chamber with split flows consisted of a filter paper substrate with casted sensors, two
aluminium and two PTFE blocks (80 x 80 x 15 mm) and connecting elements (syringe with a
needle and rubber tubing), Figure 3.4. A graphical model of the gas chamber was made in
SketchUp. The PTFE blocks contained eight holes with a diameter of 10 mm equidistantly
drilled on the circle with a radius of 25 mm, Figure 3.5. The aluminium blocks had a central
hole with a diameter of 10 mm and eight channels with a depth of 1 mm, Figure 3.6.

A PTFE foil (10 x 10 x 1 mm), Figure 3.7, was used as a mask for drawing electrical contacts
with silver conductive paint on a filter paper substrate. Composites of PEDOT or a PEDOT
derivate and PVC (7:3, m:m) was drop casted from a THF suspension to the proper positions
on the substrate. A half of milligram of the conductive polymer was used for the composite
preparation and the casing was repeated several times in order to obtain a suitable resistance
of the materials, as indicated in 4.5.

Analysis of solvents

The headspace of different solvents (AcMe, ACN, AcOH, CHCl3, DCM, EtOAc, EtOH, Hex,
MeOH, PhMe, THF and water) was analysed with the in-house built instrument. To record
resistances of the sensors, Ivium 32-channel multiplexer unit was utilised. Before the analysis,
the instrument was conditioned by purging air for 10 min. The samples were analysed in a
random order, six times each, by purging air (30 s), the sample (30 s) and air (60 s) in the
given order. The sensors’ response was smoothened with the Savitzky-Golay filter, and the
signal was expressed as normalised resistance change (Eq 6). Over mean-centred results,
the PCA was performed to reduce the data dimension, and the first three components were
utilised for classification analysis.

4.1.

Synthesis of functionalised monomers

The development of a synthetic route for the different functionalised monomers from a unique
starting material is vital for e-nose technology. The synthetic approach should preferably
involve one- or two-step transformations with high yields. In this work, chloromethyl-derivate
can be recognised as a key precursor in the synthesis of other EDOT-derivates. While other
methodologies for EDOT functionalisation (e.g. based on alkyne chemistry) are described in
literature70, the benefits of utilising halogen derivates are (1) absence of large linkers between
the polymer backbone and a functional group, which might lead to the enhancement of the
analytical signal, (2) high yields of the derivates obtained in one-step transformations, Scheme
6, and (3) the rear appearance of side products which makes the purification fairly easy.
Scheme 6. The synthetic approach of EDOT-derivates based on chloromethyl-derivate.

Each of the synthetic routes starts with an SN2 transformation, resulting in azidomethyl-,
acetoxymethyl- and imidazoliummethyl-derivate in a high yield. Besides the conditions for SN2
reaction, which frequently involves a high temperature, the EDOT ring tolerates strong basic
and mild reduction conditions, which can be spotted from the synthesis of hydroxymethyl- and
aminomethyl-derivate. Unfortunately, the synthetic approach suffers from acidic conditions.
Although no degradation of the synthesised monomers was observed on silica gel, according
to column chromatography and 2D TLC, it was observed that the synthesised monomers were
unstable in strongly acidic media and easily underwent the process of dimerisation or
oligomerisation. Consequently, the yield of the hydrolysis of Boc-protected amino acidderivative was very low. Furthermore, even a catalytic amount of acid caused the side
24

reactions at high temperatures as was observed in the synthesis of EDOT-Cl. The intensively
blue coloured oligomerisation products remained on the top of the column during
chromatographic purification, while some of the smaller oligomeric chains (reddish or
brownish) could be eluted with very polar eluents. It is important to emphasise the role of the
distillation in the synthesis of the chloromethyl derivate. Namely, attempts to synthesise the
compound from 3,4-dimethoxy thiophene at lower temperatures, as suggested in some
protocols39,40, resulted in extremely low yields (10%). Instead, the heating promoted the
reaction, while the removal of methanol by distillation shifted the chemical equilibrium allowing
a higher yield.
An additional difficulty to low yield in the attachment of an amino acid derivate was the
formation of diastereomers since aminomethyl-derivate as a precursor contained a chiral
centre. Even though two diastereomers were separated on TLC (MeOH: DCM = 1:4), they
eluted as one fraction during the column chromatography. Consequently, several peaks in 13C
and 1H NMR spectra appeared as doublets. Furthermore, all side products (oligomers) are
present in the form of two diastereomers, which can easily be seen on TLC given in Appendix
A.
Although it is possible to introduce amino acids to the EDOT side chain via an ester bond, fast
hydrolysis of the desired products under the experimental conditions of Boc-group removal
was reported in the literature.40 Therefore, in this work, the procedure described in [37] was
followed. Considering the observed issue with the acidic medium, one can test another
protection group such as fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl, which removal requires basic instead of
acidic conditions.
All the synthesised monomers, but the amino acid derivate, were previously reported.
Recorded NMR spectra, given in Appendix B, are in good agreement with the literature
spectra. To the best of my knowledge, in this work I reported the synthesis of (2S)-2-aminoN-((2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methyl)-3-phenylpropanamide for the first time.

4.2.

Electrochemical polymerisation

Most of the obtained EDOT derivatives are poorly soluble in water. Hence, an organic solvent
is required as a medium for polymerisation. Acetonitrile and dichloromethane were tested for
the mentioned purpose. Dichloromethane solutions remained stable at high potentials (up to
2.5 V), making the potential window for polymerisation rather wide. Although this is a
favourable property, some derivatives are insoluble in DCM. In addition, due to its volatility,
the solvent significantly evaporated during the polymerisations, changing the concentration of
a background electrolyte and a monomer. Therefore, in order to use DCM as a solvent, it
would be necessary to cool the electrochemical cell or to add fresh portions of DCM during
the synthesis. Unfortunately, this would lead to the formation of non-uniform polymer films. At
the same time, all synthesised monomers are well soluble at the examined concentration level
(10 mM) in acetonitrile and no significant evaporation of the solvent was observed during the
polymerisations. Consequently, acetonitrile was selected as a solvent for the electrochemical
synthesis of the polymers.
Different salts were tested as a potential background electrolyte: Bu4NClO4, Bu4NCl, Bu4NBr,
and NaPSS. Bu4NCl and Bu4NBr showed stability within a fairly narrow potential range, Figure
4.1. Even though the acetonitrile solution of NaPSS showed stability up to 2 V, the salt is
hardly soluble in the solvent. In addition, it was observed that the desired polymers frequently
25

peeled off from the electrode, making their later characterisation more difficult. As a
consequence of the above mentioned, the acetonitrile solution of Bu4NClO4 was selected as
the optimal background electrolyte for the polymerisations.

Figure 4.1. Cyclic voltammograms (3rd cycle) of different background electrolytes in ACN
solution (0.100 M), recorded at a scan rate of 100 mV·s-1.
Cyclic voltammograms of all investigated monomers showed similar features. In Figure 4.2,
the CV of EDOT-OAc is given, while CVs of other monomers are reported in Appendix C. In
the very first cycle, Figure 4.2.A, it can be observed that the polymerisation process starts
with the oxidation of the monomer at the oxidation onset potential (OOP). The monomers
underwent a single electron transfer, forming the radical cations, followed by the coupling of
two radical species. From the formed doubly charged σ-dimer two protons were eliminated
giving the neutral dimer. The process continued, and several oligomeric species were
generated. The formed oligomers were also electroactive and required lower potentials than
OPP for their oxidation due to better resonance stabilisation of their radical cations. In the
contrast to a typical CV experiment, where a current profile has a peak shape, the current
showed a sigmoidal shape in the CV of the monomer. The reason for this shape is an
accumulation of electroactive species in the near-electrode layer since both the monomer and
its coupling products can undergo electron transfer on potentials higher than OPP. Although
one can expect that the reverse and forward current in the first cycle would coincide because
the irreversible coupling step disables reduction of the formed oligomers and the nearelectrode layer is rich in oxidable species (in other words the electron transfer is not controlled
by diffusion), it was observed that the reverse current was higher than the forward scan
current, resulting in the formation of a characteristic loop. Additional charge in the reverse
process is required for deposition of the polymer to the electrode surface – nucleation process.
The nucleation loop couldn't be longer observed in the second and the third cycle since the
electrode surface was already covered with the polymer. Purplish blue coloured deposits could
also be seen with naked eye after the first cycle.

(0.010 M) in 0.1 M Bu4NClO4 acetonitrile solution at the scan rate of 100 mV·s-1.
In Figure 4.2.B, the formation of additional oxidation peaks in the second and the third cycle
can be seen at potentials lower than the onset potential. The peaks were assigned to the pdoping/n-doping processes of the polymer. The current increased within the cycles, which
indicates the gradual growth of the polymer deposits on the electrode. Furthermore, according
to some authors, the shift in the potential of the oxidation peaks, which can be observed,
implies the increase of the film’s electrical resistance during the synthesis.37
The oxidation onset potentials for all investigated monomers are given in Table 4.1. To
estimate the uncertainty of the given quantities, the cyclic voltammetry of EDOT, as a model
system, was performed five times and the sample standard deviation was used as an estimate
of A-type uncertainty for all other monomers except EDOT. The onset potential for EDOT was
expressed as the average of the five replicates, and consequently, the A-type uncertainty was
estimated by the mean standard deviation. Figure 4.3. depicts the method for estimation of
OOP given in the example of EDOT-OAc.71 Briefly, a line was fitted through the baseline and
the linear part of the sigmoidal current wave, and the OOP was found in the intersection of the
lines. In addition to OOPs, Table 4.1. also shows the potentials of current peaks observed in
CVs of the monomers.

Figure 4.3. The method for estimation of the oxidation onset potential (OOP) on the example
of EDOT-OAc
Cyclic voltammetry was shown to be very important in not only the characterisation of the
monomers but also in the diagnostics of the polymerisation process. The attempts to
polymerise EDOT-Phe with the previously described procedure failed. CV given in Figure 4.4
shows that the monomer has a very high oxidation onset potential (>2.5 V). The addition of
70% HClO4 aqueous solution to the monomer solution (forming 1% HClO4 in 0.100 M
Bu4NClO4 acetonitrile solution) helped to decrease the onset potential to 0.97 V, Appendix C.
Furthermore, in the contrast to the CV of other monomers, the CV of EDOT-Phe upon addition
of perchloric acid did not exhibit a nucleation loop, which indicates that the deposition process
was slow. Indeed, it was observed that after the bulk polymerisation, most of the polymer
remained soluble, giving a dark purple solution while the electrode surface was not entirely
covered. The addition of DCM helped to precipitate the polymer. However, obtained polymer
required repetitive washing with DCM in order to get rid of the acid and salts.

28

Another instance where CV was shown to be very valuable is the polymerisation of EDOTNH2. Although the OOP and formation of a nucleation loop can be observed, Figure 4.5, one
can also identify several peaks in the second and the third cycle connected to side reactions.
The observed current peaks can be assigned to the oxidation of the amino group, as
suggested in the literature.37 Indeed, the bulk polymerisation of the monomer did not result in
the formation of any film on the electrode. Fortunately, the addition of 70% HClO4 aqueous
solution to the monomer solution helped in the suppression of the undesirable process and
decreased the OOP from 1.58 to 1.04 V, Appendix C.

(0.010 M) in 0.100 M Bu4NClO4 acetonitrile solution at the scan rate of 100 mV·s-1.
In order to obtain sufficient amount of the polymers, after CV experiment, bulk polymerisation
was performed. The galvanostatic method was selected for bulk polymerisation since it
allowed one to control the amount of the synthesised polymers, in comparison to other
electrochemical methods. The choice of the current density of 0.2 mA/cm 2 was suggested in
the literature.31 However, the applied current density can be in a wider range, since some
articles demonstrated that doping level does not much vary (say from 20 to 30%) in the current
density range of 0-10 mA/cm2.72 Instead, the doping level more depends on polymer thickness,
and typically reaches a plateau at about 25%.73 These observations imply that 2.25 electrons
are usually required per one monomer unit, giving the general half-reaction for the
polymerisation as shown in Scheme 7.
Scheme 7. A proposed half-reaction of EDOT-derivates polymerisation

Considering that a monomer has an average molar mass of 200 g/mol, from the stoichiometry
of the reaction, the approximate consumption of the charge is 965 C per g of the polymer.
29

Therefore, to obtain 5-10 mg, taking into account the applied current of 2 mA, the required
polymerisation time is 0.6-1.2 h. Indeed, the yield of the polymerisations for different
monomers ranged from 4 to 8 mg.
A typical polymerisation curve, in the example of EDOT-N3, is given in Figure 4.6. The
polymerisation curves for other monomers are reported in Appendix C. A slow increase of
the potential in time is in good agreement with the previously discussed CV experiment. At
two instances, polymerisation of EDOT-ImdBF4 and EDOT-Phe, the rapid growth of potential
was observed after approximately 25 min, indicating that side process started occurring.
Consequently, both polymerisations were terminated when the increase of the potential was
noticed.

Bu4NClO4 acetonitrile solution at an applied current density of 0.2 mA/cm2.
After the bulk polymerisation, the CV of the polymer was recorded in a fresh 0.100 M
acetonitrile solution of Bu4NClO4, to check the stability of the form polymer films. Most of the
obtained polymer’s CV showed a typical capacitor-like shape, close to a rectangle.31 The
unchanged current in the successive cycles and absence of oxidation or reduction peaks
(given in the example of PEDOT, Figure 4.7.A) show that polymers were stable in the
examined potential window. However, PEDOT-Phe and PEDOT-ImdBF4, did not obey the
previously described features. These polymers were identified unstable at potentials
significantly different than 0 V, which can be seen in Figure 4.7. B and C. The third cycle of
all investigated polymers is reported in Appendix C.

Optimisation of the instrument geometry

Due to the limited amount of the synthesised functionalised polymers, PEDOT was selected
as a model system. PEDOT obtained by the electrochemical polymerisation is insoluble in
many of investigated solvents (distilled water, ACN, MeOH, AcMe, DCM, CHCl3, THF, PhMe,
and hexane) which limited the application of several casting techniques. The polymer was
partially soluble in DMSO and DMF, giving a brown and blueish solution, respectively.
An attempt to drop cast PEDOT from its DCM suspension to a PTFE substrate, Appendix D:
Figure 7.29, failed because the polymer peeled off from it after drying, disabling any
measurements. Consequently, it was attempted to cast the polymer on a substrate with better
adhesion properties (i.e. polymethyl methacrylate – PMM), making the groove also deeper
and narrower than one on the PTFE substrate, Appendix D: Figure 7.30. After partially
drying, the obtained sensor had a resistance of 154.1 kΩ and gave a response to several
organic solvents. In Figure 4.8.A, the response of the sensor to chloroform is given. After
keeping overnight at room temperature, the polymer got entirely dried, and the resistance of
the sensor increased to 1.000 MΩ. At the same time, the response of the sensor to the organic
solvents became much weaker or disappeared, as shown in Figure 4.8.B. One could have
also observed that after moistening the sensor with DCM, its resistance decreased.

Figure 4.8. Response of PEDOT casted on a PMM substrate to chloroform, before (A) and
after (B) drying of the polymer.
The changes in the resistance and analytical response can be explained by the formation of
agglomerates of the polymer during the drying process, as described in the text below. The
microscope image of the sensor before drying, Figure 4.9.A, shows that the polymer is in the
form of a compact mass, while after drying polymer particles, Figure 4.9.B, could be observed
even at low magnification.

substrate before (A) and after (B) drying.
Figure 4.10. depicts different modes of charge transport in a dried sensor material. As already
reported in literature74, in a crystalline material, the charge flows through a chain (intra-chain
transfer) or among chains (inter-chain transfer) in both ordered and disordered material
regions. Here, a charge transport within two particles (inter-particle transfer) is introduced as
a special case of inter-chain transfer at a large distance.

the chain depends on the density of the charge carriers (holes/electrons) in the polymer, as
well as to what extent the p-orbitals overlaps. The more planar is a polymer chain, the better
overlapping of the orbitals and delocalisation is achieved, and consequently, the lower is the
resistance.
32

The charge transport between two chains at a small distance (inter-chain transport) is
facilitated by 𝜋- 𝜋 stacking interactions that can be formed between neighbouring polymer
chains. The stacking interactions are typically explained via partially overlapped 𝜋-orbitals of
different chains. Therefore, the better the polymer chains are aligned, the easier electron
transfer within the chains is and the lower is the resistance. This type of resistance, besides
the relative orientation of the polymer chains, heavily depends on the distance between them.
In other words, the resistance increases with the distance increase (see section Sensing
mechanisms in chemiresistors).
After polymer drying and the formation of large particles, one can identify another type of
resistance – particle-to-particle resistance, which is at least an order of magnitude larger than
intra- and inter-chain resistance, as shown from the experiment with PEDOT casted on a PMM
substrate. In comparison to electron transfer between two chains on a smaller distance,
electron transfer from particle to particle does not depend on the relative orientation of the
chains within which the transfer occurs, but only on the distance between them.
Considering the previously mentioned types of resistances, one can suggest a simplified
model, where the sensor resistance can be seen as a sum of the three contributions (the
sensor is represented as the three resistors connected in a series):
𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝑅𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟−𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛 + 𝑅𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎−𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛 + 𝑅𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟−𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒 .

Eq (12)

Table 4.2. summarises the impact of different physical and chemical phenomena responsible
for the formation of analytical signal (see section Sensing mechanisms in chemiresistors),
to the three different types of sensor resistance. Adsorption of an analyte on a polymer surface
affects the electron density in the conjugated double bonds and consequently the intra-chain
resistance. The conformational changes in the polymer affect the p-orbitals overlap, both
within a polymer chain and between two chains. Therefore, both the intra- and inter-chain
resistances change in this way of formation of the analytical signal. However, the inter-particle
resistance, which mostly depends on the distance between the particles, remains unaffected.
During a polymer swelling, the distance between the polymer chains increases as well as the
volume of the particles. As a consequence, the intra-chain distance remains unchanged, while
the inter-chain resistance increases. Considering that the volume change of the polymer
during the swelling process is often less than 1% under atmospheric conditions75, which is
equivalent to 0.3% in particle radius, one can expect that changes in inter-particle resistance
would be only measurable when the ratio of the interparticle distance and the particle radius
is very small. Finally, chemical reactions can affect all three types of resistance. However, this
way of formation of the analytical signal is not desirable in the electrical nose technology as
already mentioned in section Sensing mechanisms in chemiresistors.

From the previous discussion, it is clear that the emergence of the large agglomerates leads
to the evanescence of the analytical signal and the significant increase in the sensor
resistance. In order to obtain a compact sensor material, the application of the composites of
PEDOT and PVC in different ratios was tested. Based on the model, Eq (12), the increase of
the PVC content would lead to the formation of more compact material, and consequently in
a decrease of the inter-particle resistance. At the same time, the more PVC is present in the
sensor material, the larger the distance is between the polymer chains or ordered domains. In
other words, the inter-chain resistance should grow with the increase of PVC content in the
composite. As the result of two opposing factors, one can expect that the total resistance as
a function of PVC content in the composite will have a minimum value.
Composites with the fraction of the conductive polymer of 50-90% (m:m) and the pure PEDOT
were casted on four different substrates. It was intended to obtain the casted conductive
materials in a rectangular shape with similar dimensions and to determine their resistance
based on Ohm’s law (as the slope of the U-I graph). Unfortunately, since the casting was
performed manually, the casted conductive materials obtained on various substrates differed
in the size. In order to enable the comparison of the results, the measured resistance of the
materials was standardised. Figure 4.11. depicts the method for the standardisation. Briefly,
from digital photography of the casted material, the length (𝑙) and the width (𝑑) can be
estimated in pixels, and the desired resistance can further be calculated according to the
formula given in Figure 4.11.

Figure 4.11. The standardisation of a sensor resistance, given in the example of PEDOTPVC composite (1:1, m/m) casted on filter paper substrate.
In Figure 4.12., the standardised resistances of the examined conductive materials are given.
The results obtained for the materials casted on paper and PMM very well follow the previously
described model. The composite with a PVC content of 70% shows the lowest resistance. It
is important to emphasise that applied methodology gives rather an approximate estimate of
34

the optimal PVC content so that a casting technique with better repeatability is needed for
more accurate measurement. In addition, optimal PVC content might vary for PEDOT
derivates from the one obtained for PEDOT.
At first glance, the resistances obtained for the materials casted on PVC and PC deviate from
the model. However, this disagreement can be explained by the observation that a small
fraction of PVC and PC was in situ dissolved in the solvent (THF) used for the casting.
Eventually, the obtained materials had a higher content of a non-conductive component than
expected.

Figure 4.12. Standardised resistances and their estimated standard uncertainties of PEDOT
and its composites with PVC on different substrate materials.
For further experiments, 70% PEDOT composite casted on filter paper substrate was selected,
considering the potential benefits of paper permeability for gas molecules. As described in
Experimental section, the paper substrate was positioned at different heights and angles in
the single-sensor gas chamber and the resistance of the sensor was measured in time (the
applied voltage and the current were read every 0.500 s). It was noticed that resistances of
the sensor slowly increased in time. To avoid an effect of the response drift, the different
geometric parameters and different solvents were analysed in random order with the robotic
arm as an autosampler. The air and an organic solvent were aspirated for approximately 30 s
(baseline and sample purge) in the given order, followed by an additional purge of the air for
approximately 60 s (washing purge). The ATmega328P CH340 board that controlled the
robotic arm, was logging the exact times of the sample injection and the end of the sample
purge to the serial monitor output. The signal-to-noise ratio was used as the criterion in the
geometry optimisation.
A senor response was treated in the following manner. The sensor resistance in time,
R (𝑖), was divided into three parts: baseline purge values, R (𝑖), sample purge values,
𝑖=1…120

points on the baseline was used as an estimate of the noise level (Eq 13), while the mean
value was used as an estimate of 𝑅0 (Eq 14). The value 𝑅1 was estimated as the

35

maximal/minimal resistance during the sample purge (Eq 15). Finally, the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) was calculated according to Eq 16:

In several cases, the applied methodology failed to reliably estimate the SNR. Consequently,
an extensive visual inspection of the sensor responses for all solvents and investigated
geometry parameters was necessary. In the following text, the observed cases and the applied
manual correction are described.
1. The baseline drift
Figure 4.13. illustrates a case when drift of the baseline was observed. The drift was most
probably a consequence of an insufficiently long washing purge of the previous sample.
Estimation of the baseline with a constant function led to an overestimation of the noise level
and an underestimation of the signal level. Consequently, the SNR ratio was smaller than it
should be. In the cases when drift in the baseline was observed, the baseline was
approximated with a linear function. 𝑅0 was estimated according to the linear fit at the point
with the same time as 𝑅1 , while the noise level was estimated according to the residual values
of the fit.

Figure 4.13. Baseline drift of PEDOT-PVC (7:3, m/m) paper-based sensor’s signal recorded
in the analysis of acetic acid. The height position of the substrate was 2.5 cm.
2. Wrongly assigned time of the sample injection
In the vast majority of the experimental data, the time of the sample injection could be
observed with naked eye, as a point where the constant or decreasing resistance of the
baseline was replaced with a rapidly growing resistance of the sample purge. In rarely
instances, it was noticed that the time given by the ATmega328P CH340 board was wrongly
assigned so that a part of the signal was mixed with the baseline. This led to an increase in
36

the baseline level as well as the estimated noise level. Consequently, the SNR ratio was
smaller than it should be. In such cases, the original time was replaced with the value obtained
by a visual inspection.
3. External values in the sample purge
In rare cases, it was noticed that the response of the sensor was not a smooth curve, but
occasionally contained an additional peak at the very beginning of the sample purge. This
unusual observation might be a consequence of the movement of the gas chamber during the
sample injection so that a short-term drift caused by shaking of the electrical contacts can be
observed. Figure 4.14. illustrates one of the mentioned cases. The original algorithm for the
calculation of the SNR value overestimated 𝑅1 , leading to the SNR ratio larger than it was in
reality. In the given cases, 𝑅1 value was estimated as a maximal value of the 10 last points in
the sample purge.

recorded in the analysis of ethyl acetate. The angle between the paper substrate and the
flow was 0 ○. Vertical lines denote the beginning and end of the sample purge.
Even though manual baseline correction upon visual inspection helped in overcoming the
encountered problems, there is always a danger of subjective interpretation.
Two different trends could be identified of the influence of the paper substrate position in the
gas chamber on the signal-to-ratio among the solvents, illustrated in Figure 4.15. in the
example of chloroform (A) and toluene (B). The experimental values for other investigated
solvents are given in Appendix F. For the highly volatile solvents (represented by CHCl3) the
SNR was unaffected by the position of the paper substrate. The values were randomly

37

distributed, and, furthermore, the ANOVA test failed to reject the hypothesis that SNR values
at the different heights have the same mean value (p-values>0.8).

(n=3) as a function of the position of the paper-based sensor in the single-sensor gas
chamber for (A) CHCl3 and (B) PhMe. Standard deviations were obtained under repeatability
conditions.
At the same time, for the lowest volatile compound (PhMe) among the investigated solvents,
it could be observed that the SNR value slightly decreased with the increase of the height of
the paper substrate. The reason for the obtained result might be an insufficiently long time of
the sample purge. As illustrated in Figure 4.16, the response rate decreased with the height
increase. The response is represented as the normalised resistance change to enable
comparison between three different heights, minimising the effect of the resistance drift. It can
be noticed that the noise level was comparable in all three measurements. Therefore, the
difference in the SNR value originates from the differences in the signal values. The fact that
the measured signals were lower due to insufficiently long time of the sample purge, can also
be justified by consideration of the concentration profile of the gas vapours. Namely, upon a
sample injection, the vapours of the organic solvent are mixed with the air in the gas chamber,
making a concentration gradient. The gradient decreases in time until, eventually, the gas
chamber get saturated with the solvent vapours on the temperature of the analysis.
Consequently, for a sufficiently long analysis time, the chamber is saturated with the solvent
and the position of the probe does not affect the SNR value. However, if the analysis time is
too short, the effective concentration, to which the probe responds, follows the concentration
gradient. It is also very important to emphasise that the volume of the headspace in sample
vials is critical to observe the difference in the results between high- and low-volatile solvents.
If the headspace of the vials is much larger than the volume of the gas chamber, the effect of
insufficient analysis time should be noticeable for all solvents, since it depends only on the
pumping speed. At the same time, if the volume of the headspace is smaller than the volume
of the gas chamber (such was the case in the experiment), the volatility of the solvent starts
playing an important role. It would be important to test in further studies the effect of the
headspace volume along with the pumping speed to the signal profile in order to confirm or
reject the given hypothesis.

Figure 4.16. Normalised resistance changes in time of PEDOT-PVC (7:3, m/m) paper-based
sensor to PhMe at three heights in the single-sensor gas chamber. 𝑅0 is resistance at the
baseline level. Vertical lines denote the beginning and end of sample purge.

From the above-mentioned facts, one can conclude that height does not influence the SNR
value. However, it is favoured to minimise the volume of the gas chamber in order to reduce
the analysis time.
Similar to the effect of position, it was observed two different trends in the influence of the
angle between the paper substrate (α) and the gas flow to the signal-to-ratio among the
solvents. They are illustrated in the example of chloroform (A) and ethyl acetate (B) in Figure
4.17. The experimental values for other investigated solvents are given in Appendix F. The
rise of the SNR value of the response to CHCl3, THF and AcOH with the increase of angle 𝛼,
can be justified in the following way. Under the assumption of laminar flow in the gas chamber,
the only possible way for solvent molecules to come in the contact with the sensor in 0-angle
geometry (the substrate plate is parallel to the flow) is a transverse diffusion. In all other
geometries, besides the transverse diffusion, the molecules can be directly driven by the flow.
At the same time, as the angle is closer to 90 o, the substrate becomes a bigger obstacle to 𝛼
the flow, causing longer retention of the analyte molecules in the sensor surrounding.
Assuming that the noise level is unaffected by the angle, one can drive a theoretical model
that describes SNR as a function of the angle 𝛼:
Eq (17)
𝑆𝑁𝑅 = 𝑐0 + 𝑐1 sin 𝛼.
where 𝑐𝑜 and 𝑐1 are arbitrary constants. To test the suggested model, additional experiments
were performed with 𝛼 values of approximately 22.5 and 67.5o. Even though the experiments
with PhMe also suggested that the optimal angle between the substrate and the flow was 90o,
the additional experiments with this solvent weren’t performed. The reason was the fact that
very weak or no signal was observed for angles of approximately 0 and 45o.

(n=3) as a function of the angle between the paper substrate and the flow of CHCl3(A) and
EtOAc (B) vapour. Standard deviations were obtained under repeatability conditions.
The SNR values from the additional experiments, as well as the fitted model, are given in
Figure 4.18. It can be seen that the model very well fitted the data for AcOH, but not for highvolatile solvents such as THF and CHCl3. There might be several reasons for the deviation of
the suggested model from the experimental data. For instance, the suggested model assumes
a laminar flow in the single-sensor gas chamber, which might not be very accurate,
considering the ratio between the diameter of the chamber and the opening on its bottom.
Secondly, the model ignores the electrical wires inside the chamber which were an obstacle
to the flow in addition to the substrate. In order to further check the suggested model, it is
necessary to perform additional experiments with a different chamber design. One possibility
is to use a wind tunnel.
In the contrast to other solvents, data for EtOAc and 2-propanol did not obey the suggested
model. Instead, it was observed that the SNR value did not depend on angle 𝛼. It is hard to
explain the absence of the trend. An explanation that for highly volatile EtOAc the sensor gives
a very strong response so that even transverse diffusion was enough to saturate the sensor
is unlikely since THF shows the expected trend. Furthermore, the given reason fails to explain
the experimental results for 2-propanol. Instead, the possible reason for deviation of EtOAc
and 2-propanol from the suggested model can be an experimental error. Namely, it was
observed that in several replicates, the sensor response did not reach the starting resistance
after the washing purge, Appendix G. This might indicate an unreversible process that
occasionally happened between the solvent and sensor, leading to the overestimation of
signal in some replicates. This reason can also explain the large standard deviation of the
SNR values for EtOAc and 2-propanol in several experiments.

Construction of the autosampler

As described in Experimental section, the robotic arm was positioned in the middle of the
hollow stand. The arm has the six servomotors whose position is controlled by the applied
voltage pulse width. With the original setup, it was not possible to take objects from the whole
stand and carry them to the same injecting position, since Servo Library does not allow 180 o
rotation of the base motor with the defined pulse width limits of 544 and 2400 ms. Replacing
the values with 400 and 2600 ms, respectively, allowed the desired rotation of the arm.
However, the call of the modified function resulted in a small deviation of the executed rotation
angles and those in the function input. Here, all reported angles refer to the function input.
Nevertheless, they can be used as an approximation of the executed ones.
The safety position defined by Arduino Braccio Library was not compatible with the geometry
of the autosampler. Therefore, the starting/ending position was redefined as reported in Table
4.3, making the arm outstretched.

Before setting the arm into position to take a sample vial (Step 2), by rotating the M1 motor to
angle 𝜃, it was necessary to set the arm into the starting position (Step 1). Otherwise, it was
observed that the arm terminated to the slightly different location by rotation of the base
servomotor from an arbitrary 𝜃1 to 𝜃. The values of 𝜃 for different sample positions are given
in Figure 4.20. After closing the gripper (Step 3), the arm was positioned in the inner hole
(Step 4 and 5), and it could freely rotate to the injection position (Step 6). To place a vial under
the syringe without touching the gas chamber or the sample holder, additional steps were
required (Step 7-9). The sample injection was done by the movement of the arm’s wrist (Step
10). The timely injection was achieved by mean of timer 𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 . Returning the sample to the
proper position required the same steps in reverse order.

Design of the multi-sensor gas chamber

The gas chamber with split flows was constructed based on the observations from section 3.4.
Optimisation of the instrument geometry. Although the single-sensor chamber used in 3.4.
and the chamber with split flows differ (the gas chamber with split flows forces the gas to
penetrate through the paper, while in the single-sensor geometry, the flow around the
substrate was also possible), the single-sensor chamber could be used as an approximation
to observe the general principles and to draw the conclusions for the construction of a multisensor chamber. The fabricated components of the gas chamber with split flows are given in
Figure 4.21. The constructed chamber allowed resistance measurement of eight sensor
materials in parallel.

44

Figure 4.21. Components of the gas chamber with split flows.
In order to check the repeatability of the manual casting and uniformity of the flow channels in
the multi-sensor chamber, PEDOT composite with PVC (7:3, m:m) was drop casted to eight
different positions on a filter paper substrate with drawn electrical contacts, Figure 4.22. It can
be seen that the casting process is poorly repeatable, giving the materials with the resistance
ranging from 10 to 400 𝑘Ω. Besides the difference in the sensor materials’ size, a different
local composition can be also the origin of the variable resistances. These results,
unfortunately, entirely disable the application of absolute resistance change as the analytical
signal. However, the relative or normalised resistance changes might be utilised. Sensors’
response to various solvents was tested. Indeed, comparing the signals at different positions,
the ANOVA test failed to reject the hypothesis that the signals of the different sensors
expressed as the normalised or relative resistance change have the same mean value. pValues for different solvents varied from 0.5 to 0.9.

Figure 4.22. Filter paper substrate for the multi-sensor gas chamber with the drawn
electrical contacts (silver lines) and eight casted PEDOT-based sensors.

45

The problem with wide variation in the sensor resistances was also encountered when the
composites of PEDOT and different PEDOT derivates with PVC were casted on a filter paper
substrate. In addition to the poor repeatability of the casting process, the differences in sheet
resistances of synthesised polymers could also cause variations in the resistance of the
composites. However, on this occasion, the resistances of sensor materials covered a much
broader range, from 5 𝑘Ω to 50 𝑀Ω. Unfortunately, these variations (several orders of
magnitude) made it impossible to simultaneously measure the sensors’ responses. Namely,
the practical limitation of the multiplexer is that a user can only apply the same potential to all
sensors and measure the current in one current range at a time. Therefore, the optimal current
range for high resistance sensors would lead to current overload for other sensors, while at
the optimal current range for low resistance materials, too small currents could not be
accurately measured for high resistance materials.
Three different approaches have been utilised to overcome the described problem.
1. Multilayer drop-casting and reduction of sensor dimensions
Reduction of the gap between the electrical contacts decreased the effective length of sensor
materials and their resistance. Repetitive casting also helped in achieving similar resistances
for all sensors but PEDOT-N3 and PEDOT-Im based ones. In the case of the latter, the
resistances were approximately 4 𝑀Ω and 15 𝑀Ω, respectively, even after five consecutive
casting. Unfortunately, the further casting would have produced too thick sensor materials,
making the sensor response too slow or weak.
2. Utilising of copolymers of EDOT and functionalised EDOT
The polymerisations of EDOT-N3 and EDOT-ImBF4 were repeated with a modification of the
procedure described in the experimental section. Instead of 0.010 M solution of EDOT-N3 or
EDOT-ImBF4, for the polymerisation, the mixture of the monomer and EDOT in molar ratio 1:1
with the total concentration of 0.010 M was utilised. The composites of the obtained
copolymers and PVC (7:3, m:m), were casted on a filter paper substrate to afford materials
with the resistance of approximately 20 𝑘Ω. Although this approach is shown to be very
efficient and gives freedom of mixing EDOT and a functionalised monomer in different molar
ratios to afford materials with a desirable resistance, it can be time-consuming to find the
optimal ratio of monomers. Therefore, this approach is rather suitable for rough tuning of
sensor resistances.
3. Connecting of a constant resistor in parallel or series
This approach is shown to be ideal for fine-tuning sensor resistances. Let us assume that the
sensor material had the resistance - 𝑅𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠 , and that we would like to achieve 𝑅𝑎𝑑𝑗 instead.
Then, by connecting a resistor with a resistance of 𝑅𝑎𝑑𝑗 − 𝑅𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑛 in series (𝑅𝑎𝑑𝑗 > 𝑅𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑛 ), or
𝑅𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠 𝑅𝑎𝑑𝑗
𝑅𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠 −𝑅𝑎𝑑𝑗

in parallel (𝑅𝑎𝑑𝑗 < 𝑅𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑛 ) to the sensor we can accomplish the desired resistance.

However, one should note that this method makes the SNR worse for a sensor. Although the
real sensor resistance and its change can be recalculated, the very small changes in sensor
response might not be detected. Therefore, this approach is only applicable when 𝑅𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑛 and
𝑅𝑎𝑑𝑗 are the similar order of magnitude.
With the previously mentioned corrections, it was possible to carry out the simultaneous
measurement of all sensor resistances in the 10 𝜇𝐴 current range and with the potential of
1.00 V applied to the sensor materials.

Analysis of solvents

Sensor materials based on PEDOT, PEDOT-Cl, PEDOT-Im, PEDOT-NH2, PEDOT-N3,
PEDOT-OH and PEDOT-OAc gave measurable analytical signal. In the contrast, it was
observed that sensor based on PEDOT-Phe did not give any analytical response in the
analysis of the examined solvents. The presence of a high-level noise instead, might be a
consequence of acid traces occluded in the polymer during the precipitation with DCM. To
evaluate the polymer properties, a modified polymerisation of the monomer is needed to be
performed in the future. The polymer was excluded from all further analysis. Response profiles
of examined solvents are given in Appendix I.
Although it is fairly hard to predict the response of sensors to different solvents, some patterns
can be seen. The formation of hydrogen bond between the analyte molecule and sensor
materials is the most likely dominant mechanism in signal formation for methanol, water and
acetic acid. The response patterns for the mentioned solvents are given in Figure 4.23.
Specifically, the formation of a negative signal (a decrease of the material resistance), which
was observed in the case of MeOH and water, cannot be explained by swelling or adsorption
mechanism. Instead, it is most likely that methanol and water in order to make stable hydrogen
bonds cause the molecule twisting, leading to better alignment of the polymer chains.
Furthermore, MeOH and AcOH gave the highest responses with the polymers that in the side
chain have a group that can form a hydrogen bond.

solvents. The error bars represent standard deviation (n=6) obtained under repeatability
condition.
Besides the ability to form a hydrogen bond, the polarity of an analyte can play an important
role in the formation of the signal. It can be observed that molecules with similar dipole
moments, and acidic and basic properties, such as AcMe and ACN,76 gives a similar response
pattern, Figure 4.24.

similar polarity. The error bars represent standard deviation (n=6) obtained under
repeatability conditions.
Finally, in addition to the ability to form intermolecular interactions, the size of the analyte
molecules can also be a factor in the differentiation of solvents. This conclusion can be drawn
from the different response pattern of chemically similar compounds that differ in the size such
as DCM and CHCl3 or MeOH and EtOH. The response patterns for the mentioned solvents
are given in Figure 4.25. Consequently, the morphology of the polymers might be equally
important in achieving selectivity as functionalisation of the polymers. To confirm previously
mentioned hypothesises, further studies are required. It is described in the literature, that
different morphology of the conductive polymers can be achieved by utilising different
counterions during the electrochemical synthesis.77 Therefore, one can try to prepare the
same functionalised polymer with different doping ions and to test the impact of polymer
morphology to signal formation. Also, experiments performed on a larger set of chemically
similar compounds can give an insight into the mechanisms of signal formation and a
possibility to achieve more selective sensors’ response. Finally, crystallographic studies of the
materials upon analyte binding can also be of great help.

EtOH and MeOH; and (B) DCM and CHCl3. The error bars represent standard deviation
(n=6) obtained under repeatability conditions.
The fact that the response patterns of the examined solvent are different, opens various
possible application of the sensor materials. However, in addition to different patterns, it is
extremely important to obtain sensors with a less variable response (lower standard deviation)
in the analysis of one analyte. Namely, large scatter of data points would cause partial overlap
of analyte clusters and decrease the predictive power of an employed data mining algorithm.
Here, four solvents (CHCl3, DCM, MeOH and EtOH) were selected to demonstrate the
efficiency of the nose. In Figure 4.26, the PCA plot of the mentioned solvents is given. In order
to build a model that can distinguish between the solvents, each solvent can be represented
by the centre of its replicates (𝑐𝐶𝐻𝐶𝑙3 , 𝑐𝐷𝐶𝑀 , 𝑐𝑀𝑒𝑂𝐻 , 𝑐𝐸𝑡𝑂𝐻 ). Then, the model identifies an arbitrary
sample, 𝑘, given by its coordinates in the PCA plot, as the solvent which centre is the closest
to the observed sample:

where 𝑑(𝑥, 𝑦) is the Euclidian distance between the points 𝑥 and 𝑦.

To evaluate the predictive power of the suggested model on the given data set of the four
solvents, cross-validation based on the leave-one-out method was performed. It was observed
that the model in 79% of cases correctly predicted the solvent. The confusion matrix of the
classification is given in Figure 4.27. At the same time, if the same model was performed only
on MeOH and EtOH, the accuracy of the identification reached 100%. This result suggests a
possible application of the constructed nose in an industry of spirits. However, further
development of the nose is required to obtain a more robust and reliable instrument, reducing
the effect of sensors drift in time and variability between the replicates of a sample.

5. Conclusion
In this work, seven EDOT derivatives (chloromethyl-, acetoxymethyl-, azidomethyl-,
imidazoliummethyl-, aminomethyl-, hydroxymethyl- and L-phenylalanine-derivate) were
synthesised. The synthesis of the amino acid derivate was reported for the first time.
Chloromethyl-derivate was the main precursor in the synthesis of other EDOT-derivates. The
synthetic approach tolerates high temperature, strong basic and mild reduction conditions,
while it suffers from acidic conditions. Considering the observed issue, it is recommended to
utilise a protection group such as fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl in the synthesis of amino acid
derivates of EDOT instead of the Boc group.
The monomers were polymerised galvanostatically in acetonitrile solution of Bu4NClO4, which
were selected as the optimal solvent and the background electrolyte, respectively. Cyclic
voltammetry was shown to be crucial in the diagnostics of the polymerisation process of
EDOT-Phe and EDOT-NH2. The addition of 70% HClO4 aqueous solution to the monomer
solutions helped to decrease the onset potentials of the monomers and to avoid side reactions.
It was observed that resistance of the PEDOT sensor casted on PMM substrate increased
during the drying, followed by the evanescence of the analytical signal. The changes in the
resistance and analytical response could be explained by a simplified model that addresses
the formation of polymer agglomerates during the drying process. To obtain a compact sensor
material, the composites of PEDOT and PVC with the fraction of the conductive polymer of
50-90% were prepared and casted on a filter paper, PC, PVC and PMM. The suggested model
well qualitatively predicted the influence of the polymers’ ratio to composites’ resistances
casted on the filter paper and PMM. The deviation of material resistances casted on PVC and
PC from the model was assigned to in situ dissolutions of the substrate polymers.
For the experiments of the geometry optimisation, PEDOT composites with PVC (7:3, m:m),
casted on a filter paper substrate was selected. The paper substrate was positioned at
different heights and angles in an improvised single-sensor gas chamber and the response of
the sensor to several solvents was measured in time. The signal-to-noise ratio was used as
the criterion in the geometry optimisation. It was noticed that height did not influence the SNR
value. However, the minimisation of the volume of the gas chamber could help to reduce the
analysis time. On the other hand, it could have been seen that the angle between the paper
substrate and the gas flow had a significant impact on SNR. 90-degree geometry was found
to be optimal.
The gas chamber with split flows was constructed following the previously described
conclusions. The chamber allowed resistance measurement of eight sensor materials in
parallel. Poor repeatability of the casting process and differences of polymers’ sheet
resistances caused a broad range of sensor resistances which further disabled simultaneous
measurements of sensor responses. However, multilayer drop-casting, reduction of sensor
dimensions, connecting of a constant resistor in parallel or series to the sensor and utilising of
copolymers of EDOT and functionalised EDOTs were proven to be efficient in the tuning of
materials resistances.
Sensor materials based on PEDOT, PEDOT-Cl, PEDOT-Im, PEDOT-NH2, PEDOT-N3,
PEDOT-OH and PEDOT-OAc gave measurable analytical signal. On the other hand, it was
noticed that PEDOT-Phe based sensor did not give any response in the analysis of different
solvents, and consequently the sensor was excluded from all further analysis.

51

Various solvents were analysed with the constructed instrument to evaluate sensors selectivity
and to have a better understanding of the sensing mechanism. Even though it is hard to draw
clear conclusions, several important factors of signal formation were identified. It was found
that the formation of hydrogen bonds, analyte polarity and the size of the analyte molecules
might play a crucial role in the recognition of different solvents. However, further studies are
required to make more accurate conclusions.
The ability of the instrument to discriminate between different solvents was shown in the
analysis of CHCl3, DCM, MeOH and EtOH. After processing of sensors’ response, PCA was
performed to reduce the data. A simple classification model based on the distances of an
object and the centre of clusters formed by the solvents’ replicates was utilised. Based on the
cross-validation, it was found that the model had an accuracy of 79% in the case of the four
solvents and 100% in the classification problem of methanol and ethanol. The latter can be a
promising result for quality control in the spirits industry.
