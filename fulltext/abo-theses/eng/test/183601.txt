Abstract
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has a multifactorial etiology wherein both genetic and
environmental factors predispose and modulate an individual’s risk of developing the
disease. Hereditary factors are perceived to be the fundamental facilitators of the
diabetic pathogenesis since they evidently predispose children to T1D via effects that
modulate the immunological homeostasis, alter gene-environment interactions and
enable the escape of self-reactive T and B cells targeting pancreatic self-antigens.
Furthermore, environmental factors, such as viral infections, have been shown to
modulate the risk of developing autoimmunity; with some factors exhibiting evident
disease-associated effects, and others demonstrating weak or contradictory disease
associations. This thesis project aimed to generate a cohort of 700 children enrolled in
the Finnish Diabetes Prediction and Prevention study (DIPP). The cohort was
genotyped for ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with T1D and
thought to modify the phenotype of immune cells. The generated data repository was
thereafter used to perform a pilot immunophenotyping study of twelve matched pairs
in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the study design and to study the effects of
the rs231775 (A>G) polymorphism on CTLA-4 expression in conventional T cells and
regulatory T cells (Treg). The thesis study’s assembly of a novel DIPP data repository
gave rise to a cohort of 694 genotyped, non-diabetic, autoantibody-negative, at-risk
children with ≥ 2 stored peripheral blood monocyte samples taken between the ages of
six months and five years. When studying CTLA-4 surface expression on
PMA/Ionomycin stimulated CD3+ T cells, amongst nine matched pairs (rs231775, GG
vs. AA), we detected no differences in the frequency of CTLA-4+ CD4+ cells and CD8+
cells. However, when staining CTLA-4 intracellularly in nonstimulated cells, the study
of eleven matched pairs revealed a significant alteration in the frequency of CTLA-4+
CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127LowFOXP3+ Treg cells. Homozygosity for the risk-associated
G-allele conferred a decreased frequency of CTLA-4+ cells when examining total
CTLA-4+ Treg cells (p = 0.0091), naïve CD45RA+ Treg cells (p = 0.0136), and with a
borderline significance, memory CD45RA− Treg cells (p = 0.0631). The results
maintain the assertion that the rs231775 SNP modifies the frequency of CTLA-4+ Treg
cells. Thus, further study is warranted to investigate whether the SNP affects the
surface availability of CTLA-4 and weakens the immunoregulatory ability of Treg
cells.

Swedish abstract
Typ 1 diabetes (T1D) har en multifaktoriell etiologi där både genetiska och
miljöbetingade faktorer predisponerar och omreglerar en individs benägenhet för att
utveckla T1D. Ärftliga genetiska faktorer anses utgöra den främsta etiologiska orsaken
bakom sjukdomsutvecklingen. Detta beror på att genetiska faktorer ger upphov till
immunologiska riskeffekter som omreglerar en immunofenotyps cellulära homeostas,
modifierar gen-miljöinteraktioner och möjliggör en okontrollerad expansion av
autoreaktiva T- och B-celler; autoreaktiva celler som initierar en autoimmun attack
mot de insulinproducerande β-cellerna. Avhandlingsprojektet var avsett att skapa en
kohort på 700 barn värvade till den finländska prospektiva studien The Diabetes
Prediction and Prevention Study (förkortning, DIPP). Kohorten genprofilerades för
förekomsten av tio olika enbaspolymorfismer förknippade med en ökad risk för T1Dutveckling och som förväntas ha en modifierande påverkan på immunofenotypen.
Datamaterialet användes därefter för att utföra en immunofenotypprofilering hos tolv
fenotypparade individer. Profileringens målsättning var att granska studiedesignens
utformning och studera CTLA-4 (+A49G) rs231775-polymorfismens förmodade
modifierande verkan på proteinuttrycket av CTLA-4. Avhandlingsprojektet skapade
en datasammanställning som inkluderar 694 genetiskt profilerade, autoantikroppsnegativa, icke-diabetiska barn vilka är genetiskt predisponerade för T1D till den
kliniska

DIPP-studien.

Proteinuttrycket

CTLA-4

studerades

först

i

PMA/jonomycin-stimulerade CD3+ T-celler bland nio fenotypparade individer (GG
gentemot AA). Dock kunde inga skillnader hittas i frekvensen av CTLA-4-positiva
CD4+-hjälpar T-celler eller CD8+-cytotoxiska T-celler efter extracellulär färgning för
CTLA-4. CTLA-4 polymorfismen (+A49G) observerades utöva en signifikant verkan
på frekvensen av CTLA-4-positiva CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127LowFOXP3+-Treg-celler
när man färgade CTLA-4 intracellulärt i ostimulerade celler hos elva fenotypparade
individer. Homozygositet för den riskassocierade G-allelen medförde en lägre
frekvens av CTLA-4-positiva Treg-celler (p = 0,0091), naiva CD45RA+-Treg-celler
(p = 0,0136), och som ett gränsfall, minnes CD45RA−-Treg-celler (p = 0,0631). De
framtagna resultaten förstärker därmed teorin att rs231775-polymorfismen sänker
nivån av lagrat CTLA-4 i Treg-celler. Därav uppmuntras fortsatta studier av
polymorfismens verkan på proteinets ytuttryck för att fastställa ifall polymorfismen
förändrar T-cellernas immunregulatoriska förmåga.

1. Introduction
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the most prevalent metabolic disease in children worldwide,
and it has an incidence rate (IR) that has been increasing since the beginning of the
twentieth century. Imperatively, the progressive increase in IR is of uppermost
concern, and the high prevalence of diabetic disease poses a great challenge to the
medical community’s efforts to improve global health. Autoimmune diabetes,
promoted by self-reactive T and B cells, drives the progressive destruction of insulinproducing pancreatic β-cells, causing at first dysglycemia, and later on, a total
dependence on exogenous insulin injections to allow for the continued survival of the
child. The factors contributing to the etiology of T1D can be divided into two distinct
classifications; firstly, into genetic factors predisposing children to disease via strong
hereditary risk effects with partially unknown causality, and secondly, into
environmental factors which are associated with disease and able to modify certain
aspects of the pathogenesis. The disease etiology is, therefore, inherently
multifactorial, with both genetic and environmental factors predisposing and
modulating an individual’s risk of developing T1D.
The care of T1D patients still lacks treatment options that would eliminate the need
for exogenous insulin treatment. Nevertheless, the creation of either preventative or
interventional treatment options requires an understanding of why the disease
develops, and on what grounds. The clinical pathophysiology of T1D after isletautoimmunity (IA) initiation is well understood, albeit the field of medicine still lacks
an explanation for how and why IA is initiated. There is, hence, a significant gap in
the present understanding of the disease etiology. However, the nescience forms a path
that the immunogenetics community might be able to illuminate since the researchers
aim to understand how the diabetic autoimmune condition develops in individuals
genetically predisposed to T1D. Nevertheless, further revelations of the disease
etiology can, in time to come, provide a better understanding of the immunological
involvement and hopefully enable one to intervene in the early pathogenesis to stop
the disease from reaching fulminancy.

3

Multiple population-based, longitudinal prospective studies have been conducted since
the 1980s (Ilonen et al., 1988; LaPorte et al., 1990) with the goal of detecting the
genetic and environmental factors which predispose individuals to T1D or increase the
susceptibility to the disease. These studies have been able to detect an array of
immunogenetic factors which predispose individuals to disease and are associated with
pathophysiological characteristics, such as disease progression rate and morbidity.
Crucially, the main goal of the prospective studies has been to predict, prevent and
intervene in the autoimmune condition in hope of either delaying or terminating the
disease development.
This thesis is set to generate a 700-subject cohort of healthy, autoantibody-negative
(AAb), at-risk children who have been enrolled in the Finnish prospective Diabetes
Prediction and Prevention Study (DIPP). The cohort will be genotyped for ten
functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), whereafter the dataset can be used
to quantify the gene variants’ poorly characterized downstream effects on immune cell
functions and on peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC) population frequency
parameters.

2. Literature review
2.1 Relevance through incidence, the epidemiology of T1D
T1D exhibits high levels of familial aggregation, and there are reported twin
concordance ratios ranging from 30 to 50%. One study reported a twin concordance
rate of 65% at the age of 60 in twins with a proband that has T1D (Redondo et al.,
2008). Furthermore, a Finnish study reported a probandwise concordance rate of
42.9% in monozygotic twins, a rate which is considerably higher than the 7.4%
observed in dizygotic twins (Hyttinen et al., 2003). The phenomenon of familial
aggregation demonstrates that there is a significant genetic component to the etiology,
although, environmental factors can concurrently modulate the susceptibility to
autoimmunity or possibly even function as a determinator of the final outcome. It is
now estimated that approximately 88% of the disease-phenotypic variance is acquired
from genetic risk factors such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles or
polymorphisms in other loci that are important for immune cell function or affect the
β-cell phenotype (Hyttinen et al., 2003).
4

HLA-based risk factors constitute approximately 40–50% of the total genetic risk
effect, that is, when comparing low-penetrance and low-effect risk factors, such as
non-HLA SNPs, with HLA-based risk factors (Noble & Valdes, 2011). Is should be
noted that only 10–15% of all individuals genetically predisposed to T1D eventually
develop the disease (Knip et al., 2005). Furthermore, there has been an increase in
individuals belonging to a neutral or intermediate HLA-based risk group who later on
develop T1D (Fourlanos et al., 2008; Hermann, Knip, et al., 2003; Vehik et al., 2008).
The increase in intermediate-risk individuals who develop T1D is believed to be
caused by an increased prevalence of environmental risk factors or a change in their
penetrance. Continuous changes in living conditions and in diets have globally resulted
in a major generational change, a change that may have decreased the cumulative
penetrance of traditional HLA-based genetic risk factors’ effects on disease
susceptibility. To conclude, gradual alterations in the prevalence and penetrance of
traditional environmental factors are thought to underlie the increase in global IR and
the observed changes in pathophysiological aspects, such as changes in the time point
of disease initiation and in the rate of disease progression (Ilonen et al., 2019).
The epidemiological characteristics of T1D are distinctive since they in theory
establish a pediatric metabolic disease that has an outcome which is lethal without
medical intervention. However, with recent advancements in global T1D awareness
and in T1D healthcare, increasingly fewer children are succumbing to metabolic
ketoacidosis in the industrialized world. According to the 9th edition of the
International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Atlas (2019), the estimated per annum global
incidence of T1D in under 15-year-olds is 98,200. Moreover, the corresponding global
prevalence of existing cases is estimated to be at 600,900 (Patterson, Karuranga, et al.,
2019). A major distinction in global prevalence-incidence statistics is that the highprevalence, high-incidence countries are situated in Europe and North America, while
the low-incidence countries are found in Asia, Africa, and South America. When
considering children under the age of 15, the IR of T1D in low-prevalence regions,
such as Asia and South America, ranges from 1–3/100,000; as compared to an IR of
10–20/100,000 in South European countries and 40–60/100,000 in Nordic countries
(Norris et al., 2020). The global peak incidence of T1D can be found amongst 10–14year-olds. However, those who develop IA and clinical T1D at a younger age often
5

exhibit a more rapid disease progression with a more morbid dysglycemia (Norris et
al., 2020). Notably, high-incidence countries have lower peak-incidence ages as
compared to low-incidence countries; a difference that has been connected to a
region’s child mortality rate (Patterson, Karuranga, et al., 2019). Thus, when creating
an overview of global T1D trends, the IDF has a need to extrapolate for incomplete
data and also compensate for higher mortality rates in economically developing
countries (Patterson, Karuranga, et al., 2019). Moreover, since developing countries
have higher levels of child mortality due to poorer social security and less available
treatment options, it has been difficult to estimate the incidence and prevalence of T1D
in economically developing countries; especially when many regions have not
gathered extensive epidemiological data during the past century.
Statistical analysis of 22 European countries’ T1D data, including national data
collected between 1989–2013, revealed a 3.4% (95% CI = 2.8-3.9%) per annum
increase in IR (Patterson, Harjutsalo, et al., 2019). The report also found that there is
an even increase in male and female IR amongst 0- to 4-year-olds (3.7% and 3.7% per
annum, respectively) and amongst 5- to 9-year-olds (3.4% and 3.7% per annum,
respectively). However, the IR was slightly higher amongst boys than girls when
studying 10- to 14-year-olds (3.3% and 2.6% per annum, respectively). The authors
noted that according to the ongoing trend, there could be a doubling of the global IR
after twenty years. The highest continental IRs can be found in the Nordic countries,
wherein Finland exhibits an IR of 52.2/100,000 (as of the time period 2015–2018;
children < 15 years of age), subsequently placing Finland in the lead of global IRs
(Parviainen et al., 2020). This makes the study of T1D especially relevant amongst
Nordic Caucasians and in Caucasians of a European origin. Furthermore, the
etiological factors which predispose or facilitate the disease development can more
easily be discovered, from a prospective standpoint, in an ethnically homogenous
population. This is one reason why T1D research has been more attentive to highincidence Caucasian populations, thus, providing predictive models better fitted for
Caucasian population genetics, albeit simultaneously depriving non-Caucasians
subjects from similar qualitative predictive models (Noble & Erlich, 2012).

2.2 Intercepting autoimmunity, a goal of the Diabetes Prediction and Prevention Study
The longstanding aspiration to illuminate the etiology of T1D has set the stage for
numerous longitudinal observational studies, prospective studies that still today are at
the forefront of diabetes research. The Finnish Diabetes Prediction and Prevention
study (Ilonen et al., 1996), a prospective study that was initiated in 1994, is one of the
forerunners in the field. It started as an observational prospective study enrolling
newborns in the areas of Turku, Tampere, and Oulu. The DIPP study has now
established a HLA genotype-based risk-classification system (Hermann, Turpeinen, et
al., 2003) from results published by the study’s clinical predecessors and from data
available in the Finnish Pediatric Diabetes Register (FPDR) (Parkkola et al., 2013); in
essence, forming a screening system that can detect individuals genetically
predisposed to T1D (Ilonen et al., 2016). The DIPP community has since 1994
screened over 250,000 children for eligibility, with ~8000 children becoming screened
each year (R. Veijola, personal communication, September 1, 2021). Around 700 of
all children screened each year are eligible for follow-up with ~500 children becoming
enrolled in the study annually. The current follow-up cohort consists of over 8000
children under the age of 15, and 766 of these children have developed seropositivity
for one AAb and 868 for two or more AAbs (as of September 2021). Finally, over 500
of the enrolled children have to date progressed to clinical T1D with approximately 20
new cases appearing each year.
Parents can enroll their child in the DIPP study if the child is born at the
aforementioned centers, when one of the parents is of a Caucasian origin, and when
the caregivers speak either Finnish, Swedish or English (Kupila et al., 2001). The
genetic screening is performed with cord blood samples extracted after delivery,
however, children born with a severe systemic disease or during circumstances where
a cord blood sample cannot be taken are not screened nor enrolled. A full description
of the HLA-based enrollment criteria is presented in Section 4.1. Children compatible
with the inclusion criteria can take part in regular follow-up visits with a physician
every three months during the first year and every three to twelve months until the age
of fifteen, until the development of clinical T1D or until the individual exits the study
(e.g., by relocating to an area out of reach for regular follow-up visits). The follow-up
includes the collection of standard healthcare data and the extraction of a venous blood
7

sample that is tested for AAbs against islet cells (ICAs), insulin antigens (IAA), protein
tyrosine phosphatase-like antigen (IA-2A), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) and
zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8A). Moreover, additional blood samples are taken for the
collection of PBMCs which become cryopreserved as a part of the study’s data
repository. Subjects who become seropositive for at least one persistent AAb, with
AAb-persistence defined as two successive positive samples, have their first-phase
insulin response (FPIR) to intravenous glucose tested at 6–12-month intervals. A full
description of AAb-screening methods is given in Section 4.1.
The HLA-based enrollment criteria and the follow-up intervals for AAb-screenings
have changed over the years, although, the most recent methodologies for included
tests have been described earlier (Ilonen et al., 2016; Koskinen et al., 2018). In addition
to the collection of basic healthcare data, there have been multiple subcohorts formed
under the DIPP umbrella which studied maternal and newborn health after birth or
factors such as newborn diet (Erkkola et al., 2005), thus creating numerous additional
categories of healthcare data. Finally, siblings of enrolled children, as well as the
parents of the newborn, are encouraged to become screened for T1D susceptibility.
Subjects who later on developed T1D, together with their first-degree-relatives and
siblings, become encouraged to enroll in the FPDR, a registry which includes around
90% of all T1D subjects in Finland (Mäkinen et al., 2008; Parviainen et al., 2020). To
conclude, the DIPP study has to date been able to collect a vast amount of material,
including healthcare data, PBMC samples and plasma samples, which can be used to
study the diabetic pathogenesis of T1D.
The DIPP research community has published over 200 articles using data produced
within the follow-up. These articles include papers describing both the genetic and
environmental background of T1D susceptibility and of IA. As an example, the
association of dietary factors with T1D susceptibility has been investigated by
comparing T1D susceptibility amongst children who have been nursed against those
that received milk formula (Kimpimäki et al., 2001; Vaarala et al., 1999). Moreover,
there have been numerous studies investigating the introduction of dietary factors or
known allergens, such as milk products or gluten, into the diets of young children
(Hakola et al., 2019; Niinistö et al., 2020). Different pathogens’ associations with T1D
have also been studied, in a longitudinal manner, via the genomic analysis of childrens’
8

viromes and microbiomes. The goal of the metagenomic studies has been to investigate
whether any specific bacteria or virus taxa are associated with T1D or IA. The
proposed immunomodulatory effects of pathogens has been investigated since some
pathogens are believed to modify the immunophenotype, an effect that can alter
disease susceptibility or disease progression rate (Cinek et al., 2017; Honkanen et al.,
2017). Furthermore, the potential effects of enterovirus and cytomegalovirus (CMV)
infections on T1D susceptibility have been extensively studied, especially amongst
infants (Ekman, Vuorinen, et al., 2019; Lonnrot et al., 2000). The immunophenotyping
of subjects’ immune cell populations is a more recent addition to the DIPP study’s
research spectrum; this area aims to determine and quantify the downstream effects
which genetic factors, such as coding and non-coding T1D associated polymorphisms,
exert onto the phenotype (Valta et al., 2020). Within cell-based research, there has
been an especial effort put into studying alterations in different immune cell population
frequency parameters, alterations which can be associated with IA or T1D (Ekman,
Ihantola, et al., 2019; Ihantola et al., 2018; Viisanen et al., 2019). Lastly, the
characterization of T cells which recognize pancreatic autoantigens and the screening
for novel self-reactive T-cell epitopes are both longstanding areas of DIPP research
(Ihantola et al., 2020; Öling et al., 2005).
Clinical diagnostics is an important area of functional DIPP research. This area
includes the technical and methodological development of genetic tests, specifically,
the development of PCR-based screening systems that can accurately genotype
individuals for T1D associated gene variants (Kiviniemi et al., 2005, 2007). The
development includes research into novel screening criteria, such as the potential use
of metabolomic data (Lamichhane et al., 2018), non-HLA-based genetic data
(Lempainen et al., 2015) and epigenetic data (Acevedo et al., 2015) to predict disease
susceptibility and disease progression rate. Importantly, the research conducted by the
DIPP study community is performed cooperatively, and in common interest, with other
national and multinational prospective T1D studies, such as the German BABYDIAB
and BABYDIET studies (Hummel & Ziegler, 2011), the USA-based DAISY study
(Barker et al., 2004), the T1D research network TRIALNET (Bingley et al., 2018) and
the international TEDDY study (Hagopian et al., 2011). Novel research made by the
DIPP study has also served as the basis for clinical trials of interventional medical
9

treatments; clinical trials wherein DIPP study subjects have been enrolled. One
example of a preventative trial is that of a nasal immunization with insulin to induce
insulin tolerance (Näntö-Salonen et al., 2008; Ryhänen et al., 2011).
2.3 Rise of autoimmunity: the immunopathogenesis of type 1 diabetes summarized
The autoimmune pathogenesis of T1D can be divided into four stages of disease
development. The founding stage, stage 0, is a pre-clinical phase during which
individuals may carry a hereditary risk of developing T1D and become exposed to a
diverse set of environmental factors (Insel et al., 2015). Immunological self-tolerance
is breached as individuals progress to stage I, immune cell infiltration and
seroconversion, when self-reactive T cells targeting β-cell autoantigens start to
infiltrate β-islets and autoreactive B cells start to produce AAbs directed against selfantigens (Ilonen et al., 2019). Stage I is asymptomatic, normoglycemic, and a stage
manifested by the initiation of progressive β-cell mass loss. Most importantly, stage I
establishes the longest period of disease development, a phase which can last from a
few months up to many years. Stage II, in opposite, is defined by the asymptomatic
onset of clinical, measurable dysglycemia. During stage III, the child will eventually
start to exhibit the clinical symptoms of diabetes, such as polyurea, polydipsia,
polyphagia, and fatigue. The symptoms will become progressively morbid, as the
disease progresses, culminating in the obligate need for exogenous insulin injections
to allow for the continued survival of the child. The pathogenesis and the main
pathophysiological characteristics of T1D are summarized in Figure 1.

Figure 1. The pathogenesis of T1D. The disease development is staged according to the phase of
immunological involvement, i.e., into the pre-autoimmune stage 0 and in three autoimmune stages
according to the degree of immunological involvement and the morbidity of the symptoms. The
pathological phases, stages I–III, are initiated through the induction of autoimmunity against β-islets.
The autoimmune stages are further divided into asymptomatic and symptomatic T1D. The progressive
loss of β-cell mass is depicted as a descending solid line. The genetic etiological background affects the
individual throughout life, hence, affecting disease susceptibility. The environmental factors can
temporarily or for a longer period exert an effect on disease susceptibility or disease-progression rate.
Clinical T1D is manifested when there is approximately 30% of the total β-cell mass left. Created with
BioRender.

Disease heritability is the first etiological factor that is to be covered when discussing
T1D disease development. However, no genetic factors have to date been shown to
exert a dominant causative effect on autoimmune T1D development, with the
exception of rare gene variants that cause monogenic diabetes (M. B. Johnson et al.,
2019). Nevertheless, genetic factors demonstrably modulate certain aspects of the
disease development, such as the archetypical example of the MHC molecules that
presents antigens to T-cell receptors (TCR). The HLA loci that encode MHC
molecules have been consistently shown to confer the highest risk effect for various
autoimmune diseases. However, it is still not understood how the HLA genes exert a
causative effect in the phenotype. Nevertheless, the risk effects conferred by the MHC
are often limited to a certain HLA genotype, which would indicate that the MHC has
an antigenic affinity that promotes the expression of self-peptides, a bias which would
11

facilitate the presentation of self-antigens to self-reactive T cells (Ilonen et al., 2019).
It has been suggested that certain MHC molecules are able to present self-antigens
with a disparate binding affinity during the negative selection of T cells. This could
enable the escape of self-reactive T cells from the thymus, consequently, breaching the
immunological self-tolerance (Wallet et al., 2017). Furthermore, it is during the prediabetic phase that the environmental factors may exert the most significant effect onto
the immunophenotype. For example, genetic factors may systematically modulate the
function and the homeostasis of the innate immune system; a change that could affect
the susceptibility to viral infections or the ability to initiate and resolve an immune
response. The main etiological constituents of the pre-diabetic phase, the hereditary
and the environmental factors, are further discussed in Section 2.4. The first stage of
T1D disease development, a stage initiated via the induction of self-reactivity, is
presented next.
2.3.1 Immune cell self-reactivity, when cells break the rules of self-tolerance
The first stage of type 1 diabetes development is usually completely asymptomatic.
Nevertheless, progressive β-cell dysfunction can be detected when measuring FPIR,
which indicate that the β-cell mass is declining (Richardson et al., 2011). The process
of how self-reactivity initiates is not fully understood, however, there are multiple
theories which state that the initiation of autoimmunity can occur due to stochastic or
environment-mediated perturbations of central and peripheral self-tolerance
mechanisms. T1D is also commonly referred to as a T-cell mediated autoimmune
disease since it is mainly self-reactive cytotoxic T cells (Tc) and helper T (Th) cells
that infiltrate pancreatic islets and facilitate the targeted killing of β-cells (Vandamme
& Kinnunen, 2020). The immunological mechanisms which control immune cell
homeostasis and the cell types which break the rules of self-tolerance are reviewed
next.
The process of positive and negative selection, the main constituents of central T-cell
tolerance, should first eliminate double-positive T cells that do not recognize HLApeptide complexes through clonal deletion in the cortical thymic region (Klein et al.,
2014). Self-reactive single-positive T cells are subsequently eliminated in the
medullary thymic region through the clonal deletion of T cells that exhibit an increased
affinity for self-antigens (Figure 2). Accordingly, low-avidity tolerogenic interactions
12

allow for the T-cell clone to survive. Moreover, through still uncategorized cellular
mechanisms, mid-avidity interactions produce a subset of immunomodulatory cells
called regulatory T cells (Treg) (The Treg cells are further described in Section 2.3.2).
Negative selection occurs through a process where medullary thymic epithelial cells
(mTEC) present a wide range of tissue-specific antigens (TSA). In this process, master
transcription factor AIRE and the immune regulator forebrain expressed zinc finger 2
(Fezf2) initiate the expression of TSAs, leading to the surface expression of TSAs by
MHC class I and class II complexes (Clark et al., 2021). The presentation of alternate
TSAs, e.g. autologous chimeric proteins or low-affinity TSAs, could allow for the
escape of alternate TSA-specific or self-antigen specific T cells (Pugliese, 2017). In
the periphery, the self-reactive T cells can attack self-tissues and proliferate, thus,
initiating a state of autoimmunity. Negative selection is also mediated by medullary
dendritic cells (mDC) and B cells, both of which are able to present circulating
antigens acquired from the medullary environment. These antigens can have a
peripheral origin, be acquired from mTECs through trogocytosis or from apoptotic
mTECs (Clark et al., 2021).
The process of central B-cell self-tolerance is first initiated in the bone marrow (Figure
2). The mechanism is mediated via clonal deletion or anergy induction of autoreactive
B cells and the clone-specific editing of B cells’ autoreactive or polyreactive BCRs
(Brooks et al., 2020; X. Chen & Jensen, 2008). Ultimately, this process should
eliminate the self-reactive B cells before the cells migrate to the periphery. The
selective process of B cells is also extended to the periphery since mature B cells
migrate upon antigen recognition into the germinal centers of the lymph nodes (Figure
3). The recognition of antigens presented by follicular DCs (fDC) initiates a process
of clonal expansion and somatic hypermutation, a clonal expansion that is restricted to
clones which demonstrate increased affinity for target antigens (Tsubata, 2017).
Consequently, B cells which show unsatisfactory avidity to the target antigen become
selected against; a negative selection that is mediated through the competition with
high-avidity clones, subsequently causing the low-avidity clones to die by anergy
(Hinman et al., 2014). Still, clonal expansion is canonically dependent on trans-cellular
interactions with follicular Th (Tfh) cells that stimulate the B cells and fDCs which
present the clone-specific antigen. However, perturbations in the cellular functions
13

which regulate the process of clonal expansion and affinity maturation could allow for
the proliferation of self-reactive B cells which have a high affinity to self-antigens
(Hanley et al., 2017). Nonetheless, the existence of self-reactive Tfh cells or peripheral
Th cells (Tph) is perceived to be a necessity for the positive selection of self-reactive
B cells in the germinal centers.

Figure 2. The main mechanisms of central tolerance. A. Central T-cell tolerance is mediated via the
positive selection of self-restricted T cells in the cortical thymic region. The selected cells are thereafter
tested for affinity to self-antigens in the medullary thymic region. Cells that show affinity to
autoantigens become selected against. Perturbations in the process of negative selection could allow for
the escape of self-reactive T cells. B. The process of central B-cell tolerance occurs in the bone marrow
where B cells expressing autoreactive or polyreactive BCRs become selected against. Negative selection
is mediated via direct deletion or death by anergy. Perturbations in the negative selection of autoreactive
B cells could allow for the escape of self-reactive B cells to the periphery. Created with BioRender.

14

Peripheral tolerance is multifaceted and relies on multiple cellular mechanisms to limit
the activation and expansion of self-reactive naïve T cells in the periphery (Figure 3).
Traditional T-cell activation requires that the interaction between a naïve conventional
T cell (Tconv) and a MHC-antigen complex presented by an APC is of a high enough
avidity (Clark et al., 2021). Moreover, T-cell activation is dependent on costimulatory
signaling through the CD28–CD80/86 axis and on cytokines expressed by the APC.
Genetic perturbations of cellular activating pathways could change the kinetic
threshold level of BCR and TCR activation, a change that could be coupled with the
aberrant MHC presentation of a self-antigen. Hence, in theory, facilitating a breach in
the aforementioned stimulatory mechanisms which would allow for a rare self-reactive
cell clone to proliferate upon activation (Clark et al., 2021; Pugliese, 2017).
Furthermore, systemic or temporal changes in cytokine-receptor function or in
cytokine-expression levels can modify a cell population’s ability to become activated,
to expand or to resolve an immune response (Jeker et al., 2012). Lastly, changes in the
function or expression of immune cell checkpoint inhibitors may cause perturbations
to the threshold levels of immune cell activation or in the ability of a regulatory cell to
downregulate effector cells (Shibru et al., 2021). Essentially, perturbations of the
aforementioned cellular mechanisms can collectively change how the cumulative
stimulatory effect between a T cell and an APC is interpreted. This can cause an
otherwise harmless self-antigen that should not activate any circulatory effector T cells
(Teff) to produce an immune response that facilitates the expansion of self-reactive
immune cells, subsequently initiating a state of autoimmunity. Examples of genetic
and environmental factors which can facilitate perturbations of central and peripheral
self-tolerance mechanisms are presented in Section 2.4.

15

Figure 3. The main mechanisms of peripheral tolerance. A. Peripheral B tolerance is centralized to
the germinal centers of the lymph nodes where activated B cells undergo somatic hypermutation and
clonal expansion to produce a broad pool of experienced memory B cells and plasma cells. Peripheral
tolerance should restrict the inappropriate expansion of B cells showing affinity for autoantigens
presented by follicular dendritic cells. Follicular Th cells facilitate the expansion of B cells which show
increased avidity for presented target antigens. The restriction of B-cell expansion is mainly facilitated
by anergy induction in those cells which develop BCRs’ that do not interact with the target antigen. B.
Peripheral T-cell tolerance include processes which restrict the expansion of activated T cells in the
periphery. Peripheral T cell tolerance is mainly restricted to the time period when naïve T cells first
encounter their antigen, after which the T cell clone begins to proliferate in the T-cell areas of the lymph
node. Clonal expansion is mediated by DCs and Th cells, with self-reactive cells either becoming
deleted or anergic. Perturbations of cell-cell and intracellular signaling pathways could lead to the
aberrant expansion of self-reactive T cell clones. Created with BioRender.

2.3.2 Pancreatic insulitis, the infiltration of immune cells into islets of Langerhans
Insulitis, the immune cell-mediated inflammation of β-cells, is caused by the
infiltration of primarily CD8+ Tc cells and secondarily CD4+ Th cells (Figure 4).
Macrophages, DCs, B cells, Treg cells and natural killer cells (NK) are to a lesser
extent observed in the immune infiltrate (Leete et al., 2016; Richardson et al., 2011;
Vandamme & Kinnunen, 2020). The medical field’s current understanding of insulitis
as a pathological event is still based on the observational study of pancreatic tissue
samples, tissue samples which are most often of a cadaveric origin and rarely from
biopsies. Consequently, it is largely unknown how insulitis facilitates β-cell mass loss
since there is no sufficient method to study the pathology ex vivo without the use of
tissue samples taken from individuals who actively experience insulitis. Nevertheless,
insulitis is believed to be initiated by self-reactive Tc cells since they are most often
observed in the proximity of β-islets during the early-stages of insulitis (Richardson et
16

al., 2011; Roep et al., 2021). As the inflammation progresses, there is a significant
increase in the number of immune cells surrounding the islets and a noticeable
reduction of β-islet size. During the final stage, there is a large infiltrate of immune
cells visible inside the islets and there can be a total lack of insulin-granule containing
cells. β-cell death is believed to be preliminary mediated via the direct cytotoxic killing
by Tc cells; a β-cell death induced by granzyme and perforin, and by FASL-mediated
killing (Richardson et al., 2011; Roep et al., 2021). Furthermore, intrinsic apoptosis is
partially contributing to the decline in β-cell mass, either through becoming activated
by elevated levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), or by becoming
activated via extrinsic factors secreted by inflammatory macrophages and Th1 cells
(Vives-Pi et al., 2015) (Figure 4). The cumulative effect of local extrinsic and intrinsic
cell-apoptosis activation is highly analogous to a classical type 1 immune response
against an intracellular pathogen, causing the β-cells to undergo programmed
apoptosis in an attempt to save neighboring cells.
The role of pAPCs is becoming more dominant during periods of chronic inflammation
since there is an increase in systemic inflammatory-factor prevalence, therefore,
facilitating an increase in the presentation of endo- and exogenous antigens in
lymphoid tissues (Clark et al., 2017). The increase in antigen presentation might in
autoimmune disease promote a more efficient presentation of novel antigens and selfantigen epitopes, antigens which can be recognized by naïve T cells. Notably, novel
epitopes have not been presented as a part of the self-peptide repertoire during the
negative selection of single-positive T cells (James et al., 2020). It is, hence, likely that
novel epitopes cause an immune response since the equivalent TCRs have not been
eliminated through the process of negative selection. Moreover, local inflammation
increases intracellular IFN-γ production which facilitates an increased surface
expression of MHC I and possibly the presentation of aberrant antigens (Richardson
et al., 2011). The increase in MHC I expression also mimics a prototypical type 1
inflammatory response where an immunological reaction increases antigen
presentation by APCs, thus, promoting antigen-recognition by T cells and
subsequently the clonal expansion of the experienced T cells.

17

Figure 4. The facilitators of islet inflammation and β-cell death. A. Islet autoimmunity is initiated
via the infiltration of immune cells into the islets of Langerhans. The immune cell involvement
facilitates cell stress, insulin degranulation and β-cell death. B. Cell stress can cause the upregulated
expression of antigens and the production of neo-autoantigens, both of which can result in the activation
of self-reactive B cells and T cells in the periphery. C. The killing of β-cells is preliminary mediated by
direct cytotoxic killing and contact-dependent killing, however, increased levels of cell stress in an
inflammatory milieu may allow for intrinsic apoptosis to occur. D. The immunomodulatory
involvement of Treg cells is crucial for the downregulation of effector-cell activation and for the
resolution of immune cell activation in an inflammatory niche. Treg cells are recruited by increasing
levels of inflammatory factors, nevertheless, some Teff cells can achieve an immunoregulatory profile
in the presence of IL-10 and TFG-β. Created with BioRender.

Furthermore, coordinated T-cell–mediated attacks on β-islets will increase the β-cells’
inherent stress levels, and concurrently increase the rate of β-cell mass loss by
programmed cell death (Figure 4). Programmed cell death also enables the release of
apoptotic bodies into the environment, extracellular vesicles which function as a good
source of self-antigens (Vives-Pi et al., 2015). Both the inflammatory milieu and cell
stress can increase the aberrant expression of self-antigens or the production of
chimeric antigens (Piganelli et al., 2021). The pathway of neo-autoantigen formation
is still poorly understood, although, neo-autoantigen production is believed to be a byproduct of major endoplasmic reticulum and metabolic stress (Clark et al., 2017;
18

Piganelli et al., 2021). Nevertheless, neo-autoantigen production in β-cells could
produce novel antigens from aberrant insulin peptides, thus forming a pool of novel
pancreas-specific autoantigens. Furthermore, since blood-derived antigens have been
found to be presented by mDCs during the negative selection of T cells, peripherallysourced pancreas-specific antigens could be presented in the thymus (Atibalentja et
al., 2011; Vollmann et al., 2021). However, it is still unknow whether blood-derived
antigens affect tolerogenicity induction and T-cell selection.
During the development of insulitis, some individuals have an increased prevalence of
B cells. B cells have been found in the proximity to β-islets during insulitis, and B cell
positive insulitis correlates with a more prevalent Tc involvement, a more rapid islet
degeneration, and a younger age at diagnosis (Leete et al., 2016). The B cells are not
themselves believed to contribute to the pathogenesis, although, when B cells gain the
ability to produce low- and high-avidity AAbs, the disease will start to gain
progressively more speed (Richardson et al., 2011; Vandamme & Kinnunen, 2020).
Nevertheless, B cells might aid the local inflammation by functioning as pAPCs, hence
presenting self-antigens to local self-reactive T cells. B cells could in this case present
self-antigens to experienced autoreactive Th cells, thus, providing each other with costimulation that facilitate B-cell differentiation or class switching (Leete & Morgan,
2021). Moreover, the Th cells are simultaneously provided with costimulatory signals,
hence facilitating further clonal expansion (Armitage et al., 2021; X. Chen & Jensen,
2008). The recognition of soluble neoantigens by BCRs is another mechanism
analogous to the presentation of neo-antigens to TCRs. A low avidity neo-autoantigen–
BCR interaction occurring in an inflammatory milieu could allow for B-cell activation,
hence, enabling the B cell to more efficiently present autoantigens to surrounding T
cells (Hinman et al., 2014). Nevertheless, it is still not understood how self-reactive B
cells escapes protective peripheral self-tolerance mechanisms, such as receptor editing
and the negative selection of self-reactive cells during somatic hypermutation.
However, the self-tolerance mechanisms could be perturbated by underlaying genetic
and environmental factors (Ilonen et al., 2019). The B-cell compartment has been
observed to be altered in diabetic individuals, although, the alterations are highly
heterogonous and change as the disease progresses (Habib et al., 2019; Hanley et al.,
2017). Furthermore, the serological appearance of AAbs during the first stage of T1D
19

development, followed by a decline in FPIR, function as the main markers of
autoimmunity initiation and progression (Ilonen et al., 2019). A pooled analysis of
multinational cohorts observed that 69.7% of individuals with multiple AAb and
14.5% of individuals with one AAb progressed to T1D after 10 years (Ziegler et al.,
2013). In comparison, only 0.4% of children with no AAbs developed T1D after 15
years.
The autoimmune condition in T1D is also mediated by an aberrant prevalence of
immune regulatory cells, mainly regulatory T cells, that during normal physiological
circumstances should be able to maintain the body’s immunological homeostasis.
Thymic Treg cells (tTreg) are produced during the negative selection of single positive
T cells in the thymus (Clark et al., 2017). It has been determined that certain CD4+
single-positive T cells, showing higher affinity for TSAs presented by mTECs, start to
express FOXP3 (Sprouse et al., 2018). This makes FOXP3+ T cells, carrying a selfreactive TCR, to undertake a highly immunomodulatory cell profile and to express a
more diverse set of inhibitory receptors and ligands. This, in turn, enables Treg cells
to suppress conventional T cells and pAPCs presenting the TCR-specific epitope,
either through direct cell-cell interactions or indirectly through the production of
cytokines such as IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-β (Amit Sharma & Rudra, 2018) (Figure 4).
Treg cells can also be formed in the periphery from conventional T cells in the presence
of IL-10 and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). These Treg cells are coined
peripheral Treg cells (pTreg). pTreg cells can, therefore, be formed in an inflammatory
environment where bystander cells express IL-10 and TGF-β in an attempt to reinstate
homeostasis and to resolve an immune response. Treg cells also have a highexpression of the trimeric high-affinity IL-2-receptor which deprives surrounding
naïve and effector T cells from IL-2, a necessary cytokine for T-cell proliferation and
survival (Clark et al., 2017). Tissues with a less effective or a smaller Treg-cell
population may be prone to autoimmunity, mainly since the existing Treg-cell pool is
unable to reintroduce immunological homeostasis (Mohr et al., 2019). Functional
studies of Treg-cell populations amongst individuals with autoimmunity have
observed major phenotypic changes in Treg-subpopulation frequencies, thus,
indicating that there might be a pathological alteration in Treg cell homeostasis
(Ohkura & Sakaguchi, 2020).
20

The emergence of AAbs and the phenotypic alteration of immune cell population
parameters function as the most accurate markers of autoimmunity. This marks the
first stage of T1D disease development as a phase during which medical preventative
and interventional treatments might have the greatest effect in either delaying or
stopping the disease development (Warshauer et al., 2020). The development of
interventional treatments has to this point focused on the targeting of cell-mediated
pathological mechanisms; all in an attempt to deplete self-reactive immune cell subsets
or to reinstate immunological homeostasis.
2.4. The predisposing genetic factors and proposed environmental triggers of T1D
The immunogenetics community has established a clear causative connection between
hereditary immunogenetic factors and T1D. The ability to predict the likelihood of
T1D development using genetic factors is no longer limited to one event, clinical
diagnosis; genetic factors can now be used to estimate the probable time point of
seroconversion, the number and type of autoantibodies (Siljander et al., 2009) and the
progression rate of the disease (Pöllänen et al., 2017). Gene variants in loci both within
and outside the HLA region can remodulate the immune system through variantmediated perturbations of immune system functions. They are, hence, in theory able
to produce a susceptible immunophenotype in which the disease could be initiated
through various stochastic immunological events. Furthermore, if an individual has an
intrinsic genetic predisposition to T1D, it is also possible that extrinsic environmental
factors could more easily act as a trigger for the disease. These predisposing factors
and proposed triggers of T1D will be discuss in the following sections.
2.4.1 HLA-based risk factors
The main genetic factors which predispose individuals to T1D are located within the
MHC loci (6p 21.31), i.e. in genes coding for proteins that are responsible for antigen
presentation in adaptive immunity (Noble & Valdes, 2011). The MHC loci, annotated
I through III, establish one of the most gene-dense and polymorphic regions of the
human genome, consequently producing vast polygenic sections in high linkage
disequilibrium (LD) (Figure 5). The class I region contains the classical HLA genes,
HLA-A, -B and -C, in addition to the non-classical and non-polymorphic genes HLAE, -F and -G. The class II region encodes the HLA-DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQA2, DQB1, -DQB2, -DRA, -DRB1, -DRB2, -DRB3, -DRB4 and -DRB5 genes (Dendrou
21

et al., 2018). HLA-DRB2 is a non-coding pseudogene and the DRB2 through DRB5
loci are not necessarily found on all haplotypes due to copy number variations (Noble
& Erlich, 2012). The class II region also encodes multiple invariant non-classical MHC
complexes, such as HLA-DM and HLA-DO, which are important for antigen
preparation and antigen loading onto classical MHC complexes. The third MHC region
contains numerous genes important for antigen processing, complement activation and
immunological signaling. Nevertheless, the study of antigen-presenting non-classical
MHC complexes has been largely overlooked, mainly due to a longstanding disinterest
in the invariant presentation of antigens by the gene products and due to the genes’
monomorphic nature.

Figure 5. The chromosomal placement of the HLA loci and the structure of the classical MHC
molecules. The three regions of the MHC are located on chromosome 6. The region is highly
polymorphic, and the genes are densely packed. The side view of respective MHC class I and II
molecules demonstrates the secondary structure of the complexes. The top view depicts the secondary
structures of the MHC molecules which forms the peptide-binding groove. The variable residues are
illustrated with red dots (top and side view) and the generalized distribution of high-variability residues
is illustrated in the bar chart. The figure is based on data from Noble & Valdes (2011) and on a
illustrative concept from Janeway’s Immunobiology (Janeway et al., 2012). Created with Biorender.

22

The MHC I molecule contains a transmembrane helix domain with a short cytoplasmic
tail and three extracellular immunoglobulin domains (α1, α2 and α3), of which the α1–
2 domains form the peptide-binding groove (Wieczorek et al., 2017) (Figure 5). The
peptide-binding groove is formed by eight antiparallel β-sheets that contain peptideanchoring residues at conserved positions and a wide range of residues which exhibit
high genetic variability (Noble & Erlich, 2012). The anchoring residues are less
variable and form the strongest interactions with the antigen, thus, determining a
MHC’s bias to bind a particular antigen. The high-variability residues are sites which
demonstrate the most variation when comparing different HLA alleles, hence
modifying the MHC-antigen avidity. The anchoring residues of the MHC class I
complex are located closely to the terminal domains of either immunoglobulin domain.
Furthermore, the peptide-binding groove is close-ended, hence, fitting a peptide of 8–
10 amino acids (Wieczorek et al., 2017). The MHC class II complex, in contrast, is
formed by a heterodimeric interaction between the A and B domains of respective
HLA-DP, DQ or DR components (Wieczorek et al., 2017). Both the A and B units are
composed of a transmembrane helix domain with a short cytoplasmic tail and two
extracellular immunoglobulin domains, α1–2 and β1–2, respectively. The peptidebinding groove of the MHC class II complexes is formed by the combined surface of
respective α1 and β1 immunoglobulin domains, both contributing with four
antiparallel β-sheets (Noble & Erlich, 2012). In comparison to the MHC class I
molecule, the MHC class II complex’s peptide-binding groove contains evenly spaced
anchoring residues and is open ended, thus fitting a 13–25 amino-acid long peptide
(Wieczorek et al., 2017). Codominant gene expression of both maternally and
paternally inherited MHC molecules is an important inherent property of HLA
genetics. This enables the combination of class II alpha-beta components in both cis
and trans combinations, hence, creating an even more diverse panel of antigenpresenting MHC complexes.
Both familial linkage studies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have
demonstrated that certain allelic genotypes of classical HLA genes confer a risk or are
protective for a wide range of different autoimmune diseases, e.g. T1D, rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), celiac disease (CeD) (Bakay et al., 2019). It is primarily variants of the
HLA class II genes HLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 that in T1D exert the strongest
23

risk effect (Noble & Erlich, 2012). Moreover, alleles of DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1 loci
form haplotypes which within a population are conserved by the process of LD, thus
making it highly unlikely to find allelic components in other combinations than those
seen in the most common genotypes. For example, the HLA-DRB1*03-DQA1*05DQB1*02 (referred to as DR3-DQ2) and DRB1*04-DQA1*03-DQB1*0302 (DR4DQ8) haplotypes are on a panethnic level associated with T1D susceptibility.
However, some high-risk haplotypes, including the risk associated DRB1, DQA1 and
DQB1 alleles, are less frequent in certain ethnic populations. Consequently, partially
explaining why the IR of T1D can be lower in some ethnic populations or geographical
regions which have significantly lower frequencies of high-risk HLA genotypes.
(Erlich et al., 2008; Nakaoka & Inoue, 2015). Furthermore, certain allele subtypes of
HLA loci, such as the risk-associated DRB1*04:01 allele versus the protective *04:03
allele, exert effects which are specific to a defined haplotype (Ilonen et al., 2016). This
adds an additional level of complexity to the determination of disease susceptibility
amongst genotypes carrying both protective and risk associated HLA alleles.
In accordance with published linkage studies of Finnish DIPP material, the DR3-DQ2
haplotype confers an approximately three-fold increase in disease risk (OR = 2.8; CI
= 2.50–3.17), and the DR4-DQ8 haplotype confers a ten-fold increase in disease risk
(OR = 10.11; CI = 8.66–11.54) (Ilonen et al., 2016). Interestingly, the combined DR3DQ2/DR4-DQ8 genotype confers a significant increase in T1D susceptibility (OR =
14.69; CI = 10.46–20.62), and this has been contributed to the phenotype expressing
both the cis and trans conformations of the aforementioned risk-associated HLADQ/DR components. Nevertheless, there are also haplotypes that are associated with
strong protection, such as the DRB1*15-DQB1*06:02 (OR = 0.03; CI = 0.03–0.05)
haplotype (Ilonen et al., 2016). HLA haplotypes generally adhere to the rule of additive
effects, although, there are certain genotype combinations in where one haplotype
seemingly exerts a dominant effect (protective or risk effect) over the other haplotype.
These types of deviations from the traditional rules of additive effects have not been
widely characterized, and it is still unknown why certain alleles become dominant in
certain haplotypic combinations (Dendrou et al., 2018).
In addition to the classical HLA class II genes, class I alleles in the HLA-A and -B loci
are also associated with T1D (Nejentsev et al., 2007). The strongest predisposing T1D24

associated MHC class I alleles are B*18, B*39 and A*24 (Mikk et al., 2014). The
predisposing effects of the MHC class I alleles are best seen as an association with
increased progression rate from seroconversion to T1D, a risk effect also correlating
with a faster decline in FPIR. (Koskinen et al., 2020). The HLA class I variants’
associations to later events in the disease development imply that the Class I molecule
is not as important for the triggering of autoimmunity; instead, variants in Class I loci
are thought to modulate disease progression characteristics after IA initiation.
To conclude, it is now commonly agreed upon that it is the DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1
genes which confer the highest risk effect to T1D when compared to other HLA genes.
This association has been observed in multiple international and national studies, such
as those conducted by the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC) (Erlich et
al., 2008), the TEDDY group (Hagopian et al., 2011) and the DIPP study group (Ilonen
et al., 2016). It has been possible through similar prospective studies to allot other less
powerful HLA alleles, e.g. in HLA-DP and HLA-B loci, to a T1D risk (Mikk et al.,
2014; Noble & Erlich, 2012). Most importantly, specific genotypic and haplotypic
combinations of DRB1-DQA1-DQB1 alleles are now recognized to be the main
contributors to the genetically conferred risk. The classification of genotypes into riskassociated DRB1-DQA1-DQB1 haplotypes now forms the basis for a majority of the
adapted T1D genetic risk-scoring systems (Noble & Valdes, 2011).
2.4.2 Genetic risk factors outside the HLA region
The risk effects contributed by non-HLA factors are overshadowed by the
overpowering effects of HLA-based factors. However, SNPs proximal to riskassociated HLA loci can exert a significant effect on HLA gene expression as an
expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) (Aydemir et al., 2019; Nygård et al., 2021);
an epigenetic effect that can be exerted in cis or trans (Nyaga et al., 2018). In other
words, it is possible that there are additional undetected HLA-proximal non-coding
polymorphisms which significantly modify the risk conferred by HLA loci. However,
the process of finding new modifiers has proven to be difficult since HLA-proximal
modifiers are in strong LD with already disease-associated HLA loci. Furthermore,
recent studies have also determined that the methylations status of the HLA-situated
epigenome significantly modifies the risk conferred by HLA loci (Kindt et al., 2018).
25

However, there is also a plethora of non-HLA polymorphisms, such as the PTPN22
rs2476601 (G>A) SNP, a SNP that has been associated with an increase in risk of
developing T1D (Sharp et al., 2015) and with an increased T1D progression rate
(Pöllänen et al., 2017). Furthermore, variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) in the
insulin (INS) gene can either increase or decrease the susceptibility to T1D (DurinovicBelló et al., 2010). It has been determined that the risk effect conferred by INS VNTR
type I is due to a decreased AIRE-activated insulin expression in the thymus (Cai et
al., 2011). The lower expression of insulin-type TSAs could allow for the escape of
self-reactive T cells during the negative selection of T cells; auto-reactive cells which
could have an high specificity for insulin-epitopes (Bettini & Bettini, 2017; DurinovicBelló et al., 2010). The most recent T1D GWAS have found approximately 90 gene
variants that are associated with T1D and which encompass almost 70 non-HLA loci
(Nyaga et al., 2018; Sur, 2020). However, the T1D associated SNPs’ functional effects
have not been thoroughly studied, except in cases of rare polymorphisms in already
well-studied loci, such as TYK2 (Pellenz et al., 2021), or in the more common or
powerful gene variants such as SNPs in the locus of PTPN2 (Wiede et al., 2017),
PTPN22 (Valta et al., 2020), CTLA-4 (Y. Chen et al., 2018) and IL2RA (Rainbow et
al., 2017). Notably, these are all immunologically important genes which in the global
population harbor multiple polymorphisms associated with various forms of
autoimmune disease.
The study of exonic coding polymorphisms is of uppermost interest in T1D research
since it is a more straightforward approach to formulate a preliminary hypothesis of
SNP causality if the polymorphism’s translation results in a structural change to the
protein. Nevertheless, intronic coding polymorphisms can cause downstream effects
by modifying protein-splicing patterns or micro-RNA binding (de Almeida et al.,
2018; Sharp et al., 2021). Moreover, both coding and non-coding polymorphisms can
exert epistatic effects via alterations to the expression patterns of close and distant
genes. Researchers have been committed to integrating HLA and non-HLA risk factors
to produce more accurate systems of risk scoring. Studies have observed that certain
combinations of genes may significantly increase the disease risk through synergistic
and epistatic mechanisms, although these types of combinatory effects were difficult

26

to corroborate and the synergistic effects were often best observed amongst high-risk
HLA genotypes (Maziarz et al., 2015; Perry et al., 2018; Winkler et al., 2012).
Still, a highly relevant aspect of future research into the risk effects conferred by noncoding SNPs relates to their highly pleiotropic nature, i.e., that they have an ability to
exert hard-to-detect distal effects on other genes by remodulating their expression.
Non-coding polymorphisms can be clustered in super-enhancer regions proximal to
large gene clusters (Afzali et al., 2017; Onengut-Gumuscu et al., 2015). These types
of polymorphisms may influence expression by affecting the methylation and
acetylation rates of those enhancer regions (Gao et al., 2019). Moreover, such
polymorphisms may exert more visible changes to the cell phenotypes since they can
influence cell subset-specific expression patterns and cell fate (Soskic et al., 2019).
Non-coding polymorphisms may also affect the binding of transcriptional factors or
the formation of transcriptional complexes through effects on complex formation
(Schwartz et al., 2017; Soderquest et al., 2017). Lastly, non-coding polymorphisms
may also affect epigenetic functions, such as heterochromatin formation, by changing
acetylation and methylation patterns, or by modifying a loci’s ability to recruit
chromatin modifiers. Crucially, alterations to cell subset-specific chromatinmodification patterns can inflict changes to higher-order chromatin structures
(Acevedo et al., 2015). However, there are still only a few papers that cover the
epigenetic downstream effects of non-coding polymorphisms, and the field’s current
understanding of cells subset-specific epigenetics is still primarily based on archaic insilico analysis methods of GWAS data, methods which only impute the probability of
an epigenetic effect occurring. For this thesis, ten different SNPs are presented in
Section 2.5 in order to describe the functional polymorphisms’ suggested alterations
to the immunophenotype.
2.4.3 Environmental factors
The contribution of environmental factors to the formation of T1D and to the
heterogeneity of the disease has been implied earlier in this literature review. As
mentioned, physiological factors such as birthweight, obesity, growth pattern and
nourishment status have been thoroughly studied, although the prospective study of
physiological characteristics has often produced counter-indicative results with effects
that are either weak or change direction depending on the study population (Krischer
27

et al., 2015, 2019). The study of dietary factors, such as the introduction of dietary
fibers or milk products, has suggested that they contribute with a causal effect, albeit
the results have been difficult to replicate (Hakola et al., 2019; Niinistö et al., 2020).
A more recent hypothesis on this matter, which has been supported by independent
authors, suggests that a dietary factor’s timepoint of introduction determines whether
the factor confer a risk or not (Rewers & Ludvigsson, 2016). The immune system has
to adapt to a novel non-pathogenic antigen or to a change in diet every time when a
new dietary factor is introduced. Thus, indicating that a dietary factor’s risk effect stem
from a highly temporal perturbation in the tolerogenic immune response. This could
become especially relevant at a time point when children are weaned off from breast
milk or when solid food are introduced to the diet.
The most thoroughly studied unit of environmental factors is that of viral infections,
which can exert broad downstream effects on both immune cell and β-cell functions.
It was noted early on that pancreatic sections of deceased T1D subjects had higher
viral loads of certain virus taxa (Krogvold et al., 2015; Richardson et al., 2014).
Additionally, observational studies have associated enterovirus and adenovirus
infections with the onset of β-cell autoimmunity (Faulkner et al., 2020). The
connection between enteroviral infections and T1D is well documented, although, the
suggested causal nature of either acute or latent infections is obscure (Honkanen et al.,
2017; Lonnrot et al., 2000; Oikarinen et al., 2011). The interaction between viral
infections and T1D susceptibility or protection could be related to the direct infection
of pancreatic tissue, an infection which could increase β-cell stress and facilitate the
engagement of immune cells (Richardson et al., 2014). Furthermore, viral infections
have been shown to modulate the immune system via indirect effects. Certain viruses
have the ability to suppress and remodulate the function of the innate and adaptive
immune system (Ghazarian et al., 2013). For example, perinatal CMV infections have
been reported to confer protection from T1D (Ekman, Vuorinen, et al., 2019);
moreover, some viruses in the herpes family produce lifelong latent infections that
exert strong immunomodulatory effects (Picarda & Benedict, 2018).
Approximately 25% of all Finnish children have been infected with CMV postnatally
or during early childhood (Aarnisalo et al., 2008; Hiltunen et al., 1995). Moreover, it
has been shown that latent CMV infections exert a significant effect on the
28

immunophenotype, especially on T cell, natural killer (NK) cell and macrophage
frequencies (Picarda & Benedict, 2018). To conclude, the study of environmental
factors and their causal effects is ongoing, and the topic remains opinionated.
Nevertheless, the field’s most recent observations in this area have already been
extensively reviewed and are considered out of scope for this literature review
(Faulkner et al., 2020; Ilonen et al., 2019; Rewers & Ludvigsson, 2016).
2.5 Functional polymorphisms and their proposed effects in the immunophenotype
There has been a renewed endeavor to study the downstream functional effects of
polymorphisms on immune cell population parameters. The increase in interest has
come with recent advancements in bioinformatics, advancements including novel
computational methods better able to distinguish causal polymorphisms with
functional downstream effects from non-causal polymorphisms that are in LD with the
causal disease-associated loci. New in silico methods, such as GWAS fine-mapping,
combine computational imputation and loci prioritization to enable one to statistically
discern locus that only tag for a disease-associated locus (nicknamed ‘stowaway loci’)
from true causal gene variants (Farh et al., 2015; Onengut-Gumuscu et al., 2015).
Multiple published algorithms have shown promising efficiency and accuracy in the
detection of possible downstream phenotypic effects; such as effects on transcriptionfactor binding, gene silencing or the likelihood of a site undergoing an epigenetic
modification (Huang et al., 2017; Robertson et al., 2021; Westra et al., 2018).
Nevertheless, causal gene variants which have shown strong associations to IA or T1D
are usually of chief interest. Importantly, analysis of genetic data have clearly shown
that many T1D associated polymorphisms are clustered in pathways that regulate
immune cell function and fate (Onengut-Gumuscu et al., 2015). In order to emphasize
the functional polymorphisms’ known and proposed effects on the immunophenotype,
the following sections will depict ten different SNPs located in ten separate genes. The
summary is authored to review the published literature of the ten polymorphisms’
downstream effects, and concurrently declare the rationale behind the selected SNPs’
inclusion into the thesis project. The reviewed SNPs’ MAFs, T1D odds ratios or hazard
ratios are presented in Table 1. Furthermore, the SNPs’ proposed effects on cellular
functions and cell-cell interactions are illustrated in Figure 6.

describes the SNP’s association to islet autoimmunity. The column “affected cell types” lists the cell
types which cellular function or frequency could potentially be affected by the SNP. Sources for
numerical data: 1. Shapiro et al. (2021), 2. Onengut-Gumuscu et al. (2015) and 3. Lempainen et al.
(2015). The information on the SNPs’ disease associations stems from previously cited sources and

psoriasis, MS = multiple sclerosis, CeD = celiac disease, LADA = latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.

2.5.1 PTPN22
PTPN22 encodes protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 and is commonly
referred to as lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase (LYP). LYP acts as a negative regulator
of TCR, BCR, and innate immune signaling by dephosphorylating a wide range of
receptor kinases, such as Lck, Fyn and ZAP70 (Rieck et al., 2007). Additionally, LYP
functions as a negative regulator of LFA-1 and type 1 IFN signaling (Armitage et al.,
2021). The online SNPedia database lists 21 different PTPN22 SNPs, of which
rs2476601 (G>A) is associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, such as T1D, RA,
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults
(LADA) (Cousminer et al., 2018; Ferreira et al., 2019; Márquez et al., 2018; Westra
et al., 2018). It has been proposed that a change in the inhibitory function of LYP could
shift the threshold of immune receptor activation or inhibition in cell subsets
expressing the aforementioned kinases; a change which either produce a gain-of30

function or a loss-of-function phenotype (Armitage et al., 2021). The downstream
phenotypic effects of rs2476601 on lymphocyte and myeloid cell functionality have
been extensively reviewed in a recent article by Armitage and colleagues (2021). The
rs2476601 SNP is associated with T1D, with a younger T1D onset, and with a lower
degree of β-cell functionality at diagnosis (Kordonouri et al., 2010; Petrone et al.,
2008; Vehik et al., 2019). The SNP exerts a strong risk effect for T1D and it has been
observed to cause changes in Treg-cell frequencies (Ferreira et al., 2019; Valta et al.,
2020). Moreover, the rs2476601 polymorphism confers an increase in risk for
seroconversion by potentially perturbating BCR-receptor signaling and increasing cell
resistance to apoptosis, subsequently decreasing B-cell self-tolerance by enabling the
escape of self-reactive B cells (Armitage et al., 2021; Habib et al., 2012). Furthermore,
the rs2476601 SNP has consistently been associated with an increase in risk of
seroconversion, seroconversion of IAA and GADA AAbs, initial IAA seroconversion,
and an increased progression rate to seropositivity (Brorsson & Pociot, 2015; Krischer
et al., 2015, 2017, 2019; Lempainen et al., 2015; Steck et al., 2009).
2.5.2 CTLA-4
CTLA-4 encodes an inhibitory checkpoint molecule that is constitutively expressed on
Treg cells, and upregulated on activated conventional T cells (Y. Chen et al., 2018).
The receptor is contained intracellularly when the cell is in a resting state and becomes
expressed on the cell surface upon cell activation, whereafter it starts to shuttle
between the cytosolic and membrane-bound phase. Activated CD4+ cells have also
been shown to excrete a soluble CTLA-4 isoform, however, the physiological function
of the soluble form is still under investigation (Esposito et al., 2014). CTLA-4
competes with its activating and costimulatory counterpart, CD28, for the binding to
B-7 molecules (CD80/CD86) on APCs. A recent study demonstrated that Treg cells
were able to deplete CD80/CD86 molecules on APCs via CTLA-4–dependent
trogocytosis (Tekguc et al., 2021). Moreover, the authors were able to demonstrate
that CTLA-4 disrupts cis-CD80/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) heterodimers
through the formation of CTLA-4/CD80 interactions. This increases the prevalence of
free PD-L1 on DCs, ligands now enabled to interact with and inhibit programmed
death-1 (PD-1)–expressing effector T cells. A previous functional study observed that
the Treg cells of SLE patients expressed CTLA-4 levels corresponding to that of
31

healthy subjects, however, the CTLA-4 molecules were less clustered in the lipid
microdomains of the Treg cells (Jury et al., 2010). This is one direct connection
between the role of CTLA-4 and the dysfunction of Treg cells in a systemic
autoimmune disease. T1D GWAS have reported six different SNPs in CTLA-4
wherein the rs231775 (A>G), the most studied variant, has a suggested modifying
effect on CTLA-4-expression levels (Robertson et al., 2021; Shapiro et al., 2021). It is
proposed that the intragenic A/G substitution in exon 1 of CTLA-4, causing a T17A
amino acid exchange, impairs CTLA-4 surface expression via changes to protein
glycosylation patterns (Haseda et al., 2011; Mäurer et al., 2002). Exon 1 codes for the
CTLA-4 protein’s leader peptide, which have led researchers to believe that the
rs231775 SNP mainly affects protein transport, turnover, or surface expression (Zhao
et al., 2018). A lower expression of CTLA-4 could decrease the negative regulatory
activity of Treg cells, and, therefore, increase the risk of self-reactive T cells escaping
peripheral immunomodulatory mechanisms. A population study of Han-Chinese
observed a reduced intracellular CTLA-4 expression in CD4+CD45RA−FOXP3high
Treg cells of healthy individuals carrying the GG and GA genotype (Y. Chen et al.,
2018). Furthermore, they also observed a higher frequency of IA-2A positive subjects
amongst GG-genotypes as compared to AA-genotypes. The rs231775 allele has been
associated with an initial seroconversion of GADA AAbs and with a later age of T1D
onset in a TEDDY cohort, but the association was not found in a later analysis of
similar material (Krischer et al., 2015, 2017). Moreover, the SNP did not function as
a reliable predictor for IA in transethnic DAISY cohorts (Frohnert et al., 2017; Steck
et al., 2014) The causal downstream effects of the polymorphism are poorly
understood, nevertheless, the potential functional effects on Treg cell suppressor
activity supports the assertion that the polymorphism needs to be studied further.
2.5.3 CD226
CD226, also known as DNAX, is a costimulatory molecule in the immunoglobulin
superfamily known to modulate the activation of effector and memory T cells, and NK
cells (Shapiro et al., 2021). The CD226 complex is competing with its
immunoregulatory counterpoint, TIGIT, to bind CD155 and CD112 expressed on
APCs during antigen presentation (W. Li et al., 2021; Shapiro et al., 2021). The
function of CD226 is equivalent to CD28 since it activates Th-cell engagement, and
32

its competition with TIGIT creates an interaction that is highly analogous to the
CTLA-4/CD28 immunoregulatory checkpoint pathway. A recently published study
reported an upregulated expression of CD226 amongst TIGIT+CD226+CD4+ Th cells
in patients with dermatomyositis (W. Li et al., 2021). The CD226 SNP rs763361 (C>T)
has been associated with T1D, RA, SLE and multiple sclerosis (MS) (Bai et al., 2020).
The rs763361 variation produces a G307S missense mutation introducing a novel
serine phosphorylation site at the cytoplasmic tail (Shirakawa et al., 2005; Wallet et
al., 2017). In vitro studies have found an increase in MAPK/ERK downstream
signaling amongst rs763361 genotype selected primary CD4+ T cells (Gaud et al.,
2018). This was best observed as an increase in IFN-γ and IL-17A production upon
stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. The CD226 polymorphism rs763361 has
been associated with IA, GADA-positivity and a faster disease progression rate from
birth to T1D (Lempainen et al., 2015; Mattana et al., 2014; Törn et al., 2015).
2.5.4 SH2B3
SH2B3 encodes the lymphocyte adaptor protein (LNK), a phosphatase which is
expressed in hematopoietic and endothelial cells (Wallet et al., 2017). LNK negatively
regulates several JAK/STAT signaling pathways, pathways which are central during
hematopoiesis, cytokine signaling, TCR-signal transduction, and cell migration
(Shapiro et al., 2021). A recent study of LNK−/− mouse models has shown that LNK is
an important negative regulator of lymphoid homeostasis in adipose tissue and that
LNK reduces the risk of developing diabetes by regulating the expansion and
activation of IL-15-dependent adipose G1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC) (Mori et al.,
2018). LNK is strongly expressed in monocytes and DCs, and the SNP rs3184504
(C>T) has been associated with T1D, IA and with an altered expression of IFN-γ and
STAT1 amongst T1D cases (Ashok Sharma et al., 2018; Westra et al., 2018). The
rs3184504 polymorphism produces a R262W missense mutation in exon 3, an exon
coding for a pleckstrin homology domain important for protein docking (Shapiro et
al., 2021). It has been predicted that the rs3184504 SNP could disrupt a splicing
enhancer motif important for splicing regulator binding, thus, producing a protein with
perturbed functionality (Shapiro et al., 2021). Extensive analysis of EBV-transformed
cells and peripheral blood transcriptome profiles have determined that the rs3184504
SNP functions as a trans-eQTL that affects the expression of multiple genes over a 1
33

Mb distance (Nyaga et al., 2018; Ram & Morahan, 2017). Moreover, rs3184504 has
been shown to exert a cis-eQTL effect where it increases peripheral blood LNK levels
in RA patients (Xingbo Mo et al., 2020). The SNP’s functional effect is thought to be
caused by a structural change to LNK’s own phosphorylation site; a change that could
affect LNK-activity levels and possibly the phosphatase’s ability to dephosphorylate
other protein complexes. The rs3184504 SNP has been associated with changes in IL1β and IL-6 production due to an activation of the NOD2-pathway (Maslah et al.,
2017). The SNP has also been associated with seroconversion amongst individuals
predisposed to T1D in multiple prospective studies (Krischer et al., 2017; Törn et al.,
2015; Vehik et al., 2019). The rs3184504 polymorphism’s downstream effects on
different hematological parameters have already been extensively reviewed (Maslah
et al., 2017).
2.5.5 FUT2
FUT2 encodes fucosyltransferase 2 an enzyme required to secrete ABO-blood group
antigens. The H-antigens are expressed on intestinal mucosa, and they are actively
secreted in bodily fluids such as saliva, tears, milk, semen, and urine. Individuals able
to secrete these antigens are called secretors (Shapiro et al., 2021). Disruption of FUT2
results in the absence of ABO secretion, which can be observed amongst non-secretor
individuals homozygous for the T1D associated FUT2 variant rs601338 (G>A), a
variant that produces a W154Stop nonsense mutation. ABO-antigen expression by the
mucosal epithelium heavily impacts the binding of environmentally acquired
pathogens, and, therefore, the formation of the commensal microbiota. However,
studies have yet not been able to find a significant causative or correlative relationship
between viral or bacterial infections and a definitive risk of developing T1D in nonsecretors (Giampaoli et al., 2020). Nevertheless, similar relationships have been
studied in diseases such as measles and mumps with significant findings surrounding
the SNP’s effect on infection susceptibility (Azad et al., 2018). The non-secretor AA
genotype has been determined to be more susceptible to T1D (Smyth et al., 2011) and
exhibit a faster decline in FPIR (Koskinen et al., 2020). Conversely, homozygosity for
the FUT2 major-G SNP has in high-risk individuals been associated with a secretor,
rapid progressor disease phenotype who after seroconversion have high AAb-titers and
are positive for multiple AAbs (Pöllänen et al., 2017). Furthermore, one functional
34

study of mice demonstrated that the induction and maintenance of FUT2 expression in
epithelia requires the stimulation of mucosal class 3 innate-lymphoid cells (called
ILC3 cells) expressing RORγt, the presence of IL-22 and a pool of lymphotoxin
provided by the microbiota (Goto et al., 2014). Hence, indicating that also secretors
have a phenotype that secrete variable levels of H-antigens. It is possible that the
prevalence of mucosal-associated immune cells, such as MAIT cells gamma-delta T
cells or ILCs, could be different when comparing secretors with non-secretors since
environmental factors could affect the individuals differently. Thus, depending on
secretor status, individuals may be more likely to interact with different predisposing
or protective environmental factors.
2.5.6 IFIH1
IFIH1, the interferon induced with helicase C domain 1, is an innate immune receptor
that senses intracellular RNA and facilitates the initiation of an antiviral response by
inducing IFN type I expression (Domsgen et al., 2016; Shapiro et al., 2021). IFIH1 is
important for bodily IFN regulation since rare GOF mutations have been reported to
cause interferonopathies, while LOF mutations provide protection from T1D (M. B.
Johnson et al., 2019). The IFIH1 SNP rs1990760 (T>C) causes a missense mutation
in the proteins C-terminal domain, and the polymorphism has been associated with
protection from T1D on a GWAS level (Barrett et al., 2009). It has been determined
that the rs1990760 minor allele does not affect the receptor’s ability to bind to doublestranded RNA. However, the risk associated major T-allele has been linked to an
elevated basal and ligand-induced type I IFN response. The protective effect, conferred
by the minor C-allele, could come from a more efficient detection and clearance of
entero- and coxsackie-viral infections; both of which are common viral infections
associated with T1D (Gorman et al., 2017; Nejentsev et al., 2009). In vitro studies of
pancreatic islets have demonstrated that the protective rs1990760 genotype provides a
more efficient response to viral infections via a prominent type III IFN response
(Domsgen et al., 2016). The increase in anti-viral response was also found in cells
infected with T1D associated virus strains, suggesting that the IFIH1 SNP confers
protection by improving viral response in pancreatic tissue. Interestingly, multiple
studies have shown that TC-heterozygotes, as compared to TT-homozygotes, are more
susceptible to T1D development (Dean et al., 2020; Schulte et al., 2016). This
35

dominant effect amongst heterozygotes could be observed in IFN and IFIH1 levels; an
effect possibly facilitated by molecular heterosis. One study of T1D cases found that
the rs1990760 risk-associated phenotype exhibited higher numbers of NK cells (Dean
et al., 2020). Moreover, an eQTL analysis found a reduced CD25 expression on total
and CD56bright NK cells amongst rs1990760 risk genotypes. Interestingly, the major
rs1990760-T has also been associated with AAb-positivity and an increased IA-toT1D progression rate (Brorsson et al., 2015; Brorsson & Pociot, 2015; Lempainen et
al., 2015; Steck et al., 2014).
2.5.7 BACH2
BACH2, BTB domain and CNC homolog 2, is a highly conserved member of the basic
leucine zipper domain (bZIP) superfamily of transcription factors, and it is an
important regulator of both T- and B-lymphocyte differentiation and maturation
(Afzali et al., 2017). BACH2 coordinates the transcription, activation, and repression
of multiple lymphocyte-regulatory mechanisms, and it can induce cell apoptosis in
response to oxidative stress. A knock-out of BACH2 will in mouse models reduce Treg
cell numbers while simultaneously increasing effector T cell numbers, hence, causing
fatal autoimmunity (Afzali et al., 2017). BACH2 appears to be critical for Treg-cell
development in the thymus and it restrains effector T-cell differentiation in the
periphery (Igarashi et al., 2017). BACH2 also restrains plasma-cell differentiation and
promotes B-cell proliferation and memory B-cell formation (Igarashi et al., 2017).
Patients with BACH2-deficiency develop common variable immune deficiency
(CVID) and colitis (Afzali et al., 2017). Treg cells from these patients have reduced
FOXP3 expression and their effector T cells have an increased expression of T-bet
(Th1-cell master transcription factor) as well as the gut-homing receptors CCR9 and
B7 integrin. The BACH2 SNP rs3757247 (G>A) appears to be associated with the
primary seroconversion of GADA AAbs and with IA (Krischer et al., 2017;
Lempainen et al., 2015). One widely studied BACH2 non-coding SNP, rs11755527,
has been implicated to exert extensive pleiotropic effects, and the SNP is associated
with T1D. Moreover, the rs11755527 SNP is in LD (r2 = 0.94) with rs3757247,
suggesting that these SNPs could exert synergistic effects (Krischer et al., 2017; L.
Yang et al., 2019). Nevertheless, it should be further investigated if both SNPs are
causative or if one only tag for the other’s risk effect. Recent reviews have discussed
36

the role of BACH2 in lymphoid fate determination and different BACH2
polymorphisms’ potential roles in autoimmunity (Igarashi et al., 2017; L. Yang et al.,
2019).
2.5.8 UBASH3A
UBASH3A encodes the ubiquitin-associated SH3A protein which is dominantly
expressed in T cells and serves as a negative regulator of TCR signaling (Shapiro et
al., 2021). UBASH3A interferes with the Cbl-mediated down-regulation and
degradation of receptor tyrosine kinases (Shapiro et al., 2021), and UBASH3A can
inhibit the activation of the IKK complex through a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism
(Ge et al., 2017), subsequently inhibiting NFκB-signaling. The rs11203203 (G>A)
SNP is a UBASH3A polymorphism that is located in intron 4, an intron including a
possible CD4+ T-cell enhancer region or super-enhancer region (Onengut-Gumuscu et
al., 2015). The rs11203203 SNP is associated with IA, T1D and a faster diseaseprogression rate from IA to T1D (K. Johnson et al., 2012; Steck et al., 2014; Ziegler
et al., 2013). Functional studies have demonstrated that the rs11203203 SNP increases
UBASH3A levels in TCR-activated primary CD4+ T cells, resulting in a decreased
NF-kB signaling and subsequently to a reduced IL-2 production (Ge et al., 2017). It
is, therefore, also possible that the SNP could affect the stability of Treg-cell
populations via modifications to the IL2/IL2 receptor α (IL2RA) regulatory axis.
Moreover, the rs11203203 is in complete LD (r2 =1) with rs80054410 (T>C), another
SNP modifying the same super-enhancer. A recent article showed that the risk
associated rs11203203-A with rs80054410-C forms a common T1D associated risk
haplotype (haplotype frequency = 0.292) (Ge & Concannon, 2018). It has also been
shown that the UBASH3A SNP rs883868, which is in LD with rs11203203 (D’ =
0.85), disrupts the binding of retinoic acid receptor α (RARA), an important
transcriptional factor in Treg cells (Gao et al., 2019).
2.5.9 IL2RA
IL2RA encodes the interleukin 2 receptor chain alpha that together with the betasubunit forms the IL2-receptor. The IL2RA locus belongs to one of the strongest nonHLA susceptibility-factor loci, an association observed in multiple autoimmune
diseases (Rainbow et al., 2017). SNPs of both IL2 cytokine and IL2-receptor genes are
thought to facilitate homeostatic changes to the IL2/IL2RA regulatory axis (J. Yang et
37

al., 2015), changes which could affect the activation of T cells, especially in naïve Treg
cells (Garg et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2015). One rare IL2RA SNP of particular interest,
rs61839660 (C>T), is associated with T1D, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and
Crohn’s disease (Huang et al., 2017; Rainbow et al., 2017; Soderquest et al., 2017).
The SNP has been shown to reduce receptor subunit expression as a response-eQTL
that becomes activated in response to diverse transcriptional factors, although,
additional functional studies are needed to investigate which T-cell populations are
affected by the SNP (Rainbow et al., 2017; Simeonov et al., 2017). Furthermore, the
rs61839660 SNP was determined to be located in a T-cell enhancer region, where the
minor-T allele disrupts the binding of the transcriptional factor MEF2A/C (Schwartz
et al., 2017). Additionally, the rs61839660 gene locus has been predicted to bind Tbet, a transcription-factor interaction that could be modified by the SNP (Soderquest
et al., 2017)
2.5.10 PTPN2
PTPN2 encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2, a phosphatase
that has a analogous function to the PTPN22 product since it is an important negative
regulator of the JAK/STAT pathway (Wiede et al., 2017). Interestingly, early in vitro
studies of β-cells demonstrated that decreased PTPN2 availability exacerbated
STAT1-activated IL-1β signaling, concurrently turning an intrinsic IFNγ-signal into
an apoptotic signal (Moore et al., 2009). Studies have shown that deficiency of PTPN2
may allow for Th-independent acquisition of Tc cytotoxic activity (Wiede et al., 2014).
This is reflected in the gene’s connection to T1D development since the PTPN2 SNP
rs45450798 (G>C) is associated with islet autoimmunity and with a faster disease
progression after seroconversion (Lempainen et al., 2015). The SNP, located in the
PTPN2 3’-untranslated region, has been in-silico predicted to produce a novel
microRNA binding site for miR-453 (de Almeida et al., 2018). However, it was also
predicted that the novel binding site would not affect the translation of the product.
Nonetheless, the authors pointed out that other non-coding SNPs repressing PTPN2
are associate with several immune related diseases, including T1D (de Almeida et al.,
2018). The risk effect conferred by the rs45450798 SNP could be contributed to a
decreased sensitivity for apoptotic stimuli in B cells, although, one functional study
could not find an SNP-mediated alteration in the B-cell frequencies of individuals with
38

T1D (Thompson et al., 2014). Furthermore, functional studies of rs45450798 carriers
with T1D have not found any significant difference in Treg cell subpopulation
frequencies (Valta et al., 2020). However, one study found that the rs45450798 SNP
was significantly associated with an more rapid decline in FPIR amongst children with
multiple AAbs (Koskinen et al., 2020).

effects on cellular function. A. Perturbations in the function of IFIH1 and FUT2 modify the organism’s
interactions with the environment and the pathogens in it. The modification of antiviral response time

modifying the virome or modify the antiviral response of β-cells (C.). B. The majority of the reviewed
SNPs can be placed in the functional pathways of immune cells, especially in the pathways of T cells
and APCs. Nonetheless, it should be noted, the reviewed SNPs’ functional effects are not limited to the
illustrated cell subsets since the functional effects can be observed in other cell types expressing the
same locus. The figure is conceptually adapted from Shapiro et al. (2021). Created with BioRender.

3. The background and the objectives of the thesis study
3.1 Background
The DIPP study group was recently able to observe an effect where the PTPN22
polymorphism rs2476601 (G>A) significantly modified Treg cell frequencies in both
non-diabetic and diabetic children (Valta et al., 2020). The authors found a
significantly higher CD4+CD25+CD127lowFOXP3+ Treg cell frequency (GG vs. AA;
p = 0.014) and CD4+CD25+CD45RO−CD127lowFOXP3+ naive Treg-cell frequency
(GG vs. AA; p = 0.041) amongst rs2476601-A risk-allele carriers when comparing ten
non-diabetic GG, AG, and AA genotypes in a validation cohort. This Treg cell
modifying effect was also observed in a similar clinical study of SLE, however, only
amongst healthy adult individuals of a non-SLE–susceptible genotype (Ferreira et al.,
2019). Ferreira and colleagues observed that the rs2476601-A allele conferred a
significantly higher frequency of total CD4+CD127lowCD25hi Treg cells (p = 3.3×104

) and CD4+CD127lowCD25hi memory Treg cells (p = 1.0×10-4). It should be noted that

the DIPP study was able to detect the SNP’s cell frequency modifying effects in a
much smaller cohort (N = 30 vs. N = 486), which can potentially be explained by the
DIPP cohort examining younger children at risk for diabetes. In contrast, the SLE
study detected a corresponding effect when examining > 450 healthy adults; adults
who have a more heterogeneous and experienced immunophenotype. Notably, the
SNP’s effect could not be observed when examining SLE cases due to a persistent ingroup variation that most likely derived from the heterogeneity of the disease. High
in-study variation usually stems from the study populations’ phenotypic and genotypic
heterogeneity, and this concurrently increases the need for a larger samples size so as
to achieve more statistical power and more robust results. In conclusion, the
quantification of weak genetic risk effects in adults usually requires large sample sizes
to compensate for in-study variation, thus, lowering the practicability of
immunophenotyping adults when attempting to quantify small variations in immune
cell parameters or in immune cell functionality.
CTLA-4, the key inhibitory immune-checkpoint protein expressed by conventional T
cells and Treg cells, competes in cis with its costimulatory counterpart CD28 for the
binding to CD80/86 expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). It is evident that
the sequestration of CD80/86 on APCs suppresses the APC–T-cell interactions by
40

lowering the propensity and avidity of CD28–CD80/86 interactions (Y. Chen et al.,
2018).

The

competitive-inhibitory interaction between

the

aforementioned

components is well studied, and the kinetic-mechanistic pathway of CTLA-4
suppression was recently elucidated (Tekguc et al., 2021). The rs231775 (A>G) SNP
has been shown to confer a significant increase in risk of developing T1D, and the risk
effect is determined to stem from an alteration in the protein’s expression level (Y.
Chen et al., 2018; Mäurer et al., 2002; Robertson et al., 2021; Shapiro et al., 2021;
Wang et al., 2017). The SNP has been observed to modify CD4+ and CD4+CD25+ cell
frequencies in children at risk for T1D (Jonson et al., 2006). Conversely, one
functional study could not find a SNP-mediated effect in the intracellular expression
levels of CTLA-4 amongst individuals with fully developed T1D (Haseda et al., 2011).
Nonetheless, a lowered expression of surface-bound CTLA-4 would constitute a major
alteration to the T cells ability to downregulate CD28–CD80/86 interactions (Y. Chen
et al., 2018), a activatory axis important for normal conventional T-cell–APC
interactions.

The

polymorphism’s

functional

downstream

effects

on

an

immunophenotype level are still unknown. Furthermore, the SNP’s effect on a broader
spectrum of T-cell subsets has not been investigated, even when the polymorphism
increases susceptibility to T1D and other autoimmune diseases.
3.2 Study hypothesis
We postulate that it would be more efficient to detect and quantify the immunological
effects exerted by non-HLA polymorphisms in a cohort of younger children (< 5 years
of age); mainly since environmental effects have not had the time to modify the
immunophenotypes of young children in a similar manner to adults. Genetic factors
could, therefore, be perceived to exert a greater risk effect on the immunophenotype
of younger children since environmental factors, such as vaccinations and infection
history, have not caused a persistent alteration in the immunophenotype.
Consequently, the quantification of hard-to-detect phenotypic effects could possibly
be more efficient when studying younger children, even within a cohort of a smaller
sample size, since one is simultaneously eliminating the heterogeneity caused by
various acquired environmental effects. This hypothesis sets up a proposition to study
genotype-to-immunophenotype effects in younger children (< 5 years of age) by
utilizing the databank material produced and managed by the DIPP study group.
41

It should be attainable to quantify the CTLA-4 rs231775 SNP’s downstream effects
on multiple immune cell subsets by utilizing the DIPP study’s data repository. Proper
case-control matching, and the elimination of other powerful genetic and
environmental effects could enable one to better quantify previously discussed
downstream effects, although, not only on protein expression levels, but also on a
wider scale of cells subset frequencies; frequencies which can be affected by the
inherent perturbation of CTLA-4’s inhibitory role in the stimulatory CD28–CD80/86
axis.
3.3 Study objectives
This thesis study contains two main objectives. The first objective is to generate a
novel DIPP subject cohort that allows for the future execution of genotype-toimmunophenotype studies which aim to quantify non-HLA polymorphisms’ effects on
various PBMC population parameters. Our preliminary aim is to generate a dataset
through the genotyping of ten different non-HLA polymorphisms amongst 700
healthy, AAb-negative, at-risk children who are enrolled in the DIPP study. All
subjects are genotyped, utilizing the TaqMan qPCR platform, for the SNPs rs2476601
(PTPN22), rs231775 (CTLA-4), rs1990760 (IFIH1), rs3184504 (SH2B3), rs601338
(FUT2), rs763361 (CD226), rs72928038 (BACH2), rs11203203 (UBASH3A),
rs61839660 (IL2RA) and rs45450798 (PTPN2). Additionally, all subjects will be
screened for CMV-IgG antibodies with seropositivity functioning as a marker for an
active or latent CMV infection.
The second objective of the thesis study is to conduct an immunophenotyping pilot of
twelve matched case-control pairs homozygous for the wild type or variant form of
CTLA-4 (rs231775). The immunophenotyping pilot is conducted to demonstrate the
feasibility and practicability of the study design. The functional downstream effects of
the rs231775 SNP on immune cell population parameters will be quantified using flow
cytometry amongst the following cell types: monocytes, DCs, NK cells, innate natural
killer T lymphocytes (iNKT), B cells, T cells and Treg cells. Furthermore, the
polymorphism’s effect on intracellular CTLA-4 levels will be quantified amongst
CD4+CD25+CD127lowFOXP3+ Treg cells utilizing flow-cytometric panels developed
and optimized for the thesis project. Finally, surface CTLA-4 expression will be
42

quantified on isolated CD3+ T cells after 1, 4, and 24 hours of PMA/Ionomycin
stimulation.

4. Study design and methods
4.1 Cohort generation
The study cohort was generated from children enrolled in the DIPP study, but who
have not developed AAbs or clinical T1D during the follow-up period (Parkkola et al.,
2013). All subjects included were born between 2005 and 2017 and were HLAgenotyped in accordance with the most recent DIPP inclusion criteria (Ilonen et al.,
2016).
The DIPP study’s HLA class II-based eligibility criteria, in short, are developed to
define major haplotypes associated with susceptibility to or protection against T1D.
HLA typing was initiated with genotyping for frequent DQB1 alleles, with four-digit
resolution, followed by a panel of probes defining three DQA1 alleles (DQA1*02:01,
DQA1*03, DQA1*05) that were differentiated into major haplotypes containing
DQB1*02, DQB1*03:01, DQB1*03:02 and DQB1*03:03 alleles. When screening
DRB1 alleles, DRB1*04 alleles associated with variable T1D risk were further defined
into DRB1*04 subtypes amongst DQB1*03:02 positive subjects. A subset of DQB1
genotypes had their second exon hypervariable region sequenced by an off-site service
provider since certain alternative genotypes cannot be distinguished with probe-based
genotyping. To summarize, eligible HLA genotypes include those homozygous or
heterozygous for the DQA1*05-DQB1*02 (DR3-DQ2) and DRB1*04:01/02/04/05DQA1*03-DQB1*03:02 (DR4-DQ8) haplotypes. Individuals carrying the DR3DQ2/DQA1*03-DQB1*03:03 (DR9-DQ9) combination or the high-risk DR4-DQ8
haplotype in combination with the DQB1*05:01 (DR1-DQ5), DQA1*02:01DQB1*02 (DR7-DQ2), DQB1*04 (DR8-DQ4), DR9-DQ9, or DQB1*06:04 (DR13DQ6.4) haplotype are also eligible (Mikk et al., 2020). The DQB1 and DQA1 assays
are in-house homogeneous PCR assays (Kiviniemi et al., 2007). The HLA-DRB1
assay is an in-house assay that is based on the commercial dissociation-enhanced
lanthanide fluorescence (DELFIA) platform (Kiviniemi et al., 2007; Lehmusvuori et
al., 2014; Nejentsev et al., 1999).

43

All subjects included in the thesis cohort have at least two or more cryopreserved
PBMC samples which were drawn between the ages of six months and five years. The
PBMCs were isolated from heparinized whole blood by gradient centrifugation in
accordance with an in-house protocol, whereafter the cells were cryopreserved in -80
°C or in liquid nitrogen (Öling et al., 2005). Serotyping for GADA, IA-2A, IAA, and
ZnT8A was performed with AAb-specific radio-binding assays using blood serum
(Juusola et al., 2016; Siljander et al., 2009). Screening for ICA positivity was
performed with an indirect immunofluorescence staining method using human
pancreas sections (Bottazzo et al., 1974). The standardized limits for seropositivity
have been described earlier (Pöllänen et al., 2019).
The selection of SNPs for genotyping was based on four criteria:
1. The gene product should have a determined or suggested functional
relationship to the activities of immune cells, especially T and B cells.
2. The SNP should affect the functionality of the protein or the expression of the
gene.
3. The MAF should be sufficient for the detection of homozygotes in a cohort of
fewer than 1000 individuals, i.e., so that each SNP would yield at least 15 to
20 minor SNP homozygotes.
4. The SNP should have an association to multiple autoimmune diseases.
The selected SNPs and their suggested functions and effects on the immunophenotype
are presented in Section 2.5.
This study was authorized by the ethical committee of the North Ostrobothnia’s
Hospital District in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All samples and data
were collected with informed consent from the subjects’ legal guardians and are stored
according to the protocols of the DIPP study.
4.2 Study population characteristics
The generated cohort consisted of 694 DIPP study subjects of which 99% (690/694)
were recruited at the Turku Universal Hospital Research Centre and the remaining 1%
(4/694) at the Tampere University Hospital Research Centre. The whole-cohort maleto-female ratio was 50.3% and 49.7%, respectively. Furthermore, in accordance with
the most recent DIPP HLA-risk categories, 28.2% of the subjects are placed in a high44

risk group, 53.9% in a moderately increased risk group and 16.0% in a slightly
increased risk group (Ilonen et al., 2016). One out of the 694 subjects belonged to a
neutral risk group, and twelve subjects carried an unresolved haplotype.
The subcohort intended for wide-scale immunophenotyping and quantification of
CTLA-4 expression was formed from twelve pairs matched for rs231775 (A>G) SNP
genotype (risk allele homozygote = GG; wild type allele homozygote = AA), sex,
research center, birthdate (± 5 months) and sample date (± 6 months). All subjects
were of a PTPN22 GG-homozygous genotype, and the subjects were on average
heterozygous for two of the other eight analyzed SNPs (number of heterozygous SNP
loci: min = 0; max = 6). None of the subjects were homozygous for any other studied
SNP, apart from the subcohort’s rs231775-GG risk-allele homozygotes. The
immunophenotyped PBMC samples of the subcohort pairs were taken at the age of 6
months, 9 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, or 4 years; hence, producing two matched
pairs for respective time point. Moreover, as of the whole subcohort, six pairs were of
respective sex, however, the sex was not matched between respective pairs when
considering a specific time point.
4.3 Genotyping
Sample preparations were initiated with the aliquotation of diluted and undiluted stock
DNA samples. DNA was alternatively extracted from freezer-stored cord blood
samples using a standard in-house salting-out method (Olerup & Zetterquist, 1992),
from stored bloodspot cards using an in-house extraction method (Nejentsev et al.,
1999) or from stored PBMC samples using the commercial NucleoSpin Tissue DNA
extraction kit (Macherey-Nagel, ref. 740952.50). Visibly impure samples were
purified with a NucleoSpin gDNA Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel, ref. 740230.50).
DNA concentrations were measured with a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher, cat.
Q33226).
SNP genotyping was performed by TaqMan qPCR using on-the-shelf and custommade TaqMan probes (Thermo Fisher, cat. 4351379) for rs2476601 (Assay ID:
C__16021387_20), rs231775 (Assay ID: C___2278044_10), rs1990760 (Assay ID:
C___2780299_30), rs3184504 (Assay ID: C___2981072_10), rs601338 (Custom
assay),

rs763361

(Assay

ID:

C___1464836_20),
45

rs72928038

(Assay

ID:

C__97128303_10), rs11203203 (Assay ID: C__31891467_20), rs61839660 (Assay
ID: C__90618163_10) and rs45450798 (Assay ID: C__86382390_10). The used
methods, as modified from the manufacturers protocol, have been described earlier
(Nygård et al., 2021). The genotyping results were analyzed with QuantStudio Designs
& Analysis Desktop Software (v1.5.1) with analytical call settings set at “analyze
Real-time Rn-Median (Rna to Rnb)”. A summary of all calls was made with Thermo
Fishers Connect cloud software for genotyping with previously specified call settings.
4.4 Serological testing for latent cytomegalovirus infection
The subjects had their in-cohort oldest plasma sample analyzed, i.e., the sample
extracted in tandem with the last available PBMC sample taken at or before the age of
five years. The serological CMV-ELISA assay was performed by an off-site service
provider (Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Turku University Hospital) that
utilized the commercial VIDAS CMV IgG assay kit (bioMérieux, cat. 30204-01). The
specifications of the assay kit and the threshold values for seropositivity have been
described earlier (Murat et al., 2013)
4.5 PBMC aliquotation, CD3+ T-cell fractioning and PMA/Ionomycin stimulation
The preparations for flow cytometry and CD3+ magnet-activated bead sorting (MACS)
was initiated with the thawing and aliquotation of cryopreserved PBMC samples.
PBMC thawing was conducted according to a standard in-house procedure, and the
cells were treated with DNAse I. The matched pairs had their samples concomitantly
prepared and analyzed to limit the influence of batch variation. The used cell staining
methods are described in the next section and the panels are described in Appendix I,
tables 1-5. The cells, 0.5–2.0×106 cells for each panel, were analyzed in the following
order of prioritization using the following panels: Treg-cell panel, stimulated CD3+ T
cell CTLA-4–expression analysis panel, CD4+/CD8+ chemokine panel, B-cell panel,
and myeloid and innate lymphoid cell panel. Samples which included a suboptimal
total number of PBMCs were excluded from panel analysis in the order of increasing
prioritization. The cells aliquoted for the Treg cell, CD4+/CD8+ chemokine, B-cell,
and myeloid and innate lymphoid cell panels, were analyzed with flow cytometry on
the same day as they were thawed. Meanwhile, the cells aliquoted for CD3+ MACS
fractioning were incubated (37 °C, 5% CO2) in suspension with 5% AB serum
supplemented RPMI-1640 (supplemented RPMI-AB; Appendix II, Table 1) overnight.
46

The magnetic separation of CD3+ T cells was performed with CD3 Microbeads
(Miltenyi Biotec, cat. KM-12636) and with the use of MS columns (Miltenyi Biotec,
cat. 130-042-201) fitted for Miltenyi’s MS MACS separator. Fractioning was
performed according to the manufacturers protocol. The isolated CD3+ T cells were
subsequently aliquoted in 5×104 cell subsets to duplicate flat-bottomed 96-well 250
uL plates with aliquots intended for 1, 4 and 24 hours of incubation. Furthermore,
additional cells were aliquoted for 24 hours of incubation (and for the remaining time
points when possible) and stained as fluorescence-minus one controls (FMO). One
sample set functioned as an unstimulated control with cells suspended in 200 uL
supplemented RPMI-AB medium. The samples aimed for stimulation were suspended
in 200 uL supplemented RPMI-AB including 50 ng/mL phorbol myristic acid (PMA)
(Sigma-Aldrich, P8139-1MG) and 1 ug/mL Ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, I0634-1MG).
The plates were incubated (37 °C, 5% CO2) for the aforementioned time periods,
whereafter the samples were stained and studied with flow cytometry.
4.6 Flow cytometric studies
Flow cytometry was performed according to the guidelines published by the European
Journal of Immunology (Cossarizza et al., 2019). The staining and cytometry
procedure followed a published in-house strategy optimized for on-site equipment
(Valta et al., 2020; Viisanen et al., 2019). Moreover, internal control PBMC samples
from healthy adult individuals were used to assess technical variation. Cell viability
analysis of all panels was performed with Zombie Aqua dye (BioLegend, cat. 4231)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Surface immunostaining was performed
with fluorochrome-labeled antibodies selected to define each cell subtype of interest.
Antibodies for intracellular markers in the Treg-cell panel were added after fixation
and permeabilization with the eBioscience FOXP3/Transcription kit (Invitrogen, cat.
00-5523-00). The myeloid and innate lymphoid panel included pretreatment with the
TruStain FcX Fc-receptor blocker (BioLegend, cat. 422301). Both procedures were
performed in accordance with respective manufacturer’s instructions. The stimulated
cells intended for CTLA-4–expression analysis were stained for 30 minutes (in
incubator; 37 °C, 5% CO2) in ad 50 uL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) supplemented
with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), subsequently washed with FACS-buffer (PBS,
0.5% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide) and run on a NovoCyte Quanteon flow cytometer
47

(Agilent, cat. 2010097). The remaining panels were incubated with their markers for
20 minutes at room temperature and subsequently treated according to the
aforementioned procedure. The data was analyzed with Becton Dickinson’s FlowJo
Software (Version. 10.8.0) in accordance with predetermined gating strategies
(appendixes III–VII).
4.7 Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 9 (Version. 9.2.0). The
level of significance for lognormal distributed data was calculated using ratio paired ttest. Wilcoxon’s matched pair signed-rank test was applied when the dataset deviated
from lognormal distribution or included null values. A two-tailed p-value ≤ 0.05 was
considered significant.

5. Results
5.1 Genotyping and CMV-IgG serotyping results
TaqMan genotyping yielded a complete set of SNP data for 678 subjects, hence,
producing a successful call rate of 99.8% (for all tests combined). Out of 694 subjects,
38.5% (267/694) were homozygous for one SNP. Furthermore, when excluding

5.2 CTLA-4 expression patterns in PMA/Ionomycin stimulated CD3+ T cells
The

quantification

of

CTLA-4

surface

expression

was

performed

with

PMA/Ionomycin stimulated CD3+ T cells. The matched pairs’ samples were treated
and analyzed in tandem, consequently, producing data for 8 pairs at the 1-hour time
point and for 9 pairs at the 4 and 24-hour time points, respectively. The activation
marker CD69 was analyzed to verify proper technical performance and to measure the
level of T-cell activation (gated populations; Appendix III, Figure 1). Unstimulated
control samples expressed no CTLA-4 after each time period of incubation (figures 7
and 8). CD69 was expressed by unstimulated cells during all time points, thus,
producing a background level of marker expression with peak expression occurring at
the 4-hour time point (Figure 7; geometric mean: 4 hours = 36.56%). The
PMA/Ionomycin stimulated samples demonstrated an exponential increase in CD69
expression (Figure 7; geometric mean: 1 hour = 90.79%, 4 hours = 97.55%, 24 hours
= 99.59%) with CTLA-4 surface-expression levels peaking at the 4-hour time point
(geometric mean = 10.99%).

frequencies for respective time points is visualized with red triangles for GG-genotypes and black

When comparing the matched pairs’ data, there were no significant differences in the
frequency of CTLA-4+ cells after any period of stimulation (example data; Figure 8).
Furthermore, there were no apparent effects on CTLA-4+ cell frequencies when
examining CD4+ Th and CD8+ Tc cells separately, or when analyzing naïve and
memory T cells separately (Figure 9). Furthermore, a separate analysis of the CD69+
activated cell fraction (CD69− cells excluded) did not produce any differing results
from that found in the in-text presented total CD69+/− fraction.

5.3 The rs231775-G polymorphism modifies CTLA-4 expression in Treg cells
The immunophenotyping of the 12 matched pairs yielded 11 complete pairs which
were included in the final analysis of the Treg-cell compartments (gated populations;
Appendix IV, figures 1–3). One pair was excluded from further analysis since one
individual expressed a rare CD45 gene variant which disrupts the transcriptional
splicing of CD45RA, consequently, rendering one unable to visualize CD45RA and to
distinguish naïve cells from memory cells. In short, the Treg-cell panel stained the
intracellular compartment for CTLA-4, Ki-67, FOXP3 and Helios; thus, enabling the
measurement of intracellular CTLA-4 storage levels. Other phenotypical markers for
Treg activation and differentiation were analyzed in parallel. There were no significant
differences in the frequency of CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127LowFOXP3+ Treg cells when
analyzing the matched pairs’ data (Figure 10). However, there was a significant
difference in the frequency of CTLA-4+ Treg cells when studying total CTLA-4+ Treg
cells (p = 0.0091; t(10) = 3.223; geometric mean: GG = 29.15%, AA = 35.75%), and
CD45RA+ naïve Treg cells (p = 0.0136; t(10) = 2.998; geometric mean: GG = 16.39%,
AA = 23.32%) (Figure 11). Moreover, when examining the CTLA-4+ CD45RA−
memory Treg cells, the difference in population frequency reached a borderline
significance (p = 0.0631; t(10) = 2.090; geometric mean: GG = 72.29%, AA = 77.68%)
(Figure 11). A representative pairs’ genotypic difference in Treg cell CTLA-4
expression is shown in Figure 12.

The Treg-cell panel also enables a separate analysis of CD4+ non-Treg cells; a CD4+
T-cell fraction which excludes CD4+CD25+CD127low cells (non-Treg gate; Appendix
IV, Figure 2). When examining CTLA-4+ memory CD4+ non-Treg cells separately,
there was a significant difference in intracellular CTLA-4 expression (p = 0.0386; t(10)
= 2.380; geometric mean: GG = 10.27%, AA = 13.12%) between the genotypes
(Figure 13). A weak trend (p = 0.0702; t(10) = 2.027; geometric mean: GG = 0.333%,
AA = 0.469%) could also be observed in the CTLA-4+ naïve CD4+ non–Treg-cell
fraction (Figure 13). Whole CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell populations were also examined
separately (gating strategy; Appendix IV, Figure 1). There were no significant
differences in the CTLA-4+ fractions within the CD8+ T-cell compartment. However,
a significant difference (p = 0.0314; t(11) = 2.501; geometric mean: GG = 13.06%,
AA = 15.90%) could be observed in the CTLA-4+ memory CD4+ T-cell compartment.
Lastly, no trends were detected when examining the expression of other phenotypic
markers within the Treg-cell compartment (gating for phenotypic markers; Appendix
IV, figures 2-3).

Further immunophenotyping was performed on the samples from the 12 matched pairs
with the myeloid and innate lymphoid staining panel, the B-cell panel and the
CD4+/CD8+ chemokine panel. This was done in accordance with the pre-determined
order of panel prioritization, hence, excluding some individuals’ panel-specific
analysis due to a shortage of cells. Four pairs had their samples studied with the
myeloid and innate lymphoid panel, six pairs with the B-cell panel and six pairs with
the CD4+/CD8+ chemokine panel. Nevertheless, the phenotyping did not reveal any
indicative trends or differences between the matched pairs. The analyzed cell subtypes
of respective panel have been highlighted in the panels’ descriptions (appendixes V–
VII).

6. Discussion
The main objective of the thesis study was to produce a novel DIPP data repository
which in the future can be used to conduct the genotype-targeted immunophenotype
profiling of DIPP subjects and to study the polymorphisms’ effects on immune cell
functions. Naturally, the genotyped SNPs were selected based on their associations
with autoimmune disease, especially to T1D, and due to their presumed effects on
immune cell function. The number of preliminary subjects (N = 694) and the high
average number of stored PBMCs (Number of subjects with > 2 stored PBMCs = 85%;
> 4 stored PBMCs = 50 %) allows for the time-efficient inclusion of additional
genotyped SNPs in the future. Furthermore, since the PTPN22 rs2476601 SNP causes
both determined and still poorly characterized modifications in the immunophenotype,
individuals carrying the disease associated SNP will most likely be excluded when
forming new cohorts. In our material, 77.3% (536/694) were homozygous for the
wildtype rs2476601-G allele, thus, leaving us with 207 subjects (207/536) of a
rs2476601-GG genotype who are homozygous for one additional SNP. Nonetheless,
as observed within our genotyping output, the inclusion of low frequency SNPs puts
to question the relative cost-effectiveness of genotyping rare polymorphisms since the
frequency

of

homozygous

carriers

can

be

inadequate

for

widescale

immunophenotyping of multiple functional parameters. This drawback is observed in
the case of the IL2RA polymorphism (rs61839660) that according to Shapiro et al.
(2021) had and MAF of 10%. However, our cohort yielded no minor allele
homozygotes and a calculated MAF of 3.9%. We later noted that the 1000Genomes
56

study of European material had previously reported a lower MAF of 6.9% (N = 1006)
for this SNP. Moreover, an Estonian population study reported an MAF of 4.8% (N =
4480) (Tasa et al., 2019), a MAF that is relatively close to that observed in our material.
Hence, to yield a satisfactory number of SNP-homozygous subsets, the future
genotyping of additional SNPs within the established cohort should focus on
polymorphisms with MAFs over 20%. In some cases, the study of the SNP’s effect on
the immunophenotype can also be performed with heterozygous individuals if the
investigated allele demonstrates a dominant effect.
Serotyping for CMV-IgG seropositivity found that 24% of all subjects were infected
with CMV, a value similar to the most previous estimates (~25%) of equivalent
material (Aarnisalo et al., 2008; Hiltunen et al., 1995). CMV-infection history was not
considered when forming the matched pairs of the pilot study, an inadvertent result of
the thesis project’s time constraints. Still, CMV-infection history shall be considered
when using the produced dataset in the future, either when forming new subcohorts or
when stratifying results post hoc, since CMV infections significantly shifts the
proportion of effector CD8+ T cells towards an increased frequency of terminally
differentiated effector T cells (TEMRA). Given that CMV infections mainly exert
visible effects on the CD8+ T-cell compartment, it can be assumed that CMV
seropositivity does not significantly affect the cell-frequency patterns of CD4+ T cells,
including Treg cells.
In the pilot study, which constitutes the second objective of the thesis, the stimulation
of isolated CD3+ T cells and the subsequent phenotyping of CTLA-4–surface
expression did not produce any data to support the assertion that CTLA-4 expression
would be lower amongst rs231775 minor-G allele homozygotes. This conflicts with
the only previous study that quantified surface expression of CTLA-4 amongst
rs231775 genotypes (Mäurer et al., 2002). However, is should be noted, Mäurer et al.
used allogenic mature DCs to stimulate isolated T cells which after 48 hours of
stimulation showed a significant difference in the mean fluorescence index of CTLA4+ cells when comparing GG and AA genotypes in a small cohort (GG = 4; AA = 4).
Nevertheless, we were able to observe CTLA-4–expression patterns which
corresponded to that observed in an earlier study that used PMA/Ionomycin for T-cell
activation (Jago et al., 2004). To summarize, we and Jago et al., respectively,
57

demonstrated that CTLA-4 is mainly expressed in the effector subsets of CD4+ T cells
and CD4+ Treg cells. Memory T cells, as compared to naïve T cells, have demonstrably
higher levels of CTLA-4, both intracellularly and extracellularly, pre-stimulation and
post-stimulation (Figure 9). CD8+ T cells do express CTLA-4 upon stimulation, but
only at a fraction of that seen in CD4+ T cells.
The activation of T cells with PMA/Ionomycin, a pharmacological activator of
calcium-dependent signaling, circumvents the classical pathway of TCR-dependent
activation. PMA/Ionomycin treatment activates the degranulation of vesicles which
contain CTLA-4, hence, facilitating the proteins’ transport to the surface (Linsley et
al., 1996). Recent evidence has also shown that the transcriptional expression of
CTLA-4 is regulated via a PKA/CREB-dependent pathway, via transcription factor
IFN-γ and by cAMP; three mechanisms which upstream intersect with the pathways
of canonical calcium-dependent signaling (J. Li et al., 2013; Xuan Mo et al., 2018).
However, it is still uncertain whether pharmacological PMA/Ionomycin treatment can
induce physiologically corresponding levels of CTLA-4 expression since the induction
of stimulation is strictly pharmacological and highly potent. It is possible, when
comparing GG and AA genotypes, that the expected physiological difference in
CTLA-4 expression is lost due to our choice of stimulation method. If that is the case,
the expression levels that correspond to true physiological CTLA-4 upregulation
would perhaps be discernable after TCR-activation. It would, therefore, be reasonable
to verify the results using a separate method of stimulation, e.g., with CD3/CD28 Tcell activation or with allogenic mature DCs, as in the prior experiments of Mäurer et
al. (2002). Prior to initiation of our main experiments, T-cell stimulation with beads
that facilitate TCR-based T-cell activation was tested. However, we were unable to
activate the T cells reliably with the conditions used and, as a result, had to abandon
this approach since no CTLA-4 surface expression was observed after activation.
The Treg-cell panel demonstrated that there was a significant difference in the
frequency of CTLA-4+ total (p = 0.0091) and naïve (p = 0.0136) Treg cells when
staining for CTLA-4 intracellularly (Figure 11). Moreover, the difference between the
pairs reached a borderline significance (p = 0.0631) in memory Treg cells. In the
memory Treg-cell compartment, it is likely that the naturally high frequency of CTLA4 positivity lowered the genotypic difference when examining intracellular storage
58

levels. That is to say, the expression and storage of CTLA-4 could already be at a
maximum level in non-stimulated memory Treg cells. The study of CD4+ non-Treg
cells found a significant difference (p = 0.0386) in the CTLA-4+ fraction of memory
CD4+ non-Treg cells (Figure 13). However, compared to the CTLA-4+ memory Tregcell compartment, the frequency of CTLA-4+ memory CD4+ non-Treg cells showed
less variance, and two outliers present in the non-Treg fraction contributed
significantly to an increase in mean difference.
There was also a significant difference in the frequency of CTLA-4+ cells when
investigating the total memory CD4+ T-cell population (p = 0.0314), thus, suggesting
that the study of intercellular CTLA-4 storage levels on a whole CD4+ T-cell
population level should yield significant results. However, as shown in our stimulation
experiment no difference could be observed in the surface expression levels of CTLA4, perhaps due to the low number of analyzed cells (15–25×103 cell at the time point
of measurement) and due to the fact that the panel cannot discern Treg cells from
conventional CD4+ T cells. The majority of CTLA-4 is expressed on Treg cells,
however, Treg cells only constitute approximately 5% of all CD4+ T cells. If the
physiological difference between the genotypes is restricted to Treg cells, e.g. as a
difference in CTLA-4 storage levels or surface expression levels, then we would most
likely be unable to detect the difference when studying the whole population of CD4+
T cells.
The frequency of different Treg-cell phenotypes was also investigated; however, no
significant differences could be observed in our pilot material of eleven matched pairs.
Still, when examining the frequency of total Treg cells, a trend could be observed
amongst eight of the eleven pairs (Figure 10), wherein the GG-genotype had an
approximately 1–2 percentile unit higher frequency of Treg cells. However, the
statistical pairwise comparison was insignificant since three pairs demonstrated
inverse trends. Moreover, the abovementioned trend was lost when stratifying the
population into naïve and memory T-cell subsets. A prominent artefact was observed
when accounting for the subjects’ age as a covariate in linear regression (data not
shown). The rs231775-GG genotypes who were ≤ 2 years of age (8/11) exhibited a
higher frequency of Treg cells when compared to those ≥ 3 years of age (3/11) (Figure
10). Notably, an inverse trend could be observed amongst the rs231775-AA genotypes,
59

thus, revealing an artefact in the Treg-cell frequency. The trend where the frequency
of Treg cells decreases with age amongst rs231775-GG genotypes could be a false
signal stemming from the small sample size. Nevertheless, without further study, we
cannot corroborate whether this observation is a true physiological phenomenon or an
inadvertent effect stemming from population heterogeneity.
The analysis of the myeloid and innate lymphoid panel, B-cell panel and CD4+/CD8+
chemokine panel did not reveal any evident differences when comparing the
genotypes. However, the results have to be interpreted with caution since only 4–6
pairs were studied. These panels need to be studied further with more material to
exclude the possibility of a rs231775-inflicted downstream modification on other cell
subtypes. It remains a possibility that if the rs231775 SNP also modifies the
functionality of the Treg-cell population, there could be downstream alterations to the
prevalence of other effector T-cell subsets. For example, an alteration in the frequency
of inflammatory Th cells which are downregulated by immunomodulatory Treg cells.
However, the SNP-mediated downstream alterations to a broad range of immune cells
could be more prominent during a certain phase in the disease development, for
example, during the early development of IA or when IA starts to progress towards an
increased severity. Alterations in the Treg cell compartment have been associated with
these phases; hence, when a SNP’s causal effect is determined in non-diabetic
individuals, it would be justified to study the SNP-mediated effects in AAb-positive
individuals and in T1D cases.
The interindividual variance found in the major immune cell populations’ frequencies
displayed an inherent disadvantage in this small pilot study’s design. The inclusion of
multiple age groups (defined as age at sample retrieval) produced a scenario in which
each age group showed a variance that was dependent on the subjects’ past
immunological involvement. Hence, the deviation from the whole-cohort’s gross mean
was more profound in the younger subjects, perhaps since the experience of infections
can cause a significant change in the cell populations which expand as a direct
consequence of immunological engagement, for example, in the ratio of naïve-tomemory cells. Consequently, when analyzing the cell frequencies of the pairs aged 6
months to 2 years, we were unable to see any of the expected linear trends, such as a
progressive increase in the proportion of memory CD4+ cells. Moreover, our
60

calculations of cell frequencies are biased towards that seen in younger children since
8/11 pairs where ≤ 2 years old. Moreover, the small sample size made further analysis
using age as a covariate unreasonable. Notably, the reported geometric means of the
cell populations should be interpreted with caution since they do not necessarily
represent the actual biological mean of respective rs231775 genotype. As previously
discussed, it would be more proper to calculate a genotypic mean difference for a
specific age group since the frequency of multiple cell subsets covariate with age.
A larger sample size would allow for a more accurate study of trends and effects in
different age groups and for the detection and proper evaluation of outliers. However,
since the pilot study aimed to quantify the expression of CTLA-4 , a wider range of
age groups was formed to verify the existence of a rs231775-SNP effect; an effect
which is expected to be independent of the age. Further studies on cell frequencies,
especially amongst effector cell subsets, should focus on one age group in order to
limit the influence of age-dependent in-group variation. To conclude, the future study
of the rs231775 SNP’s effects on Treg-cell parameters should include the
quantification of intracellular storage levels and surface expression levels. This could
be applied to both resting and activated T cells, including Treg cells. Lastly, the SNP’s
possible impact on Treg-cell functionality should preferably be studied with in vitro
suppression and proliferation assays.
As one of the canonical competitive inhibitors of T-cell activation, alterations to the
function and availability of CTLA-4 could entail major modifications to the CD28–
CD80/86 activatory axis. Even when the mechanism of CTLA-4 inhibition has been
determined, there are still functional aspects which require further investigation, such
as the biological function of soluble CTLA-4. The rs231775 SNP has been observed
to alter the prevalence of soluble CTLA-4 in serum, although, the physiological impact
of this alteration is unknown (Esposito et al., 2014; Pruul et al., 2015; Rydén et al.,
2012). Changes to the CD28–CD80/86 activatory axis also affect the prospects of
immunomodulatory therapy, e.g. cancer immunotherapy, since perturbations of the
pathway evidently modify the T cells’ immunological kinetics and, therefore, the
clinical outcome (Zhao et al., 2018). For example, CTLA-4 polymorphisms have been
associated with long-term survival when treating melanoma (Xuan Mo et al., 2018;
Queirolo et al., 2017). Furthermore, through still undetermined effects, the rs231775
61

SNP has been shown to modify susceptibility for graft rejection after stem cell
transplantation; an effect that most likely stem from the SNP’s alterations to Treg-cell
function (Hammrich et al., 2019). Lastly, from a pharmacogenetic perspective, the
rs231775 polymorphism has also been shown to modify the prognosis of treating RA
with Abatacept, a fusion protein carrying the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 which
functions as a selective costimulation modulator (Pete et al., 2020).
It is now commonly agreed upon that T1D associated SNPs exert various modifying
effects on the immunophenotype; effects which not necessarily facilitate disease by
themselves but are able to modify disease susceptibility and contribute to disease
heterogeneity. Lastly, from a prospective standpoint, the broad-spectrum immunophenotyping of genotyped individuals is expected to become a more commonly
adopted research approach in functional immunogenetics. This, in turn, will hopefully
create a better understanding of how various SNPs increase disease susceptibility and
contribute to disease heterogeneity.

7. Conclusions
•

The genotyping for ten T1D associated polymorphisms produced a cohort of
678 completely genotyped subjects. Consequently, this enables the efficient
execution of future functional immunophenotyping studies within the DIPP
study community.

•

When comparing CTLA-4 rs231775 (A>G) GG and AA genotypes, the riskassociated G-allele did not appear to modify CTLA-4 surface expression on
CD4+ Th cells and CD8+ Tc cells after PMA/Ionomycin stimulation.

•

When staining for CTLA-4 intracellularly in non-stimulated cells, the
rs231775-G allele was associated with a lower intracellular CTLA-4
expression in CD3+CD4+CD25+ CD127LowFOXP3+ Treg cells.

•

Our results maintain the assertion that the rs231775 SNP modifies the
biological availability of CTLA-4 in Treg cells. This, in turn, warrants further
functional studies of this SNP to investigate whether it affects the biological
surface availability of CTLA-4 in activated Treg cells and the ability of these
to suppress the immune system.

Autoimmunitets-associerade polymorfismer och deras effekt på immunofenotypen:
Genprofilering och immunofenotypprofilering inom den finländska Diabetes
Prediction and Prevention Study.
Avhandlingsprojektets målsättning är att producera en kohort på 700 barn värvade till
den finländska prospektiva studien The Diabetes Prediction and Prevention Study
(eng. förkortning, DIPP). Den skapade datasamlingen är ämnad inom DIPPforskningsverksamheten att användas vid kartläggningen av diverse polymorfismers
påverkan på immunofenotypen, och därmed möjliggöra kvantifieringen av de
sjukdomsassocierade polymorfismernas funktionella effekter i immunceller. Den
preliminära

datasamlingen

bildas

genom

att

genprofilera

icke-diabetiska,

autoantikroppsnegativa, T1D-predisponerade barn för tio olika enbaspolymorfismer.
Samtliga individer genprofileras med hjälp av kvantitativ TaqMan-PCR för
polymorfismerna rs2476601 (PTPN22), rs231775 (CTLA-4), rs1990760 (IFIH1),
rs3184504 (SH2B3), rs601338 (FUT2), rs763361 (CD226), rs72928038 (BACH2),
rs11203203 (UBASH3A), rs61839660 (IL2RA) och rs45450798 (PTPN2).
Respektive polymorfism har en antydd verkan på proteinets funktion eller en
modifierande effekt på proteinets uttryck (Tabell 1).
Avhandlingsprojektet inkluderar även en mindre immunofenotypprofilering av tolv
fenotypparade individer för att kvantifiera CTLA-4 rs231775-polymorfismens
(+A49G) inverkan på CTLA-4 proteinets uttryck bland konventionella T-celler och
regulatoriska T-celler (Treg). CTLA-4 är en central inhibitor till aktiveringen av
konventionella T-celler då CTLA-4 konkurrerar i cis mot den T-cell-expresserade
aktivatorn CD28 för att binda till CD80/86 uttryckt på antigenpresenterande celler.
CTLA-4 utövar sin verkan genom att minska förekomsten av CD28–CD80/CD86interaktioner vilket resulterar i en nedreglerad T-cellaktivering. Rs231775
polymorfismen har observerats medföra en ökad risk för T1D-utveckling och denna
riskeffekt har förknippats med en lägre CTLA-4-uttryck bland konventionella CD4+celler samt Treg-celler (Y. Chen et al., 2018; Jonson et al., 2006; Mäurer et al., 2002).
Polymorfismen har även tidvis förknippats med en modifiering av ovannämnda
cellpopulationers frekvens, antigen vid ett friskt tillstånd eller hos individer med
fulminant T1D.
64

I avhandlingens experimentella del studeras CTLA-4-polymorfismens inverkan på
intracellulär CTLA-4-lagring bland CD4+CD25+CD127lowFOXP3+ Treg-celler.
Därefter studeras polymorfismens effekt på proteinets ytuttryck bland konventionella
CD3+ T-celler efter 1, 4 och 24 timmars stimulering med PMA/jonomycin. Då
rs231775-polymorfismen har uppvisats modifiera ytuttrycket av CTLA-4 hos Tregceller, vilket kan medföra en nedsatt immunregulatorisk funktionalitet, kommer även
andra cellpopulationer studeras för att upptäcka möjliga förändringar på fenotypnivån.
Till detta används tre separata flödescytometriska paneler för att studera
konventionella T-celler, B-celler, myeloida celler och icke-variabla T-celler.
Avhandlingens kohort bildades från 694 DIPP-klienter födda mellan 2005 och 2017,
individer

som

är

genetiskt

predisponerade

för

T1D

enligt

DIPP-

inkluderingskriterierna. Kohorten ämnad för kvantifiering av CTLA-4-proteinets
uttryck och allmän immunofenotyp-profilering formades av tolv fenotypparade
individer vilka var parade enligt kön, födelseort, födelsedatum (± 5 månader) och
provtagningsdatum (± 6 månader). Respektive individ av varje par var antigen
homozygot för den riskassocierade rs231775-G-allelen eller vildtypsallelen rs231775A. De valda individerna har gett blodprover vid endera åldern av 6 månader, 9
månader, 1 år, 2 år, 3 år eller 4 år, vilket gav upphov till två fenotypparade par för
respektive åldersklass.
TaqMan-profileringen resulterade i en komplett polymorfismprofil hos 678 individer,
vilket ger en total profileringsrat på 99,8 %. Utav 694 individer var 38,5 % (267/694)
homozygot för en polymorfism (Tabell 2). Kvantifieringen av den extracellulära
CTLA-4-uttrycket i nio par producerade inga resultat som skulle antyda på en
modifiering av frekvensen CTLA-4-positiva konventionella CD3+-T-celler (Figur 8).
Frånvaron av polymorfismens förmodade effekt observerades även då man studerade
CD4+-hjälpar-T-celler och CD8+-cytotoxiska T-celler separat. Detta inkluderar
respektive populations naiva och minnes T-celler (Figur 9).
När elva fenotyppar studerades med en Treg-cellpanel upptäcktes ingen modifiering
av frekvensen CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127LowFOXP3+-Treg-celler (Figur 10). Man fann
däremot en signifikant skillnad då man studerade den totala uppsättningen av CTLA4-positiva Treg-celler (p = 0,0091; t(10) = 3,223; geometriskt medeltal: GG = 29,15
65

%, AA = 35,75 %), naiva Treg-celler (p = 0,0136; t(10) = 2,998; geometriskt medeltal:
GG = 16,39 %, AA = 23,32 %), och som ett gränsfall, minnes Treg-celler (p = 0,0631;
t(10) = 2,090; geometriskt medeltal: GG = 72,29 %, AA = 77,68 %) (Figur 11). När
CD25+CD127low-celler exkluderas från CD4+ populationen bildas en icke-Tregpopulation. Denna population uppvisade även en signifikant skillnad mellan
genotyperna då man studerande den CTLA-4-positiva minnes-populationen (p =
0,0386; t(10) = 2,380; geometriskt medeltal: GG = 10,27 %, AA = 13,12 %), och med
en svag skillnad i den naiva populationen (p = 0,0702; t(10) = 2,027; geometriskt
medeltal: GG = 0,333 %, AA = 0,469 %) (Figur 13).
Avhandlingsprojektets första delmålsättning var att producera en datasamling som kan
användas

i

utforskningen

av

polymorfismers

funktionella

effekter

på

immunofenotypen. Projektet producerade en kohort på 694 individer där alla har ett
relativt högt antal lagrade prover (85 % av alla individer har fler än två lagrade prover).
Detta möjliggör en effektiverad fortsatt forskning inom immunofenotypprofileringen
av

DIPP-deltagare.

Stimuleringen

av

konventionella

CD3+-T-celler

med

PMA/jonomycin, med påföljande analys av CTLA-4-proteinets ytuttryck, gav inte
några resultat som skulle understöda att G-allelen medför ett lägre ytuttryck av CTLA4 vid stimulering. Detta står i konflikt med den enda tidigare motsvarande studien av
Mäurer et al. (2002) som studerade CTLA-4-proteinets ytuttryck i CD3+-T-celler efter
48 timmar av cellstimulering med allogena vuxna dendritiska celler (genotyper; GG =
4, AA = 4). Vi lyckades däremot replikera resultat från en tidigare studie som
undersökte det relativa uttrycket av CTLA-4 bland olika konventionella T-celler efter
PMA/jonomycin-stimulering (Jago et al., 2004). Det står nu i vårt intresse att replikera
våra resultat med hjälp av en alternativ stimuleringsmetod, såsom stimulering med
CD3/CD28-antikroppar eller med allogena vuxna dendritiska celler.
Det att vi inte fann någon signifikant inverkan av rs231775-polymorfismen på
fraktionen av minnes-Treg-celler beror antagligen på populationens höga grad av
lagrat CTLA-4. Det vill säga att näst intill alla minnes-Treg-celler uttrycker CTLA-4,
kanske även till en biologisk maxnivå. Kvantifieringen av CTLA-4-ytuttrycket efter
stimulering resulterade inte i några signifikanta resultat. Detta kan bero på att vi
studerade för få celler (15–25×103 celler vid mätning) eller på grund av det faktum att
endast 5 % av alla CD4+-celler är Treg-celler. Om den biologiska effekten av
66

rs231775-polymorfismen är begränsad till Treg-celler, och när deras frekvens är ~5 %
av den totala CD4+-populationen, är det sannolikt att man inte kan detektera
polymorfismens effekt i ytuttrycket av CTLA-4 om man endast studerar CD4+fraktionen. Därtill kunde den använda panelen inte frånskilja Treg-celler från
konventionella CD4+-celler.
Vid framtida studier av rs231775-polymorfismens inverkan på Treg-cellers
populationsparametrar borde den intracellulära och extracellulära uttrycket av CTLA4 mätas. Detta kan utföras med stimulerade och icke-stimulerade konventionella Tceller, inklusive Treg-celler. Polymorfismens eventuella effekter på Treg-cellers
funktionsduglighet kan testas med analyser som mäter cellernas frekvens,
proliferationsförmåga och förmåga att dämpa konventionella T-cellers aktivering. Det
är en allmän konsensus inom den immunologiska genetiken att polymorfismer har
egenskapen att modifiera en immunofenotyp genom deras inbördes effekter på
immuncellers

funktionalitet.

Metoden

att

immunofenotypprofilera

flera

immuncellspopulationer förväntas bidra till en stor ansamling originaldata, data som
den kliniska medicinen kan utnyttja för att skapa en bättre överblick över
autoimmunitetens immunologiska engagemang.

Appendix IV

Figure 1. The Treg-cell panel, step 1. The displayed panel depicts an adult control sample. Section a)
shows the preliminary steps of lymphocyte gating and the CD8+ gating control for CD25+CD127low
cells. Sections b) and c) gate the total CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations for CTLA-4. FMOs where
used when gating CTLA-4 BB700.

91

Figure 2. The Treg-cell panel, step 2. The displayed panel depicts an adult control sample. Section a)
presents the preliminary steps of lymphocyte gating for CD25+CD127lowFOXP3+ Treg cells from CD4+
cells. The CD4+ population excluding the CD25+CD127low cells were termed CD4+ non-Treg cells.
Section c) gates the total CD25+CD127lowFOXP3+ Treg-cell population into fractions according to the
expression of phenotypical markers. FMOs where used when gating HLA-DR PE-Cy5, TIGIT PEDazzle, CD39 BV711 and CTLA-4 BB700.

92

Figure 3. The Treg-cell panel, step 3. The displayed panel depicts an adult control sample. Section a)
presents the gating for phenotypical markers in CD45RA─ memory Treg cells. Section b) presents the
gating for phenotypical markers in CD45RA + naive Treg cells. FMOs where used when gating HLADR PE-Cy5, TIGIT PE-Dazzle, CD39 BV711 and CTLA-4 BB700.

93

Appendix V

Figure 1. Myeloid and innate lymphoid panel. The displayed panel depicts an adult control sample.
Section a) presents the gated NK cells. In section b), unconventional gamma-delta T cells and alphabeta MAIT cells where gated from CD3+ T cells. The bottom-left figures, innate natural-killer T
lymphocytes (iNKT) and CD8+/−CD27+/− cells, where gated from alpha-beta T cells. Section c) displays
monocytes and DCs as gated from the CD3−CD19−HLA-DR+CD56− population. The monocytes are
divided into CD14+CD16+ intermediate monocytes, CD14+CD16− classical monocytes and
CD14−CD16+ non-classical monocytes. Conventional DCs (cDC) are defined as CD11c+ DC cells and
CD11c+CD14−CD16− cells. Plasmacytoid DCs (pDC) are defined as CD124+CD11− cells.

94

Appendix VI

Figure 1. B-cell panel. The displayed panel depicts an adult control sample. Section a) presents the
preliminary gating of CD19+ cells and plasmablasts. In section b), CD19+ B cells are gated according
to their state of development and BCR class. Section c) displays the anergic B cells as gated from
CD27−CD21−CD19+ B cells. FMOs where used when gating CXCR3 BV421, IL-21R APC, CD5 PECy7 and CD38 BB700.

Appendix VII

Figure 1. CD4+/CD8+ chemokine panel, step 1. The displayed panel depicts an adult control sample.
Sections b) and c) gate CD4+ and CD8+ cells into naïve, central memory (CM), effector memory (EM),
and terminally differentiated effector memory T cells (TEMRA), for CD4+ and CD8+ cells respectively.

96

Respective T cell populations in sections b) and c) are further gated for CD27 (displayed as a histogram).
FMOs where used when gating CCR10 APC, CXCR3 BV421, CCR4 BB770, CCR6 BV711, PD-1 PE
and CD161 PE-Cy5.

Figure 2. CD4+/CD8+ chemokine panel, step 2. The displayed panel depicts an adult control sample.
The memory CD4+ cells are first gated for peripheral Th cells (Tph) and follicular Th cells (Tfh). The
Memory CD4+ cells are further gated according to CCR3 and CCR6 expression, producing Th1, Th2,
Th17, Th1/Th17 and Th22 cell subsets. Th1/Th17 and Th17 cells are further gated for CD161. FMOs
where used when gating CCR10 APC, CXCR3 BV421, CCR4 BB770, CCR6 BV711, PD-1 PE and
CD161 PE-Cy5.
