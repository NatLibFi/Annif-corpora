Abstract
The design of heat exchangers for specific applications entails a number of different
calculations in order to determine the appropriate dimensions and characteristics for the
heat exchanger unit. The relevant equations can be convoluted and often need to be solved
in an iterative fashion. Not only is this time-consuming work, but it can also be prone to
human errors if performed by hand. A large number of equations for plate heat exchangers
have been proposed in the scientific literature, all with different constraints, from which
it can be concluded that no commonly accepted method of calculating heat transfer in
plate heat exchangers exists.
The purpose of this work is to develop a software application to assist Loval Oy
with the dimensioning aspect of designing specifically brazed plate heat exchangers. It
will accomplish this by providing a graphical user interface where the user can input
information regarding the fluid streams for a specific application, and in return receive an
estimate of the heat exchanger unit dimensions necessary. Additionally, experimental
data regarding the heat transfer effectiveness will be collected for a number of heat
exchanger designs. The data will be used to construct equations that work specifically for
the heat exchangers in question in order to ensure that the software application can
produce reliable results.

1 Introduction
1.1 Introduction to heat exchangers
Heat exchangers play a central role in many modern technical industries and can be found
in a wide variety of applications. In its simplest form, a heat exchanger transfers thermal
energy from one set of fluids to another. In a majority of cases, these fluids are separated
from one another by a solid wall to prevent mixing, and heat is allowed to be transferred
through the surface wall by conduction (Sekulić and Shah, 2003, pp. 1–3). The operating
principle is illustrated in Figure 1.1, where heat Q̇ is transferred from mass flow ṁb with
enthalpy hb1 to mass flow ṁa with enthalpy ha1 in a co-current configuration.

Figure 1.1. Operating principle of a heat exchanger, where hb1 > ha1.
A wide variety of heat exchanger models and designs exist in the industry today,
including shell and tube designs, double pipe heat exchangers, and plate heat exchangers.
Plate heat exchangers, as the name suggests, consist of several thin, usually rectangular
metal plates pressed together in close proximity. The gaps between individual plates
allow for two fluids to flow through on alternating sides of the plate and exchange heat,
as illustrated in Figure 1.2 (Wang et al., 2007, p. 12). Loval mainly produces brazed plate
heat exchangers, where the plates are brazed together using copper, in order to create a
self-contained unit. These exchangers can handle higher pressures and temperatures
compared to a gasket plate heat exchanger, where the plates are separated by a rubber
gasket. They are however limited in size, usually shorter than one meter, due to brazing
furnace constraints (Wang et al., 2007, pp. 17–18).

configuration (Alfa-Laval, n.d.).

1.2 Calculation software
A significant portion of time is spent dimensioning and designing heat exchangers for
customers. It is, therefore, in Loval’s interest to develop a software tool that automates
this process as much as possible. Given input values from the customer regarding the
mass flows of the fluids and the inlet and outlet temperatures, this program ought to be
able to calculate the necessary parameters to design a suitable heat exchanger.
A common type of heat exchanger sold at Loval is a brazed plate heat exchanger
dimensioned for water-water use. Other fluids may include different oils and coolants. In
order to be a useful application for Loval, this software must, at minimum, be able to take
in data such as temperature and volume flow about two separate streams of water. Using
predefined parameters from the most common heat exchangers at Loval, it should be able
to calculate the inlet and outlet temperatures of the two streams, their respective volume
2

flows, the total heat flux, and the number of plates needed for a specific exchanger design,
that is to say the total plate area. Once this basic framework has been built, additional
features can be added, such as the ability to switch in different heat exchanger units with
different design parameters, the ability to use different fluid combinations, such as wateroil or water-glycol, and the option to use different flow configurations.
If the previously mentioned features can be implemented, another thing to
consider is the ability for users to add new heat exchanger designs and new fluids with
different parameters. It is also of interest to develop a tool to produce printable reports
containing central information regarding a calculation that can be used when producing a
quotation for a customer. Once the back end of the software is functional, a graphical user
interface will be designed in order to make the program more accessible. The possibility
for a web-based user interface for potential customers will also be investigated.

1.3 Data collection
The output data from the calculation tool must be verifiable in order to be useful.
Relatively simple equations exist in order to calculate the theoretical values for a heat
exchanger with specified fluid flows and design parameters. One difficult aspect is
estimating the internal fluid flow patterns, which are vital in order to calculate the overall
heat transfer coefficient U. Small errors in the fluid flow characteristics can lead to large
errors in the area estimate for the heat exchanger, especially in situations where the mean
temperature differences between the hot and the cold flows are minute. Estimates with
temperature differences of just a few degrees are typically more prone to errors.
Once a reasonable model has been built, a correction factor can be introduced in
order to adjust the heat transfer area estimate. A set of experiments will be conducted on
site at Loval in Loviisa where different heat exchanger designs will be tested with a
variety of fluid flows in order to gather data about their performance. There are a number
of different techniques used to fit a theoretical model to experimental data, one of them
being the Wilson plot method (Fernández-Seara et al., 2007, p. 2745). The feasibility of
utilizing the aforementioned method among others will be investigated.
The experimental setup illustrated in Figure 1.3 consist of two pumps feeding
water from a hot buffer and a cold buffer tank into the heat exchanger one wishes to test.

The hot buffer tank is heated by an electric resistor, and the cold buffer tank is cooled
through a separate loop. Pressure and temperature sensors on both sides of the heat
exchanger allow for accurate readings, and flow sensors display the volumetric flow rate.

2 Theory
As heat is transferred from one medium flow to another, the rate of heat flow Q̇ is
determined by the following energy balance:
𝑄̇ = 𝑚̇ 𝑐𝑝 𝛥𝑇

(1)
(Sekulić and Shah, 2003, p. 83)

Here ṁ is the mass flow, cp is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature
difference between the outgoing and ingoing stream. The values of either the hot or the
cold side can be used, as the heat losses to the surrounding is miniscule for well-insulated
units.
The total thermal energy passing through the surface wall between the two fluids,
or the heat transfer rate, is determined by
𝑄̇ = 𝑈 𝐴 𝛥𝑇𝑚

(2)
(Sekulić and Shah, 2003, p. 83)

In this case U is the overall heat transfer coefficient, A is the heat transfer surface area,
and ΔTm is the logarithmic mean temperature difference. ΔTm is a function of the inlet and
outlet temperatures of both the hot and the cold streams, and is determined in the
following way:
𝛥𝑇𝑚 =

𝛥𝑇𝐴 − 𝛥𝑇𝐵
𝛥𝑇
𝑙𝑛 ( 𝛥𝑇𝐴 )
𝐵

(3)

In this case ΔTA and ΔTB are the temperature differences at the ends of the exchanger, as
seen in Figure 2.1.
When dimensioning a plate heat exchanger, the end goal is to solve for A in
equation (2). Individual plates have a given area per plate, so once A is known, the total
number of plates can be determined. This leaves U as the only parameter that must be
determined before the problem can be solved. U is a function of the heat transfer
characteristics of the two media with the plate, and the characteristics of the plate material
in-between.

2.1 Flow configurations
Many plate heat exchangers can be run in either a co-current or a countercurrent
configuration. Depending on the fluids in question, one mode may be preferable to the
other, but for the most part a countercurrent configuration is used for reasons that will be
discussed in coming chapters.
2.1.1 Co-current flow
In a co-current arrangement, the fluids enter and exit at the same ends and travel in the
same direction through the heat exchanger as seen in Figure 2.1. This configuration has
the lowest thermal efficiency of the mentioned configurations due to large deviations
from the ideal constant temperature difference ΔT, and is incapable of heating the cold
fluid above the outlet temperature of the hot fluid. The high temperature difference at the
inlet also induces thermal stress across the exchanger wall, which might result in a
reduced lifespan (Sekulić and Shah, 2003, pp. 58–59).
One possible advantage of a co-current configuration is that it results a more
uniform temperature distribution across the heat exchanger when compared to other
arrangements. When dealing with temperature sensitive materials, this aspect might be of
importance when one considers extremely hot inlet flows in excess of about 1000 °C, as
the combined temperature at the inlet will be lower when compared with a countercurrent
arrangement (Sekulić and Shah, 2003, pp. 59–60).
2.1.2 Countercurrent flow
In a countercurrent arrangement, the fluids travel through the heat exchanger in opposite
directions to one another as seen in Figure 2.1. This arrangement is the most efficient
configuration due to a more uniform temperature difference, resulting in the highest
transfer of thermal energy between the streams. Another benefit to the uniform
temperature difference is the reduced thermal stress across the surface wall compared to
other flow arrangements (Sekulić and Shah, 2003, p. 57).

2.1.3 Cross flow
Heat exchangers can also be designed as cross flow exchangers. In this design, the hot
and the cold side flow at a 90-degree angle to one another. Thermodynamically, this
design is more efficient than a cocurrent configuration, but not quite as effective as a
countercurrent design (Sekulić and Shah, 2003, p. 60).
Cross flow designs can usually be found in extended surface exchangers, or 2phase heat exchangers, such as car radiators, where air flows perpendicular to the liquid
coolant.

2.2 Exchanger parameters
In order to accurately calculate the Reynold number, Nusselt number, fluid velocity, and
other variables, one needs to have detailed information regarding the properties and
dimensions of the heat exchanger in question. The accuracy of these parameters is of
paramount importance, as small deviations can lead to noticeable differences in flow and
heat transfer characteristics, leading to unreliable outputs. The Reynold and Nusselt
numbers are dimensionless numbers properly introduced in chapter 2.4. Figure 2.2
illustrates the most important dimensions of a chevron plate heat exchanger.

7

______________________________________________________________________

Figure 2.2. Chevron plate heat exchanger dimensions
2.2.1 Heat transfer area per plate
Most plates have complex engravings in order to manipulate flow patterns and increase
the heat transfer area, and for this reason a more sophisticated way of estimating the
transfer area is needed than just multiplying the plate width with the fluid flow distance.
For the chevron pattern, one can estimate the ratio between the effective heat transfer area
and an equivalent plain plate using the following equation:
2𝑎𝜋 2
(
)
1
2𝑎𝜋 2
√
) +4 1+ Ʌ
𝛷≈
1 + √1 + (
6
Ʌ
2
(

(4)
)

Thus, the effective heat transfer area can be estimated using the plate width, effective
plate length and wave height (Martin, 1996, p. 302).
𝐴 = 𝛷(𝑊𝐿𝐻 + 2𝑎𝐿𝐻 )

(5)

8

Kim Högnabba

2.2.2 Hydraulic diameter
The hydraulic diameter DH of the channels between two plates is an important parameter
when estimating the overall heat transfer coefficient, and is defined according to
𝐷𝐻 =

4𝐴𝑐
𝑃𝑝

(6)

where Pp is the wetter perimeter of the cross-sectional area Ac. DH is easily determined in
cases where the channel is cylindric or square, as Ac and Pp are well defined in those cases.
When a chevron plate design is used, approximations have to be made. Using the
previously defined surface correction factor, the hydraulic diameter can be determined.
𝐷𝐻 =

4𝑎
𝛷

(7)
(Sekulić and Shah, 2003, p. 597)

2.2.3 Additional parameters
In addition to the aforementioned parameters, an accurate list of other measurements that
can only be found in detailed drawings are also needed in order to build a reliable model.
The plate material determines the thermal conductivity, and is usually a stainless steel
such as EN 1.4301 or EN 1.4404. Specifics about the chevron corrugation including the
chevron angle β help determine the flow pattern, as does the size of the fittings.

2.3 Fluid parameters
The most common fluid used in heat exchangers is liquid water. Other fluids that Loval
deals with are different hydraulic oils, antifreezes such as propylene glycol and ethanol,
and steam in two-phase exchangers. The hydraulic oils that are of interest to Loval are
primarily VG-32, VG-46, and VG-68. These fluids have some properties that can be
copied from a datasheet at a given condition, but others vary drastically depending on the
temperature and pressure. These variations can lead to vastly different outputs if neglected,
so it is important to use values at the correct temperature and pressure.

9

Kim Högnabba
Master’s thesis
______________________________________________________________________
2.3.1 Viscosity
The dynamic viscosity μ is important when dimensioning many different aspects of the
heat exchanger, and for most fluids it varies with temperature. It is a measure of the
internal resistance to deformation during flow, and it comes into play when calculation
the Reynold number for example. Higher viscosities lead to less turbulent flows, meaning
worse heat transfer. Depending on the context, viscosity can refer to dynamic viscosity μ,
or kinematic viscosity v. Care should be taken not to mix up these two separate
measurements. The dynamic viscosity can be calculated by multiplying the kinematic
viscosity with the density.
The following equation can be used for determining the dynamic viscosity of
liquid water as a function of temperature.
247.8𝐾

𝜇(𝑇) = 2.414 ⋅ 10−5 𝑃𝑎𝑠 ⋅ 10(𝑇−140𝐾)

(8)

Here T is the temperature in Kelvin. When estimating the mean dynamic viscosity for a
fluid in a heat exchanger, one cannot use the viscosity at the mean temperature, as μ
usually does not vary linearly with respect to temperature. Instead, a more accurate value
for water can be obtained by integrating equation (8) and setting the limits as the inlet and
outlet temperature, and dividing the result by the temperature difference. The dynamic
viscosity for water varies between 0.00175 Pa⋅s and 0.000279 Pa⋅s at T = 0° C and T =
100° C.
Figure 2.3 illustrates how the viscosity of different hydraulic oils vary with respect
to temperature. Separate equations describing the relationship can be constructing by
curve fitting a polynomial function to individual datapoints for each fluid in Figure 2.3.
Compared to water, the viscosity of hydraulic oils vary even more drastically with
temperature, and can almost change by almost two orders of magnitude between T = 0°
C and T = 100° C (Shell-Oil-Company, 2010).

The colored lines represent the hydraulic oils VG-22, VG-32, VG-46, VG-68, and VG100.
2.3.2 Thermal conductivity
Another property that varies with temperature is the thermal conductivity k. For liquid
water, Kays et al. provide the following estimate.
𝑘(𝑇) = −8.354 ⋅ 10−6 𝑇 2 + 6.53 ⋅ 10−3 𝑇 − 0.5981

(9)

(Kays et al., 2005)

11

Kim Högnabba
Master’s thesis
______________________________________________________________________
Here T is the temperature in Kelvin. Between T = 0° C and T = 100° C, the conductivity
varies from 0.563 W/mK to 0.675 W/mK. This difference can be significant enough to
cause noticeable variations in the overall heat transfer coefficient U if omitted.
2.3.3 Density
Density is also dependent on the fluid temperature, although it does not vary as drastically
as thermal conductivity or especially viscosity for most liquids. Using tabulated values
for the density of water at different temperatures (United-States-Geological-Survey, n.d.),
the following polynomial function was constructed using regression analysis.
𝜌(𝑇) = 1.031 ⋅ 10−12 𝑇 5 − 3.4942 × 10−10 𝑇 4 + 5,708 ⋅ 10−8 𝑇 3 −
7,950 ⋅ 10−6 𝑇 2 + 5,837 ⋅ 10−5 𝑇 + 0.9999

(10)

Here T is the temperature is Celsius.
2.3.4 Heat capacity
Temperature has a minimal effect on the heat capacity for most fluids in the relevant
temperature ranges. cp varies from 4.17 kJ/kgK to 4.21 kJ/kgK for liquid water. This small
change of less than 1% can be neglected when performing calculations.

2.4 Overall heat transfer coefficient
The overall heat transfer coefficient in a heat exchanger is dependent upon the
characteristics of the plate material, the convective heat transfer coefficient of both the
cold and the warm fluid, and any fouling between the plate and the fluids. This coefficient
is defined accordingly:
−1
1 𝛿𝑃
1
𝑈=( +
+ + 𝑅𝑓,ℎ + 𝑅𝑓,𝑐 )
𝛼ℎ 𝑘𝑃 𝛼𝑐

(11)
(Wang et al., 2007, p. 56)

Here αh and αc are the convective heat transfer coefficients for the hot and cold fluids, δP
is the thickness of the plate, kP is the thermal conductivity of the plate, and Rf,h as well as
Rf,c are the fouling resistances on both sides of the plate. Unless otherwise specified, these
12

Kim Högnabba
Master’s thesis
______________________________________________________________________
fouling resistances are assumed to be zero. Both δP and kP are usually well defined, so
only the fluids convective heat transfer coefficients needs to be determined.
By utilizing the definition of the Nusselt number, α can be described in the
following way:
𝛼𝑖 =

𝑘𝑖 Nu
𝐷𝐻

(12)

Here ki is the thermal conductivity of the flowing fluid in question. Nu can be difficult to
determine due to the complex geometries present inside a chevron plate heat exchanger.
A commonly used estimate today is an updated version of an estimate obtained by Martin
(1996) specifically for chevron plate heat exchangers in 1996.

Nu =

1
1 𝜇𝑚 6
0.374
0.205Pr 3 ( ) (𝑓Re2 𝑠𝑖𝑛(2𝛽))
𝜇𝑤

(13)

(Sekulić and Shah, 2003, p. 515)
Here Pr is the Prandtl number, Re is the Reynold number, β is the chevron corrugation
angle, and f is the Fanning friction factor. The friction factor also comes into play when
determining the pressure drops inside the heat exchanger. μm and μw denote the fluids
dynamic viscosity at the medium’s temperature and at the wall temperature, respectively.
Other more recent estimates for the Nusselt number are presented in chapter 2.5.
Pr is wholly dependent on the fluid itself and is easily determined. It is defined as
the ratio between the momentum diffusivity and the thermal diffusivity.
Pr =

𝑐𝑝 𝜇
𝑘

(14)

In order to get accurate estimates for U in different fluid configurations, one must consider
how the viscosity and thermal conductivity of the fluids vary at different temperatures.
The Prandtl number can be anywhere from 1.5 to 12 for liquid water at atmospheric
pressure.
Re describes the flow patterns for a fluid in different geometries and at different
velocities, and is dependent on both the pipe characteristics and fluid parameters, as well
as the tube cross-sectional average velocity u.
13

Kim Högnabba
Master’s thesis
______________________________________________________________________
Re =

𝜌𝑢𝐷𝐻
𝜇

(15)

At low Re values internal viscous forces dominate, resulting in laminar flow, while at
high Re values inertial forces dominate, leading to turbulent flow. Turbulent flow is often
intentionally introduced with the help of irregularities on the surface of the heat transfer
plate, as this improves the thermal efficiency of the heat exchanger. This also results in
larger pressure drops inside the exchanger, but this tradeoff is usually worthwhile
depending on the intended application.

2.5 Nusselt number
No common estimation for the Nusselt number for plate heat exchangers exists in the
available literature (Zahid, 2003, p. 8). Instead, a commonly used method to estimate the
heat transfer is to utilize the Wilson plot technique (Opatřil et al., 2016, p. 369) (Asif et
al., 2017, p. 208). Here, experimentally obtained data are used to estimate parameter
values for the following generalized version of the Sieder-Tate correlation (Sieder and
Tate, 1936, pp. 1429–1435):
𝜇 0.14
Nu = 𝐶Re𝑚 Pr 𝑛 ( )
𝜇𝑤

(16)

Here C, m, and n are the parameters in question. This method is, however, limited by the
experimental data available, and the predicted solution tends to show large discrepancies
if applied to a plate with slightly different parameters (Dović et al., 2009, p. 4553). The
Wilson plot technique is properly introduced in chapter 2.8.
In an effort to develop a more theoretical solution, Dović et al. (2009) attempted
to model the fluid characteristics inside an individual cell, as depicted in Figure 2.4. By
considering both the longitudinal and furrow components of the flow for different plate

Figure 2.4. Fluid component flows through an individual cell in a chevron plate heat
exchanger (Dović et al., 2009, p. 4555).
The Reynold number in an individual sine duct is calculated in the usual manner,
except in this case DH is replaced by dh, sine, and the velocity through the sine duct is
determined as follows:
𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒 =

𝑚̇
𝜌𝑊2𝑎 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝛽) 𝑛𝑐

(22)

Here ṁ is the total fluid mass flow, ρ is the density, W is the plate width, and nc is the
number of channels. A Reynold number ratio for the entire heat exchanger is defined as
a ratio between the tube cross-sectional average velocity and the hydraulic diameter for a
single sine section, and the tube cross-sectional average velocity and the hydraulic
diameter for the whole unit.

Dović et al. note that this analytical solution shows relatively large deviations from
experimentally determined Fanning friction factor values ± (10-50) %, and that this is
mainly due to the lack of an empirical correction factor. Such a correction factor can be
difficult to obtain as the experimental data available typically contain large discrepancies
(Dović et al., 2009, p. 4562).

2.6 Friction factor
The Fanning friction factor f is defined as the ratio between the shear stress and the kinetic
energy density of the fluid flow, and can be interpreted as the resistance to flow caused
by the fluid moving through a channel. It is defined as
𝑓=

𝜏
𝑢2
𝜌 2

(25)

where τ is the shear stress. It is highly dependent on the specific geometry through which
the fluid flows, and it is also dependent on the flow characteristics of the fluid itself.
Another coefficient for the friction is the Darcy friction factor fD that is defined
accordingly.
𝑓𝐷 = 4𝑓

(26)

One must take care not to confuse these two factors, as both are commonly used in the
literature.
A number of different estimations for the friction factor in chevron plate heat
exchangers have been suggested over the years. These estimations can vary from one
another by over one order of magnitude, as seen in Figure 2.5, showcasing that a
commonly agreed upon and consistent method to predict the internal friction factor does
not exist. This is in part due to highly inconsistent databases, where experimentally
measured friction factors can vary up to five-fold at similar Reynolds values (Zhu and
Haglind, 2020, p. 2).

Martin states that this friction factor is valid for chevron angles between 0 and 80°, and
the predicted Darcy friction factor for β = 60° and β = 30° is shown in Figure 2.5 under
the legend “Martin (1995)”.
Thanks to rapid advancements in computer technology, computational fluid
dynamics has now become an invaluable tool when modeling and predicting fluid flows.
Using the Large Eddy Simulation, Zhu and Haglind simulated fully developed flows in
the channels of cross-corrugated chevron plates for 18°< β <72° (Zhu and Haglind, 2020,
p. 1). Using the Colebrook equation that is used to plot the turbulent section in the Moody
diagram, Zhu and Haglind modified it by assuming that the chevron angle can be modeled
as a kind of surface roughness. They obtained the following estimate for fD by curve fitting
data from their CFD simulations:

(30)

(Zhu and Haglind, 2020, p. 6)
The theoretical model of an individual chevron cell developed by Dović et al. also
predicts a value for the friction factor across the whole channel. The friction factor inside
an individual cell can be determined with the Reynold number for a single sine section,
and the parameters B and C accordingly.
𝑓𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒 =

(31)

The overall Fanning friction factor is then estimated as a fraction between the individual
cell and the whole channel:

Zhu & Haglind, with β = 60° and 2a/Λ = 0.304 is illustrated in Figure 2.6, and β = 70° in
Figure 2.7. It can be noted that estimates from these formulas vary widely from one to

another at both small and large Reynold numbers. Zhu and Haglind’s model was
developed mainly in order to predict the friction factor in developed turbulent flows, but
it still works surprisingly well in laminar regimes, and can be used there as well (Zhu and
Haglind, 2020, p. 9). Experimental data are needed to validate the accuracy of these
models in order to determine which one ought to be used in the calculation tool.

2.7 Pressure drop
When a fluid travels through a heat exchanger, it will inevitably result in a pressure drop
between the inlet and outlet. This is important to consider, because the power needed to
pump the fluid through the heat exchanger is proportional to the pressure drop over the
system, and is given by
𝑃=

𝑉̇ 𝛥𝑝
𝜂𝑝

(33)

where V̇ is the fluid volume flow and ηp is the pump or fan efficiency. This equation
is valid for non-compressible fluids.
In a plate heat exchanger, the main sources of pressure drop manifest from the
inlet and outlet ports, and from the core. The latter source of pressure drop is usually the
largest, as a complex plate geometry is necessary to facilitate optimal heat transfer,

21

Kim Högnabba
Master’s thesis
______________________________________________________________________
resulting in significant friction. The pressure drop from the inlet and outlet ports can be
minimized by designing appropriately sized ports.
A small pressure change occurs as a result of the fluid density changing as the
temperature rises or falls as it travels through the heat exchanger. Finally, there is also a
pressure change if the fluid elevation changes due to the orientation of the heat exchanger.
Adding up all these terms, the resulting equation is the following.
𝛥𝑝 =

Here ρi, ρo, and ρm stand for inlet, outlet and mean density, DH is the hydraulic diameter,
LH is the vertical distance between the inlet and outlet port, and g is the gravitational
constant. Gp and G are the fluid mass velocities through the port and through the core,
and are calculated as follows:

Here Dp is the port diameter, np is the number of channels, and Ac is the cross-sectional
area in one channel.
When dealing with liquid flows, the pressure change resulting from density
changes can be omitted. The pressure drops from elevation changes is usually accounted
for elsewhere when designing the pipe systems, and should be mentioned separately.
Pressure drops from the ports should ideally be kept under 10% of the total pressure drop,
but it is not uncommon for it to exceed 20% (Sekulić and Shah, 2003, p. 397).

2.8 Wilson plot method
The methods for determining the Nusselt number and friction factor discussed in chapters
2.5 and 2.6 are only a few of the available estimates. In a literature survey, Zahid compiled
a list of 28 different papers, all suggesting different values for the parameters C, m, and
n for the generalized Sieder-Tate correlation (Sieder and Tate, 1936, pp. 1429–1435) (37),
and all subject to different constrains for the Reynold number, Prandtl number, and
chevron angle (Zahid, 2003, pp. 9–12).
𝜇 0.14
Nu = 𝐶Re𝑚 Pr 𝑛 ( )
𝜇𝑤

(37)

In order to build a tool capable of producing reliable outputs, it might best to construct
separate Nusselt estimates for each heat exchanger model, instead of relying on one
specific function like Martin’s Nu estimate. These separate estimates can be constructed
using the Wilson plot method.
2.8.1 Original Wilson plot method
The heat transfer in an exchanger can be described with the overall thermal resistance Rov,
instead of the overall heat transfer coefficient U.
𝑄̇ =

𝛥𝑇𝑚
𝑅𝑜𝑣

(38)

Here Rov consists of the thermal resistance for both fluids, the thermal resistance for the
plate, and the thermal resistance for the fouling on both sides of the plate.
𝑅𝑜𝑣 = 𝑅ℎ + 𝑅𝑓,ℎ + 𝑅𝑤 + 𝑅𝑓,𝑐 + 𝑅𝑐

(39)

By conducting experiments where the flow characteristics of only one fluid is altered, say
the cold side, the rest of the thermal resistance factors ought to remain unchanged, which
means they can be described by a constant.
𝐶1 = 𝑅ℎ + 𝑅𝑓,ℎ + 𝑅𝑤 + 𝑅𝑓,𝑐

(40)

If one neglects the variations in fluid properties due to changes in the temperatures, then
the changes in the Nusselt number will be proportional to Rem, and the thermal resistance
of the fluid will be proportional to 1/ Rem.
23

Kim Högnabba
Master’s thesis
______________________________________________________________________
𝑅𝑐 = 𝐶2

1
Re𝑚

(41)

By adding the constant thermal resistances C1 and the resistance of the cold side Rc, the
following equation for Rov is obtained, which is just the equation for a straight line.
𝑅𝑜𝑣 = 𝐶1 + 𝐶2

1
Re𝑚

(42)

The results of the experiments can now be plotted on a graph with Rov on the y-axis and
1/Rem on the x-axis if a value for m is assumed. A linear function can then be fitted to the
plotted data with a simple linear regression, and the values for C1 and C2 can be
determined, as illustrated in Figure 2.8. Afterwards the values for the conductive heat
transfer coefficients αc and αh as well as the constant C can be calculated in the following
way.
𝛼ℎ =

2.8.2 Modified Wilson plot method
The value for the Reynold exponent m can also be determined by applying logarithms to
both sides of equation (42).
𝑙𝑛 (𝑅

This equation also takes the form of a straight line, with m describing the slope. By
plotting ln[1/( Rov- C1)] as a function of ln(Re) and using linear regression, a value for m
can be obtained, as show in Figure 2.9. If this value is not equal to the initial assumption,
then a new value for m is assumed, and the whole process is repeated (Fernández-Seara,
Uhía and Sieres, 2007, pp. 123–135).

2.8.3 Constraints
When conduction experiments and changing the flow rate in the cold stream, it is assumed
that the Prandtl number for the cold stream, and the heat transfer coefficient for the hot
stream stay constant. This is not obvious from the outset, because when the fluid flow
rate increases, the outgoing temperature of the stream will be affected. This affects the
dynamic viscosity of the fluid as well as the thermal conductivity, and thus the Prandtl
number. The wall temperature will also change as a result, and this will induce a change
in the heat transfer coefficient of the hot stream (Fernández-Seara et al., 2007, p. 2750).
As a result, the observed change in the overall heat transfer coefficient will not purely be
due to a change in the Reynold number for the cold stream.
The accuracy of the temperature and volume flow measurements also add
significant constraints. Wójs and Tietze simulated interference in the temperature
measurements used to calculate the heat transfer parameters and found that a mean-square
deviation of just 0.1 K could lead to a ~ 20% error in the estimated heat transfer coefficient.
In cases where the mean-square deviation is 1 K, the discrepancy between the real and
the predicted results exceed 50%, and the method becomes practically unusable (Wójs
and Tietze, 1997, pp. 244–245).

26

Kim Högnabba

______________________________________________________________________
Rose lists several other constraints in his article, noting that the range of the
gathered data determines what range the calculated parameters are valid in. There is also
the risk of producing erroneous results if one attempts to determine too many parameters,
especially if the accuracy and the number of datapoints do not justify this (Rose, 2004, p.
80).

3 Data collection
3.1 Experimental apparatus
3.1.1 Heat exchanger models
Experimental tests will be performed with three different heat exchanger models. These
models are HP-33, HP-64, and HP-52B. The dimensions of these models are presented in
Figure 3.1. 10-plate, 30-plate, and 60-plate versions of these models are included in the
experiments, resulting in a total of nine different heat exchangers.

Figure 3.1. Dimensions of the three heat exchangers included in the tests (Loval Oy).
Here n is the number of plates.
3.1.2 Test setups
Two different test setups will be used, one for heat transfer measurements, and one for
pressure drop measurements. Figure 3.2 contains two images of the setup used for heat
transfer measurements. The image on the left depicts the setup itself, where the two
rightmost hoses are the inlet and outlet for the hot side, and the two hoses in the middle
are the inlet and outlet for the cold side. The image on the right is taken during an
experimental run with a 10-plate version of the HP-52B heat exchanger.

Figure 3.2. Setup used for heat transfer experiments.
In practice, water for the cold side is taken from a hand wash sink in order to
quickly be able to make small adjustments to the inlet temperature, as the temperature
controls in the actual setup are rather slow. The ability to measure the volume flow of the
cold side is lost using this method, but it can be recalculated as all four inlet and outlet
temperatures are measured alongside the hot sides volume flow. A Pico USB TC-08 is
used to measure and log the temperatures on a computer during experiments.
An older setup is used for the pressure drop experiments as it has a more accurate
pressure sensor. Figure 3.3 contains two images of this setup, one taken during an active
run with a 60-plate version of the HP-52B heat exchanger. The experiments are set to run
for a couple of minutes to ensure that an equilibrium has been reached before the
measurements are taken and logged on a desktop computer.

3.2 Heat transfer data collection
3.2.1 Methodology
It is important that data are collected in the correct way in order to ensure that the model
being built will function properly. As discussed in chapter 2.8.3, it can be difficult to
distinguish the influences of different variables when studying the observed change in the
overall heat transfer coefficient in different setups. The value of U can be modeled as a
function dependent on the following variables:
𝑈 = 𝑓(Reℎ , Prℎ , Re𝑐 , Pr𝑐 … )

(47)

Here the subscripts h and c stand for the hot and the cold stream. By varying the inlet
temperatures and the volume flows for both streams, one can induce changes in the
Reynold and Prandtl numbers. However, it is important to note that a change in any one
of the inlet temperatures or volume flows will change the value of all the variables in
equation (47). In order to ensure that the values for Reh, Prh, and Prc stay relatively
constant while Rec is allowed to vary, the following methodology could be used.
30

Kim Högnabba
Master’s thesis
______________________________________________________________________
An initial experimental run will be conducted for a specific heat exchanger with
a given volume flow V̇h, a significantly smaller volume flow V̇c, and set inlet temperatures
Th, in and Tc, in. The outlet temperatures are then measured, and the mean temperatures for
the hot side Th, m and the cold side Tc, m are calculated.
For the second experiment, V̇c will be increased slightly. This will lower the outlet
temperature on the cold side, and the increased heat transfer will result in a slightly lower
temperature in the hot side’s outlet. Afterwards, the inlet temperatures Th, in and Tc, in must
be varied until the mean temperatures Th,

m

and Tc,

m

are the same as in the initial

experiment. This way the values for Prh, and Prc remain constant, and as V̇h was not
changed, Reh will also remain unchanged. Thus, the observed change in U between
experiments can be attributed entirely to the change in Rec. This procedure can then be
repeated until enough data have been gathered.
The aforementioned methodology would in theory provide high-quality data, but
the desired results with next to no deviations in the Prandtl numbers can be difficult to
achieve in practice. Fernández-Seara et al. conducted experiments for demonstration
purposes, and did not put significant effort into ensuring that the Prandtl number stayed
exactly constant between experimental runs (Fernández-Seara et al., 2007, pp. 131–133).
The parameters they obtained with the Wilson plot method proved to be satisfactory either
way, as long as the Prandtl number stayed relatively constant (Fernández-Seara et al.,
2007, p. 134).
3.2.2 Planned experiments
Experimental data are needed for each heat exchanger model that is to be included in the
software. In theory, a single set of experiments with a specific number of plates ought to
be sufficient to develop a method for predicting the heat transfer in that specific heat
exchanger with any number of plates. In practice, however, experiments with different
numbers of plates will be conducted in an effort to reduce the impact that measurement
errors have on the final model. These experiments with different numbers of plates should
yield the same parameter values C, m, and n when performing the Wilson plot method
and is, as such, in and of itself a way to verify that the method works.
Table 3.1 lays out the experiments that are to be conducted with the 30-plate
version of the heat exchanger HP-52B. As described in chapter 3.1, the volume flow for
31

Kim Högnabba

one fluid is changed between experiments, in this case the hot side, in order to induce a
change in the Reynold number. The inlet temperatures will be adjusted as necessary in
order to maintain a constant mean temperature. Th,

out

and Tc,

out

are measured with

temperature sensors, and from there Q̇ and ΔTm can be calculated with equations (1) and
(3). U is then calculated with equation (2), and Pr as well as Re are calculated for both
sides with equations (14) and (15) respectively. A similar set of experiments are then
conducted for the same heat exchanger with 60 plates, which can be seen in table 3.2.

3.3 Pressure drop data collection
Data regarding the pressure drop will also be collected in order to verify the accuracy of
equation (34). These tests will be performed separately on the same heat exchangers that
are used in the heat transfer experiments. Here it is sufficient to only pump water through
one side of the heat exchanger, as long as one knows how many channels that side has.
This has the added benefit of keeping the temperature constant, making the analysis easier.
Table 3.3 illustrates the experimental plan for the heat exchanger HP-64 with 30 plates.

4 Results and analysis
4.1 Experimental results
A table of all the experiments performed on each heat exchanger is presented in appendix
A. Most of the data will be used in the construction of the calculation tool, with the
exception of the heat transfer experiments performed on the 60-plate version of HP-64.
Analysis suggests that this heat exchanger performed considerably below expectations in
terms of heat transfer, and the inclusion of these datapoints would thus risk distorting the
model. Possible explanations for this underperformance is discussed in chapter 4.2.2.
All experiments were performed with liquid water, as the setup did not allow for
other fluids to be used. The Reynold number for all the experiments used in the
construction of software model ranges between 100 and 1500, and the Prandtl number
ranges between 4.7 and 6.3.

4.2 Determining Nusselt equation parameters
4.2.1 Wilson plot method
The modified Wilson plot method described in chapter 2.8.2 requires an iterative
procedure in order to determine the exponent m, which would be time consuming to
perform by hand. A MATLAB script that is included in appendix B is instead used to
perform the calculations.
Here the Wilson plot method is applied to data gathered with a 30-plate version
of the HP-52B exchanger, which is found in appendix A. The Prandtl exponent n is
assumed to be 0.33, and an initial m value is estimated to be 0.7. As described in chapter
2.8, the overall thermal resistance Rov is then plotted against 1/Rem, and a straight line is
fitted using linear regression. Figure 4.1 depicts this line alongside the coordinates for the
individual points. Values for the constants C1, C2, and C are determined to be the
following using equation (45):
𝐶1 = 0.00003458
{ 𝐶2 = 0.01219
𝐶 = 0.1180

Afterwards, ln[1/(Rov – C1)] is plotted against ln(Re) in accordance with the
modified Wilson plot described in chapter 2.8.2 in order to determine the exponent m
from the slope of the plot fitted line. Figure 4.2 depicts these datapoints alongside the plot
fitted line.

the HP-52B exchanger with C1 = 0.00003458.
The slope of the line is determined to be 0.605, which differs substantially from the initial
estimate of 0.7. From here on, the MATLAB script in appendix B is used to generate a
new estimate for m and perform these calculations in an iterative fashion until the initial
estimate coincides with the slope of the line in Figure X2. The result of this method is
that the exponent m is estimated to be 2.034, and C is estimated to be 0.0001737. The
corresponding plots are presented in Figure 4.3.

Figure 4.3. Wilson method plots for experiments using a 30-plate version of the HP-52B
exchanger and an iterative MATLAB script with m = 2.034 and C1 = 0.0001523.
It can be noted that plot fitted lines fit the data extremely well, but the estimated values
for m and C are unrealistic and fail to yield accurate predictions regarding the heat
exchangers performance when plugged into equation (37). Similar results are observed
when the method is applied to experimental data for the heat exchangers HP-33 and HP64.
One explanation for these results might be that the flows are laminar at the
conditions tested, and the Wilson plot method works best with turbulent flows. This might
not fully explain the results, as turbulence is expected to begin occurring at Re = 400 in
plate heat exchangers with β = 60° (Gherasim et al., 2011, p. 1501).
4.2.2 Alternative method
Another way to determine suitable parameters for equation (37) is to perform the heat
transfer calculations with the data used in the experiments and predict the heat transfer
area needed with all reasonable parameter combinations and then compare the outputs
with the actual number of plates used. In practice, this is done by giving the same input
data to the software model that were used in the experiments along with values for the
parameters C and m. The model will then estimate the number of plates needed, and the
results are compared to an answer sheet containing the actual number of plates used in
the experiments. These parameters C and m are then stored as the “best” estimates, until
a different combination yields predictions that deviate as little as possible from the
experimental results. Figure 4.4 illustrates an algorithm written in pseudocode that will
37

perform the previously described task. Ideally separate parameters for laminar and
turbulent flows should be developed, but the available dataset might be too small to justify
fitting four parameters per heat exchanger.

Figure 4.4. Pseudocode for determining the best Nusselt correlation parameters.
Roughly fifteen experiments per heat exchanger model covering a wide range of
volume flows and sizes were used in determining the parameters. In the end, the following
values were found to result in the best estimates.
𝐻𝑃 − 52𝐵 {

𝐶 = 0.278
𝑚 = 0.670

𝐻𝑃 − 64 {

𝐶 = 0.611
𝑚 = 0.574

𝐻𝑃 − 33 {

𝐶 = 0.263
𝑚 = 0.686

(48)

It can be noted that the parameters for model HP-64 differ substantially from the other
two models. The reason for this is difficult to attain, as it might be the result of a number
of factors combined. One possible explanation is that the fluid does not flow in a uniform
fashion for the relatively low volume flows tested, resulting in suboptimal heat transfer.
This effect might be more prominent in the HP-64 model, as it is the biggest heat

exchanger tested, with the largest hydraulic diameter in the individual channels. Figure
4.5 shows infrared images of 60-plate versions of HP-52B and HP-64 in use, with a
volume flow of about 1000 l/h in both the hot and the cold side. The images are taken
with a Flir E40bx thermal camera.

Figure 4.5. Infrared images of the heat exchangers HP-52B and HP-64 with 60 plates in
use.
The thermal images clearly show that the channel velocity is not uniform at the
volume flows tested for HP-64, compared to HP-52B. The fact that the theoretical model
for the Nusselt number in equation (13) underestimates the number of plates needed to
achieve the heat exchange in the experiments further suggests that the heat transfer at the
volume flows tested is suboptimal, about 15% less than expected. A table comparing the
model predictions is presented in chapter 4.4.

Any number of parameters could theoretically be fitted to the Nusselt number
correlation using the previously described method, potentially leading to better
predictions. A larger dataset would then be necessary to accommodate for this.

4.3 Pressure drop correction factor
Table 4.1 displays the measured pressure drop in the secondary channel for all the
experiments performed with the HP-52B heat exchanger, as well as the predicted pressure
drop using Zhu and Haglind’s friction factor estimate (Zhu and Haglind, 2020, p. 9)
presented in equation (30).

Table 4.1. Experimentally measured pressure drop and theoretically predicted pressure
drop for experiments performed with the HP-52B heat exchanger.

Figure 4.6 contains the pressure drop experimental results for HP-52B with 30
plates, as well as theoretical estimates using equation (34) with Martin’s friction factor
estimate (27) as well as Zhu and Haglind’s estimate (30). Both models underestimate the
pressure drop, but Zhu and Haglind’s estimate seems to be off by a constant factor.
Similar results can be observed in the other experiments. In this case, the theoretical
estimate is off by a factor of roughly 1.36 on average. A good correlation is achieved by
introducing this correction factor, as can be seen in Figure 4.6. One plausible explanation
for this mismatch between the theoretical predictions and the observed results might be
40

Kim Högnabba
Master’s thesis
______________________________________________________________________
that the friction factor in the heat exchanger is underestimated at all volume flows.
Another explanation could be that equation (34) underestimates the pressure drops in the
inlet and outlet ports. This could have been tested by performing experiments on the same
heat exchangers with differently sized ports. A closer analysis of the current data might
also give some better insight into the inlet and outlet effects, as most heat exchangers
tested used the same ports.

Figure 4.6. Experimental results and theoretical predictions for the pressure drop in an
HP-52B heat exchanger with 30 plates.
Setting a constant correction factor can, however, be quite limiting, as experiments
presented in table 4.1 show that different numbers of plates and different volume flows
demand different correction factors. One solution is to calculate how much the theoretical
prediction is off from each experiment, which is included in table 4.1, and then use these
numbers to construct a two-variable function that predicts the correction factor for a given
number of plates and volume flow. Using the curve fitting tool in MATLAB with the
volume flow and number of plates as independent variables, the following polynomial
was fitted for the heat exchanger HP-52B:
𝑐𝑓,𝐻𝑃−52𝐵 (𝑛𝑝 , 𝑉̇ ) = 1.08 − 5.16 ⋅ 10−8 𝑉̇ 2 + 4.49 ⋅ 10−6 𝑉̇ − 1.96 ⋅ 10−4 𝑛𝑝 2
+1.51 ⋅ 10−2 𝑛𝑝 + 2.75 ⋅ 10−6 𝑉̇ 𝑛𝑝

(49)

This function is illustrated graphically in Figure 4.7. It has a coefficient of determination
R2 = 0.966, indicating a good fit. The predictive power outside the scope of the
41

experiments, that is for heat exchangers with over 60 plates is probably unreliable and,
thus, the correction factor for these cases is assumed to be equal to the correction factor
with 60 plates. Similar equations were constructed for the heat exchangers HP-33 and
HP-64 and can be found in equations (50) and (51).

Figure 4.7. Graphical depiction of equation (49). The black dots are the correction
factors for individual experiments in Table 4.1.

𝑐𝑓,𝐻𝑃−33 (𝑛𝑝 , 𝑉̇ ) = 1.34 + 5.02 ⋅ 10−11 𝑉̇ 3 − 2.64 ⋅ 10−7 𝑉̇ 2 + 3.89 ⋅ 10−6 𝑉̇
+4.70 ⋅ 10−5 𝑛𝑝 2 − 7.63 ⋅ 10−3 𝑛𝑝 − 3.03 ⋅ 10−10 𝑉̇ 2 𝑛𝑝 − 1.79 ⋅ 10−7 𝑉̇ 𝑛𝑝 2
+1.89 ⋅ 10−5 𝑉̇ 𝑛𝑝

(50)

𝑐𝑓,𝐻𝑃−64 (𝑛𝑝 , 𝑉̇ ) = 1.57 − 3.58 ⋅ 10−8 𝑉̇ 2 − 3.70 ⋅ 10−5 𝑉̇ − 1.89 ⋅ 10−4 𝑛𝑝 2
+5.42 ⋅ 10−3 𝑛𝑝 + 3.12 ⋅ 10−6 𝑉̇ 𝑛𝑝

(51)

The correction factor for HP-33 was fitted to a third-degree polynomial, resulting in a
coefficient of determination R2 = 0.943. A second-degree polynomial only resulted in
R2 = 0.742, indicating a relatively poor fit. The correction factor for HP-64 has a
coefficient of determination R2 = 0.969.

4.4 Model verification
The constructed model’s ability to predict the performance of the included heat
exchangers is verified by comparing the estimated heat transfer and pressure drop for a
given input with the data gathered from experiments. Additional data gathered during
previous test runs that were not included in the construction of the model are also included
in the comparison in order to ensure that the model performs adequately outside the scope
of the data used to build it.
The capabilities to determine the heat transfer between fluids other than water
could not be verified for the different models, as no such test data was available for
comparison.
4.4.1 Heat transfer
Table 4.2 contains a comparison of the heat transfer experimental results, theoretical
performance predictions, and the constructed model’s predictions. Here data about inlet
and outlet temperatures, as well as volume flows, are taken from experiments found in
Appendix A, and are given as inputs to the software models. The number in the first
column denotes which experimental values are being used, with the exception of the last
two experiments in the HP-64 column, which are taken from a different dataset. The
models then predict the number of plates needed to facilitate the heat exchange, and the
result is compared to the known number of plates used in the experiment. The column
“Martin Model” contains predictions using Martin’s Nusselt correlation presented in
equation (13), as well as his friction factor estimate in equation (27). The column “Dović
et al” contains predictions using equations (17) through (24), which are constructed by
modeling the heat transfer in individual sine sections. The “Experimental Model” column
uses the generalized Nusselt equation (37) with heat exchanger specific parameters from
(48) and n = 0.33. The viscosity correction factor has been left out, as it is difficult to
predict the internal wall temperatures across the heat exchanger, and as the factor has a
miniscule impact on the result anyway. Assuming a temperature difference of 3° C
between the wall and the fluid, the correction factor is roughly 1.015 for water, which is
likely to be overshadowed by errors in other estimates. This factor will also be offset to a
certain degree by the affected heat transfer on the other side of the wall.

______________________________________________________________________
Table 4.2. Comparison between the number of plates used in experiments and the model’s
predicted number of plates needed to facilitate the given heat transfer.

It can be noted that the theoretical model makes surprisingly good predictions,
especially for the smallest heat exchanger, HP-33. This might in part be due to the reasons
discussed in chapter 4.2.2, meaning that the fluid flows are more developed in small
channels at relatively low flowrates. The experimental model using individual parameters
for each heat exchanger performs slightly better in heat exchangers with more plates, and
the difference is especially apparent in large versions of HP-64.
The model developed by Dović et al. failed to yield any outputs for 10-plate
versions of any heat exchanger. This model had the largest Nusselt number estimates in
general, and as such predicts the fewest number of plates. The calculation tool had
difficulties with plate estimates under six, and this probably why the model did not work.
4.4.2 Pressure drop
Table 4.3 presents a comparison between the experimentally measured pressure drop, and
the model’s corrected theoretical predictions for experiments performed with HP-52B.
This corrected prediction is constructed by multiplying the theoretically calculated
pressure drop using equations (34) and (30), with the correction factor for HP-52B
presented in equation (49).

Table 4.3. Experimentally measured pressure drop for HP-52B, and the model’s
predicted pressure drop.

For this specific heat exchanger, the largest divergence between the experimental results
and the theoretical predictions is just 2.4%, and for most experiments the prediction is
within 1% of the actual pressure drop.
The estimated pressure drops at 250 l/h were left out, as the calculation tool had
trouble when very low volume flows were given as inputs.

5 Calculation tool development
Loval currently has access to a calculation tool built in Excel that uses equations and
estimates from a previous thesis work.
The biggest drawback to building a calculation tool in Excel is the difficulty of
designing an intuitive interface, and as such there is a risk of creating a poor user
experience. It will be difficult for the user to utilize the tool at an advanced level without
at least some insight into how the model functions and what the individual cells do. The
user might also grow frustrated as a lot of redundant information tends to be displayed,
and as a result the tool risks falling out of use.
It was decided early on that a proper standalone piece of software would be
developed in order to meet the demands of delivering a functional user experience. The
software will be written in Python as that is the language the author is most familiar with,
and the Python toolkit Qt will be used to implement the graphical user interface.

5.1 Frontend
When designing a graphical user interface, the user experience must always be the prime
focus. The user should easily be able to identify where inputs are required, and what
buttons to press to perform certain actions.
Figure 5.1 depicts the final version of the GUI. It contains the ability for the user
to input data regarding the primary and secondary streams, and the total heat flux. The
program calculates the value for any cell that is left empty, the LMTD, and the total
number of plates needed. In order not to overwhelm the user with information, additional
calculation outputs like flow velocities and different dimensionless numbers are presented
under a different tab labeled “Details”. The software includes features like the ability to
switch between different fluids and heat exchangers designs with different parameters.

______________________________________________________________________
In practice, heat exchangers are often slightly over dimensioned compared to the
theoretical estimate. One reason can be in order to ensure that they perform adequately in
cases where fouling is a factor, which would reduce the heat transfer performance. Thus,
the ability to set a design margin percentage was implemented.
The user can also set a maximum allowed pressure drop which the software takes
into account, adding additional plates as necessary in order to lower the flow rate inside
the core. Different plate materials and connection sizes are also available to choose from.
One requested feature was the ability to save the results of a calculation in a
presentable document, preferably in a PDF format. This document could be used just as
an internal reference, or it could potentially be sent to customers as an estimate of what
to expect. In the software, this function is implemented as a single button press that
becomes enabled once the calculate button has been pressed and a feasible solution has
been found.
Finally, a method for the user to add additional heat exchanger models with unique
parameters was requested. This feature could be implemented as a button in the GUI
where the user is asked to input a name for the heat exchanger along with parameter
values. This would, however, be tedious work, as such a feature would also necessitate a
way to make changes to already existing heat exchangers, as well as a way to delete them.
It was therefore decided that new heat exchangers will be added by modifying an
accompanying text file. While this solution might not be particularly user friendly, it saves
a lot of work on the programmer’s side. Figure 5.2 depicts the text file containing one
heat exchanger with hypothetical parameter values.

5.2 Backend
Backend refers to the “behind the scenes” functionality of the software and contains all
the algorithms and methods needed to transform user input into outputs.
5.2.1 Heat transfer area
A simplified version of the central algorithm used to estimate the number of plates needed
to facilitate a specific heat transfer is illustrated in Figure 5.3. The user is initially asked
to give five inputs out of the following seven: Q̇, V̇h, V̇c, Th, in, Th, out, Tc, in, Tc, out. The
remaining two values are then calculated with equation (1). Afterwards, the following
equation can be constructed by combining equations (2) and (11), and substituting the
total area A for area per plate Ap times the number of plates np:
−1
𝑄̇
1 𝛿𝑃
1
=( +
+ + 𝑅𝑓,ℎ + 𝑅𝑓,𝑐 )
𝐴𝑝 𝑛𝑝 𝛥𝑇𝑚
𝛼ℎ 𝑘𝑃 𝛼𝑐

(52)

Here the convective heat transfer coefficients αh and αc can further be expanded as
follows:
𝑚

𝜌(

where

(54)
for secondary side

Here C, m, and n are the parameters that have been calculated to fit equation (37). Each
heat exchanger model has separate values for these parameters. From here on, the only
unknown in equation (52) is the number of plates np. A numerical method is then used
in the algorithm to solve for np, as it might be impossible to solve analytically.

______________________________________________________________________
5.2.2 Pressure drop
Once the total number of plates needed is known, additional information is calculated,
such as the total pressure drop using equations (34), (35), and (36), as well as the
physical properties of the heat exchanger, like the thickness and weight. Equation (34)
needs an estimate of the friction factor, and as discussed in chapter 4.3, the estimate
provided by Zhu and Haglind (Zhu and Haglind, 2020, p. 9) proved to consistently
underestimate the pressure drop. The introduction of a simple correction factor results in
predictions that match experimental data within 5% in virtually all cases.

(55)

Here cf is the heat exchanger specific correction factor from equations (49), (50), and (51),
ranging in value from 1.2 to 1.5, depending on the heat exchanger model, the number of
plates, and the volume flow V̇.
If the previously calculated pressure drop exceeds the maximum allowed pressure
drop defined by the user, the number of plates needs to be re-estimated. This can be done
in an iterative fashion where two plates are added to the previous estimate and the pressure
drop is recalculated. This is then repeated until the total pressure drop no longer exceeds
the maximum allowed. Afterwards, the temperatures of the outgoing streams need to be
recalculated, because the total heat transfer has increased as a result of the increased
surface area. A separate algorithm described in chapter 5.2.3 is used for this task.
5.2.3 Total heat transfer estimate
Estimating the heat transfer that will occur in a heat exchanger with a given number of
plates is done using the same equation (52) as when estimating the number of plates
needed to facilitate a specific heat transfer. In this case, however, the temperatures at the
outlets are unknown. These temperatures can be described by rearranging equation (1):
𝑇ℎ,𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝑇ℎ,𝑖𝑛 −

𝑄̇
𝑐𝑝,ℎ 𝑚̇ℎ
(56)

{

𝑇𝑐,𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝑇𝑐,𝑖𝑛 +

𝑄̇
𝑐𝑝,𝑐 𝑚̇𝑐
51

Kim Högnabba
Master’s thesis
______________________________________________________________________
This leaves Q̇ as the only unknown in equation (52), as ΔTm can be determined by
inserting equation (56) wherever necessary.
The method described in chapter 2.3.1 for determining a mean fluid parameter
value between two temperatures is used throughout the software. If the outlet temperature
is described with equation (56), the parameter equation would take the following form
for the hot side:
𝑇ℎ,𝑖𝑛

1
𝑄̇
𝑇ℎ,𝑖𝑛 − (𝑇ℎ,𝑖𝑛 − 𝑐 𝑚̇ )
𝑝,ℎ ℎ

∫
𝑇ℎ,𝑖𝑛 −

𝑓ℎ (𝑇) 𝑑𝑇
𝑄̇
𝑐𝑝,ℎ 𝑚̇ℎ

(57)

Here fh(T) is a general function describing some fluid parameter such as viscosity or
density as a function of temperature. This gives rise to a problem, as the numerical
integrator used in the software only accepts numerical values as limits. This would not be
a problem if fh(T) could be solved symbolically for all fluid properties, as the integral
could be then solved as follows:
[𝐹ℎ (𝑇)]

𝑇ℎ,𝑖𝑛
𝑇ℎ,𝑖𝑛 −

𝑄̇
𝑐𝑝,ℎ 𝑚̇ℎ

= 𝐹ℎ (𝑇ℎ,𝑖𝑛 ) − 𝐹ℎ (𝑇ℎ,𝑖𝑛 −

𝑄̇
)
𝑐𝑝,ℎ 𝑚̇ℎ

(58)

Here Fh(T) is the antiderivative of fh(T). Most fluid properties in the software tool are
described using plot fitted polynomial functions and , as such, finding the antiderivative
is trivial. Some functions, however, could not be solved symbolically, and equation (58)
could thus not be used as a solution.
The implemented workaround consists of giving an initial estimated value to Q̇
for the purpose of determining the fluid parameters with equation (57). Afterwards, Q̇ is
redefined as a variable, and equation (52) is solved. If the initial estimate and the
calculated heat transfer differ from one another, new fluid parameters are estimated using
the previously calculated heat transfer. The estimated and the calculated heat transfer
values usually converge after two or three iterations, and the algorithm returns the outlet
temperatures.

52

Kim Högnabba
Master’s thesis
______________________________________________________________________
5.2.4 Design margin
The implementation of a design margin feature is easily achieved by altering equation
(52) in the following way:
−1
𝑥
𝑄̇
1 𝛿𝑃
1
(1 +
)
=( +
+ + 𝑅𝑓,ℎ + 𝑅𝑓,𝑐 )
100 𝐴𝑝 𝑛𝑝 𝛥𝑇𝑚
𝛼ℎ 𝑘𝑃 𝛼𝑐

(59)

Here x is the design margin as a percentage. The estimated number of plates tends to
increase rapidly for small increases in design margin, as the total heat transfer Q does not
scale one to one with an increased number of plates. This is because while an increased
number of plates leads to more heat transfer area, it also reduces the fluid velocity through
the core, thereby resulting in a lower Reynold number, and as such, a lower Nusselt
number.
5.2.5 Generating calculation reports
The open-source package ReportLab was used in order to generate PDF reports for
calculations (ReportLab-Inc, 2021). The method takes all the results from a successful
calculation as inputs, converts them into appropriate units, rounds them as necessary, and
presents them at predetermined locations on an A4-sized document. It also attaches an
illustrative Figure of a heat exchanger and prints the physical dimensions, including the
thickness depending on the estimated number of plates needed as well as information
regarding the connections used. An example of a generated report is available in
Appendix C.

6 Summary and Conclusion
A calculation tool capable of predicting the thermodynamic performance of a number of
brazed plate heat exchangers to a satisfactory degree was successfully developed for
Loval Oy. This was achieved by developing a mathematical model of the expected heat
transfer using Nusselt number estimates specific to each heat exchanger included in the
software. A graphical user interface was developed to enhance the user experience,
allowing for different plate heat exchanger designs, fluids, and connections to be used in
the calculations.
Heat transfer and pressure drop experiments were performed in Loval’s laboratory
in Loviisa in order to construct a function for the Nusselt number, and to validate the
software’s calculations. Experiments with liquid water showed that a purely theoretical
model yielded relatively good performance predictions for smaller heat exchangers, but
severely underestimated the performance of the largest heat exchanger tested. The data
gathered allowed for the construction of models specific to each heat exchanger, resulting
in performance predictions that matched reality more closely. Experiments also showed
that the theoretical model underestimated the pressure drop in all heat exchangers by 1030% depending on the volume flow and number of plates, and as such a correction factor
was introduced.
The reliability of the software’s calculations could be further improved by finding
and implementing a better Nusselt number estimate for chevron plate heat exchangers.
Additional features that could be included but were deemed to be outside the scope of this
work are the inclusions of evaporation and condensation as well as a web-based user
interface for potential customers.

7 Summary in Swedish – Svensk sammanfattning
Dimensionering av plattvärmeväxlare är en tidskrävande och beräkningsintensiv process.
Beräkningarna bör dock göras, eftersom kunder inte vill betala för en större värmeväxlare
än nödvändigt, och vissa begränsande faktorer som tryckfallet måste kännas till. Målet
med denna avhandling var att utveckla ett sådant beräkningsprogram för Loval Oy som
tillåter användaren att snabbt och enkelt mata in data om en viss värmeöverföring, och
därefter få ut dimensionerna på en värmeväxlare som klarar av uppgiften i fråga. I arbetet
ingår förutom programvaruutvecklingen även en litteraturstudie för att fastställa vilka

Lovisa för att undersöka tillförlitligheten hos programmets beräkningar och introducera
olika korrektionsfaktorer.

plattvärmeväxlare beskrivs i följande ekvation:

Här är Q̇ värmeöverföringen, U värmegenomgångstalet, A värmeöverföringsytans area,
och ΔTm den logaritmiska medeltemperaturskillnaden mellan fluiderna. U är beroende av
värmeöverföringstalet α för båda fluiderna, vilket i sin tur är beroende av Nusselts tal
enligt följande:

Här är i mediet i fråga, k den termiska konduktiviteten och DH den hydrauliska diametern.
Nusselts tal är inom flödesdynamik ett dimensionslöst förhållande mellan den konvektiva
och konduktiva värmeöverföringen. Litteraturstudien visade att det inte existerar någon

som alla föreslog egna uppskattningar på Nusselts tal i plattvärmeväxlare (Zahid, 2003,

tidigare nämnda ekvationer kunde en teoretisk modell konstrueras som klarar av att lösa
värmeöverföringsproblemet med avseende på värmeöverföringsytan A, vilket ger en
uppskattning på antalet plattor som behövs för en viss värmeväxlarmodell.

experimentellt i Lovals laboratorium och en korrektionsfaktor introducerades.

Denna uppskattning gjordes genom att utföra experiment där värmeöverföringsförmågan
hos olika värmeväxlarmodeller uppmättes. Tabell 7.1 innehåller de experiment som
utfördes på värmeväxlaren HP-52B med 30 plattor. Andra värmeväxlare som
inkluderades i testen var HP-33 och HP-64.

Tabell 7.1. Värmeöverföringsexperiment för HP-52B med 30 plattor.

Alla inlopps- och utloppstemperaturer mättes, inklusive den varma sidans volymflöde.
De resterande värdena är uträknade med hjälp av insamlade data.
Genom att utföra de ovannämnda experimenten och korrelera resultaten med
ekvation (16), så kunde värden för parametrarna C, m, och n uppskattas för varje
värmeväxlare som inkluderas i beräkningsprogrammet. Tabell 7.2 innehåller en
jämförelse mellan två olika teoretiska modeller som använts och modellen som byggts
upp baserat på experimentella data. Som inputdata används experiment som inkluderas i
appendix A. Den första kolumnen i varje tabell beskriver vilket experiment i appendix A
som används.

Tabell 7.2. Jämförelse av resultaten mellan olika beräkningsmodeller.

Den teoretiska modellen baserad på Martins Nusselt ekvation (Sekulić och Shah, 2003, s.
515) visade sig ge relativt goda uppskattningar på värmeöverföringen, medan en annan
teoretisk modell baserad på ekvationer från Dović et al. (Dović et al., 2009, s. 4553–4563)
misslyckas med att ge uppskattningar för värmeväxlare med få plattor. Den
experimentella modellens uppskattningar korrelerade bäst med testdata, speciellt för HP64, vilket var den största värmeväxlaren som testades.
Ett separat testupplägg konstruerades för att mäta tryckfallet i värmeväxlarna.
Data samlades in genom att låta volymflödet variera mellan ungefär 250 l/h och 2 000 l/h,
och resultaten jämfördes med uppskattningar från ekvation (34). Den teoretiska modellen
visade sig underskatta tryckfallet med 10–30 % för alla värmeväxlare. Figur 7.1
innehåller en jämförelse mellan olika teoretiska uppskattningar och tryckfallsdata för HP52B med 30 stycken plattor. Den gula linjen i figuren är en korrigerad teoretisk
uppskattning på tryckfallet vilket sammanfaller väldigt bra med uppmätta data. Separata
korrektionsfaktorer konstruerades för alla värmeväxlare som inkluderades i modellen.

värmeväxlaren HP-52B med 30 stycken plattor.

7.3 Programvaruutveckling
Det bestämdes i ett tidigt skede att utvecklingen av ett fristående beräkningsprogram var
nödvändigt för att bäst kunna uppfylla projektets mål. Programmet utvecklades med
programmeringsspråket

Python,

biblioteket

PyQt5

användes

som

grund

för

användargränssnittet, och programvarupaketet ReportLab användes för att generera
beräkningsrapporter.
En bild på användargränssnittet för beräkningsprogrammet presenteras i figur 7.2.
För att utföra en beräkning fyller användaren i fem av följande sju alternativ: Q̇, V̇prim,
V̇sek, Tprim, in, Tprim, ut, Tsek, in, Tsek, ut. Programmet beräknar de uteblivna värdena tillsammans
med den uppskattade värmeytan. Dessutom kan användaren mata in frivilliga parametrar
som en designmarginal samt ett maximalt tryckfall som inte får överstigas i
värmeväxlaren. Programmet tillåter även användaren att välja mellan olika
värmeväxlarmodeller, platt material, och anslutningstyper.

Figur 7.2. Beräkningsprogrammets användargränssnitt efter en beräkning.
En efterfrågad funktion var förmågan att generera rapporter på utförda
beräkningar. Denna rapport konstrueras med programvarupaketet ReportLab när
användaren trycker på ”spara ikonen”. En exempelrapport inkluderas i bilaga C.
Användaren har även möjligheten att implementera nya värmeväxlare med godtyckliga
dimensioner och designparametrar. Detta möjliggörs genom att modifiera en textfil som
läses när programmet startas.
