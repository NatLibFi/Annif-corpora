Hydrodeoxygenation of lignin-derived model compound

As the world is transitioning away from fossil fuels, lignocellulosic biomass is scrutinized as a
source of renewable fuels and chemicals. Political motivations and environmental concerns
have increased the research in lignin, an underutilized resource currently, as a potential
source of bio-oils. These bio-oils cannot be used in the existing petroleum-based
infrastructures due to their high oxygen content and complex structures. Hence, catalytic
hydrodeoxygenation could be used to reduce the oxygen content of the bio-oils.
This thesis aims to contribute to the ever-growing knowledge of the HDO of lignin-derived
model compounds, as the HDO of isoeugenol over Fe- and Fe-Ni-based catalysts was
conducted for the first time in this work. The reaction was investigated at 300 °C, and 30 bar
total H2 pressure with hexadecane as a solvent. Iron was chosen for the metal modifications
of zeolites because it is inexpensive, oxophilic, and environmentally friendly. The synthesized
fresh and spent catalysts were characterized using different characterization techniques to
explain their activity, selectivity, and stability in the HDO of isoeugenol.
The Fe-modified zeolites contained highly dispersed metal nanoparticles and microporous
structures, according to the characterization results. However, the unreduced Fe-based
catalysts exhibited poor activity in the HDO of isoeugenol as neither cycloalkanes nor
alkylbenzenes were formed. A plethora of cracking products was produced, which could have
originated both from the reactant and the solvent. The reduced Fe-based catalysts still did
not exhibit sufficient HDO activity, as only minor concentrations of deoxygenated products
were formed.
A suite of novel Fe, Ni, and Fe-Ni supported on H-Y-5.1 support was synthesized to study the
synergistic effects of Fe and Ni active sites. Compared to the monometallic Fe and Ni catalysts,
the bimetallic Fe-Ni catalyst exhibited better performance in the catalytic HDO of isoeugenol
due to the synergy between Fe and Ni sites. The yield of the desired compounds such as
propylcyclohexane, ethyl-methylcyclohexane, butylcyclopentane, and propylbenzene over
the Fe-Ni catalyst with Fe to Ni weight ratio of 1:1 was 18%, 15%, 7%, and 3%, respectively.

Introduction

Lignocellulosic biomass has generated considerable interest as a source of renewable liquid
fuels and chemicals due to the depletion of fossil-based feedstocks, and the environmental
concerns associated with fossil fuels. Political motivations have also played a significant part
in the research and development of renewable energy sources, as many governments have
set ambitious goals to generate domestic energy and chemical production from biomass in
the foreseeable future [1], [2], [3].
Lignocellulosic biomass has been used for decades in the production of paper via the Kraft
process. This process utilizes cellulose to produce paper, whereas major biomass components
such as hemicellulose and lignin are burned as low-value fuels [3]. Lignin, an underutilized
resource currently, has enormous potential as a source of renewable energies, chemicals, and
aromatic compounds due to its unique structure [3]. Compared to cellulose and hemicellulose,
lignin is highly aromatic and contains lower oxygen content, making it suitable for fuels [4]. It
also consists of the most reduced carbon fraction of lignocellulosic biomass and utilizes less
hydrogen to form linear and cyclic alkanes [5]. Hence, considerable research is being done to
develop lignin valorization processes [2].
One of the options in lignin valorization is the production of renewable jet fuels. Such fuels
contain iso-paraffins, n-paraffins, naphthenes, olefins, and aromatics [6]. The aromatics and
naphthenes in jet fuels can be produced from the pyrolysis of lignin [7]. In jet fuels, olefins
are undesirable due to their high reactivity. ASTM regulations state that the arene content
should be lower than 25% to diminish the soot formation [7]. However, a low aromatic
content of 10–15% is still required to avoid leaks in the seals of fuel systems. In the
commercial jet fuels studied by Pires et al. [6], naphthene content was found to be in the
range of 3–15%. Additionally, small amounts of phenols were used as antioxidants in the fuel
[6].
The complete hydrogenation of the phenolic ring derived from lignin on the metal sites of a
bifunctional catalyst followed by dehydration and re-hydrogenation yield aliphatic
hydrocarbons. These processes have high hydrogen consumption and reduction of carbon
number of the compounds formed, which is not desired. Although the use of aromatics is
limited in jet fuel by legislative and technical aspects, they can still be used as a blend in jet
fuel [8].

1.1 Components of lignocellulosic biomass
The proper utilization of different fractions of lignocellulosic biomass requires understanding
its various components or building blocks.
Lignocellulose consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The dry weight portions of
cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin range 35–50%, 20–35%, and 10–25%, respectively,
1

depending on cell types and sources [9]. Lignin, a three-dimensional amorphous polymer, fills
the space between cellulose and hemicellulose in plant cell walls [3].
Cellulose: Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on earth. It is a polysaccharide
consisting of a linear chain of β-1,4 linked D-glucose units. The degree of polymerization of
this chain varies from hundreds to many thousands, depending on the plant species. The
hydroxyl groups found in cellulose are bonded by hydrogen bonds that provide the compact
crystalline structure of cellulose. Small amounts of unorganized cellulose chains make up the
amorphous cellulose [9], [10].
Hemicellulose: The chemical structure of hemicellulose can vary depending on the plant.
Hemicelluloses are branched heteropolymers consisting of monosaccharides such as
pentoses (xylose, arabinose), hexoses (glucose, galactose, and mannose) and uronic acids.
The degree of polymerization is usually around 200. Due to their branched structure,
hemicelluloses are likely amorphous polymers. Xylan, the most abundantly found
hemicellulose, consists of β-D-xylopyranosyl residues linked by 1,4 glycosidic bond [9,10].
Lignin: Lignin is a complex, cross-linked polymer consisting of phenolic monomers. The three
phenyl propionic alcohols that are lignin monomers are coniferyl, p-coumaryl, and sinapyl
alcohols (Figure 1). Different kinds of bonds, such as alkyl-aryl, alkyl-alkyl, and aryl-aryl ether
bonds, exist in lignin that links these monomers together. Lignins do not contain regular
structures like cellulose and are variable both in structures and compositions due to the
variety of monomers of lignin and the random linkages between these monomers [9–11].

1.2 Bio-oils and different model compounds
The transformation of lignocellulosic biomass to liquid fuels through flash pyrolysis and fast
pyrolysis offers a cost-efficient method for biomass conversion. In the fast pyrolysis method,
the biomass undergoes thermal degradation in a moderate temperature range of 450–600 °C
and residence time of shorter than two seconds in the absence of oxygen. The yield of
condensed bio-oil consisting of chemicals such as aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, phenolics, etc.,
2

through this process can be up to 75%. The fast pyrolysis products of lignin are such
compounds as phenol, anisole, guaiacol (about 39%), cresol, syringol, etc. Additionally, char,
noncondensable gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, and water are formed as
products from fast pyrolysis [2,12,13].

1.2.1 Properties of bio-oils
The composition of bio-oil obtained from fast pyrolysis differs significantly depending on the
used raw materials. The bio-oil contains high oxygen concentrations (up to 40 wt.%) and
water (up to 30 wt.%), as depicted in Table 1. In addition, it is acidic (pH 2.8–3.8), highly
viscous, has a low heating value which is less than half of the one for petroleum, due to its
high oxygen content [2,14]. The oxygen-containing bio-oil has an increased tendency to
polymerize. It is thermally and chemically unstable, and it is not miscible with conventional
petroleum [15]. It cannot be used as such in the current petroleum-based infrastructures.
Thus, the produced bio-oil must be upgraded by eliminating oxygen to convert it into highquality transportation fuels or chemicals. Hence, catalytic deoxygenation is a critical step to
selectively remove oxygen from pyrolysis oil to improve its properties as a fuel [4].

1.2.2 Model compounds of bio-oils
Due to the complexity in the chemical compositions of fast pyrolysis products, various
complex reactions occur in the catalytic HDO process. HDO of pyrolysis oils is complicated to
understand and model due to the plethora of these reactions occurring simultaneously. Thus,
various lignin-derived bio-oil model compounds have been extensively studied in the
literature to test synthesized catalysts and elucidate the respective reaction patterns and
mechanisms. Guaiacol [16] seems to be the often used prototype compound to represent
lignin-derived bio-oils, as it resembles lignin and its derivatives by consisting of two types of
C-O bonds. Similarly, other lignin-derived oxygenates have been used as model compounds
in the literature, such as phenol [17], p-cresol, 4-propyl-phenol, isoeugenol [18], anisole,
vanillin, etc., [19] due to their similarities to depolymerized lignin (Figure 2a).

1.2.3 Isoeugenol as a model compound
HDO of lignin-derived model compound isoeugenol has been less intensively studied
compared to other model compounds. Some publications can be found in the literature about
HDO of isoeugenol over nickel, cobalt, noble metals supported on silica, alumina, zirconia,
etc. [18,21–23].
Isoeugenol is a good representative model as it contains the common methoxy, hydroxyl, and
oxygenated allyl groups as depolymerized lignin and coniferyl alcohol [18]. Isoeugenol is a
part of the guaiacol family and an isomer of eugenol. Many publications about eugenol HDO
can be found in the literature [24–28].

1.3 Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction
In hydrodeoxygenation reaction, oxygen-containing compounds are converted to oxygen-free
hydrocarbons and water at high hydrogen partial pressures (up to 200 bar) and temperatures
of around 300 °C in the presence of a catalyst [14]. The purpose of HDO of bio-oil is to remove
oxygen from the compounds, especially aromatic hydroxyl and methoxy-containing
compounds, making the upgraded bio-oil favorable to be used as fuels [2]. An example of
HDO is shown in the reaction below for a model compound [15]:
-(CH2O)- + H2 → -(CH2)- + H2O

(1)

There are wide ranges of reactions occurring during catalytic HDO, such as decarboxylation,
hydrogenation, hydrocracking, hydrogenolysis, dehydration, which modify the C-O-C, C-O-H,
and C-C linkages (Figure 2b) [4]. As lignin-derived phenols contain several functional groups
such as alkyl, hydroxyl, alkoxy, olefinic double bonds, etc., there is a competition between
HDO reactions and hydrogenation reaction of double bond/aromatic ring during upgrading of
these compounds. Excessive ring hydrogenation is not desired due to the high hydrogen
consumption in such reactions and the high costs associated with such processes.
The catalysts used in catalytic HDO reactions are typically noble metals, transition metal
carbides, bifunctional metal-acid catalysts, and metal sulfides supported on metal oxides or
carbon. Among these catalysts, bifunctional catalysts containing both metal and acid sites
have shown better hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation activity for the HDO of ligninderived bio-oil [29]. The pre-sulfided forms of CoMo/Al2O3 and NiMo/Al2O3 catalysts similar
to those used in the HDS process have also been investigated for the HDO process [30,31].
The major drawback for these catalysts is the need to use a sulfur source for catalyst
activation, as biomass is nearly sulfur-free [15]. Noble metals such as Pt, Ru, and Pd loaded
on carbon, H-Y, ZSM-5, etc., have shown excellent catalytic activity for HDO. The drawbacks
for these catalysts are the high price of noble metals and their tendency towards aromatic
ring hydrogenation, which increases the hydrogen consumption [4,32].

1.4 Zeolites and bifunctional catalysts
Zeolites are crystalline silicates and aluminosilicates with a three-dimensional framework
consisting of SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra as building units [33], [34]. Due to the presence of
aluminum in zeolites, one negative charge is developed at each tetrahedron having aluminum
in its center. The zeolitic framework contains channels, channel intersections, and cages
where water molecules and small cations are present that compensate for the negative
framework charge [34]. These microporous solids with uniform pore sizes of 0.3–2 nm in
diameter possess the unique property of shape selectivity due to the proximity of their pore
dimensions with many substrate molecules. Due to their molecular dimensions, acidity, high
internal surface area, and ability to confine metal species, zeolites are widely used in many
heterogeneous catalytic processes [35], [36]. Synthetic zeolites with MFI, FAU, and BEA
frameworks are used in many processes in oil refining and petrochemical industries [37].
Bifunctional catalysts are materials that contain two distinct types of active sites working in
tandem in a surface-catalyzed reaction. These sites can either participate in the same
chemical reaction step or separately catalyze different elementary steps in the reaction [1].
Bimetallic and metal-metal oxides are both examples of such bifunctional catalysts.
Bimetallic catalysts: The catalytic performance of a supported metal catalyst can be modified
by adding another metal to the catalyst. The addition of a second metal might influence the
properties of the first metal by ligand effects, ensemble effects, or bifunctional effects [1].
The ligand effect is the shifting of the d-band density of the first metal. Pt catalysts modified
with 3d elements such as Ni, Co, Fe, and Ti have shown improved performance in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction due to the ligand effect [7], [8]. An example of the
ensemble effect is the improvement of catalytic activity by adding Au to Pd olefin
hydrogenation catalysts. The addition of relatively inactive Au decreases the number of
adjacent Pd clusters, which have been shown to accumulate the unreacted species and
reduce the activity of the catalyst [40]. In bifunctional effects, both the metals present at the
surface of the catalyst participate in the reaction. In a study about the bifunctional effects of
catalysts, dispersed biphasic Pd-Au nanoparticles were found to be highly active for lowtemperature CO oxidation. The Pd sites from the catalysts participated in dissociative
adsorption of oxygen, whereas the Au sites were involved in CO oxidation, as shown in Figure
3a [41]. Similarly, bimetallic Ni-Fe catalysts supported on MCSs showed better performance
in the liquid-phase hydrodeoxygenation of phenol compared to their monometallic
counterparts on the same support. Bimetallic catalyst with Ni/Fe weight ratio of 3/1 yielded
around 93% of cyclohexane due to the formation of Ni-Fe alloy [42].

Metal-Metal Oxide Catalysts: These types of bifunctional catalysts combine metal sites that
perform hydrogenation/dehydrogenation function and acid sites that are active in
protonation/deprotonation. For example, in the dry reforming of methane shown in Figure
3b, the Pt metal dehydrogenates methane, and the active sites at Pt/ZrO2 catalyst serve to
dissociate CO2. Therefore, the interfacial contact area plays a vital role in these kinds of
bifunctional catalysts [1]. Similarly, bifunctional catalysts are efficient for transformations of
phenolic compounds present in bio-oil [43]. Pt/H-Beta was found to be superior to H-Beta and
Pt/SiO2 in the hydrodeoxygenation of anisole due to the combination of the metal and acid
sites [8]. Conversion and selectivity of lignin-derived phenolics over bifunctional
metal/zeolites are influenced by the synergistic effect between these sites according to the
following reaction aspects: (i) hydrogenation over metal sites; (ii) acid-catalyzed reactions
over acid sites in combination with hydrogenation over metal sites; (iii) influence of porosity
of the support, dispersion of the metal, and accessibility of the metal active centers by the
molecules [44]. Thus, these factors influence the catalytic activity of metal-modified zeolites.

1.5 Literature review of catalysis in HDO reaction
According to the literature, bifunctional metal/zeolite catalysts and bimetallic catalysts are
efficient in upgrading phenolics obtained from bio-oil through the HDO route [4,42,44]. The
structure of the zeolite, pore-dimensions and acid sites influence the dispersion of metal
nanoparticles of a metal-modified zeolite, which consequently affects its catalytic activity. The
aspects that affect the performance of bifunctional metal/zeolite catalysts are [44]:

Choice of the metal phase affects the reaction pathway. Fe as the metal phase on zeolites
improves direct deoxygenation of phenolics, whereas the use of noble metals on zeolites
promotes the hydrogenation-dehydration route.
Size of metals and metal particle distributions also affect catalytic performance, as small
particle sizes and higher metal dispersions are preferred. A low metal particle size
distribution that provides more metal sites for the reaction and a balance between
metallic and acidic sites are preferred. In the HDO of guaiacol over Fe-Ni/CNT, smaller
metallic particles enhanced the hydrogenolysis of C-O bonds, while larger particles were
found to be less active in the reaction [45].
Acidity of the zeolitic support is required to maintain a synergistic effect between the
metal and the acid sites. Strong acid sites favor HDO also leading to more side reactions
such as hydro-isomerization and hydrocracking. Therefore, an optimum number of acid
sites is required for efficient HDO [44,46].
Appropriate pore sizes of zeolites are required to obtain a high metal dispersion and
facilitate the diffusion of molecules inside the zeolitic channels. Large pore sizes provide
space for the formation of large molecules and side reactions, which can deactivate the
catalyst. In contrast, small pore sizes diminish diffusion of reactants/products within the
zeolite pores [44].

1.5.1 HDO of phenolic compounds over Fe- and Fe-Ni-based catalysts
Bomont et al. [23] have demonstrated that the HDO of lignin-derived compound isoeugenol
proceeds rapidly and to complete conversion with a high yield of the desired
propylcyclohexane already at 200 °C and 30 bar hydrogen over Pt supported on different HBeta zeolites. Similar results were obtained by Alda-Onggar et al. [22] over bimetallic IrRe
and PtRe catalysts on Lewis acidic support alumina at 250 °C and 30–40 bar hydrogen pressure.
However, due to the high costs of these noble metals, considerable research is currently
being done to develop transition metal catalysts for HDO. Nickel, cobalt, and iron have all
been studied for this purpose. Nickel-based catalysts have been extensively investigated as a
cheaper alternative for the HDO process, as they have comparable activity to Pt-based
catalysts. Compared to nickel and cobalt, iron has been scarcely studied for this process.
H-Beta, which has three-dimensional 12-membered ring channels (0.66 × 0.67 and 0.56 × 0.56
nm) (Figure 4b), was chosen as the zeolitic support for this project because of its ability to
accommodate larger phenolic compounds compared to zeolites with 10-membered ring such
as ZSM-5 (0.51 × 0.55 and 0.53 × 0.56 nm) [8]. The larger channels of H-Beta improve the
diffusion of phenolic molecules inside the catalyst channels [47]. Similarly, the use of largepore zeolitic support H-Y (0.74 × 0.74 nm) (Figure 4a)[43] might be beneficial for the
dispersion of metal nanoparticles and the diffusion of phenolic compounds inside the catalyst
channels to access these metal particles [44]. Yang et al. have asserted that there is a better
Fe nanoparticles dispersion and smaller nanoparticles size on the catalyst prepared on Y
zeolite compared to mordenite (Figure 4c) and ZSM-5 [48].

Iron was chosen for the metal modifications of zeolites because it is inexpensive, oxophilic,
and environmentally friendly. Iron has been proven effective by Rezaei et al. [47,50] for the
selective conversion of lignin-derived phenolics into aromatic hydrocarbons on H-Beta,
zirconia, rhenium oxide, MCM-41, etc. Due to the combination of mesoporosity, oxophilicity,
and balanced acidity, FeReOx supported on ZrO2 produced BTX with a high HDO efficiency
(BTX yield of 50.5 wt.%) during HDO of m-cresol at 250 °C and 1 atm. When iron was combined
with an acidic support such as H-Beta, saturated cyclic compounds were not produced. The
reaction mechanism was postulated as the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group followed by
dehydration leading to selective production of aromatic hydrocarbons due to the oxophilicity
of iron [47,50].
Similar results were obtained by Nie et al. [51] during selective conversion of m-cresol to
toluene over Ni, Fe, and Fe-Ni catalysts. It was stated that over Ni/SiO2 catalyst ring
hydrogenation occurs, leading to formation of 3-methylcyclohexanone and a lower HDO
degree. In contrast, Fe/SiO2 and bimetallic Fe-Ni/SiO2 hydrogenate chemoselectively the
carbonyl group of formed ketone intermediate to produce the desired toluene [51]. Olcese et
al. achieved a 38% yield of benzene and toluene over Fe/SiO2 with a high HDO selectivity.
Fe/SiO2 catalyst did not hydrogenate the aromatic ring (Figure 5). Hence, Fe is a compromise
between activity and selectivity during HDO as minimal ring hydrogenation takes place on Fe
compared to Ni and Co (Table 2, entry 23)[47].

Bimetallic catalysts have attracted considerable interest due to their unique properties and a
better catalytic activity than their monometallic counterparts [48]. Fe-Ni bimetallic catalyst
was chosen for this project because of its inexpensive preparation and high hydrogenation
ability of Ni [46]. The use of Ni alone in HDO reactions is undesirable due to a tendency of Ni
to saturate the benzene ring during the HDO of phenolics and high methanation activity.
However, an addition of a more oxophilic metal such as Fe can modify the geometry and
electronic properties of Ni, leading to formation of alloys or intermetallic compounds (IMC)
[54,55].
The synergistic effects between Ni and Fe active sites promoting the HDO pathway have been
discussed in many articles in the literature [42,45,51,55,56]. Ishihara et al. emphasized in their
paper from 1986 that bimetallic Fe-Ni, Fe-Co, and Co-Ni supported on SiO2 had better catalytic
activities in the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide to produce olefins, paraffins, and gasoline
compounds compared to the respective monometallic catalysts. Higher activity and selectivity
were attributed to the formation of metallic alloys on the bimetallic catalysts [57].
Han et al. have confirmed in their paper a synergistic effect between Ni and Fe sites in
the HDO of different lignin-derived compounds. They demonstrated that 10 wt.% and 20 wt.%
loaded Ni-Fe/MCSs catalysts with Ni to Fe atomic ratio of 3:1 were excellent catalysts for the
HDO of different model compounds such as guaiacol, phenol, catechol, etc. Increasing the
Ni/Fe atomic ratio to more than 3:1 decreased the activity and selectivity of these catalysts
to produce cyclohexane, which inferred that there is an optimum Ni/Fe atomic ratio (a
volcano curve) for these catalysts to have synergy between metallic Ni and Ni-Fe alloy sites.
All the bimetallic catalysts tested with different Ni and Fe ratios were found to be catalytically
superior to the corresponding monometallic catalysts (Table 2, entry 7–13) [42]. Similarly, FeCo/SiO2 catalyst tested by Cheng et al. exhibited better performance for the production of
hydrocarbons than Fe/SiO2 or Co/SiO2 during the upgrading of bio-oils [58].
Fang et al. reported better guaiacol HDO activity of Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on
carbon nanotubes than the monometallic catalysts [45]. Ni promotes hydrogen dissociation,
whereas Fe has oxygen affinity, leading to the hydrogenation of aromatic ring and formation
of cyclohexane when Ni/Fe atomic ratio is high, and the formation of phenol when Ni/Fe
atomic ratio is low, as shown in Figure 6. They stated that the activity and the selectivity of
these catalysts could be correlated with the Ni/Fe atomic ratio and nanoparticle size of these
metals, and these parameters could be fine-tuned to produce cyclohexane or phenol as the
main product (shown in Table 2, entry 14–17) [45].
The guaiacol molecule has the following three types of carbon-oxygen bonds [59,60]:
i.
ii.
iii.

C(sp3)–OAr (methoxy group) with the bond energy of 247 kJ/mol
C(sp2)–OMe with the bond energy of 356 kJ/mol
C(sp2)–OH (hydroxyl) with the bond energy of 414 kJ/mol

The phenol production over Fe-supported carbon nanotubes is thermodynamically favorable
as demethoxylation has a lower bond dissociation energy than C(sp2)–OH bond [60]. However,
in Ni-based catalysts, hydrogenation of the aromatic ring producing cyclohexane easily occurs
after thermodynamically favored demethylation and demethoxylation steps due to the ability
10

of Ni to efficiently dissociate hydrogen [45]. This was in agreement with a study by Shafaghat
et al. [43], who obtained cycloalkanes (cyclohexane, cyclopentane, etc.) over Ni/H-Beta and
aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, etc.) over Fe/H-Beta in the HDO of simulated biooil containing phenol (50 wt.%), o-cresol (25 wt.%) and guaiacol (25 wt.%). The selection of
metals leads to the production of either cycloalkane through the hydrogenation-dehydrationhydrogenation route with Ni or benzene through the hydrogenolysis (direct deoxygenation)
route with Fe (Table 2, entry 1–5).
Xu et al.[46] have demonstrated that the acidity of zeolitic support plays an essential role in
the activity of bimetallic catalysts used in HDO reactions. The Fe-Ni/H-Beta catalyst showed
the highest activity in the HDO of anisole at 350 °C and ambient pressure with a 24% yield of
BTX (Table 2, entry 18). The catalytic activity decreased in the same order as the number of
acid sites and intensity, i.e., Fe-Ni/H-Beta > Fe-Ni/HY > Fe-Ni/ZSM-5 > Fe-Ni/Al2O3.
In the conducted literature review, 20 wt.% loaded Ni-Fe/MCSs with the Ni/Fe atomic ratio of
3:1 was found to be the catalyst producing the highest yields of hydrocarbons in HDO of
guaiacol (93.9%), p-cresol (96.7%), and eugenol (94.5%) as shown in Table 2, entry 11–13.

1.5.2 HDO of phenolic compounds over supported noble metal catalysts
A summary of the results obtained from eugenol and isoeugenol hydrodeoxygenation over
supported noble metal catalysts is shown in Table 3. Alda-Onggar et al. [22] and Bomont et
al. [23] have conducted HDO of isoeugenol over supported noble metal catalysts producing
deoxygenated product propylcyclohexane, with high activity and selectivity. Alda-Onggar et
al. produced propylcyclohexane with a yield of 99% over bimetallic IrRe catalyst supported on
alumina. Similarly, Bomont et al. obtained propylcyclohexane with a high yield of 89% on
Pt/H-Beta-300. The reaction scheme for isoeugenol HDO proposed by Bomont et al. is shown
in Figure 7. Yohe et al. [62] obtained a 98% yield of propylcyclohexane in the HDO of
dihydroeugenol, a hydrogenated product of isoeugenol, over bimetallic PtMo/MWCNT. They
stated that the deoxygenation occurred through a bifunctional pathway, with hydrogenation
occurring over Pt sites and dehydration over Mo sites. Zhang et al. performed HDO of eugenol
over a physical mixture of 5 wt.% Pd/C and H-ZSM-5 zeolite with Si/Al ratios of 12.5 and 25.
They obtained a high conversion of around 85% in both cases, and selectivity towards
propylcyclohexane was 64.1% and 53.9%, respectively [24].
The highest yield of propylcyclohexane was obtained over IrRe/Al2O3 (Table 3, entry 3). Such
high HDO activity of the bimetallic IrRe catalyst was attributed to a high metal dispersion with
a size close to 1 nm, mild acidity, and the presence of Re4+ valence state. According to the
authors, the activity of Ir for C-O bond hydrogenolysis and the Re4+ valence state of rhenium
are the reasons for an efficient bimetallic IrRe catalyst [22]. The high pressure of 40 bar was
found to be suitable for the HDO reaction compared to 17 and 25 bar.

1.5.3 HDO of isoeugenol over Fe supported transition metal catalysts
According to our knowledge, HDO of isoeugenol over Fe-based catalysts is performed for the
first time in the current work. HDO of isoeugenol over monometallic and bimetallic Fe and Ni
supported on H-Y-5.1 zeolite is also done for the first time in this work. HDO of isoeugenol
over other transition metals, i.e., Ni- and Co-based catalysts, can be found in the literature
[18,21]. Lindfors et al. [21] have studied HDO of isoeugenol over Co supported on TiO2, SiO2,
Al2O3, and SBA-15, and Ni supported on graphite and SiO2. They stated that the maximum
yield of deoxygenated product, propylcyclohexane, and the highest GCLPA were obtained
over 10 wt.% Co/SBA-15 mesoporous catalyst. Tieuli et al. [18] performed HDO of isoeugenol
over non-acidic Ni-SBA-15 with a 75% yield of propylcyclohexane at 300 °C and 30 bar. A
slightly acidic Ni-SZ-SBA-15 mesoporous catalyst exhibited lower HDO activity than the nonacidic Ni-SBA-15 mesoporous catalyst due to coking because of the oligomerization of
phenolic compounds, and location of Ni inside the structure of the support [18].

1.6 Catalyst characterization methods
The study of the physical and chemical properties of a synthesized catalyst is important in
predicting, understanding, and explaining catalytic activity. The following characterization
techniques have been used to study the physico-chemical properties such as morphology,
texture, acidity, and reducibility:

1.6.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-rays
Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS)
SEM-EDX is used to observe and analyze the microstructure morphology of catalytic materials.
In this method, the sample is irradiated with a finely focused electron beam revealing
information about its morphology and chemical composition. SEM has a much higher
resolution than light-optical instruments and produces 3D images. These images are crucial
in determining the catalyst morphology, surface, and internal microstructure of catalysts. EDX
provides information about the elemental composition of materials [66].

1.6.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
TEM is a powerful tool for material characterization. During TEM measurements, a highenergy beam of electrons is shown through a very thin sample, and the interactions between
electrons and atoms are used to observe features about the material. 2D imaging in TEM is
used to study morphology, porosity, texture, and channel systems of the synthesized catalysts.
17

TEM is also used in catalysis to analyze particle size, lattice structure, and defects, as it has a
higher magnifying power and resolution than SEM [66].

1.6.3 Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR)
Temperature Programmed Reduction technique is used to study the reduction rates of metal
oxide catalysts as a function of temperature [67]. This technique can be used to characterize
oxidative-reductive properties of both bulk and supported catalysts by evaluating the ease of
their reduction with hydrogen [68]. During TPR measurements, a gas used for reduction (for
instance, H2) continuously flows through a porous catalyst. As the temperature is low at the
beginning of TPR experiments, the reduction rate is almost zero. When the temperature is
increased constantly, the reduction of a solid material increases and progresses until the
material is completely reduced [69]. This method is used to determine the most suitable
reduction conditions for the catalyst.

1.6.4 Nitrogen physisorption
Nitrogen physisorption is utilized to determine specific surface area, pore-volume, and pore
size distributions of catalytic materials. The determination of these parameters is important
to understand and predict the catalytic activity of materials. Determining the pore dimension
of a zeolite helps to predict the diffusion ability of various molecules inside the zeolite
framework. Most experimental surface areas are derived from nitrogen adsorption isotherms
at -196 °C. These are reported as either Langmuir surface area or BET surface area. BET
measurements predict multilayer adsorption whereas, in the case of Langmuir, monolayer
adsorption is supposed. In the BET method, typically, values at a relative pressure (P/P0)
between 0.05 and 0.35 are taken [70]. The surface area of a microporous zeolite is evaluated
by the Dubinin-Radushkevich method.

1.6.5 Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
Adsorption of acidic or basic probe molecules on the catalyst and the determination of their
amounts is done by FTIR spectroscopy [66]. In FTIR spectroscopy, radiation interference
between two beams results in a signal called interferogram, which is usually generated by the
Michelson interferometer [71]. FTIR can be used to characterize the Brønsted and Lewis acid
sites on the surface of catalysts with the help of adsorbed probe molecules. Various basic
probe molecules such as amines, ammonia, pyridine, and acidic probe molecule such as
carbon dioxide can be used. The estimation of the amount and strength of surface active sites
of catalysts with FTIR can be used to predict the catalytic performance in a given reaction and
to optimize the properties of the catalyst [72].
18

1.6.6 X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)
XRD is one of the most frequently used characterization techniques in catalysis. X-rays have
wavelengths in the angstrom range, which are sufficient to penetrate solids and probe their
internal structures. When an X-ray beam penetrates a crystalline material, a diffraction
pattern that reflects its structural property is formed. Diffraction patterns are like fingerprints
that can identify the crystalline sample with the help of a database [73]. XRD is used to identify
bulk phases and to estimate crystallite particle sizes. Diffraction patterns can be used to
identify various phases in a catalyst. X-ray powder diffraction is applied to study the structure,
phase purity, and presence of amorphous materials in catalysts. Furthermore, XRD can also
measure the crystal size of metal nanoparticles in catalytic materials using the Scherrer
equation [74]. However, due to the measurement limit of the instrument, metal nanoparticles
that are less than 3 nm cannot be measured.

1.6.7 Mössbauer Spectroscopy
Mössbauer spectroscopy is a characterization technique in which γ-rays emitted from excited
nuclei are absorbed by other nuclei of the same element, and hyperfine interactions between
electrons and nuclear moments are subsequently measured. A Mössbauer spectrum has
various observable parameters such as the isomer shift, electric quadrupole splitting, and
magnetic dipole splitting [75], [76]. Mössbauer spectra provide information on:
a) the oxidation state, coordination number, and ligand type of the resonant atom
b) the electron distribution, molecular symmetry of the resonant atom
c) the magnetic properties [74]
Mössbauer spectroscopy is mainly used to study iron (Fe) and tin (Sn). This spectroscopy,
mainly with 57Fe, is used as a “fingerprint analysis’’ of iron-bearing compounds to determine
the type of iron oxide present in the solid material [76]. In catalysis, this technique is applied
to identify active sites or active phases for catalysis processes, study the correlation between
structure and performance of catalysts, and characterization of catalysts during activation
and deactivation [75].

1.7 Analysis of reaction mixtures
The analysis of the reaction mixture is important in identifying and determining the
concentrations of substances formed during the reaction.

19

1.7.1 Gas chromatography (GC) for analysis of liquid phases
Gas chromatography is an analytical tool in which gases or evaporated liquids to be analyzed
pass through a chromatographic column consisting of a stationary phase and a mobile phase.
The substances in the mixture have different affinities towards these phases and are
separated. The chromatographic column consists of thin capillary tubes which can be from
few meters to 100 m long. The tube is coated with a thin layer of a stationary phase which
has different interactions with the components in the sample to separate them. The liquid
stationary phase can be classified into two types: polyethylene glycol based or
polydimethylsiloxane based. The mobile phase used to transport the mix in the capillary
column are gases such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and helium [77].

1.7.2 Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for substance
detection
GC-MS is a powerful analytical technique with the ability to separate, detect, and identify a
range of volatile and semi-volatile organic molecules even at trace levels in complex mixtures.
The mass spectrum obtained from GC-MS is the fingerprint of a molecule [78].

1.8 Objectives and scope of catalyst preparation and HDO of isoeugenol
The transformations of bio-oil using hydrodeoxygenation have been extensively studied in
the literature using catalysts loaded with noble metals. However, cheaper Fe and Fe-Ni-based
bifunctional catalysts have been only scarcely studied. The objective of this work was to study
the HDO of lignin-derived phenolic compound isoeugenol in a batch reactor on monometallic
(Fe) and bimetallic (Fe-Ni)-based catalysts on different supports. The scope of the project
included the following catalyst synthesis research targets and investigation of isoeugenol HDO:
Catalyst synthesis research targets:
1. To study the influence of Fe precursors, preparation methods, acidities of Beta zeolites,
metal loading, and zeolitic structure on the prepared bifunctional catalysts.
2. To characterize the fresh catalysts with different characterization techniques such as SEM,
TEM, and FTIR. Select different catalysts for HDO testing based on these characterization
results and the literature review.
3. To screen the catalysts and analyze the liquid phase products of the HDO reaction to
assess if any reaction occurs under the used operational conditions with the prepared
catalysts.
4. To characterize some spent catalysts to study crystal size, morphology, and coke
formation after the reactions.
20

Isoeugenol HDO research targets:
1. To perform a non-catalytic experiment for hydrogenation of isoeugenol under the
selected operational conditions.
2. To compare the performance of different monometallic and bimetallic Fe-based catalysts
supported on different zeolites.
3. To perform a set of reactions with three different catalysts made with the same
preparation method to compare the product distributions. The three catalysts
synthesized for this objective were Fe/H-Y-5.1, Ni/H-Y-5.1, and Fe-Ni/H-Y-5.1.
4. To determine the products obtained from the reaction as a function of time.

2.2 Catalyst synthesis
2.2.1 Precursors and supports used for the preparation of Fe-based
catalysts
The zeolites used were obtained from Zeolyst International: BEA (nominal Si/Al = 25, Si/Al=
38, both NH4 - form, and Si/Al= 300, H - form), MOR (nominal Si/Al = 20, NH4 - form), Y zeolite
(nominal Si/Al= 5.1, H - form). The ammonium forms of the obtained zeolites were converted
into proton forms at 400 °C in a muffle oven using a step calcination procedure. The following
scheme was used for calcination: 60 min – increasing temperature to 250 °C, then hold at 250
°C for 40 min, 70 min – increasing temperature to 400 °C, and hold at 400 °C for 240 min, then
back to 25 °C in 100 min. The iron precursors used to prepare bifunctional catalysts were ferric
acetate basic pure, ferric nitrate nonahydrate, and ferric chloride.

2.2.2 Catalyst synthesis methods
Three different methods of iron introduction in the zeolitic supports were studied:
•

•

•

Conventional impregnation: In wet impregnation, an excess of the solution containing the
precursor is contacted with the solid support to deposit the precursor on the support. The
imbibed solvent is subsequently removed by drying [79].
Ion-exchange: The metal ions are deposited into the support by replacing an ion inside
the support with the ion of the precursor. This method is called ion-exchange, and an
excess precursor solution is taken for the metal deposition. The ions between the support
and the solution are exchanged until an equilibrium is established [79].
Deposition-precipitation: In this method, an alkali solution is added to cause precipitation
from the slurry containing the metal precursor and the support [79].

2.2.3 Synthesis of Fe-supported bifunctional catalysts
Wet impregnation, ion-exchange, and deposition-precipitation methods were used to study
the effect of preparation methods on the synthesized Fe catalysts. The preparation of Femodified zeolite consists of the following steps:
i.
ii.
iii.

Transformation of NH4-form of the zeolite to the H-form by step-calcination,
introduction of Fe to the zeolite through impregnation, ion-exchange, or depositionprecipitation,
filtration, drying, and step-calcination.

Different amounts of iron precursors were taken depending on the target metal loading and
then dissolved in 250 ml of distilled water in the ion-exchange method. The supporting zeolite
22

was then mixed in the solution and stirred for 24 hours at room temperature. In this step, the
H-forms of the zeolite were ion-exchanged with the iron precursor. The resulting product was
subsequently washed, dried overnight at 100 °C, and then calcined using a step calcination
procedure [80]. During the step calcination, the temperature was increased to 250 °C with a
temperature ramp of 4.5 °C/min, and then the temperature was held at 250 ° C for 40 minutes.
Subsequently, the temperature was increased to 450 °C with a ramp of 5 °C/min, where after
the temperature was held at 450 °C for 240 minutes [80]. Hence, with this method, different
Fe-loaded zeolites with variable Fe loadings were prepared to be tested in the HDO of
isoeugenol.
One non-acidic catalyst Fe/SiO2 prepared by the solid-state ion-exchange method in another
project, was used in the HDO of isoeugenol to study the influence of acidity in the reaction.
The list of catalysts prepared by the ion-exchange method and characterization techniques
used can be seen in Table 5.

In the conventional evaporation-impregnation method, iron was loaded on zeolites by using
water as a solvent. Catalysts with different supports and different iron loadings were
prepared. The iron precursor, solvent (250 ml), and zeolite support mixture were stirred in a
rotavapor for 24 h at 60 °C. Subsequently, the mixture was evaporated under vacuum. The
synthesized catalysts were dried at 100 °C overnight, and calcined using the same calcination
procedure mentioned in the ion-exchange method [81].
In the deposition-precipitation method, the proton form of zeolite was mixed with an
aqueous solution of iron precursor (500 ml). Then, 22 ml of the aqueous ammonia solution
(32%) was taken to increase the pH of the solution to 10. The suspension was stirred for 24 h
at room temperature. The synthesized catalyst was filtered, washed with deionized water,
23

dried overnight at 100 °C, and calcined using the same calcination process as stated above
[81].

2.2.4 Synthesis of Fe, Ni, and Fe-Ni supported bifunctional catalysts on HY-5.1
A set of Fe, Ni, and Fe-Ni supported bifunctional catalysts on H-Y-5.1 zeolitic support were
prepared by Dr. Irina Simakova from Boreskov Institute of Catalysis (BIC) Novosibirsk, Russia.
The single metal catalysts (Fe and Ni) with 5 wt.% nominal metal loading were prepared by
the incipient wetness impregnation method with an aqueous solution of the corresponding
nitrate precursor, Ni (NO3)2.6H2O or Fe (NO3)3.9H2O, respectively. The bimetallic Ni-Fe catalyst
containing 5 wt.% loading of each metal was prepared by subsequent impregnation of the HY-5.1 zeolite with the corresponding iron nitrate and nickel nitrate aqueous solutions and a
drying step (100 °C overnight) in the middle. Thereafter, the single-metallic and bimetallic
samples were dried at 100 °C overnight and calcined at 450 °C for 6 h with a temperature
ramp of 2 K/min. The decomposition of nickel and iron nitrates was controlled in the
calcination step by measuring the pH of the outgoing gases. The synthesized catalysts were
activated in the flow of molecular hydrogen using the corresponding TPR profile before the
catalytic runs (see Table 8).

2.2.5 Reduction procedures
Some of the prepared catalysts were used in the HDO of isoeugenol without reduction. Only
four of the synthesized catalysts were reduced before the reaction. The same reduction
program was used for the reduction of all four catalysts. The catalysts were sieved to < 63 μm
before ex-situ reduction in Microtrac Belcat II equipment under hydrogen (AGA, 99.999%)
flow. The amount of catalyst taken for reduction was 100 mg. Pretreatment of the sample
under 30 ml/min of argon flow was done in the same equipment before the actual reduction
program. In the pretreatment, the sample was heated to 200 °C with a temperature ramp
rate of 5 °C/min, and then the temperature was held at 200 °C for 120 minutes. After the
pretreatment, the temperature was decreased to 50 °C before the actual reduction program.

Ex-situ reduction program
1. Heat from 50 °C to 250 °C at 2 °C/min
2. Hold at 250 °C for 120 minutes
3. Heat from 250 °C to 500 °C at 2 °C/min
4. Hold at 500 °C for 120 minutes
5. Decrease the temperature to 150 °C
6. Decrease the temperature further to 35 °C

Steps 1–5 were performed under 30 ml/min of hydrogen flow, and step 6 was conducted
under 30 ml/min of argon flow.
After the temperature reached 35 °C, 10 ml of solvent (hexadecane) was added to the catalyst
and kept overnight.

2.3 Batch reactor set-up, analyses of the reaction products, and catalyst
characterization
All the HDO experiments were performed in a 300 ml batch reactor (PARR instruments). The
reactor was equipped with a mechanical stirrer used at 900 rpm to eliminate mass-transfer
limitations. The samples were taken from the sampling lines, removing some drops as waste
25

before taking the samples. The heating was performed with a heating mantle at 10 °C/min
rate until the desired temperature.
In all the experiments, isoeugenol and hexadecane were used as the reactant and the solvent,
respectively. All the catalyst screening experiments were conducted at 300 °C for 3 hours and
30 bars of H2 pressure. 100 ml of hexadecane, 100 mg of the catalyst, and 200 mg of
isoeugenol were taken for the experiments. The reactor was flushed with high-purity argon
three times followed by high-purity hydrogen three times. Then, the reactor was charged with
15 bars of hydrogen at room temperature, and the heating procedure was started. When the
temperature reached 290 °C, the pressure inside the reactor was increased to 30 bars. After
the experiments, the reactor was cooled to ambient temperature and depressurized. Five
samples were taken in total at times 0, 1 min, 60 mins, 120 mins, and 180 mins, which were
analyzed by GC. No gas samples were taken.
The experiments involving Fe, Ni, and Fe-Ni supported on H-Y-5.1 prepared by the same
method were conducted at 300 °C for 4 hours and 30 bars of H2 pressure. Seven samples were
taken in total at times 0, 1 min, 30 mins, 60 mins, 120 mins, 180 mins, and 240 mins, which
were analyzed by GC. One 5 ml gas sample was taken for the reaction conducted with Fe-Ni
bimetallic catalyst when the reactor was cooled to 40 °C to study the gas phase in GC-FID.

2.3.1 Analysis of the reaction mixture
The GC analysis for the liquid phase was performed using a DB-1 capillary column (Agilent
122–103e) with 30 m in length, 250 μm internal diameter, and 0.5 μm film thickness. The
carrier gas used was helium with a flowrate of 1.7 ml/min. The following temperature
program was used: Hold at 60 °C for 5 minutes followed by heating with a temperature ramp
of 3 °C/min until 135 °C. Then a ramp of 15 °C/min was applied until 300 °C. The same column
and the same temperature program were used for the GC-MS analysis.

The gas sample taken was analyzed using an Agilent 6890N-GC apparatus with a GC-Q
capillary column having: 30 m x 530 μm x 40 μm dimensions. FID at 300 °C was used to detect
light hydrocarbons at 300 °C, and TCD was used to identify gases containing oxygen at 250 °C.
The following temperature program was used: Hold 8 minutes at 35 °C followed by heating
with a temperature ramp of 20 °C/min to 230 °C. The temperature was kept constant at 230
°C for 30 minutes.

2.3.2 Catalyst characterization methods
Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-rays Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS):
Crystal morphology of the prepared catalysts was studied by SEM, and the elemental
compositions were determined by EDX. SEM measurements were performed with a Zeiss Leo
Gemini 1530 Scanning Electron Microscope with a Thermo Scientific UltraDry Silicon Drift
Detector (SDD) [82]. An acceleration voltage of 15 kV was used for the X-ray analyzer.
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM): The metal particle size, textural properties,
porosity, and periodicity of pores of catalysts were studied by Jeol JEM-1400Plus with 120 kV
acceleration voltage and resolution of 0.38 nm equipped with Osis Quemesa 11 Mpix bottommounted digital camera [82]. Most of the Fe-based catalysts were not reduced before the
TEM measurements. The set of monometallic and bimetallic catalysts synthesized on H-Y-5.1

27

zeolite were reduced using the same reduction program as before the catalytic experiments.
The particle size distributions of the catalysts were determined by ImageJ software.
Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR): TPR measurements were performed in
Microtrac Belcat II equipment. In a typical experiment, ca. 0.25 g of the catalyst sample was
taken, followed by pre-treatment at 200 °C for 2 hours and cooling to 50 °C. Thereafter, the
sample was heated to 800 °C with a ramp of 5 °C /min under 1.5 ml/min of hydrogen and 28.5
ml/min of argon (5 vol.% hydrogen and 95 vol.% argon). When reduction of the sample took
place, hydrogen was consumed, which was recorded by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
Nitrogen physisorption: The surface area measurements were performed by Micromeritics
3Flex-3500. The degassing of the sample was performed before pre-treatment of the sample.
First, a burette was degassed under vacuum for 2 minutes, and the weight of the empty
degassed burette was measured. For sample degassing, ca. 0.25 g of the catalyst was heated
overnight in the same burette at 200 °C under vacuum. The weight of the degassed sample
was measured the following morning. In this step, the moisture from the catalyst was
removed. Next, the sample was subjected to pre-treatment at 250 °C for 4 hours in the
physisorption equipment . After this step, adsorption isotherms at -196 °C were recorded,
and the moles of nitrogen adsorbed on the sample at different relative pressures were
plotted . The specific surface areas of the synthesized microporous materials were calculated
using the Dubinin-Radushkevich method. The micropore and mesopore volumes were
obtained by the DFT method.
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy: The qualitative and quantitative
determination of both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites of the catalyst were performed by ATI
Mattson FTIR using pyridine as a probe molecule. A thin self-supporting pellet of the catalyst
of the size of 10–20 mg and radius 0.65 cm was prepared and placed inside the FTIR cell.
Under vacuum, the cell temperature was increased to 450 °C for pretreatment and kept there
for 1 hour. After that, the temperature was decreased to 100 °C, and the background
spectrum of a sample was recorded. The probe molecule (pyridine) was adsorbed at 100 °C
for 30 mins and then desorbed by evacuation at different temperatures. Three different
desorption temperatures, defined as 250 °C–350 °C as weak, medium, and strong sites, 350
°C–450 °C as medium, and strong sites, and pyridine not desorbed even at 450 °C as strong
sites [83]. The spectra of the sample were recorded at every temperature ramp. Scanning was
performed under vacuum at 100 °C, and spectral bands at 1545 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 were used
to identify Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively. Quantification of the acid sites was
performed using the molar extinction parameters reported by Emeis [84]. The weight of the
catalyst was taken into account in the calculations.
X-Ray Diffraction (XRD): The phase purity and crystal phase identification of a set of Ni, Fe,
and Fe-Ni catalysts supported on H-Y-5.1 were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD).
XRD analysis was conducted for samples pre-reduced ex-situ with the same reduction
program used before the catalytic experiments. The Bragg-Brentano focusing configuration
was applied. XRD patterns of the samples were recorded on X-ray diffractometer D8 Advance
(Bruker, Germany) using CuKα radiation (λ =1.5418 Å) and one-dimensional LynxEye detector
with an angular range of 2.9° on the 2θ scale by scanning in the 2θ-angle range from 15° to
28

70° with a step of 0.05° and acquisition time of 3 s at each point. The sizes of the coherently
scattering domains (CSD - DXRD) were determined from the broadening of diffraction peaks.
The instrumental broadening of the diffraction lines was taken into account, which was
recorded from the diffraction pattern of the international standard -Al2O3 (SRM 1976).
The XRD measurements of other Fe-based catalysts were performed by using PANalytical
Empyrean diffractometer with five axis goniometer. The incident beam optics consisted of a
Bragg-Brentano HD x-ray mirror, fixed 1/4o divergence slit, 10 mm mask, 0.04 rad Soller slit,
and 1° anti-scatter slit. The diffracted beam optics consisted of a 7.5 mm divergence slit, 0.04
rad Soller slit, and PIXcel detector array. The used X-ray tube was Empyrean Cu LFF. The X-ray
radiation was filtered to include only Cu Kα1 and Cu Kα2 components.
Mössbauer Spectroscopy: The samples were characterized using 57Fe Mössbauer
spectroscopy in transmission geometry. The spectra were measured using a 10-month old
57Co:Rh source (Ritverc Co. 50 mCi June 2020) at 77 K and 300 K using a maximum Doppler
velocity of 11.0 mm/s. The velocity scale of the transducer was linear. The sample was cooled
using an Oxford CF506 continuous-flow cryostat with liquid nitrogen for the 77 K
measurements. The temperature was controlled using an Oxford Intelligent Temperature
Controller ITC 502. All spectra were fitted using a home-written nonlinear least-squares
program with the following Mössbauer parameters for the components: the quadrupole

hyperfine magnetic field B when present. All components had the same experimental
linewidth Γ, but the additional Gaussian broadening for the magnetically-split components
was modeled using a width ΔB of the field distribution.

Results and Discussion

3.1 Catalyst characterization results
3.1.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-rays
Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS)
SEM was used to study the morphological features such as shape, size, and crystal
distributions of Fe- and Ni-modified catalysts. EDS was used to measure the chemical
compositions of the pristine H-Y-5.1, H-Beta-38, H-Beta-25, H-Beta-300, and H-Mordenite
zeolites along with their Fe-modified counterparts. The set of monometallic and bimetallic
catalysts on H-Y-5.1 was denoted through as nominal loadings as their elemental
compositions could not be measured by EDS. SEM micrographs of all catalysts exhibit welldefined crystallites which have retained their structures after introduction of Fe. SEM
micrographs and crystal size distributions of the fresh and spent bimetallic Fe-Ni/H-Y-5.1
catalyst are presented in Figure 8. SEM micrographs of other catalysts are given in Appendix .

SEM micrographs of the metal-modified H-Y zeolites show well-ordered and uniform
crystallites. As visible from Figure 8, the support of the bimetallic catalyst was kept intact
during four hours of the HDO reaction, as the average crystal size and shapes are identical.
Similar micrographs with intact structures were obtained for the Fe/H-Y-5.1 and Ni/H-Y-5.1
monometallic catalysts (Figures S2, S3). Furthermore, it was observed from the SEM
micrographs that the structures of the parent zeolite, silica, and alumina supports were kept
intact after metal modifications (Fe, Ni) for all the catalysts. Hence, it can be concluded that
the methods of metal incorporation applied in the current work, such as ion-exchange,
evaporation-impregnation, and deposition-precipitation, did not influence the morphological
features of the parent supports.

The TEM micrographs of Ni/H-Y-5.1 showed well-dispersed nanoparticles in the range of 5–
50 nm with an average Ni particle size of 20 nm (Figure 11). The average particle size of fresh
and spent Fe, Ni, and Fe-Ni catalysts synthesized on the H-Y-5.1 support was almost identical.
This confirms that there was no sintering of Ni and Fe nanoparticles during the HDO reaction.
TEM micrographs and particle size distribution of 5 wt.% Fe - 5 wt.% Ni/H-Y-5.1 showed that
33

the average nanoparticle size of Ni decreased with the addition of Fe, as the average
nanoparticle of this bimetallic catalyst was 8 nm smaller than in the monometallic nickel
catalyst. The particle size distribution of this Fe-Ni bimetallic catalyst was in the range of 1–
25 nm (Figure 12). The metal nanoparticles dispersion was improved, and the particle size
distribution was also decreased by the addition of Fe to monometallic Ni/H-Y-5.1. This might
be due to the geometric and stabilizing effect which occurs because of the interactions
between these two metals [42]. It was found that addition of the second metal as a promoter
enhances stability, geometry, and dispersion of the active metallic sites by preventing
sintering of the metal during the catalyst preparation or the reaction [77]. However, Ni and
Fe nanoparticles could not be distinguished in these micrographs. TEM micrographs of 5 wt.%
Fe/H-Y-5.1 show highly dispersed Fe nanoparticles with an average Fe particle size of 6 nm
(Figure 13). Yang et al. obtained similar results in their TEM micrographs of 8 wt.% Fe/H-Y-9.
In [48], highly dispersed Fe2O3 nanoparticles were present on the surface of zeolite Y, having
an average size of 5 nm without any obvious bulk Fe2O3 particles [48].

3.1.3 Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR)
Reducibility of Fe species with hydrogen in the synthesized Fe-modified zeolites was studied
using H2-TPR. It is well known that the reduction of hematite (Fe2O3), the oxide of iron with
the highest oxygen content, to metallic iron takes place in stages. If the temperature lower
than 570 °C is used, reduction of hematite to magnetite (Fe3O4) and then to metallic Fe occurs.
When a reduction temperature is above 570 °C, an intermediate oxide called wüstite (Fe(1-x)O)
must be considered, which is stable at these temperatures. The reduction pathway in this
instance is hematite → magnetite → wüstite → metallic Fe [86], namely:

3Fe2O3 + H2 → 2Fe3O4 + H2O

Figure 14: H2-TPR profiles of some Fe-modified Beta catalysts. Catalyst 1 is prepared with the
deposition-precipitation method, and the rest of the catalysts are synthesized with the
evaporation-impregnation method.
No clear reduction peak is observed for the H-Beta zeolites before the introduction of Fe [87].
From the TPR profiles, it can be concluded that the TPR profiles of the Fe catalysts prepared
with different precursors show different reduction temperatures (see Figure 14 and Table 11).
All the catalysts show the reduction behavior typical for hematite (α- Fe2O3) [88], which is in
line with the XRD results ( see section 3.1.6). The first reduction peak for all catalysts appears
in the range of ∼ 320-500 °C, with the peak for the catalyst prepared with the chloride
precursor (no. 5 in Figure 14) coming the farthest. Catalysts 1, 2, and 3, synthesized using the
ferric acetate precursor, have the first reduction peak centered at 420 °C, 390 °C, and 390 °C,
respectively. An increase in the reduction temperature for catalyst 1 might be a different
preparation method (deposition-precipitation) compared to catalysts 2 and 3 (evaporationimpregnation).
The first reduction peak for catalysts 4 and 5 was centered at 410 °C and 465 °C, respectively,
which suggests that reduction of the catalyst prepared from the ferric nitrate precursor is
36

easier than the one synthesized from the chloride precursor. This can be due to the initiation
of ferric nitrate and ferric acetate decomposition at a lower temperature of ca. 300 °C to form
hematite, compared to ca. 320 °C or higher for ferric chloride [89–91]. Yan et al. [89] have
stated that a lower temperature of the metal salt precursor decomposition leads to a better
metal dispersion. This is in agreement with our work, as a better metal dispersion and a lower
metal particle size were obtained using ferric acetate and nitrate precursor (see section 3.1.2).
The first peak for all catalysts can be attributed to the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 [92–94].
The peak around 600 °C and 700 °C can be attributed to the successive reduction of Fe 3O4
nanoparticles to FeO and FeO to metallic Fe [93], [95]. The peak close to 800 °C might be the
direct reduction of Fe2+ to metallic Fe upon the collapse of the zeolite framework [96]. Since
the reduction temperature above 800 °C was used, the pathway Fe3O4 →wüstite →Fe1-xO →
Fe0 also needs to be considered during the reduction process, especially for rapidly heated
samples [88]. It is also possible that reduction of Fe in the prepared zeolites proceeds only to
FeO because it is a metastable form of iron oxide on the Beta-supported zeolites. Interactions
of the metal and the support (Fe-Al2O3) might further retard reduction of FeO to metallic Fe
by stabilizing the FeO phase [56].

The catalyst prepared with the iron chloride precursor exhibited the peaks for the reduction
of isolated Fe3+ to Fe2+ (the first peak) and FexOy clusters (the second peak) [97]. The catalysts
prepared from the ferric nitrate precursor showed considerably small peaks in the 600–800
°C, contrary to those prepared from other precursors. This might suggest that the catalyst
prepared from the ferric nitrate precursor might be difficult to be reduced to metallic Fe.
The TPR results indicate that iron oxide formed in the catalysts cannot be reduced entirely
under 400 °C. A typical hematite curve consists of two peaks with a low-temperature peak
approximately covering 13% of the total TPR surface area [88,98]. The results from the
obtained TPR profiles indicate that the hematite of the samples was not completely converted
into Fe0 during the reduction process.
The TPR of monometallic and bimetallic catalysts synthesized on H-Y-5.1 support (Figure 15)
was performed to illustrate reducibility of these catalysts and to study interactions between
Ni and Fe nanoparticles. The TPR profile of Fe/H-Y-5.1 exhibits a broad reduction curve in the
range of 275 °C–500 °C with a peak temperature of 395 °C, which corresponds to reduction
of Fe(III) to Fe(II) [99]. In this case, ferric nitrate was used as a precursor, and Tmax was lower
than for the catalyst prepared from the ferric chloride precursor. The TPR curves indicate
further a small hydrogen consumption at the temperature above 500 °C. The TPR profiles
37

indicate that from nitrate, only some Fe(II) species were converted into metallic Fe during the
reduction process. Nováková et al. have shown that the amount of metallic Fe on HY zeolites
after the reduction with hydrogen at 545 °C does not exceed 10% in the surface layers [100].

Figure 15: H2-TPR profiles of Fe/H-Y-5.1, Ni/H-Y-5.1, and Fe-Ni/H-Y-5.1.
The TPR profile of Ni/H-Y-5.1 shows three reduction peaks with the maximum temperatures
at 375 °C and 500 °C, and 625 °C, respectively. The 1st reduction peak can be attributed to the
reduction of free NiO crystallites, while the 2nd prominent peak and the 3rd small shoulder
peak can be ascribed to the reduction of other Ni-species having stronger interactions with
the support [101]. It could be due to the reduction of nickel aluminate or nickel silicate species.
It is possible that the aluminum in the sample is located outside of the framework and reacts
with NiO to form nickel aluminate (NiAl2O4) [56]. According to Misi et al. and Cheng et al.
[56,102] the NiO phase is reducible below 500 °C and the nickel aluminate is reduced above
500 °C or 600°C, depending upon the zeolite support used. The 2nd peak is almost 1.9 times
the 1st peak, suggesting that more nickel in the catalyst is bound to the zeolite. The nickel
38

zeolite could undergo reduction from Ni2+ to Ni+ and then to metallic Ni0 [103]. The total nickel
reduction can be written as:
NiO +H2 → Ni0 +H2O

(10)

The TPR profile of Fe-Ni/H-Y-5.1 exhibits two big peaks and one small shoulder peak identical
to the profile of Ni catalyst. Interactions between Fe and Ni seem to intensify the peaks
significantly. Introduction of Fe leads to an increase of the reduction temperature for NiO
from 375 °C to 395 °C, which can be attributed to the interactions between Ni and Fe [54,55].
These interactions might be due to formation of an alloy or an intermetallic compound. The
maximum temperature of 2nd peak decreased by almost 30 °C compared to the monometallic
Ni catalyst.
The peaks in Fe-Ni/H-Y-5.1 illustrate the simultaneous reduction of iron oxide and nickel oxide.
As the peaks increased significantly compared to monometallic Ni and Fe catalysts, it can be
concluded that Ni promoted the reduction of Fe2O3. According to the literature, the easy
hydrogen dissociation on the pre-reduced Ni sites followed by the spilling of the dissociated
hydrogen to the Fe oxide sites can promote the reduction of Fe species [55,104].
According to these profiles, it is evident that the complete reduction of Fe and Ni species
occurs only at temperatures above 600 °C. However, reduction at such a high temperature
can lead to sintering of active metals and destruction of the zeolite framework. A reduction
temperature of 500 °C is a good compromise based on the obtained H2-TPR profiles [101].

3.1.4 Nitrogen physisorption
The Dubinin-Radushkevich surface areas and DFT pore volumes of 5 wt.% Fe/H-Y-5.1, 5 wt.%
Ni/H-Y-5.1, and 5 wt.% Fe - 5 wt.% Ni/H-Y-5.1 catalysts studied using nitrogen physisorption
are given in Table 13. The surface areas and the pore volumes of Fe- and Ni-modified H-Y-5.1
catalysts are much smaller than the pristine H-Y-5.1 zeolite catalyst, which is around 897 m2/g,
according to the literature [105]. A decrease in the surface area of more than 30% for these
catalysts can be attributed to blockage the of pores of H-Y-5.1 zeolite with a relatively large
pore size by Fe and Ni metal nanoparticles. A decrease in the pore volume in the metal
impregnated H-Y-5.1 might be because the metallic species occupy some space inside the
zeolite pores [43]. As shown in Figure 16 (left), all zeolites display type I isotherm with an H4type hysteresis loop indicating the presence of micropores. The pore volume was almost
entirely in the micropore range. The pore width of all metal-modified H-Y-5.1 zeolites was
similar to the pristine H-Y-5.1, suggesting that the metal-impregnated zeolites retained their
structures.

for different preparation methods and higher metal loading.

3.1.5 Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
The acidic properties, such as the amount of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites in the metalmodified Fe and Ni heterogeneous catalysts, were determined using the FTIR pyridine
adsorption-desorption method (Table 16). The results revealed that addition of Fe to H-Beta25 led to a loss of strong Brønsted and Lewis acid sites of the parent H-Beta-25. Only 12 wt.%
Fe/H-Beta-38 exhibited strong acid sites. Deposition of the metal on H-Beta-38 led to the
formation of Lewis acid sites at the expense of Brønsted sites, which is in accordance with
Suerz et al. [107]. 7 wt.% Fe/H-Beta-25 and 12.5 wt.% Fe/H-Beta-25 both prepared by the ionexchange method showed similar acid sites, with the former containing slightly more
Brønsted sites.

Notation: W- weak acid site, M-medium acid site, S-strong acid site
Acidity of 8 wt.% Fe/H-Y-5.1 was found to be 204 μmol/g comprising weak and medium
Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. Acidity of Fe, Ni, and Fe-Ni on H-Y-5.1 support has not been
measured in the current work. However, from the literature, it is known that acidity of a
zeolite decreases with an increase in the metal loading [43,109]. As the bimetallic Fe-Ni
catalyst consists of double the metal loading (10 wt.%) compared to the monometallic Fe and
Ni catalysts (5 wt.% each), the bimetallic catalyst should have fewer acid sites than the
monometallic counterparts.

3.1.6 X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)
The structural features of the Fe- and Ni-modified zeolite catalysts were measured using Xray powder diffraction. The XRD patterns of Fe-modified H-Beta-25 catalysts presented in
Figure 17, clearly show the typical structures of the H-Beta zeolite. However, a gradual
decrease in the characteristic Beta peak intensities with an increase in Fe loading can be
observed, which might be due to the adverse effect of the Fe loading on these peaks [110],
[111]. Sun et al. [111] have stated that the Fe-modifications on ZSM-5 support might decrease
the degree of crystallinity of the ZSM-5 support resulting in decreased XRD peak intensities.
The XRD patterns also exhibited the presence of the hematite (Fe2O3) phase, with the peaks
becoming sharper with an increase in metal loading. The hematite peaks were observed in 2θ
= 33.3°, 2θ = 35.6°, 2θ = 49.5°, and 2θ = 54.1°. There might also be possible magnetite (Fe3O4)
and Fe phases in the samples. From the TEM measurements, the particle sizes of these
42

samples were found to be less than 3 nm. These particles are not detected by XRD due to
limitations of the instrument, therefore not all possible phases might have been detected.

Figure 18: XRD images of 5wt.% Ni/H-Y-5.1, 5 wt.% Fe/H-Y-5.1, and 5 wt.% Fe - 5 wt.% Ni/HY-5.1.
The XRD images of the Fe and Ni catalysts synthesized on H-Y-5.1 support clearly show the
typical structure of the Y phase of the zeolite (Figure 18) with an average crystal size diameter
of more than 100 nm. This is in agreement with the SEM measurements, which showed that
the average crystal sizes of these metal-modified zeolites were between 500 and 600 nm (see
section 3.1.1). In all synthesized catalysts, the nickel phase was detected at 2θ = 44.7° and 2θ
= 51.9° which can be attributed to Ni0 (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) respectively [51,85]. The crystallized
iron-containing phase was not detected by XRD in both monometallic and bimetallic samples
synthesized with the H-Y-5.1 support. This might be due to the uniform dispersion of Fe on
the Y zeolite without formation of a large-particle crystal structure and an incomplete
reduction of Fe oxides at 500 °C [104]. Yang et al. [48] have stated that detecting Fe2O3 peaks
with Fe loading lower than 9% on Y zeolite is difficult because of the small Fe2O3 nanoparticles
formed. Analogous results were obtained by Zhang et al. and Li et al. during Fe-modifications
on H-Beta, HY, and H-ZSM-5 zeolites [110,112].
The intensity of diffraction peaks due to the presence of NiO decreased in the bimetallic
catalyst compared to the monometallic Ni catalyst. This might be due to a better dispersion
of NiO by the addition of Fe oxides, which indicates interactions between Fe and Ni oxides
[104]. This result was supported by a decrease in the average metal particle size of the
bimetallic catalyst evident from TEM (see section 3.1.2). The average particle sizes of
synthesized monometallic and bimetallic catalysts on H-Y-5.1 support, determined by XRD
and TEM, are shown in Table 17.

3.1.7 Mössbauer Spectroscopy

9 wt.% Fe/H-Beta-38-FeAc

7 wt.% Fe/H-Beta-25-FeAc

Figure 19: Mössbauer spectra of two different Fe-modified zeolites prepared by the ionexchange method: 7 wt.% Fe/H-Beta-25-FeAc (left) and 9 wt.% Fe/H-Beta-38-FeAc (right).
All six samples (Figure 19, Figures S10, and S11) were fitted with 3 to 4 magnetic sextets
(drawn in red, brown, green, and gray), each representing a magnetically ordered iron species.
Additionally, two paramagnetic doublets (drawn with blue and turquoise lines) were needed
to complete the along with a small fraction of paramagnetic iron (drawn with a black line) in
the beryllium window of the detector. The latter is not taken into account in the analysis. The
spectra recorded at 300 K are dominated by a red sextet with a substantial quadrupole
coupling, seen as a larger distance between lines one and two compared to that between
lines five and six. The internal field value of 50–51 T and the isomer shift value of just below
0.4 mm/s for α-iron indicates that this is a trivalent Fe-species closely related to hematite
(Fe2O3), being probably hematite with a small particle size, although not in the nm range.
Nanoparticles of (anti)ferromagnetic species do not have an internal field, as they are
superparamagnetic at room temperature. It should be pointed out that hematite should
undergo the so-called Morin transition (at ~200 K), which affects the quadrupole splitting in
45

such a way that when the distance between lines 1 and 2 is larger than that between the 5th
and 6th lines, the situation is opposite at low temperatures. This is seen for the sample 7.5
wt.% Fe/H-Beta-25-FeN (Figure S11a) prepared by the evaporation-impregnation method,
confirming presence of hematite in this sample. If the samples do not differ chemically too
much it is probably safe to say that all red components are hematite.
The following two sextets in brown and green seem to appear as a pair, i.e., their intensities
are more or less locked, with one of them having a field of 46.5–49.5 T and the other 40–45
T. That would suggest a slightly lower oxidation state than 3+ as high-spin Fe3+ should have a
field exceeding 50 T. Magnetite (Fe3O4) is the most likely candidate exhibiting two Fe species
at room temperature: Fe3+ and valence mixed Fe2.5+ species. Upon cooling down, the spectrum
should undergo a change as the mixed-valence is split into Fe3+ and Fe2+. However, this is seen
only in catalysts samples containing pure Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 crystals. Magnetite should generally
have a significantly larger isomer shift value than hematite which was not visible in this work.
Nevertheless, tentatively the green and brown components are assigned to the magnetitelike compounds.
Additionally, a very weak magnetic component (gray) with a field of 25–30 T is seen in some
of the samples (Figures S10a, S11a, S11b at room temperature and Figures 19a, S11a, S11b
at 77 K ). It has a high isomer shift value being unambiguously identified as Fe2+ and accounting
only for a few percent of the total Fe content and such component can be an impurity.
The two paramagnetic compounds could be due to hematite and/or magnetite nanoparticles.
In principle, they should lose intensity to the magnetic ones upon cooling, and while this
perhaps is the case in 12 wt.% Fe/H-Beta-25-FeAc and 9 wt.% Fe/H-Mor-20-FeAc, the effect
is generally small. Maybe even lower temperatures should be employed to turn the two
paramagnetic ones into regular sextets. Speculating further, it can be stated that there is
more hematite than magnetite in the sample, subsequently if this holds also for the assumed
superparamagnetic species, then the blue color in the spectra represents hematite, and the
turquoise color represents magnetite.

3.2 Hydrodeoxygenation of isoeugenol
3.2.1 HDO of isoeugenol on Fe-based monometallic catalysts
A blank experiment without any catalyst was performed using isoeugenol as a reactant and
hexadecane as a solvent to elucidate the hydrogenation activity at 300 °C and 30 bar total
pressure for 3 hours. The same operating parameters used by Lindfors et al. [21] for HDO with
Ni catalysts were chosen to compare the obtained results. The mass balance closure requires
analysis of the products in the solid, liquid, and gas phases. In this work, however, only the
liquid phase has been quantitatively analyzed by GC. Thus, the incomplete mass balance could
be due to the strong adsorption of oligomers and coke on the active sites of the catalyst, and
formation of gaseous products [18].
46

As can be observed from Figure 20, a complete conversion of isoeugenol was obtained under
the used operating conditions without any catalyst. Rapid hydrogenation of isoeugenol to
dihydroeugenol already took place in the first minute of the experiment, which has also been
reported by Bjelić et al. [113]. The GCLPA decreased sharply in the first minute of the reaction
and then stabilized at over 85%. The GCLPA calculations did not include hexane, heptane,
octane, and nonane as they were detected in the initial sample, and it was difficult to identify
if these compounds formed later in the experiment originated from the solvent or the
reactant. While the dihydroeugenol conversion was around 15%, only hexane, heptane,
octane, and nonane were seen in the products in the liquid phase as determined by GC-MS.
It must be noted that all these compounds were also present as impurities in the solvent. The
dihydroeugenol conversion of 15% might be due to formation of the gas-phase products
during the blank experiment. The GC equipment error also needs to be considered during the
calculations. From this experiment, it was clear that the HDO of the reactant does not occur
in the studied conditions without a catalyst. Similar results were obtained by Alda-Onggar et
al. [22] at 250 °C and 30 bar total pressure using isoeugenol as the reactant and dodecane as
the solvent.

In Figure 21, cracking of the solvent because of the acidic properties of Fe/H-Beta-38 catalyst
can be observed. Such strong cracking activity of Fe/H-Beta-38 compared to other zeolites
used in the study might be due to the presence of strong Brønsted acid sites after Fe loading
on H-Beta-38, which were absent in other metal-modified zeolites (see section 3.1.5). As the
cracking products of the solvent and the products of the HDO reaction with isoeugenol
coincide, it is difficult to identify the origin of the formed products. Cracking of the solvent in
47

the absence of the reactant resulted in formation of primarily light hydrocarbons. Most of the
small peaks could not be identified by GC-MS.

GC retention time

HDO of isoeugenol conducted over different unreduced Fe-modified catalysts yielded
dihydroeugenol as the main product (Appendix V, Table S1). Activity of these catalysts was
poor in the studied conditions, and only cracking products were obtained on catalysts
prepared using H-Beta-38 zeolitic support. The results are difficult to be compared with the
existing literature because the HDO of isoeugenol over Fe-modified zeolites have not been
performed previously. The catalysts did not produce the desired deoxygenated products. The
reason for such low activity might be the strong adsorption and retention of phenolic
compounds on the acidic sites of Fe/H-Beta. Analogous results were obtained by SirousRezaei et al. [50] in the HDO of guaiacol over Fe/H-Beta-38 catalyst. In their study, the HDO
activity of Fe/H-Beta-38 decreased by ca. 87% when the reaction temperature was reduced
from 350 °C to 300 °C. They stated that an increase in adsorption energy occurs with a
decrease in the reaction temperature because of the exothermic nature of adsorption
reactions [47,50]. Therefore, stronger adsorption and retention of phenolics occurs at 300 °C
than 350 °C, leading to a lower catalytic activity. The strong adsorption might be due to
substantial interactions between hydroxyl groups from phenolic molecules and oxygen atoms
linked with the framework aluminum from zeolite, forming phenolate ions [50]. As H-Beta
consists of microscopic structure and narrow channels, low diffusivity of bulky phenolic
molecules inside the catalytic channels leads to the blockage of pores [50].

48

Only reduced 9.5 wt.% Fe/H-Beta-38-FeCl3 displayed slight deoxygenation activity, yielding of
4-propylphenol of c.a. 6% and traces of propylcyclohexane. However, the unreduced 9.5 wt.%
Fe/H-Beta-38-FeCl3 catalyst did not show significant deoxygenation activity. The better
catalytic activity of the reduced catalyst might be due to presence of the Fe in the magnetite
and metallic Fe phase compared to hematite phase in the unreduced counterparts. Even a
non-acidic Fe/SiO2 catalyst did not exhibit any deoxygenation. Summarizing, Fe-based
monometallic catalysts were found to be unsuitable for the HDO of isoeugenol in the used
operating conditions. Hence, the decision was taken to apply bimetallic Fe-Ni catalysts which
have better activity according to the literature.

3.2.2 HDO of isoeugenol on Fe-Ni-based bimetallic catalysts
The HDO of isoeugenol was conducted with a set of catalysts synthesized using the same
preparation method on H-Y-5.1 support to study the synergistic effects of Fe and Ni. The set
of catalysts prepared for this study consisted of monometallic 5 wt.% Fe/H-Y-5.1 and 5 wt.%
Ni/H-Y-5.1, and bimetallic 5 wt.% Fe - 5 wt.% Ni/H-Y-5.1.
Reduced 5 wt.% Fe/H-Y-5.1 exhibited poor activity in the HDO of isoeugenol. Analogous
results were obtained by Fang et al. [45] in the HDO of guaiacol over Fe/CNT. Dihydroeugenol
was formed as the main product with a yield of 73% and selectivity to the liquid phase
products visible in GC analysis of 96% along with traces of 1,2-dimethoxy-4-propylbenzene.
Complete conversion of isoeugenol was reached after 60 min (Figure 22a). The carbon
balance in the liquid phase was ca. 80%.

Reduced monometallic 5 wt.% Ni/H-Y-5.1 showed high activity in the HDO of isoeugenol with
complete conversion of dihydroeugenol after 240 min but poor selectivity implying that
reaction pathways for various products have similar rates (Figure 23a). It is known from the
49

literature that Ni is active in the hydrogenation of aromatic rings due to its ability to efficiently
dissociate H2 [42],[45]. In this work, light hydrocarbons were detected in the catalytic reaction
of isoeugenol over Ni/H-Y-5.1 with the yields of 19% methyl heptane (2 and 3) and 18% methyl
hexane (2 and 3). Similarly, methylated butane, pentane, octane, and nonane were formed.
Detection of these compounds in high concentrations indicates that ring-opening took place
over Ni/H-Y-5.1 catalyst. The C-C bond hydrogenolysis of the reactant followed by cracking on
the Brønsted acid sites of the acidic zeolitic support might have produced light paraffins. It
has been reported that in the HDO of guaiacol (a compound similar to isoeugenol),
demethylation and ring-opening take place at high temperatures [114]. Tran et al. [114]
observed ring-opening of guaiacol due to high C-C bond hydrogenolysis activity of Ni in the
HDO of guaiacol over an acidic Ni/Al-MCM-41 catalyst.
The yields of cyclic compounds, i.e., propylcyclohexane, ethyl-methylcyclohexane, and
butylcyclopentane were 5%, 6%, and 2%, respectively. A combined yield of 28% was obtained
for the products that could not be identified by GC-MS. The compounds formed in the gas
phase were not identified, therefore analysis of the gas phase should be conducted in the
future.

selectivity by the carbon number and the yield versus time over 5 wt.% Ni/H-Y-5.1.
The calculated yield and the carbon balance for the products formed in the liquid phase over
Ni/H-Y-5.1 catalyst were exceeding 100%, which can be explained by the following reasons:
•

•
•

Calibration values for quantification by GC analysis of all products were not determined,
but estimated based on their molecular weights, carbon numbers, and proximity of GC
retention times to the calibrated compounds.
Some compounds could not be identified by GC-MS. Hence, their calibration also needed
to be approximated based on their GC retention time.
Cracking of the solvent on the acid sites of the catalyst.

50

Reduced bimetallic 5 wt.% Fe - 5 wt.% Ni/H-Y-5.1 exhibited high activity and reasonable
selectivity in the HDO of isoeugenol. There was a complete conversion of dihydroeugenol
after 2 hours of the reaction. The yields of propylcyclohexane, ethyl-methylcyclohexane,
butylcyclopentane, and propylbenzene were 18%, 15%, 7%, and 3%, respectively. The GC
retention times of the products along with the names of the compounds formed in the
catalytic HDO reaction over this catalyst are shown in Figure 24 and Table 18. The molar
concentrations of the products, the reactant conversion, the carbon balance, GCLPA%, and
selectivity % are shown in Figure 25. An almost 3.5-fold increase in the yields of these
compounds and a considerable decrease in the yields of light hydrocarbons were observed,
compared to the monometallic Ni/H-Y-5.1 catalyst. The reduction in the yield of light
hydrocarbons might be due to a decline in ring-opening reactions and less acid sites, as the
acid sites can crack the bigger hydrocarbons. Although the acidity of the Fe-Ni/H-Y-5.1 was
not determined, it most probably exhibits lower acidity than its parent zeolite as in [43,109].
The qualitative gas phase analysis showed the presence of methane and propane.

GC retention time (min)
Figure 24: GC retention times of the products formed during the HDO of isoeugenol with 5
wt.% Fe - 5 wt.% Ni/H-Y-5.1.
A reaction yield of over 100% in the liquid phase was obtained similar to those obtained over
Ni/H-Y-5.1. GCLPA was found to be ca. 72%. Additionally, an increase in GCLPA% and carbon
balance was observed with increasing reaction duration (also observed in Ni/H-Y-5.1).

51

Possible reasons for the increment in carbon balance and GCLPA % with the increase in
reaction time are:
•

At the beginning of the reaction, the phenolics could have been strongly adsorbed to the
catalyst. As the reaction proceeds, the aromatic ring is hydrogenated, and the products
desorb to the bulk liquid.
The gas-phase products could have reacted with cyclohexane derivatives in the liquidphase producing alkylated compounds.
The cracked products were formed from the solvent (n-hexadecane).

Fe/H-Y-5.1 showed no deoxygenation activity, hence, an increase in the yields of
deoxygenated aromatics and cycloalkanes over bimetallic Fe-Ni compared to the
monometallic Ni catalyst is due to the synergy between Fe and Ni sites. There are several
studies in the literature stating that bimetallic Fe-Ni catalysts exhibit better HDO performance
than monometallic Ni catalysts due to the synergistic effect between Fe and Ni [42,43,55]. A
decrease in the average metal particle size and an increase in the relative H2-TPR area of the
bimetallic catalyst compared to the monometallic Ni catalyst obtained from the
characterization results suggest interactions between Fe and Ni. The results from isoeugenol
transformation over these catalysts are presented in Table 19.

Proposed reaction pathway
In the HDO of isoeugenol with a bimetallic Fe-Ni catalyst, 1,2-dimethoxy-4-propylbenzene as
an intermediate was already formed in the 1st minute of the reaction. Tieuli et al.[18] stated
that heavy products such as 1,2-dimethoxy-4-propylbenzene are formed in the HDO of
isoeugenol with an acidic catalyst. Formation of 1,2-dimethoxy-4-propylbenzene implies that
there is fast dehydration of dihydroeugenol to 2-methoxy-4-propylbenzene and then
methoxylation to 1,2-dimethoxy-4-propylbenzene. Due to the fast reaction step, the
intermediate 2-methoxy-4-propylbenzene is not observed.
In this study, 2-methoxy-4-propylcyclohexanol, 2-methoxy-4-propylcyclohexanone, and 4propyl-1,2-cyclohexanediol were not observed, indicating that the hydrogenation of aromatic
ring occurs after the demethylation and demethoxylation reactions. The major deoxygenated
products of the reaction, which are propylcyclohexane and butylcyclopentane were also
formed already in the 1st minute. Such fast generation of these compounds indicates that the
aromatic ring hydrogenation proceeds rapidly in combination with ring contraction on the
acidic sites of the H-Y-5.1 support (steps 1–9 Figure 26). For cyclohexane and
propylcyclohexane, the ring contraction generates methylcyclopentane and
54

butylcyclopentane, respectively. Shafaghat et al. [43] have reported formation of similar
products (methylcyclopentane and methylcyclohexane) in the HDO of simulated phenolic biooil over Ni, Fe, and Fe-Ni/H-Beta.
In HDO of isoeugenol, 4-propylphenol and 1-propylcyclohexene were also formed as
intermediates. The formation of 1-propylcylohexene implies that the Ni particles with sizes of
over 11 nm are less active in the phenyl ring hydrogenation compared to Pt on zeolites used
by Bomont et al. [23], where no such intermediate was formed [18]. Propylcyclohexene
intermediate was also observed by Tieuli et al. [18] in the HDO of isoeugenol over Ni/SBA-15
mesoporous catalyst containing Ni particles of around 20 nm.
As depicted in Figure 26, demethoxylation in the HDO of isoeugenol is subsequently followed
by dehydration on the acidic sites and hydrogenation of the ring on the metal sites to form
propylcyclohexane. Han et al. [42] observed that methoxy groups in eugenol HDO were
removed by demethoxylation instead of demethylation over Fe-Ni/MCSs, which is in
accordance with this work. The authors [42] stated that the propyl side chain of eugenol did
not undergo hydrogenolysis. However, over bimetallic Fe-Ni/H-Y-5.1, the propyl side chain of
isoeugenol underwent hydrogenolysis after ring hydrogenation. This might be because the HY-5.1 support is more acidic than the MCSs, which indicates that acidic sites are needed to
break the alkyl side chain of isoeugenol. Bomont et al. [23] obtained analogous results with
removal of the propyl chain after ring hydrogenation over an acidic Pt/H-Beta catalyst.
The results suggest that addition of Fe facilitates deoxygenation but suppresses the
hydrogenation activity of Ni, such as phenolic ring-opening compared to the monometallic Ni
catalyst [42]. The possible synergy between formed Fe-Ni sites and Ni sites, which are needed
to activate C–O bonds and dissociate H2 for dehydroxylation reaction, respectively, facilitates
the HDO of isoeugenol for the formation of aromatics and cycloalkanes [42].
The bimetallic Fe-Ni catalyst was found to have high activity in alkyl transfer (transalkylation)
reactions. Various alkylated products of cyclohexane, such as ethyl-methylcyclohexane (yield
of 15%), methylcyclohexane, dimethylcyclohexane, and trimethylcyclohexane were formed.
Zhu et al. have stated that the Brønsted acid sites of H-Beta catalyze methyl transfer reactions
from the methoxy group to the aromatic ring in the HDO of anisole over Pt/H-Beta. The
presence of active Pt improves the rate of cleavage of the methoxy bond and thus the rate of
transalkylation. In Fe-Ni/H-Y-5.1 catalyst, the Brønsted acid sites of H-Y-5.1 might catalyze
methyl transfer reactions with the synergy of Fe-Ni sites, as more alkylated products were
observed on the bimetallic catalyst than on the monometallic catalyst.
In both Ni and Fe-Ni catalysts supported on an acidic H-Y-5.1 zeolite, hexane, heptane, octane,
and nonane were formed as the products. These might have been formed by cracking of
nonane formed after the ring-opening of propylcyclohexane or as a result of the cracking of
the solvent.

Based on the product identification with GC-MS, the following reaction network was
proposed for the isoeugenol HDO over Fe-Ni/H-Y-5.1.

Conclusions and Recommendations

As the world is transitioning away from fossil fuels, lignocellulosic biomass is scrutinized as a
source of renewable fuels and chemicals. Political motivations and environmental concerns
have increased the research in lignin, an underutilized resource currently, as a potential
source of bio-oils. However, bio-oils obtained for example by fast pyrolysis need to be
catalytically upgraded to reduce their oxygen content making them compatible with the
current petroleum-based infrastructures. Since bio-oils are a complicated mixture of many
aromatic compounds, a lignin-derived phenolic compound isoeugenol was selected as a
model compound for this study. The catalytic hydrodeoxygenation reaction (HDO) of
isoeugenol was conducted over different Fe-, Ni-, and Fe-Ni-based catalysts supported on
zeolites in a batch reactor at 300 °C and 30 bar total pressure for 3 hours or 4 hours with
hexadecane as a solvent. Iron was chosen for the metal modifications of zeolites because it is
inexpensive, oxophilic, and environmentally friendly. This thesis aims to contribute to the
ever-growing knowledge of the HDO of phenolic compounds as the HDO of isoeugenol over
Fe- and Fe-Ni-based catalysts was conducted for the first time in this work.
The review of the relevant literature revealed that Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts are more active
in the HDO of phenolic compounds than their monometallic counterparts due to the
synergistic effects of these metals. Activity of the Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts was found to
follow a volcanic curve depending on the mass ratios between Fe and Ni. There are only a few
papers in the literature about the HDO of phenolic compounds over Fe-based catalysts.
Monometallic Fe was found to be a compromise between activity and selectivity in the HDO
reactions as it removes oxygen selectively from phenolic compounds by direct deoxygenation
with low H2 consumption but exhibits low activity.
In this study, various Fe-, Ni-, and Fe-Ni modified catalysts were synthesized and characterized
to study the influence of Fe precursors, methods of preparation, acidity, metal loading, and
zeolitic structure on the catalytic performance. The SEM images of the prepared catalysts
showed that the catalysts retained their structures after Fe-introduction, and TEM images
indicated presence of highly dispersed nanoparticles in the prepared catalysts. Fe species in
the prepared catalysts were mainly in the hematite (Fe2O3) form, according to the XRD and
Mössbauer results. H2-TPR studies indicated that the Ni species were easier to be reduced
than Fe species, as the Fe particles need a higher temperature for complete reduction. The
specific surface areas and acid sites of all the studied catalysts decreased after the metal
modifications as observed previously for other catalytic systems.
Unreduced Fe-based catalysts exhibited poor activity in the HDO of isoeugenol in the applied
operating conditions. A lot of cracking products were formed, and it was difficult to identify
them by GC-MS. It was also difficult to assess the origin of the products as cracking of the
solvent was observed in a blank experiment performed with the solvent and the catalyst. Only
the reduced 9.5 wt.% Fe/H-Beta-38-FeCl3 showed slight deoxygenation activity visible
through formation of 4-propyl phenol of ca. 6% and traces of propylcyclohexane. Poor
performance of Fe might be due to the presence of Fe in the hematite form for unreduced
catalysts or rapid catalyst deactivation due to blockage of the catalyst pores by strong
57

adsorption and trapping of phenolics during the experiments. Even in reduced catalysts, Fe
was observed mostly in the magnetite form. Because the desired deoxygenated products such
as propylcyclohexane were not formed over the initially selected Fe-based catalysts, a suite
of Fe, Ni, and Fe-Ni catalysts on H-Y-5.1 support was prepared to study the synergistic effects
of bimetallic catalysts.
A reduction temperature of 500 °C was chosen for the set of catalysts on H-Y-5.1 support
based on the obtained H2-TPR profiles. The synthesized Fe-based catalysts exhibited a high
metal dispersion according to TEM imaging. However, the reduced 5 wt.% Fe/H-Y-5.1
displayed low activity in the HDO of isoeugenol following the same trend as other studied Febased catalysts. Dihydroeugenol with a yield of 73% was formed as the main product over
this catalyst.
The reduced 5 wt.% Ni/H-Y-5.1 exhibited high hydrogenation activity but poor selectivity in
the HDO of isoeugenol. Ni nanoparticles with an average size of 19 nm were found to be active
in aromatic ring hydrogenation and ring-opening reactions leading to formation of light
hydrocarbons. The aromatic ring-opening reactions are not desirable due to a relatively high
H2 consumption. The yield of the desired product propylcyclohexane was just 5% after 4 hours.
The carbon balance exceeding 100% suggests cracking of the solvent over this catalyst.
Although complete HDO of isoeugenol was achieved over this catalyst, it was not selective
towards the desired deoxygenated aromatic and cyclic compounds.
The reduced bimetallic 5 wt.% Fe - 5 wt.% Ni/H-Y-5.1 (with Fe to Ni weight ratio of 1:1)
exhibited both high activity and reasonable selectivity in the HDO of isoeugenol. This was the
best catalyst of all the tested Fe-based catalysts in this work. The yields of the desired
deoxygenated compounds such as propylcyclohexane, ethyl-methylcyclohexane,
butylcyclopentane, and propylbenzene were 18%, 15%, 7%, and 3%, respectively. An almost
3.5-fold increase in the yields of these compounds and a considerable decrease in the yields
of light hydrocarbons were observed, compared to the monometallic Ni/H-Y-5.1 catalyst.
The average nanoparticles size in the prepared bimetallic Fe-Ni catalyst was 11nm being 8 nm
smaller than for the monometallic Ni catalyst. Such decrease in the average metal particle
size, diffraction peaks of NiO phase, and an increase in the relative H2-TPR area of the
bimetallic catalyst compared to the monometallic Ni catalyst indicate the synergy between
Fe and Ni particles. The Fe-Ni sites are needed to activate C–O bonds while Ni sites are
required for H2 dissociation and subsequent dehydroxylation. The synergy between these two
sites facilitates the HDO of isoeugenol to form cycloalkanes and deoxygenated aromatics. This
study shows that application of two relatively cheap metals Fe and Ni in tandem over a zeolitic
support has a potential to produce an efficient HDO catalyst. The results obtained from this
study are in accordance with the literature where bimetallic catalysts have exhibited better
performance in the HDO of phenolic compounds compared to the respective monometallic
catalysts due to the synergy between Fe and Ni metallic sites.
HDO of isoeugenol over mostly unreduced Fe-based catalysts was carried in this work. HDO
activity of Fe/H-Beta-38 catalyst was improved after reduction at 500 °C. Hence, further

58

experiments could be performed with reduced Fe-based catalysts prepared by ferric acetate
precursor, which exhibited excellent metal dispersion.
HDO of isoeugenol over Fe-Ni-based bimetallic catalysts should be further investigated with
different weight ratios of Fe and Ni as the HDO activity of the bimetallic catalysts can be finetuned by adjusting the Fe to Ni ratio. Interactions between Fe and Ni active sites could also
be clarified by characterization of catalysts with different Fe to Ni ratios. Reaction should be
conducted at 350 °C to study the adsorption of phenolics on the catalyst surface as adsorption
and retention of phenolics decrease with increasing temperature. Similarly, characterization
could be done to study coke deposition inside the pores of the zeolitic supports. The GC
calibration of the products should be done to obtain more precise results. Quantification of
the acid sites of the synthesized catalysts should be done to better explain the obtained
catalytic results. Further experiments should be done by varying the reduction temperatures
of the catalysts to see the effects of reduction temperatures on the HDO of isoeugenol as
reduction temperature influences the oxidation state of the Fe-modified catalysts.
Additionally, solventless HDO experiments should be conducted, which would make product
identification and calculations simpler. Such experiments are the most relevant in the context
of eventual industrial implementation.
