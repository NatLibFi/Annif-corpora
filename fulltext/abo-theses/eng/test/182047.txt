Abstract
Being able to control and understand cell functions at will is a valuable tool in cell biology
and opens new possibilities and applications in regenerative medicine and tissue
engineering. Developing bioelectronic platforms that allow for spatial and temporal
control of both cells and their microenvironment is crucial for scientists to gain a better
understanding of cell functions and activation. External control of the conformation of
biomolecules allows for the control of their binding affinity to cells, and thus also control
of the activation of specific cell functions. Finding new, cheaper, and more biocompatible
materials for fabricating bioelectronic activation platforms is therefore of great interest.
The conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS possesses several desirable properties, e.g. high
conductivity and biocompatibility, making it an exciting and practical material to be used
in bioelectronic applications, including for fabricating a bioelectronic activation platform
for controlling cell functions.
The purpose of this thesis was to demonstrate the feasibility of using a transparent and
conductive PEDOT:PSS thin film as a bioelectronic activation platform for potentially
inducing a conformational change in a short peptide sequence with a positive end group.
PEDOT:PSS thin film platforms were fabricated by spin-coating on glass or ITO
substrates. The films were made stable and insoluble in organic solutions by the addition
of a crosslinker. The film surfaces were functionalized via silanization and the available
binding sites for the peptides were quantified using a colorimetric assay. Bio
functionalizing the polymer film with the charged peptides was shown not to affect the
film conductivity. Underwater contact angle measurements were conducted to
demonstrate that a potentially induced conformational change in the charged peptides
could be obtained. It was shown that by applying a potential with different polarity over
the PEDOT:PSS film with the charged peptides, the surface wettability could be
controlled indicating that a conformational change occurred. The measurements
conducted in this thesis were not sufficient for conclusive results, and more underwater
contact angle measurements are needed to understand how applying a potential over the
PEDOT:PSS film affects the wettability of the surface and the conformation of the
peptides.

1. INTRODUCTION

1. Introduction
1.1 Organic bioelectronics
In recent years, bioelectronics, an interdisciplinary field that integrates electronics with
biological systems, has gained much interest from scientist all over the world. Fabricating
bioelectronic devices using conducting polymers has been shown to be an excellent way
to improve the interface between the electrode and the biomaterial which is paramount
for the efficiency of the bioelectronic device. Conducting polymers have therefore already
been used in numerous bioelectronic applications, such as tissue engineering, drug
delivery and biosensors [1, 2, 3, 4].
Conducting polymers are known as smart materials that combine the conductive
properties of metals with the ease of synthesis and fabrication of polymers [5, 6]. One key
advantage of conducting polymers is their mixed ion-electron conductive property [7].
The dual ionic and electronic conductivity allows for efficient signal transport between
the electrode, i.e. the polymer complex, and the biological matrix in the form of ion
transport [8, 9]. Conductive polymer devices can also be fabricated using a large variety
of different processes including soft lithography, spin-coating and electropolymerization, thus enabling the fabrication of a vast range of different devices [10].
Furthermore, the chemical structure of conductive polymers enables the mechanical and
electrical properties of the polymers to be easily tailored for specific applications by
changing the backbone structure or by incorporating side chains into the polymer
structure.

1.2 External control of cell functions
One interesting application within bioelectronics is the prospect of externally controlling
the fate of cells. Developing bioelectronic platforms that allow for spatial and temporal
control of cells and their microenvironment is crucial for scientists to gain a better
understanding of cell functions and their activation. Being able to control and understand
cell functions is a valuable tool in cell biology and opens new possibilities and
applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine [11, 12]. Furthermore,
external stimulation of cells allows scientists to remotely activate specific cellular
functions, thus enabling, for example, control of the adhesion, proliferation, and
differentiation of cells [13]. There are several types of external stimuli that can be used
1

Anni Eklund

1. INTRODUCTION

to control cell behaviour, for example, electrical, thermal, optical, magnetic, and
biochemical to name a few [13]. Due to their versatile mechanical and chemical
properties, conductive polymers are excellent materials for applying different types of
external stimuli and have been successfully used in bioelectronic devices to externally
control cell functions and activation [14, 15]. For example, by changing the redox state
of a conductive polymer Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate
(PEDOT:PSS) platform, the growth of both human glioblastoma multiforme cells and
primary human dermal fibroblasts could be controlled [16]. The growth was shown to
depend strongly on the redox state of the platform, but it was also dependent on the cell
type, with one growing better on a reduced surface and the other on an oxidized surface.
One method to control cell functions – that utilizes the conductive property of conductive
polymers – is by controlling the conformation of charged biomolecules by changing the
polarity of the potential over the polymer film. External control of the conformation of
charged biomolecules in turn allows for the control of the binding affinity of the
biomolecules to cells, and thus also control of the activation of specific cell functions. By
oxidizing or reducing the polymer film, the charged biomolecules either bend towards or
point away from the surface due to electrostatic interactions between them and the
polymer. Conductive polymer films have already been successfully used to externally
control the conformation of biomolecules, for example, applying a potential over a
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) toluene sulfonate (PEDOT:TOS) film was shown to
induce a change in the conformation of fibronectin, a protein found in extracellular matrix
[17, 18].

1.3 Purpose of the thesis
Currently, within the Organic Electronics group at Åbo Akademi University (ÅAU), a
bioelectronic activation platform for controlling and activating cell functions using gold
as the electrode is being developed. Finding new, cheaper, and more biocompatible
materials for fabricating such platforms is of great interest. Since conductive polymers
are excellent alternatives to use as electrodes in bio applications due to them giving a soft
surface for the biomolecules to attach to, as well as them possessing mixed ion-electron
conductive properties, developing a bioelectronic activation platform using conductive
polymers is intriguing.

1. INTRODUCTION

Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is one of the best
known conductive polymers and it is already widely used in many bioelectronic
applications such as tissue regeneration [19] and neural electrodes [20]. PEDOT:PSS
possesses many excellent properties that are ideal for bioelectronic devices, for example,
not only is it commercially available, it can be fabricated into transparent and flexible
thin films [10, 20, 21], it is a mixed ion-electron conductor with high electric conductivity
[21] and it is biocompatible [8, 19, 22]. Additionally, it is chemically and mechanically
stable and can be fabricated into 3D structures thus making it possible to fabricate
structures that mimic the microenvironment of real tissue [6]. Furthermore, its
morphology and surface properties can easily be modified with additives or by
functionalizing the surface. All these properties make PEDOT:PSS an exciting and
practical material to be used in bioelectronic applications, including for fabricating a
bioelectronic activation platform for controlling cell functions.
The purpose of this thesis was to demonstrate the feasibility of using a transparent and
conductive PEDOT:PSS thin film as a bioelectronic activation platform for potentially
inducing a conformational change in a short peptide sequence with a positive end group.
A comparison between two different PEDOT:PSS solutions, AI4083 and PH1000, was
conducted to see if the PEDOT-to-PSS ratio affected the device performance. Firstly, the
PEDOT:PSS thin film properties were enhanced by the addition of three different
additives in order for the films to be better suited for this specific application. To facilitate
film processing, 4-docdecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) was added to the PEDOT:PSS
solutions; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to enhance the thin film conductivity;
and the crosslinker (3-Glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (GOPS) was added to
increase the film stability. UV-Visible absorption measurements were conducted to see if
the addition of GOPS resulted in the films becoming insoluble in organic solutions.
Secondly, the conductivities of the PEDOT:PSS films were characterized using a standard
four-point probe set-up both before and after bio functionalizing the surfaces with the
peptides to see if the surface conductivity was affected by the biofunctionalization
process. The thicknesses of the films were obtained using an atomic force microscope by
doing a line-measurement analysis. Thirdly, it was demonstrated that functionalizing the
PEDOT:PSS films by silanization resulted in available amine groups on the surfaces. The
number of available amine groups on the different films corresponds to the number of
available binding sites for the peptides and was quantified using a colorimetric assay.

1. INTRODUCTION

Fourthly, the positively charged peptides were immobilized on the films by converting
the available amines to carboxyl groups which were then used to covalently bind with
amine groups in streptavidin. Streptavidin was used as an anchoring point to which the
charged peptides attached by their biotin group. And lastly, to demonstrate that the
PEDOT:PSS films could be used as bioelectronic activation platforms for potentially
inducing a conformational change in the charged peptides, underwater contact angle
measurements were conducted whilst applying a positive or negative potential over the
platforms.
Not only does the results from this work aim to prove the feasibility of using conducting
polymers for potentially controlling the conformation of charged peptides, the thesis also
gives valuable insight into the future studies required to develop and optimize a
bioelectronic activation platform using PEDOT:PSS.

2.1 Charge transport in conductive polymers
2.1.1

The electronic structure

Polymers are built from chains of covalently bound repeat units also known as monomers.
The optical, chemical, and mechanical properties of such polymers depend heavily on the
chemical structure of the monomer(s). These properties can be tailored by changing the
monomer itself or by incorporating side chains to its structure. The monomer units are
made of carbon atoms with the possibility of some additional atoms such as oxygen,
sulphur or nitrogen being a part of the unit. In 𝜋-conjugated polymers, the carbon atoms
are sp2 hybridised, meaning that each carbon atom has three sp2 hybrid orbitals and one
unhybridized pz-orbital. The three sp2 orbitals form 𝜎-bonds, whereas the unhybridized
pz-orbital forms what is known as a 𝜋-bond. The carbon atoms in 𝜋-conjugated polymers
form a backbone of alternating single and double bonds that correspond to a single 𝜎bond, and a 𝜎-bond together with a 𝜋-bond, respectively. The pz-orbitals of the carbon
atoms are perpendicular to the plane of the backbone formed by the 𝜎-bonds which allows
the pz-orbitals of adjacent atoms to overlap with each other, thus forming the 𝜋-bond. The
𝜋-bond in turn allows electrons in the polymer system to become delocalized and move
along the polymer chain. This alternating single and double bond backbone structure is
the key to the conductive properties of conjugated polymers. [23, 24]

2.1.2

Doped conjugated polymers

The band gap, i.e. the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in a molecule determines
how easy it is for charges to be transported in the material. The conductivity (i.e. the
ability to transfer charge) of conjugated polymers is intrinsically small, with innate
conjugated polymers having a band gap in the range of 3 – 6 eV [24]. Conjugated
polymers are due to this classed as semiconductors. Their low ability to transport charges
stems from the orbitals being filled with electrons, which correlates to there being no
room for charges to move along the polymer chain. This issue can be bypassed by doping
the polymer, i.e. by externally changing the number of electrons in the polymer structure
and thus changing the electronic structure of the system. Externally adding electrons to
5

Anni Eklund

2. THEORY

the polymer system is known as n-doping whereas removing electrons from the polymer
system is known as p-doping [23, 24]. Doping the polymer system thus either creates
charges that are free to move along the polymer chain or creates space for the existing
charges in the system to move. Doping conjugated polymers has been reported to reduce
the band gap to 1 – 4 eV [24], which means that the electrons can more easily jump from
the HOMO to the LUMO in doped conjugated polymers. As a result, the charge transport
in the system is easier. Doping occurs when a doping agent is introduced into the polymer
system. The mechanical, electrochemical, and optical properties of the polymer can be
tailored and controlled by the choice of dopant. Using small dopants, e.g. iodine, results
in an unstable doped system since small dopants are mobile within the polymer and can
easily leave the polymer complex. Using large and thus immobile dopants, on the other
hand, results in a more stable doped polymer system.
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)

polystyrene

sulfonate

(PEDOT:PSS),

the

𝜋-

conjugated polymer used in this work, is a polymer blend of EDOT monomers doped
with PSS-. PSS- is a large, anionic polymeric doping agent, which removes an electron
from the backbone of PEDOT thus leaving an electron hole, i.e. positive charge, behind.
This doping process is also called redox doping since the PSS- oxidizes the PEDOT chain.
The redox reaction PEDOT undergoes is the following
PEDOT+ PSS- + M+ + e- ⇌ PEDOT0 + PSS- M+

(1)

When PEDOT is reduced (right-hand side of the equation), M+ cations flow into the
polymer matrix and bind with the anionic PSS-. When oxidizing PEDOT (left-side of the
equation), the cations are released by the PSS- and flow out of the polymer matrix. This
in turn results in an electron to be released from the PEDOT backbone to balance the net
charge of the system. Since PSS- is large and immobile within the polymer matrix, only
the M+ cations are mobile during the redox reaction. The removal of the electron from the
PEDOT backbone creates a hole that is allowed to move more freely along the polymer
backbone. Figure 2.1 shows the PSS- dopant creating a charged centre, i.e. a positive
charge on the PEDOT backbone while simultaneously resulting in a balanced net charge
of the system.

a charged centre on the PEDOT backbone. Figure from [23].

The electron holes diffusing along the PEDOT backbone chain is the mechanism behind
the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Both intra- and interchain transport of holes occur
through a process called hopping. On a macroscopic level, the electron holes travel
between regions with higher mobility, i.e. intermolecularly, through percolation. These
two processes determine how effectively the electron holes are transported within the
polymer system, and thus the conductivity in, for example, a PEDOT:PSS film. The
conductivity of PEDOT:PSS is therefore a combination of both microscopic and
macroscopic charge carrier mobility.

2.1.3

Charge transport in PEDOT:PSS thin films

Although the doped conjugated backbone is the key to the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS,
as described in the chapter above, the charge transport in PEDOT:PSS thin films strongly
depend on the structure and morphology of the film. The widely accepted morphological
model of spin-coated PEDOT:PSS films is a lasagne-like structure of PEDOT-rich cores
(PEDOT:PSS grains) surrounded by a layer of excess PSS [25, 26, 27]. Figure 2.2 depicts
a cross-sectional representation of a spin-coated PEDOT:PSS film based on this model.

2. THEORY

Figure 2.2. Cross-sectional model of the morphology of spin-coated PEDOT:PSS films.
The dark regions represent the PEDOT-rich cores, and the light regions represent the
surrounding excess PSS layer. Figure from [25].

One important parameter that affects the resulting thin film morphology is the ratio of
PEDOT-to-PSS in the solution from which the films are fabricated. It is clear that a higher
ratio of PSS in the solution results in more PSS being present in the spin-coated film.
Therefore, it can be argued that a thicker layer of excess PSS between the PEDOT-rich
cores is formed with increasing PSS content.
Like many 𝜋-conjugated polymers, PEDOT:PSS is considered a mixed ion-electron
conductor, meaning it exhibits both ionic and electronic conductivity [7]. The PEDOTrich cores are known to be electrically conductive whereas the surrounding PSS is known
to be ionically conductive, i.e. electrically more insulating than the PEDOT-rich cores
[28]. It has been reported that an increase in PSS content results in a decrease in the
conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS films. This has been ascribed to be due to a decrease in
the charge carrier mobility in the films, not due to a change in the charge carrier
concentration as a result of the increased PSS content [29].
As mentioned above, the mobility of the electron holes in PEDOT:PSS thin films strongly
depends on the morphology of the films. A thicker layer of PSS between the PEDOT-rich
cores makes percolation more difficult as the PEDOT-rich cores are further away from
each other. Films fabricated from a solution with a PEDOT-to-PSS ratio higher than 1:6
have been reported to behave fully ionically [29]. This implies that the PEDOT-rich cores
are completely isolated from each other and charge transfer through percolation is not
possible. Reducing the PSS content, and therefore the thickness of the excess PSS layer

8

Anni Eklund

2. THEORY

in the resulting film, would make percolation easier and thus increase the conductivity of
the films.
Enhancing the conductivity of polymer thin films is common practise. Although plain
PEDOT:PSS has been reported to have relatively high intrinsic conductivity, it is often
desirable to further enhance its conductivity as much as possible. The most common way
to increase the conductivity of conductive polymers is by adding a secondary dopant (also
called secondary solvent) to the polymer complex. The addition of 5 % v/v dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) has been widely reported to result in an increase in the conductivity
of polymer thin films [19, 28, 30, 31, 32]. The mechanism behind how the addition of a
conductivity enhancer such as DMSO increases the conductivity of polymer films is,
however, still under debate [30]. One possible explanation is that the addition of DMSO
changes the thin film morphology by removing some of the excess PSS layer surrounding
the PEDOT-rich cores and by increasing the size of the PEDOT-rich cores [28, 33, 34].
These changes in the PEDOT:PSS film morphology would make charge transport through
percolation easier, thus increasing the conductivity of the film.
In addition to improving the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS films by adding DMSO, the
film forming properties must be further enhanced for PEDOT:PSS to be used for the
bioelectronic activation platform. Adding 0.25 % v/v 4-docdecylbenzenesulfonic acid
(DBSA) to the PEDOT:PSS solutions is recommended to facilitate film processing during
spin-coating [30, 35]. One of the biggest issues of using plain PEDOT:PSS for the
platform is it being soluble in water-based solutions [36]. It is paramount for the polymer
film to be stable in organic solutions since biofunctionalization of the surface with
biomolecules takes place by incubating the devices in organic solutions. The addition of
1 % v/v (3-Glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (GOPS) has been reported to result in
the PEDOT:PSS thin films becoming insoluble in organic solutions [35]. GOPS is
considered to only react with PSS, thus changing the film morphology and resulting in a
decrease in both the ionic and electrical conductivity. The epoxy ring in the GOPS
molecule is thought to form a bond with a sulfonic acid (SO3H) group in PSS, whereas
the methoxysilane group in GOPS is thought to bond with a hydroxyl (OH) group on the
substrate surface [37]. GOPS therefore functions as a crosslinker between the
PEDOT:PSS and the substrate, fixing the polymer thin film to the substrate, thus resulting
in insoluble thin films.

2.2 Characterization of film conductivity using a four-point probe
The resistivity of a material, i.e. the ability of a material to resist electric current, is an
important factor to take into account when working with any type of bioelectronic
devices. One of the best-known methods to measure this resistivity is with a four-point
probe, also known as the Kelvin technique. Although there are a few different variations
of the four-point probe set-up, the most common is a colinear probe conformation with
equal spacing between each probe. A schematic representation of this set-up can be seen
in figure 2.3.

Figure 2.3. Schematic illustration of a four-point probe with equal probe spacing, s.

By applying a current between the two outer probes, the resulting voltage in the material
can be measured with the two inner probes. The advantage of having two separate probes
measure the voltage, compared to a two-probe set-up, is that the voltage drops occurring
in the wires and in the probe-to-surface contacts can be eliminated [38, 39, 40]. The
probes are usually fabricated from materials with high impedances, and as a result, no
current flows through the inner probes. The only resistance that is measured is thus the
resistance in the material between the two inner probes.
The four-point probe method can be used to determine the resistivity of thin polymer
films. The geometry of the set-up and the sample must be well-known for an accurate
calculation of the resistivity. Here, how to calculate the resistivity of a square sample with
an equally spaced colinear probe arrangement is considered. The polymer film is also
assumed to be homogenous over the whole sample surface. For a more extensive view on
how different geometries and how an anisotropic film affects the resistivity, the reader is
referred to [40].

where 𝑡 is the thickness of the film, 𝑉 the potential and 𝐼 the current. The current-voltage
(I-V) characteristics of the films are obtained by measuring the voltage over the two inner
probes with varying current applied on the two outer probes using the four-point probe.
𝐹1 , 𝐹2 and 𝐹3 are correction factors that take into account the sample geometry and
position with respect to the probes. In the case of an anisotropic film, additional correction
factors are required.
The first correction factor, 𝐹1 , considers the film thickness and depends on the boundary
type between the substrate and the film that is measured. This correction must be taken
into account if the film thickness is on the same order as the probe spacing. If the bottom
boundary, i.e. the substrate on which the polymer film has been deposited, is insulating,
the correction factor is given by
𝐹11 =

If the bottom boundary is conductive, on the other hand, 𝐹1 is given by
𝐹12 =

The second correction factor, 𝐹2 , considers the placement of the probes with respect to
the sample edge. This correction factor is obtained mathematically by considering
hypothetical image probes outside the sample surface. How the correction factor changes
as a function of the relation d/s between the distance of the probes to a nonconducting
sample edge, d, and the probe spacing, s, can be seen in figure 2.4 below. The correction
factor takes a value between 0.5 and 1 depending on the probe alignment, i.e.
perpendicular or parallel, with respect to the edge. In both cases, however, it approaches
unity when the probes are positioned from the sample edge a distance of at least four
times the probe spacing.

by the probe spacing, d/s. The solid curve refers to the perpendicular arrangement,
whereas the dashed curve refers to the probes being parallel to the sample edge. Figure
from [40].

The third correction factor, 𝐹3 , considers the finite width of the sample. Its value differs
for square, rectangular and circular samples as a function of the sample width (or diameter
for circular samples) divided by the probe spacing. Figure 2.5 shows the correction factor,
𝐹3 , of a square sample.
The resistivity of a homogenous polymer thin film, given in Ω.m, can now be obtained
using the above-mentioned correction factors and equation (2). The conductivity, 𝜎, of
the film, given in S/m, is then simply obtained as the inverse of the resistivity

𝜎=

Since calculating the correction factors can be tedious, it is common to use mathematical
programmes that automatically calculate the resistivity and conductivity of a film based
on the film thickness, sample geometry and probe set-up used.

2.3 PEDOT:PSS thin films as bioelectronic activation platforms
2.3.1 Principle and working mechanism
The PEDOT:PSS bioelectronic activation platform is composed of a substrate on which
a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS has been deposited by spin-coating. Spin-coating is an easy
and fast deposition method that enables the fabrication of thin films of different thickness
by varying the spin-speed. Although spin-coating is easy to use, one disadvantage of the
method is the difficulty of controlling the deposition and thus obtaining homogenous
films is challenging [44]. After drying the deposited film to remove excess water, the
PEDOT:PSS film is functionalized by silanization to cover the surface with alkoxysilane
groups possessing a terminal amine group. The amine groups of the alkoxysilane are then
chemically converted to carboxyl groups using succinic anhydride. The protein
streptavidin is then attached to the activated carboxyl groups and all unbonded carboxyl
groups are blocked by ethanol amine. Lastly, a short peptide sequence

referred to as SV1 – composing of a group of positively charged amino acids in one end

and a biotin molecule in the other end – is anchored to the streptavidin by its biotin

Figure 2.6. Structure of the PEDOT:PSS activation platform. Note that the figure is not
to scale.

The working principle behind the PEDOT:PSS bioelectronic activation platform is the
ability to utilize the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS to regulate the surface potential of the
biofunctionalized film. By oxidizing PEDOT:PSS the backbone is made positive,
whereas by reducing PEDOT:PSS the backbone becomes negatively charged. Oxidizing
and reducing the polymer also changes the surface potential of the film. Having a
PEDOT:PSS film with high conductivity is therefore paramount to obtain a uniform
potential distribution over the whole platform surface. The surface potential in turn can
change the conformation of the charged peptides by electrostatic interactions. This
mechanism has already been demonstrated to work on gold electrodes functionalized with
RGD peptides that possess a positively charged end group [45]. By applying a negative
or positive potential over the gold electrode, the conformation of the RGD peptides was
successfully switched between a linear and cyclic conformation. The electrostatic
interaction between the charged end group and the gold surface was argued to be the cause
of the change in the conformation of the RGD peptides. The positively charged platform
repelled the positively charged end groups, whereas the negatively charged platform
attracted the end groups towards the surface, thus bending the peptide backbone into a
cyclic conformation. Furthermore, it was argued that this electrostatic modulation should
be applicable to other peptides with a charged end group. Similar electrochemical
switching of biomolecule conformation has also been demonstrated by others [17, 18, 46,
47]. The positively charged peptide used in this work should therefore hypothetically be
14

capable of undergoing a conformational change upon switching the polarity of the
potential over the PEDOT:PSS film as demonstrated in figure 2.7 below.

2.3.2 Demonstration of conformational change using underwater contact angle
measurements
By applying a positive or negative potential over the PEDOT:PSS film to which the SV1
peptide has been immobilized, the electrostatic interaction between the film and the
positively charged peptide end group bends the peptide either towards or away from the
surface. To demonstrate this potentially induced conformational change, underwater
contact angle measurements can be utilized. The PEDOT:PSS platform is placed in an
electrolyte solution and a drop of dichloromethane (DCM), a nonpolar oil, is placed on
the surface. The angle the drop makes with the surface at the point where the oil drop, the
electrolyte, and the film surface are connected, is called the contact angle. This angle
changes based on the surface wettability of the biofunctionalized polymer film. The
principle behind this measurement is therefore the change in the surface wettability as a
result of a change in the conformation of the peptides. The end group in the peptide
sequence used here consists of Arginine amino groups, which are due to their positive
charge hydrophilic [48]. The hydrophilic end group of the peptide sequence therefore
affects the surface wettability of the platform when the peptide is either bent up (repelled
from the polymer film) or bent down (attracted towards the polymer film). When the
surface is more hydrophilic, i.e. oleophobic, the contact angle of the oil droplet is larger
than when the surface is more hydrophobic, i.e. oleophilic. The conformation of the

15

peptide with the hydrophilic end group therefore should affect the contact angle of the oil
drop by changing the surface wettability as is demonstrated schematically in figure 2.8.

Figure 2.8. Schematic representation of the change in contact angle of the DCM oil drop
as a response to the change in the peptide conformation.

As is demonstrated in figure 2.8, the contact angle, 𝜃, of the oil drop is higher for an
oxidized surface compared to the contact angle of the drop on a reduced surface. When
oxidizing the PEDOT:PSS film, the peptide end group is repelled from the positive
surface, standing straight up thus making the surface more hydrophilic, i.e. oleophobic.
When reducing the PEDOT:PSS film, the hydrophilic end group is attracted towards the
negative film surface, hiding the hydrophilic part and making the surface more
hydrophobic, i.e. oleophilic.
Instead of using contact angle in degrees to analyse the surface wettability, and thus the
conformational change, it is useful to calculate the corresponding surface tension of the
film. The surface tension, 𝛾, measures the strength of the attractive molecular interaction
at the surface required to keep the shape of the DCM drop intact. The surface tension is
therefore related to the surface area that the oil drop makes on the film surface, which in
turn is related to the contact angle that the drop makes with the surface. A high surface
tension results in a strong attractive force that can pull the drop down towards the surface.
This corresponds to the drop being flatter on the surface, and the contact angle small. The
surface tension of the film is thus higher than the surface tension of the drop. In contrast,
a small surface tension results in the drop being able to resist the attractive forces from
the film surface, thus keeping its shape and only having a small contact area with the
surface. This corresponds to a larger contact angle.

2. THEORY

The surface tension depends on the interfacial tension between the oil drop, the
electrolyte, and the film. In a solid-liquid-liquid system, as is the system used in this work,
the Bartell-Osterhof equation is used to calculate the relation between the contact angle
and the surface tension [49]. The change in surface tension between two states is given
by
′
∆𝛾 = 𝛾𝑜𝑙 (cos 𝜃𝑜𝑙
− cos 𝜃𝑜𝑙 )

(4)

Where 𝛾𝑜𝑙 = 26.54 ± 0.51 mN m-1 is the interfacial tension between the DCM oil drop
′
and the liquid, i.e. the electrolyte solution [49]. 𝜃𝑜𝑙
and 𝜃𝑜𝑙 are the contact angles

measured in two different states of the system, e.g. before and after a potential has been
applied over the platform. This way the change in the surface tension between these two
states can be calculated. A decrease in the contact angle corresponds to an increase in the
surface tension compared to the initial state. Based on the hypothesis for the working
mechanism of this platform, an increase in the surface tension would correspond to the
surface becoming more oleophilic and thus the peptides would be bent towards the film
surface, hiding their hydrophilic end groups. By comparing the surface wettability when
reducing and oxidizing the PEDOT:PSS film, with respect to when no potential is applied,
the conformational change in the peptides can thus be demonstrated.

3. Materials and experimental methods
3.1 Platform fabrication
3.1.1 PEDOT:PSS solutions
Two different PEDOT:PSS solutions, AI4083 and PH1000, were purchased from Ossila.
AI4083 was already available in the lab, since it had previously been used for fabricating
solar cells, PH1000 was ordered specifically for this project.
The PEDOT:PSS solutions were first filtered using a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
0.45 µm filter to remove aggregates, and the filtered PEDOT:PSS was used immediately
for the samples fabricated from plain PEDOT:PSS. Samples made from the plain, filtered
PEDOT:PSS solutions are referred to as plain AI4083 and plain PH1000 in the rest of the
thesis.
For the samples used in the stability measurements, 1 % v/v (3- Glycidyloxypropyl)
trimethoxysilane (GOPS) was mixed in the plain filtered PEDOT:PSS solutions. The
mixture was then stirred on a magnetic stirrer at 900 rpm for at least 30 minutes before
use.
Three different chemicals: 1 % v/v (3-Glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (GOPS),
5 % v/v dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 0.25 % v/v 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid
(DBSA) were added to the filtered PEDOT:PSS solutions to enhance the thin film
properties. These PEDOT:PSS mixtures were also stirred on a magnetic stirrer at 900 rpm
for at least 30 minutes before use. The samples fabricated from these solutions are
referred to as PH1000:chem and AI4083:chem in the rest of the thesis.

3.1.2 Platform fabrication process
Two different materials, microscope glass and indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass slides,
were used as substrates for the PEDOT:PSS solutions. The ITO substrates (CEC010S)
were purchased from Präzisions Glas & Optik GmbH, Germany, and the microscope glass
(Menzel-Gläser) from Thermo Scientific. The thickness of the ITO layer was reported as
180 nm.

18

Anni Eklund

3. MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

Square substrates of size 2.56 x 2.56 cm were used for the UV/Vis/NIR and four-point
probe measurements. Substrates of size 2.56 x 1.2 cm were used for the quantification of
the available amine groups analysis to maximize the sample area with respect to the
solution required to cover the samples. Small substrates of size 1.2 x 1.2 cm were used
for the biofunctionalization and c-AFM analysis. For the underwater contact angle
measurements, samples of size 2.56 x 0.8 cm were used.
After cutting the substrates to the desired sizes using a diamond cutter, the substrates were
cleaned by following an established protocol. The substrates were first washed with
ethanol or soap-water and then ultrasonically cleaned in deionized water (DI-water),
acetone, and isopropanol, 10 minutes in each solution at 60oC. The substrates were then
rinsed with DI-water before being dried under a nitrogen flow. The samples made from
plain glass and plain ITO were stored in room temperature in sealed petri dishes until use.
The PEDOT:PSS solutions were deposited on the cleaned and dried substrates by spincoating at 5000 rpm for 45 seconds with an acceleration of 2500 rpm/s in order to obtain
thin PEDOT:PSS films. Prior to spin-coating, the substrates were ozone cleaned for
5 minutes in an UV-Ozone cleaner (UVC-1014, NanoBioAnalytics). For the thickness
and conductivity analysis, films spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 45 seconds with an
acceleration of 1250 rpm/s were also fabricated. Approximately 200 µl of solution was
used for the biggest substrates, 100 µl for the medium-sized, 60 µl for the smallest
substrates, as well as for the samples used in the underwater contact angle measurements.
After spin-coating, the samples were immediately dried by annealing on a hotplate in air.
For the crosslinking effect to occur when adding GOPS, annealing the polymer thin films
at 140oC for one hour was required. All spin-coated films were annealed the same way to
keep the annealing time and temperature consistent for all samples. Prior to annealing,
the PEDOT:PSS films of the samples made for the thickness analysis were scratched with
a soft plastic tip to create a cut in the polymer films. Post annealing, the samples were left
to cool to room temperature and then stored in sealed petri dishes until use.

3.2 Experimental methods
3.2.1 Stability of PEDOT:PSS films in organic solutions
UV-Vis scanning measurements were conducted in air using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900
UV/Vis/NIR spectrometer to determine if the addition of 1 % v/v (3-Glycidyloxypropyl)
trimethoxysilane (GOPS) would result in the polymer thin films to become insoluble in
organic solutions. The data interval was set to 1 nm and the slit width was set to 2 nm.
The UV-Vis absorption spectrums were recorded from 1600 – 200 nm (0.77 – 6.20 eV).
In this analysis, PEDOT:PSS films fabricated on glass substrates were used (the choice
of substrate was not considered to have an effect on the film stability), and therefore, plain
cleaned glass was used for the baseline reading. Samples with plain AI4083 and plain
PH1000, as well as samples with AI4083 and PH1000 mixed with 1 % v/v GOPS, were
analysed. Two samples of each version were incubated first 2 hours in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and two samples in N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), respectively. After
incubation the samples were quickly rinsed in DI-water and dried under a nitrogen flow
before the UV-Vis measurements. The same incubated samples were then placed back in
PBS and DMF for further incubation for 22 hours, after which the UV-Vis scanning was
repeated to see how long-term incubation affected the films. The scanning was also
conducted on two samples of each version that had not been incubated in the organic
solutions. These samples were used as a reference. The absorbance spectra of the
incubated and not-incubated samples were compared to see how incubation in PBS and
DMF, as well as the addition of GOPS, affected the films. The results and discussion of
these measurements can be found in chapter 4, section 4.1.

3.2.2 Conductivity measurements
The conductivities of plain ITO and of two different film thicknesses of both
PH1000:chem and AI4083:chem (spin-coating performed at 5000 rpm or 2500 rpm on
glass substrates) were measured using a four-point probe set-up together with a Keithley
4200 SourceMeter (both seen in figure 3.1). The four probes were separated by an equal
spacing of 1.82 mm and were aligned colinearly. The conductivities of PH1000:chem
films (spin-coated at 5000 rpm) were also measured after the films had been
biofunctionalized as described in section 3.2.5 below.

Anni Eklund

3. MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

The current applied to the samples were adjusted for each type of sample. The highest
current, ranging from 0.1 mA to 1.0 mA, was applied to the plain ITO and the
PH1000:chem samples spin-coated at 2500 rpm. For the PH1000:chem films spin-coated
at 5000 rpm a current ranging from 0.01 mA to 0.1 mA was applied, whereas a current
ranging from 0.1 µA to 1.0 µA was applied to the AI4083:chem samples spin-coated at
2500 rpm. The lowest current, ranging from 0.01 µA to 0.1 µA, was applied on the
AI4083:chem samples spin-coated at 5000 rpm. In all cases, the current was applied in
ten steps and the resulting voltages over the films were measured. An average of the
current-voltage relation was then calculated separately for all sample types, and these
values were then used for calculating the conductivity with a LabVIEW programme
specifically designed for this set-up. The results of these measurements can be found in
chapter 4, section 4.3.

Figure 3.1. The Keithley Source Meter (left) and the four-point probe station (right) used
to measure the current-voltage relation of the PEDOT:PSS:chem films and ITO.

In addition to using a four-point probe set-up to measure the conductivity of the films, a
conductive Atomic Force Microscope (c-AFM) was also used to characterize the surface
conductivity on a macro-and nanoscopic level. Three types of samples were measured:
plain ITO, plain PH1000 spin-coated at 5000 rpm on ITO and PH1000:chem spin-coated
at 5000 rpm on ITO. The c-AFM measurements were conducted to see how the surface
conductivity of the PH1000:chem films differed from the plain PH1000 films and plain
ITO. All measurements were conducted with a scan size of 2 µm, with 1024 pixels on

each line, a scan rate of 2 Hz and a scan angle of 90o. For all samples a 500 mV DC bias
was applied between the conductive probe and the sample surface. The room temperature
varied between 20-25oC and the room humidity between 38-45% during the
measurements. The c-AFM machine can be seen in figure 3.2 below.

3.2.3 Characterization of the film thickness
The thicknesses of the PEDOT:PSS films were measured using an Atomic Force
Microscope (AFM, diCaliber Vecco 2020). The height difference between the polymer
film and the underlying substrate, created by making a cut in the film prior to annealing,
was measured in tapping mode after which a line measurement analysis was used to
obtain the film thickness. The thicknesses of the films were measured on 2-3 samples of
each type on several places on each sample. For each sample type the average and the
standard deviation of the thickness was then calculated. The results can be found in
chapter 4, section 4.2.

3.2.4 Quantification of available amine groups
The number of available amine groups on the sample surfaces was quantified for plain
ITO, plain glass, as well as for PH1000:chem and AI4083:chem films spin-coated at
5000 rpm on glass substrates. The quantification was conducted by utilizing a
colorimetric strategy, known as 4-NBA assay. A total of 10 pieces of each sample type
was used for the quantification to maximize the surface area with respect to the solution
required to cover the samples.
After cleaning and drying with nitrogen gas, the plain ITO and glass samples were UVOzone cleaned for 5 minutes (a step that was omitted for the samples with the
PEDOT:PSS films) before all sample types were placed in separate glass jars in a 2 %
APTES/ethanol ((3- Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane, 99% absolute ethanol) solution. This
process is known as silanization as it uses a silane for the functionalization. In this step,
amine groups attached to hydroxyl groups on the surfaces of the samples. The samples
were left to incubate in the APTES/ethanol solution at room temperature under gentle
stirring (~125 rpm) for 2 hours after which they were rinsed three times by dipping in
absolute ethanol and then dried with nitrogen.
The samples were then placed in a solution of 10 mg 4-nitrobenzoic acid (4-NBA), 25 ml
absolute ethanol and 20 µl acetic acid to incubate under nitrogen atmosphere in an oven
at 50oC for 3 hours after which they were again rinsed in absolute ethanol and dried with
nitrogen. In this step, 4-NBA molecules attached to the amine groups on the surface at a
1:1 ratio. Lastly, the samples were incubated in 10 ml of hydrolysis solution (200 µl acetic
acid mixed with 100 ml DI-water) in an oven at 30oC for 1 hour during which the 4-NBA
molecules detached from the surfaces into the hydrolysis solution. The absorptions of the
hydrolysis solutions were then measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer to determine
the absorption of 4-NBA (peak at 270 nm) and thus obtain the concentration of detached
4-NBA in the hydrolysis solutions. In all measurements, quartz cuvettes were used which
were washed and dried between each measurement. The UV-Vis absorption spectra were
measured from 600-200 nm and plain hydrolysis solution was used for the baseline
reading.
In addition to the 10 pieces of each of the four types of samples mentioned above, two
reference samples of each type were also fabricated. For these samples, functionalization

23

Anni Eklund

3. MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

by silanization (i.e. incubation in the APTES/ethanol solution) was omitted to see if it
would affect the number of available amine groups on the surfaces.
The absorption of 0.4 µM, 0.6 µM, 0.8 µM, 1.0 µM, 2.0 µM, 4.0 µM, 6.0 µM and 8.0 µM
4-NBA dissolved in hydrolysis solution was also measured to obtain a calibration curve
of 4-NBA absorbance as a function of concentration. This was then used to determine the
concentration of detached 4-NBA for the four sample types incubated in hydrolysis. The
results and discussion of these measurements can be found in chapter 4, section 4.4.

3.2.5 Biofunctionalization of the PEDOT:PSS films
After fabricating PEDOT:PSS:chem thin films following standard protocol, the samples
were incubated in glass jars in a 2 % APTES/ethanol ((3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane,
99% absolute ethanol) solution to obtain amine groups on the surfaces. The samples were
left to incubate in this solution at room temperature under gentle stirring (~125 rpm) for
2 hours after which they were rinsed three times by dipping in absolute ethanol and then
three times in N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF). After rinsing in DMF, the samples were
placed in a 5 mgml-1 succinic anhydride (SA) and DMF solution. First the samples were
placed in 40 ml of DMF where they were left for 20 minutes before adding a solution of
250 mg SA dissolved in 10 ml DMF. The glass jars were covered with a loose lid and
placed in a nitrogen chamber for overnight incubation (~16 hours) under nitrogen
atmosphere. In this step, carboxyl groups attached to the available amine groups on the
surface which had been obtained after incubating the samples in the APTES-solution.
After overnight incubation in the SA/DMF solution, the attached carboxyl groups were
activated by carbodiimide crosslinking. First, the samples were rinsed by dipping in DMF
and filtered DI-water, respectively, after which they were incubated in a 1-ethyl-3(3- Dimethylaminopropyl(carbodiimide)/ N-Hydroxysuccinimide (0.1 M EDC/ 0.05 M
NHS) solution for 30 minutes at room temperature. The EDC/NHS solutions were
prepared by mixing 21.5 mg NHS and 76.5 mg EDC into 2 ml filtered DI-water. For the
chemicals to fully dissolve in the filtered DI-water, the solution was left to stand for
5 minutes in room temperature before being added to the samples. For every sample, for
both the conductivity and for the underwater contact angle measurements, 2 ml of
solution was enough to fully cover the sample surface.

Anni Eklund

3. MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

After 30 minutes of incubation in the EDC/NHS solution, the samples were rinsed by
dipping in filtered DI-water and then in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The
biologically highly active protein streptavidin was then attached to the activated carboxyl
groups. The working concentration of the streptavidin was 100 µgml-1 in PBS and a total
of 2 ml solution was needed for each sample. The samples were left to incubate in the
streptavidin/PBS solution for 2 hours at room temperature during which the streptavidin
attached to the activated carboxyl groups. After streptavidin attachment, the remaining
unbound carboxyl groups were blocked by ethanol amine (EA) by first rinsing the
samples in PBS and then placing them in an EA/PBS solution (195 mg EA in 2 ml PBS)
to incubate for 1 hour at room temperature.
The samples used for the conductivity measurements were then rinsed with PBS and DIwater before being left to dry in a laminar flow hood. The conductivities of the samples
were measured immediately after the samples had dried. The samples used as control
samples in the underwater contact angle measurements were rinsed with PBS and then
stored in PBS in the fridge before use.
For the samples used in the underwater contact angle measurements, the last
biofunctionalization

step

involved

binding

a

peptide

sequence

(RRRVRRRGSGSRVTCDDYYYGFGCNKFCRPRGSGSGSGSGSK-BIOTIN), to the
streptavidin by the peptide’s biotin-molecule. The peptide sequence, referred to as SV1
in the thesis, has a positive end group (underlined in the sequence), which is hydrophilic.
The working concentration of SV1 was 500 nM and for a final volume of 500 µl of SV1,
6.08 µl of SV1 from a 200 µgml-1 solution was mixed with 494 µl PBS. The samples were
left to incubate for 2 hours at room temperature before being rinsed with PBS. All
biofunctionalized samples were stored in PBS in the fridge and were used within three
days in the underwater contact angle measurements.

3.2.6 Underwater contact angle measurements
To see if the PEDOT:PSS films could be used to potentially induce a conformational
change in the positively charged peptides, static underwater contact angle measurements
were conducted using a C205 Attention Theta Optical Microscopy measurement unit
from Biolinscientific. The set-up of the measurement and the measurement unit can be
seen in figures 3.3 and 3.4 below.

3. MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

The measurements were conducted using a three-electrode set-up. The working electrode
(WE) was the polymer platform itself (PH1000:chem films on ITO substrates). The
surface potential of the polymer film was changed by applying a potential with a
potentiostat (Autolab PGTSTAT101, purchased from Metrohm, software Nova 2.1) that
was connected to a gold probe which in turn was in contact with the film. The gold probe
also fixed the working electrode on the bottom of the box (a transparent plastic box),
keeping it in place during the measurements. The counter electrode (CE) used was a thin
platinum wire and the reference electrode (RE) was a double junction Ag/AgCl electrode
with the inner liquid being kalium chloride (KCl) and outer liquid potassium nitrate
(PNO3). The reference electrode was purchased from Metrohm. The oil used, which
contact angle on the surface was measured, was dichloromethane (DCM) and a 2 μl drop
was added in all measurements. The electrolyte used was a 0.1 M solution of sodium
nitrate (NaNO3) in DI-water.
In order to see the electrochemical window, i.e. the potential range that could be applied
on the samples without inducing an irreversible redox reaction in the polymer films,
cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted. The cyclic voltammograms
were scanned from – 0.4 V to + 0.2 V for 5 cycles with a scan rate of 50 mVs-1. The CVs
were scanned in the 0.1 M sodium nitrate electrolyte with the same three-electrode set-up
as described above. Figure 3.5 below shows the cyclic voltammograms of plain ITO and
a PH1000:chem film on an ITO substrate.

Figure 3.5. CV of plain ITO (left) and PH1000:chem on ITO (right) scanned from – 0.4V
to + 0.2V vs Ag/AgCl, with a scan rate of 50 mVs-1.

Anni Eklund

3. MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

The CVs show that the charging current is higher for the PH1000:chem sample, implying
that the PEDOT:PSS film is able to accept more charge during the CV sweep than the
plain ITO film. Based on the CV and visual inspection of the samples after the CV was
measured, the two end potentials, – 0.4 V and + 0.2 V, were chosen as the negative and
positive potentials to be applied to the biofunctionalized PH1000:chem platforms,
respectively. The CV curves clearly show that no redox peaks are present within this
potential range and thus no irreversible redox reactions occur in the films. Moreover,
visual inspection of the samples showed that no colour change occurred as a result of
applying these potentials, an issue which had previously been noted when applying a
– 0.4 V and + 0.4 V on the samples.
For the underwater

contact

angle measurements,

PH1000:chem

thin films

biofunctionalized with the SV1 peptides were used. As a reference, underwater contact
angle measurements were also conducted on PH1000:chem films where the bonding of
the peptide was omitted. These samples worked as a control to see if the charged peptides
on the surface affected the contact angle when applying a positive or negative potential
over the platform, respectively. For both sample types, ITO was used as the substrate.
Prior to measuring the contact angle, the samples, the transparent plastic box, and the
electrodes were rinsed with the electrolyte solution. The first trial measurements showed
that the contact angle did not change when switching the polarity of the potential over the
same sample. Therefore, applying only one type of potential on each sample was
considered to be the best way forward to get an understanding of how the polarity of the
potential over the PH1000:chem film affected the peptides and the surface wettability.
The underwater contact angle measurements were conducted as following: firstly, the
contact angles of two oil droplets when no potential was applied over the surface were
measured (drop1_0V and drop2_0V). Secondly, either a positive (+ 0.2 V) or negative
(– 0.4 V) potential was applied over the platform for 50 seconds until the current had
stabilized. The contact angle of the two first drops were then measured again (drop1_V
and drop2_V) to see if any change in the contact angle had occurred after applying the
potential. Thirdly, up to four additional drops were placed on the platform surface and the
contact angles measured consecutively (drop3_V, drop4_V, drop5_V and drop6_V). The
first DCM drop was always placed at the left edge of the sample, as far away from the
gold probe as possible. Figure 3.6 below shows the DCM drops in the electrolyte.

4. Results and discussion
4.1 Stability of PEDOT:PSS films in organic solutions
Despite the fact that plain PEDOT:PSS exhibits several excellent properties, using it
without further modification for fabricating a bioelectronic activation platform is
impossible. One of the biggest issues of using plain PEDOT:PSS thin films in bio
applications is the films dissolving in water-based solutions [36]. The importance of the
polymer films to be insoluble in organic solutions is indisputable since using different
organic solutions is crucial when working with biomolecules. The addition of 1 % v/v (3Glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (GOPS) has been reported to result in PEDOT:PSS
thin films becoming insoluble in organic solutions [35]. A smaller amount of GOPS, e.g.
0.1 % v/v has also been reported to result in insoluble polymer films [37], but since
optimization of the chemical concentrations was not a focus in this work, a 1 % v/v
addition of GOPS was used to ensure that a long-term film stability in organic solutions
was obtained.
For this specific application, it was paramount that the PEDOT:PSS thin films were stable
and insoluble in the organic solutions PBS and DMF since both of these solutions were
used during the biofunctionalization process, i.e. the process where the charged peptides
were attached to the film surface. How the addition of the crosslinker GOPS affected the
PEDOT:PSS film stability in PBS and DMF was investigated using UV-Vis absorption
measurements. The absorption of plain AI4083 and plain PH1000 films, i.e. when no
GOPS was added to the polymer solution, as well as the absorption of films fabricated
from AI4083 and PH1000 mixed with 1 % v/v GOPS, were measured both before and
after incubation in PBS and DMF for 2 and 24 hours. Figure 4.1 shows the absorbance of
AI4083 films with and without GOPS before and after incubation in PBS for 2 hours. A
five-point adjacent-averaging smoothing was done in Origin to remove some of the noise
from the absorbance.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 4.1. Absorbance of AI4083 polymer films with and without GOPS both before
and after 2 h incubation in PBS. Note the change in the scale in the two graphs.

From figure 4.1 it is evident that incubating plain AI4083 films in PBS decreases the
absorbance significantly. This indicates that a drastic change occurs in the plain film
during incubation. While absorbance is a measure of how much the sample, i.e. the
polymer film, absorbs the incident light, transmittance is a measure of how much of the
incident light passes through the sample and is more often used when analysing material
properties. The transmittances for all the samples were estimated from the measured
absorbance using the following equation
𝑇 = 10−𝐴𝑏𝑠.

(5)

The amount of the incident light that was reflected from the samples was considered not
to have a significant effect and was therefore omitted. To see the small changes in
transmittance occurring in the polymer films upon incubation in PBS or DMF, or when
adding GOPS to the PEDOT:PSS solutions, a difference-spectrum was calculated for
each PEDOT:PSS type by using the equation

−

∆𝑇
𝑇

=−

𝑇−𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓
𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓

(6)

The difference in transmittance was obtained by subtracting the transmittance of the plain,
unincubated PEDOT:PSS films, 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓 , with the transmittance of the films with GOPS or
the incubated films, i.e. the other sample types, 𝑇. The transmittance of the plain,
unincubated film functions as a reference transmittance to which all the other
transmittances are compared. A negative difference indicates that more of the incident
light passes through the sample, whereas no change indicates that the same amount of
31

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

light passes through the sample, and thus no change has occurred in the film. The
difference spectrum for the AI4083 and PH1000 films can be seen in figure 4.2 and figure
4.3, respectively. In both graphs a five-point adjacent averaging was done in Origin to
remove some of the noise from the spectra.

unincubated AI4083 films used as reference.

Figure 4.3. Difference spectrum of the PH1000 polymer films. Transmittance of plain
unincubated PH1000 films used as reference.

In figure 4.2, a substantial, negative difference in transmittance can be seen for the plain
AI4083 films that were incubated in PBS or DMF. This indicates that more of the incident
light passes through these samples in comparison to the reference sample (i.e. the plain,
unincubated AI4083 film). In other words, there is less film that can absorb the incoming
light after incubation. In addition, it is clear that the difference in transmittance of the
AI4083 films with GOPS both with and without incubating in PBS or DMF remains close
to zero. This indicates two things: (i) the addition of GOPS does not change the
32

Anni Eklund

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

transmittance of the films significantly compared to the plain AI4083 films, and (ii) the
addition of GOPS results in stable films since no change in the amount of light that passes
through the films is seen after incubating the films in PBS or DMF. Figure 4.3 shows
similar results for the PH1000 films. Again, it is clear that without adding GOPS into the
polymer solution the resulting films are greatly affected by incubation in both PBS and
DMF. By adding GOPS to the PH1000 solution, stable and insoluble thin films are
obtained.
The UV-Vis absorption measurements conducted on samples with GOPS after a 24-hour
incubation in PBS or DMF showed no significant difference in the transmittance
compared to the plain unincubated films. This further proved that the addition of the
crosslinker into the PEDOT:PSS solution results in stable and insoluble films even after
24 hours of incubation. This is in good agreement with previously reported studies and
paramount for the PEDOT:PSS films to be used as bioelectronic activation platforms.

4.2 Thickness analysis
The thicknesses of the two PEDOT:PSS films, AI4083:chem and PH1000:chem, were
compared by preparing samples with two different spin speeds, 5000 rpm and 2500 rpm.
The results of the thickness analysis are summarized in table 4.1 below.
One drawback in the method used to determine the thickness, i.e. making a cut in the
polymer films prior to annealing, is the possibility of some of the solution spreading back
into the cut before the films dried completely. This issue was noted during the linemeasurement analysis, as a clear step in the height between the substrate and the polymer
surface could not be seen. Instead, the analysis showed a slope between the height of the
substrate and the polymer film. For comparison, table 4.1 also includes the expected
thicknesses of each PEDOT:PSS type when spin-coating plain PEDOT:PSS solutions
(values obtained from Ossila’s product description) to ensure that the obtained values of
the thicknesses for the PEDOT:PSS:chem films were reasonable. For a more accurate
thickness analysis, measurements on more than three samples are required as well as
finding another method of creating a cut in the polymer films. Creating a cut postannealing proved not to work, however, since making the cut using a soft plastic tip did
not result in the surface being scratched enough and using a harder material to make the

33

Anni Eklund

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

cut would possibly also cut the underlying substrate, thus creating a larger height
difference resulting in an overestimation of the film thickness.

As expected, thicker films were obtained by spin-coating at 2500 rpm compared to spincoating at 5000 rpm. For both PEDOT:PSS types, the thicker films showed a larger
difference in the homogeneity of the thickness, both between samples and on different
places on the same sample, as can be seen from the calculated standard deviations. This
indicates that spin-coating at 5000 rpm results in films that exhibit a more uniform
distribution over the substrate surface, which is important for the performance of the
platform. The most notable deviation was seen for the PH1000:chem films spin-coated at
2500 rpm which were also visibly the thickest. The PH1000:chem samples spin-coated at
5000 rpm showed the best homogeneity with respect to the thickness.
The PH1000:chem films were also clearly thicker than the corresponding AI4083:chem
samples spin-coated at the same speed, which was also expected based on the values for
the thickness of the plain PEDOT:PSS solutions reported by Ossila. This difference can
be ascribed to be due to the difference in viscosity of the two PEDOT:PSS solutions.
According to Ossila’s product information, AI4083 has a viscosity of 5-12 mPa.s, whereas
PH1000 has a viscosity of < 50 mPa.s [28]. The PH1000 solution is thus much more
viscose than the AI4083 solution, which results in thicker films when spin-coating.
The results from the thickness analysis also show that the PEDOT:PSS:chem films are
thicker than the corresponding plain PEDOT:PSS films. A 20 % increase in the film

34

Anni Eklund

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

thickness in AI4083:chem films spin-coated at 2500 rpm and a 43 % increase in the film
thickness in AI4083:chem spin-coated at 5000 rpm compared to plain AI4083 films spincoated at the same speeds was noted. The same trend was also seen for the PH1000:chem
films with a 50 % increase for PH1000:chem spin-coated at 2500 rpm and a 25 % increase
for PH1000:chem spin-coated at 5000 rpm with respect to the thickness of the
corresponding plain PH1000 films. Since all versions of the PEDOT:PSS:chem films
followed the same trend, i.e. were thicker than the corresponding plain PEDOT:PSS
films, the obtained thicknesses are assumed to be within a reasonable accuracy and were
used to calculate the conductivity of the films.

4.3 Conductivity analysis
To ensure a homogenous potential distribution over the bioelectronic activation platform,
it is important that the PEDOT:PSS films possess high conductivity. PEDOT:PSS is
known to have high conductivity, with some even reporting obtaining conductivities in
the range of ITO (400 000 S/m) by treating the films with sulfuric acid after deposition
[50]. In bio applications, however, the biocompatibility of the films is important and
therefore post-treatment with sulfuric acid, a strong and corrosive acid, is not a viable
option to increase the conductivity since it is detrimental for biomaterial [30]. Many have
reported that the addition of the conductivity enhancer dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
increases the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS films without harming biomolecules [19,
28, 30, 51]. Since it has been widely reported that the addition of DMSO increases the
electrical conductivity in polymer films, no measurements to specifically prove this was
done in this work. This was also partly because the I-V characteristics of the films
fabricated from plain PEDOT:PSS were unstable when measured with a four-point probe
set-up, and therefore no reliable values for the conductivities of the plain PEDOT:PSS
films could be obtained. Measuring the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS films with ITO
as the substrate was also unsuccessful as the conductivity of the underlying ITO overruled
any conductivity values of the polymer thin films.
The conductivity of plain ITO and the two different film thicknesses of both
PEDOT:PSS:chem types were measured using a standard four-point probe measurement
set-up. The conductivity of PH1000:chem thin films (spin-coated at 5000 rpm) after
biofunctionalization was also measured to see if bio-functionalizing the surface had an
effect on the conductivity. The thicknesses used to calculate the conductivities were
35

Anni Eklund

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

obtained from the AFM measurements as mentioned in the chapter above. For the
biofunctionalized samples, the thickness was considered to be the same both with and
without biofunctionalization since incubating the films in neither PBS nor DMF had an
effect on the films, as was evident from the results from the absorbance measurements
presented in chapter 4.1. The conductivity of the AI4083:chem samples after
biofunctionalization could not be measured because the I-V characteristics were not
stable.
The conductivities were calculated from the I-V relation (obtained by the four-point probe
measurements) and the thickness of the films using a LabVIEW programme which had
specifically been made for the set-up that was used. The LabVIEW programme took into
consideration the correction factors presented in chapter 2.2, including the probe spacing
as well as the sample shape and size. The average conductivities and standard deviations
were calculated from three different samples of each type, with the results summarized in
table 4.2 below.

A few important conclusions can be drawn from these results. Firstly, the thicker
PEDOT:PSS:chem films (spin-coated at 2500 rpm) were slightly more conductive
compared to the thinner equivalents. The difference, however, was considered to be too
small to affect the performance of the platform. Others have reported that the conductivity
of the PEDOT:PSS films is independent of the spin-speed which they concluded after
36

Anni Eklund

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

extensive measurements [52]. They further argued that it was proof that no changes in the
film structure or morphology that effect the conductivity of the films occur by spincoating at different speeds. It is, however, safe to say no real comparisons can be made
between the conductivities of PEDOT:PSS films that have different compositions, i.e.
different concentrations of additives, because the composition of a polymer dispersion
greatly affects the morphology of the resulting film and therefore the conductivity. Since
only two different thicknesses were compared here, no real conclusion can be drawn
about how the film thickness of this exact polymer composition affects the conductivity.
The only rational conclusion for the present results is that the change in conductivity
between the two different thicknesses is small enough to be considered negligible for the
platform performance.
Secondly, the results show that the PH1000:chem films are significantly more conductive
than the AI4083:chem films. This was also expected based on the sheet resistances of the
two plain PEDOT:PSS types reported by Ossila [28]. The sheet resistance for plain
AI4083 is reported to be 5-50 Ω.m and for plain PH1000 0.01 – 0.1 Ω.m. As mentioned
previously, the conductivity of a PEDOT:PSS film strongly depends on the film structure
and morphology. This in turn is strongly influenced by the composition of the film, i.e.
the ratio of PEDOT-to-PSS as well as the presence of any additional chemicals. The
difference in sheet resistance between the two plain PEDOT:PSS solutions can be
explained to be caused by the difference in the ratio of PEDOT-to-PSS. AI4083 has a
ratio of 1:6, whereas PH1000 has a ratio of 1:2.5, meaning that there is more PSS in the
resulting AI4083 films compared to the PH1000 films. Therefore, as described in chapter
2.1.3, the layer of excess PSS between the electrically conductive PEDOT-rich cores is
thicker for the AI4083 films, which in turn makes intramolecular charge transport through
percolation between the PEDOT-rich cores in the film more difficult. This corresponds
to a higher sheet resistance, i.e. lower conductivity, in the AI4083 films compared to the
PH1000 films where the PSS layer surrounding the PEDOT-rich cores is thinner.
Thirdly, compared to the sheet resistance of the plain PEDOT:PSS thin films, the sheet
resistance obtained for the PEDOT:PSS:chem films is considerably smaller. For example,
for the PH1000:chem samples, a sheet resistance of ~0.0001 Ω.m was obtained and for
the AI4083:chem ~0.01 – 0.05 Ω.m was obtained. In both cases the composition of the
PEDOT:PSS solutions, obtained by mixing the three additives into the solutions prior to
deposition, resulted in a decrease in the film sheet resistance. The decrease in sheet
37

Anni Eklund

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

resistance, i.e. increase in conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS:chem films, can be ascribed
to the change in film morphology caused by the addition of the three chemical enhancers.
The addition of the crosslinker GOPS is reported to only bind with PSS, which cause a
change in the film morphology resulting in a decrease in conductivity [37]. On the other
hand, the film conductivity increases with an increasing concentration of DBSA added to
the solution. However, adding more than 0.5 % v/v DBSA is reported to result in a phase
separation in the polymer solution, resulting in a non-homogenous spin-coating and nonuniform films [30]. Based on this, and the discussion in chapter 2.1.3, it can be argued
that the addition of DBSA, as well as the addition of DMSO, changes the film morphology
in such a way that intramolecular charge transport through percolation becomes easier
and thus the film conductivity is increased.
Lastly, bio-functionalizing the PH1000:chem film did not affect the film conductivity
significantly. This is evident by comparing the conductivities between the nonbiofunctionalized and the biofunctionalized PH1000:chem films. This implies that the
PEDOT:PSS films do not lose their ability to conduct charge after the surface has been
biofunctionalized. This result is important since it is paramount that the PEDOT:PSS
films are conductive for them to be used as bioelectronic activation platforms.
In addition to the four-point probe analysis of the film conductivities, the conductivity on
a macro- and nanoscopic level was investigated using conductive Atomic Force
Microscopy (c-AFM). The c-AFM measurements were conducted to see how the surface
conductivity of the PH1000:chem films on ITO substrates differed from plain ITO and
plain PH1000 films on ITO substrates. Since extensive c-AFM measurements were not
conducted in this work, the results presented here should only serve as a visual
representation of the difference in the surface conductivity of the three sample types. In
order to fully investigate the macro-and nanoscopic surface conductivities of
PEDOT:PSS films, more c-AFM measurements are needed. This, however, went beyond
the scope of this thesis.
Figure 4.4 shows the height and current images obtained from the c-AFM measurements,
the blue regions on the right-side images represent a more conductive region, whereas the
yellow represents a more insulating region. For all measurements, a 500 mV DC bias was
applied to the sample surface.

38

Anni Eklund

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

From figure 4.4 it is clear that plain ITO exhibits the highest conductivity. It can be seen
by the amount of blue regions in the current profile (b) compared to those on the plain
PH1000 film (d) and the PH1000:chem film (f). This is expected since ITO has a much
higher conductivity than the two PH1000 film versions. The plain PH1000 film (d), is
almost completely insulating when applying a 500 mV bias over the surface. More
conductive regions can be seen on the PH1000:chem film (f) compared to the plain
PH1000 film (d). This further proves that the addition of the three film enhancers
collectively increase the surface conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS films, which was
already noted from the four-point probe measurements.

4.4 Quantification of available amine groups
Functionalizing surfaces by silanization has been reported to increase the adhesion of
biomolecules [53, 54]. By using the organosilane (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane
(APTES) for the silanization, amine groups are attached to hydroxyl groups on the
surfaces. These amine groups can then be further modified to other functional groups
which are more suitable for the adhesion of biomolecules. The number of available amine
groups on surfaces can be assessed using a colorimetric strategy, known as 4-NBA assay
[53, 55, 56]. In this method, 4-NBA molecules are attached to the amine groups in ethanol
and later released in an acidic solution called hydrolysis solution. The concentration
of 4-NBA on the surfaces corresponds to the concentration of available amine groups
(1:1 ratio), which in turn is thought to correspond to the number of binding sites for
biomolecules. The concentration of 4-NBA is obtained by measuring the UV-Vis
absorption of the hydrolysis solution in which the 4-NBA molecules have detached from
the surfaces as a result of incubation (see chapter 3.2.4 for more details about the process).
A 4-NBA assay was employed to see if silanization using APTES would provide available
amine groups on the PEDOT:PSS films. Four different sample types: plain glass; plain
ITO; PH1000:chem on glass substrates; and AI4083:chem on glass substrates were
compared with respect to the surface density of available amine groups. The left graph in
figure 4.5 shows the absorbance of the hydrolysis solutions after 4-NBA detachment from
the plain glass and plain ITO samples, whereas the right graph shows the absorbance
resulting from 4-NBA detachment from the PH1000:chem and AI4083:chem samples. In
both graphs, the absorbances of control samples for which the silanization step, i.e.
attaching of amine groups, was omitted, are also shown. Although the absorbance
spectrum was measured up to 600 nm, no absorbance occurred at higher wavelengths and
therefore the graphs only show the absorbance up to a wavelength of 360 nm.
4-NBA absorbs light at approximately 270 nm and the absence of a peak at this
wavelength (as seen in figure 4.5) for the control samples for which the silanization step
was omitted, is a clear indication that there were no available amine groups on the surface
to which the 4-NBA molecules could attach. The samples functionalized by silanization,
however, clearly show an absorbance peak at around 270 nm, indicating that there were
available amine groups present on the surface to which 4-NBA molecules could attach.

41

Anni Eklund

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

This result proves that functionalizing the surfaces by silanization results in available
amine groups on the sample surfaces which is crucial for further biofunctionalization.

Figure 4.5. Absorbance of the hydrolysis solutions after 4-NBA detaching from plain
glass and plain ITO (left); and from PH1000:chem and AI4083:chem films (right).

To obtain the concentration of the detached 4-NBA in the hydrolysis solutions, and thus
being able to calculate the surface density of the available amine groups, Beer’s law of
the absorbance of a solution was used. Beer’s law states that the concentration of a
solution is directly proportional to the absorbance of the solution. Therefore, a calibration
curve of absorbance as a function of 4-NBA concentration was obtained by measuring
the absorbance of known concentrations of 4-NBA in hydrolysis solution. The absorbance
spectrum of different concentrations of 4-NBA as well as the standard curve with a linear
fit of the absorbance at 270 nm as a function of concentration can be seen in figure 4.6.
The intercept was fixed to zero to represent that at zero concentration of 4-NBA there is
zero absorbance.
The linear fit function along with the maximum absorbance values at 270 nm in figure
4.5 can be used to calculate the concentrations of 4-NBA in the hydrolysis solutions for
the different sample types. The function obtained from the linear fit 𝑦 = 0.01912 ∗ 𝑋,
corresponds to
Absorbance at 270 nm = 0.01912 * Concentration of 4-NBA [µM]

solution (left); Standard curve of the absorbance of 4-NBA with a linear fit of the
absorbance at 270 nm as a function of 4-NBA concentration where the intercept has been
fixed to zero (right).

The total amount, 𝑛, of 4-NBA in the hydrolysis solutions is obtained by multiplying the
concentration of 4-NBA with the total volume of hydrolysis solution used in the detaching
process.
𝑛 =𝑐∙𝑉

(7)

The total number of 4-NBA molecules in the hydrolysis solution, 𝑁, and thus the number
of 4-NBA molecules attached to the surface, was then calculated by multiplying the
amount of substance of 4-NBA with Avogadro’s constant.
𝑁 = 𝑛 ∙ 𝑁𝐴

(8)

Since the 4-NBA molecules attach to the amine groups on the surfaces at a 1:1 ratio, the
surface density of 4-NBA molecules corresponds to the surface density of available amine
groups. To obtain the surface density, ρ𝑆 , the number of 4-NBA molecules was divided
by the total surface area of the samples.

The results show that the highest surface density of available amine groups was obtained
on plain glass. Functionalizing glass using APTES has previously been reported to result
in a surface density of 31 available amine groups per 1000 Å2 [53]. The high surface
density of 71 amine groups per 1000 Å2 obtained here for the glass samples can be
explained to be due to the UV-Ozone cleaning step which was done prior to the
silanization. UV-Ozone cleaning glass slides is known to result in the formation of
hydroxyl groups on the surface [57], and more hydroxyl groups on the surface correspond
to more binding sites being available for the amines during the silanization process. UVOzone cleaning the glass surfaces prior to silanization thus resulted in more available
amine groups to attach to the surface compared to the glass surfaces which had not been
UV-Ozone cleaned, as was the case in the study where they obtained 31 available amine
groups per 1000 Å2 [53].
The three other sample types, i.e. plain ITO, PH1000:chem and AI4083:chem, all showed
a similar surface density of available amine groups. Functionalizing the PH1000:chem
samples, however, resulted in a slightly higher surface density compared to the
AI4083:chem and plain ITO samples which indicates that more biomolecules can attach
to the PH1000:chem surfaces.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.5 Underwater contact angle measurements
Underwater contact angle measurements were conducted on biofunctionalized
PH1000:chem films to see if a potentially induced conformational change in the
positively charged peptides could be achieved. ITO was chosen as the substrate to ensure
a homogeneous potential distribution over the polymer film, since the resistivity of the
PH1000:chem film was considered to be too high for the potential to be equal over the
whole surface. The PH1000:chem thin film was chosen based on the results from the
thickness analysis, conductivity measurements and the amine quantification, as the
PH1000:chem film spin-coated at 5000 rpm was the most homogenous and possessed the
highest conductivity as well as the most available binding sites for the peptides on the
surface. Based on cyclic voltammetry measurements, presented in section 3.3.6, the
positive and negative potential chosen to be applied over the platform was + 0.2V and
– 0.4V, respectively. As a control group, PH1000:chem films that were biofunctionalized
as described in section 3.3.5, up until the bonding of the peptides were also analysed.
These control samples worked as a reference to see if the change in the surface wettability
was due to the peptides, and not due to a change in the surface of the polymer film itself,
or a change caused by the streptavidin, as a result of applying a potential.
A few issues were noted during the measurements that are good to mention: Firstly, the
number of drops that could be added on the sample surface varied depending on if the
addition of the drops was successful or not. An unsuccessful case was, for example, when
the oil drop touched the wall of the box and spread across it, blocking the light and the
camera, thus making it impossible to record any drop placed at that position of the sample.
Another failed attempt occurred if there was an air bubble present in the oil drop. Since
the contact angle of such a drop would be vastly different compared to a drop with no air
bubble, these had to be disregarded. During the measurements, a method of removing
such drops without placing them on the sample surface was discovered. By externally
removing any oil drops that contained air bubbles from the syringe tip using another
syringe, all unusable drops could be removed from the system. This way the amount of
DCM in the electrolyte could also be minimized. Excess DCM in the electrolyte was an
issue that was noticed during the first trial measurements. The DCM would gather at the
surface of the sample, creating a layer of oil thus making it difficult to measure the contact
angle. Minimization of the amount of DCM in the electrolyte and maximization of the

45

Anni Eklund

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

number of useable oil drops on the sample surfaces could therefore be achieved by
externally removing DCM drops with air bubbles from the system using a syringe needle.
Secondly, the DCM drop size varied significantly even though no changes in the dispense
parameters were made during measurements. It has been reported that the contact angle
depends on the drop size in some liquid-solid interfaces depending on the surface
heterogeneity [58, 59]. The effect the drop size has in this specific system is unknown,
which means that the difference in the size of the drops might have affected the contact
angles greatly. The results obtained might thus be misleading and should be viewed
critically. The difference in the drop size can clearly be seen in figure 4.7 below.

Figure 4.7. Picture of the difference in the size of the oil droplets.

Thirdly, it was noted that the contact angle of the drops changed as a function of time.
Measuring the contact angle of the same drop a few minutes apart (without changing the
potential over the surface) resulted in a decrease in the contact angle. This can be seen
from figure 4.8 where each column represents the change in the contact angle of a drop
occurring over time. The figure shows the change calculated as −∆𝐶𝐴 = −(𝜃𝑡 − 𝜃𝑡0 ),
where 𝑡0 is the time when the contact angle was first measured and 𝑡 is the time when the
contact angle was measured again.

Figure 4.8. Change in contact angle (CA) of the same drop measured a few minutes apart.
The light blue columns show the change in the CA of drops when no potential was
applied; the dark blue columns show the change in the CA of drops measured when a
potential had been applied over the surface. The minutes between the measurements are
marked above each column. Each column represents a different drop, and all drops were
measured on the same sample.

As can be seen from figure 4.8, the contact angle decreases for all drops indicating that
even though the system is static, i.e. the potential is not changed between the
measurements, the contact angle changes by itself over time. From figure 4.8, it is also
clear that waiting for a longer time resulted in a larger decrease in the contact angle, as
waiting 12 minutes before measuring a drop again resulted in a larger than 8o decrease in
the contact angle. Others have reported similar results: the contact angle of static water
drops deposited on plain PEDOT:PSS films were shown to decrease with an increase in
the time between the deposition and the measurement [60]. The decrease in the contact
angle was hypothesised to be due to the hydrogel-like behaviour of the PEDOT:PSS film,
not due to the evaporation of the water drop. Similarly, the hydrogel-like behaviour of the
PH1000:chem film used here could be the reason for the decrease in the contact angle
over time since the PH1000:chem film is in contact with the electrolyte solution, which
is water-based. It is also good to note that the XYZ-stage the set-up was placed on was
moved between the measurements for drops 3-6. There is therefore a chance that the
movement of the platform itself caused, or at least had an effect on, the change in the
47

Anni Eklund

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

contact angle. Further measurements are however needed before any real conclusions
about how time and the interaction between the electrolyte and the PH1000:chem film
affect the contact angle can be drawn.
Fourthly, it is good to note that the measured contact angle strongly depended on how far
the drop was placed from the wall of the transparent box. This affected how well the
image of the drop could be focused and thus the position of the baseline for the angle.
The drops had to be placed as close to the box wall towards the camera as possible to
obtain the best focus and thus the most accurate baseline.
The effect that applying a potential over the PH1000:chem films had on the contact angle
of drops that were already placed on the surface was also investigated. First, the contact
angles of two drops on each sample were measured when no potential was applied, after
which either – 0.4V or + 0.2V was applied over the film and the contact angles for the
drops were measured again. The change in surface tension was then calculated using
′
equation (4) where 𝜃𝑜𝑙
was the contact angle measured after the potential had been applied

and 𝜃𝑜𝑙 the contact angle measured before the potential was applied. The difference, ∆𝛾,
is therefore a measure of how much the surface tension changed after applying a potential
over the PH1000:chem film. The calculated change in surface tension for each sample
type is summarized in figure 4.9.

columns represent the first drop, the light blue columns the second drop. The dotted lines

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The results in figure 4.9 clearly show that no matter which type of potential, positive or
negative, is applied over the PH1000:chem films, both with and without the peptides on
the surface, the surface tension is higher after the potential has been applied compared to
when no potential was applied over the surface. This implies that the contact angle has
decreased and that the oil drop is attracted more towards the surface of the film, i.e. the
surface is more oleophilic.
Since the same effect was noted for both the reduced and oxidized PH1000:chem films
with and without the peptides attached, it can be deduced that there is a common factor
behind the decrease in the contact angle, i.e. the increase in surface tension. The decrease
in contact angle between a drop measured before and after applying a potential over the
film is in the same order as that seen for a drop measured a few minutes apart without
changing the surface potential. The change occurring after applying a potential could
therefore be explained to be caused by an interaction between the PEDOT:PSS film and
the electrolyte solution, which had already been argued above to result in a decrease in
the contact angle, i.e. an increase in surface tension. As described by equation (1), PEDOT
undergoes a Faradaic reaction in the presence of cations in the electrolyte when a potential
is applied over the film. This reaction can be thought to be less likely to occur under the
oil droplet. The oil drop hinders the Na+ cations from the electrolyte to diffuse into the
polymer matrix at that location. This non-homogeneity of the reaction over the film
surface might be the cause of the change in the contact angle seen after applying a
potential over the polymer film. More measurements are however needed to understand
if the increase in the surface tension after applying a potential can be explained to be due
to an interaction between the electrolyte and the PH1000:chem film.
In order to compare the samples with and without the peptides, and to minimize the
decrease in the contact angle occurring over time, the contact angles of the DCM drops
were measured immediately after placing them on the surfaces of the PH1000:chem films.
For both sample types, i.e. with and without the peptide, separate samples were used when
applying a positive, + 0.2 V, and a negative – 0.4V, potential over the surface. The change
in surface tension was then calculated between the changed state and the initial state, i.e.
when no potential was applied. The initial state was obtained by calculating the average
of two drops (drop1_0V and drop2_0V) measured immediately after placing them on the
surface. The change in surface tension for all sample types can be found in figure 4.10.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 4.10. Change in surface tension after applying a potential over the samples with
respect to when no potential was applied. The dotted lines separate different samples of
the same type with each column within a dotted line region representing a different drop.
The solid lines separate the different sample types. The blue columns indicate an increase
in surface tension, the beige almost no change (< 0.5), and the red a decrease.

From figure 4.10 it is clear that only in the case of the reduced PH1000:chem film with
the peptides, i.e. SV1 (– 0.4V), does the surface tension increase after applying the
potential. It should, however, be noted that the results are inconsistent, as one of the
samples resulted in a decrease in the surface tension and two of the samples in almost no
change. Additional measurements are clearly needed to obtain more data and a better
understanding of how the potential affects the peptides.
An increase in the surface tension, obtained for the PH1000:chem films with the peptides
when the films were reduced, indicate a decrease in the contact angle, i.e. the surfaces
becoming more oleophilic. On the other hand, when the PH1000:chem films with the
peptides were oxidized, a decrease in the surface tension corresponding to an increase in
the contact angle was obtained. The PH1000:chem surface therefore became more
oleophobic. As discussed in chapter 2.3.2, applying a negative potential over the polymer
film, i.e. reducing the film, should result in the positively charged, i.e. hydrophilic, end

50

Anni Eklund

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

groups of the peptides to bend down towards the surface and as a result make the surface
more oleophilic. Applying a positive potential over the polymer film should result in the
hydrophilic end groups of the peptides to be repelled away from the surface, thus making
the surface more hydrophilic, i.e. oleophobic. The results obtained for the PH1000:chem
films with the peptides are therefore in agreement with the hypothesis.
For the control samples, i.e. the PH1000:chem thin films without the peptides, a decrease
in the surface tension was obtained when both reducing and oxidizing the films. The
surfaces therefore became more oleophobic in both cases. Oxidizing the PH1000:chem
control samples resulted in the surfaces becoming more oleophobic compared to when
the films were reduced. The reduced control samples can be argued to have undergone no
significant change in the wettability as the change in the surface tension is so small. It has
previously been reported that a layer of excess PSS is formed on top of plain PEDOT:PSS
films and that a change in the redox state of the polymer (when a + 0.8V and – 0.9V bias
was applied) would therefore not affect the surface processes [16]. The surface wettability
of plain PEDOT:PSS films would thus only be weakly influenced by an applied potential.
This argument is not in agreement with what was seen for the oxidized PH1000:chem
control samples, as it was clear that a significant change in the surface wettability was
seen after applying the potential. It is however important to note that the control samples
in this work had been biofunctionalized up until the anchoring of the peptide sequence
and therefore possessed a biolayer which included the streptavidin. To understand why
the control samples became more oleophobic when applying a potential over the films,
how the PH1000:chem films themselves, as well as how streptavidin affects the surface
wettability after applying the potential must be considered.
Underwater contact angle measurements on biofunctionalized gold electrodes, conducted
by the Bioelectronics group at Åbo Akademi University, showed that a change in the
contact angle was only obtained for gold electrodes that had been biofunctionalized with
the SV1 peptides (results not published yet). As a control, gold electrodes with
streptavidin, i.e. samples where the anchoring of the peptides was omitted, were also
measured. No change in the contact angle was obtained for the control samples, indicating
that streptavidin was not affected by the potential over the gold platforms. This is in good
agreement with the fact that streptavidin is a neutral molecule and should not be affected
by a change in the potential over the gold electrode. As has been previously stated, and
contrary to the gold electrode, PEDOT:PSS is not only electrically conductive but also
51

Anni Eklund

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

ionically conductive. This ionic conductivity is known to change the surface properties
of a polymer film in the presence of an electrolyte, e.g. the local pH, when the redox state
of the polymer is changed. The pH in turn is known to affect the conformation of some
proteins [18]. A change in the surface properties due to the ionic conductivity of
PEDOT:PSS can therefore have affected the streptavidin molecules in such a way that
they caused the change in the surface wettability observed here for the PH1000:chem
control samples. No information on how different surface properties affect streptavidin
was found, and therefore its effect on the wettability of the PH1000:chem control samples
is still unclear. More measurements on how applying a potential over the PH1000:chem
films affect the surface properties of the polymer films and how these properties in turn
affect streptavidin are needed to obtain a better understanding of what caused a change in
the surface wettability.
In addition to streptavidin affecting the surface wettability of the control samples, it is
possible that the change in the wettability is caused by a change in the PH1000:chem
films themselves. When changing the redox state of a PEDOT:PSS film in the presence
of an electrolyte, the polymer film exchanges cations with the surrounding media to
maintain its electroneutrality [61]. The large and immobile PSS - anions within the
PEDOT:PSS film results in the small sodium cations, Na+, in the sodium nitrate
electrolyte used in this work, to diffuse in and out of the polymer matrix as a result of
changing the redox state. Reducing the PEDOT:PSS films results in the cations diffusing
into the polymer matrix, and has been said to make plain PEDOT:PSS films more
hydrophilic [62]. Since almost no change can be seen for the reduced control samples
here, it can be thought that reducing the PH1000:chem films does not result in a large
number of cations to diffuse into the polymer causing a change in the wettability.
Oxidizing the PEDOT:PSS films would result in the Na+ cations to diffuse out of the
polymer to maintain the electroneutrality, thus making the surface more hydrophobic.
This, however, is not in agreement with what was seen here, as oxidizing the
PH1000:chem control samples resulted in the surface becoming even more hydrophilic
than in the reduced case. The cations diffusing in and out of the polymer matrix can
therefore not explain the change in the surface wettability seen for the PH1000:chem
control samples.
Another process that has been reported to change the surface wettability of some redox
polymers is the reorientation of sulfonic acid groups, SO3-, within the polymer matrix. It
52

Anni Eklund

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

has been previously argued that applying a potential in the range of + 0.6 V and – 0.9 V
over a plain film of the redox polymer PPy:DBS, which contains sulfonic acid groups,
results in a reorientation of the groups by either repelling the negatively charged groups
away from the reduced polymer backbone or by attracting the negatively charged groups
towards the oxidized polymer backbone [49]. This reorientation was further argued to be
the cause of the change in the surface wettability of plain PPy:DBS films due to the
sulfonic acid groups being hydrophilic. When oxidizing the plain PPy:DBS film, the
sulfonic acid groups would be attracted towards the backbone making the surface more
hydrophobic, whereas when reducing the polymer, the sulfonic acid groups would be
repelled out towards the surface, making the surface hydrophilic [49]. Polystyrene
sulfonate, PSS-, which also contains sulfonic acid groups, could therefore be thought to
behave similarly as PPy:DBS. This, however, was not the case since the surfaces of the
PEDOT:PSS PH1000:chem control samples became more hydrophilic when oxidizing
the films. It can therefore be argued that a change in the reorientation of the sulfonic acid
groups is not the cause of the change in the surface wettability seen in the control samples.
The potential range used in this work, i.e. + 0.2 V and – 0.4 V, might, for example, not
have been strong enough to cause a reorientation of the sulfonic acid groups.
None of the above-discussed processes can explain the change in the surface wettability
seen for the oxidized PH1000:chem control samples. This is not surprising as static
contact angle measurements are known to be strongly dependent on the experimental
conditions [60]. No real comparisons can therefore be drawn between the different
systems described above and the system used in this work. More measurements with this
exact set-up are needed to obtain a better understanding of how a potential range of + 0.2V
and – 0.4V affects the PH1000:chem films both with and without streptavidin.
All-in-all, it should be noted that the measurements conducted here are not enough to get
a clear picture of how the polarity of the potential over a PH1000:chem thin film affects
the surface wettability and thus the peptide conformation. Additional contact angle
measurements should be conducted on plain PH1000:chem films that have not been
biofunctionalized at all, in order to see if the streptavidin affected the surface wettability
or if the change was caused by the polymer surface itself. Moreover, the measurements
should be conducted more carefully to exclude any potential errors occurring due to a
change in the drop size, movement of the platform, or simply as a result of the time
between the deposition and measurement of the drops.

5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE OUTLOOK

5. Conclusions and future outlook
The goal of this work was to develop a transparent and conductive PEDOT:PSS thin film
platform for potentially inducing a conformational change on positively charged peptides.
To enhance the thin film properties of two different PEDOT:PSS solutions, AI4083 and
PH1000, three different additives were mixed to the PEDOT:PSS solutions prior to
deposition. The crosslinker (3-Glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (GOPS) was added
to enhance the film stability in organic solutions, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added
to enhance the conductivity and 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) to facilitate film
processing. The resulting PEDOT:PSS films, PH1000:chem and AI4083:chem, were
compared to see which PEDOT:PSS type would be most suitable as a bioelectronic
activation platform. The PEDOT:PSS films were compared with respect to their stability
in organic solutions, conductivity and the number of amine groups that could be obtained
on the surfaces by silanization.
UV-Vis absorption measurements were conducted to see how the addition of 1 % v/v of
the crosslinker GOPS affected the film stability. No change in the absorbance of the films
fabricated from the solution containing GOPS was noted after incubating the films in PBS
or DMF. A substantial decrease in the absorbance, however, was seen for plain
PEDOT:PSS films after the films had been incubating in the two solutions. This indicated
that the addition of GOPS made the PEDOT:PSS thin films stable and insoluble in the
two organic solutions. Obtaining insoluble PEDOT:PSS films was paramount for the
PEDOT:PSS films to be used as bioelectronic activation platforms since both PBS and
DMF were used during the biofunctionalization of the films. One disadvantage of adding
GOPS to the PEDOT:PSS, however, is that it has been reported to decrease both the
electronic and the ionic conductivities of the films [16, 63]. Optimizing the concentration
of GOPS would therefore be a viable step to further increase the film conductivity as
minimizing the amount of GOPS in the PEDOT:PSS solution would also minimize the
negative effect it has on the conductivity. The addition of 0.1 % v/v GOPS has been
reported to be enough to obtain stable and insoluble thin films [37]. Fabricating the
PEDOT:PSS thin film platforms containing this concentration of GOPS might therefore
be a better alternative for the overall device performance.
Thickness analysis of two different film thicknesses of PH1000:chem and AI4083:chem
showed that the thinner films were more homogenous compared to the thicker films of
54

Anni Eklund

5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE OUTLOOK

the same type. It was concluded that the PH1000:chem films spin coated at 5000 rpm
exhibited the best surface homogeneity with respect to the thickness.
As expected, the conductivity measurements showed that the PH1000:chem films had a
higher conductivity than the AI4083:chem films. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS film
did not have a significant effect on the film conductivity. The results also showed that
bio-functionalizing PH1000:chem films did not affect the conductivity, which was critical
for the PEDOT:PSS films to be used as bioelectronic activation platforms. From the
conductivity measurements it was concluded that the PH1000:chem films spin-coated at
5000 rpm possessed the highest conductivity when also taking into consideration the film
homogeneity.
A colorimetric assay was utilized to quantify the number of available amine groups
obtained on the PH1000:chem and AI4083:chem film surfaces after silanization. The
results showed that the PH1000:chem films had the most amine groups on the surface,
which implied that more peptides could be attached to the PH1000:chem films.
Underwater contact angle measurements showed that when oxidizing a PH1000:chem
thin film with the positively charged peptides, a more oleophobic surface was obtained
compared to an oleophilic surface that was obtained when reducing the PH1000:chem
film. A more oleophilic surface could indicate that the hydrophilic positive end groups of
the peptides were bent towards the film surface, thus being hidden, when the PEDOT:PSS
was reduced, whereas a more oleophobic surface could indicate that the peptides were
repelled away from the oxidized PEDOT:PSS film, thus revealing their hydrophilic end
groups. The measurements conducted in this work were, however, not sufficient to give
a clear idea about how the PEDOT:PSS film performed as a bioelectronic activation
platform. More measurements are needed to understand the change in the surface
wettability seen as a result of applying a potential over the PH1000:chem thin films.
Measuring the contact angle on plain PH1000:chem films when applying a negative and
positive potential would be beneficial to see how the polymer itself affects the surface
wettability. Measuring the contact angle on PH1000:chem films that have been
biofunctionalized with a negative peptide would also give valuable information about the
interaction between the peptides and the polymer film. When using a negatively charged
peptide the opposite effect on the surface wettability when applying a positive or negative
potential, compared to when using a positively charged peptide, is expected if the

55

5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE OUTLOOK

activation platform works as hypothesized. These measurements are therefore essential
to obtain a better understanding of the working mechanism behind the bioelectronic
activation platform.
Moreover, obtaining both spatial and temporal control of the bioelectronic activation
platform, and thus over the biomolecules, is paramount in order to gain a better
understanding of cell functions and activation. Although spin-coating is a fast and easy
deposition method of fabricating PEDOT:PSS thin films, obtaining high spatial control
is difficult. Utilizing other, more easily controlled deposition methods, such as soft
lithography, to fabricate the platforms would enable the fabrication of high-quality microand nanoscale patterned platforms which in turn would allow for a better control over the
activation of cell functions [64]. Although further measurements and optimization of the
platform are needed, the results from this work proved that using a PEDOT:PSS thin film
as a bioelectronic activation platform is feasible.

6. SUMMARY IN SWEDISH – SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING

6. Summary in Swedish – Svensk sammanfattning
Bioelektronisk aktiveringsplattform av PEDOT:PSS
6.1 Introduktion
Under de senaste åren har bioelektronik, ett tvärvetenskapligt område som integrerar
elektronik med biologiska system, väckt stort intresse bland forskare över hela världen.
Att kunna kontrollera och förstå cellfunktioner är värdefullt inom cellbiologi och ger nya
möjligheter och tillämpningar inom regenerativ medicin och vävnadsteknik [11, 12]. Att
utveckla bioelektroniska plattformar som möjliggör rumslig och temporär kontroll av
både celler och deras miljö är väsentligt för att forskare ska få en bättre förståelse av
cellfunktioner och deras aktivering. Att hitta nya, billigare och mer biokompatibla
material för tillverkning av sådana plattformar är därmed av stort intresse. Tillverkning
av bioelektroniska apparater från ledande polymerer har visat sig vara ett utmärkt val.
Ett sätt att styra cellfunktioner – som utnyttjar ledningsförmågan hos ledande polymerer
– är att kontrollera konformationen av laddade peptider genom elektrostatiska
interaktioner mellan polymerplattformen och peptiderna. Genom att applicera antingen
en positiv eller negativ potential, det vill säga oxidera eller reducera polymerytan, böjer
sig de laddade peptiderna antingen mot eller bort från ytan, beroende på laddningen av
peptidändgruppen. Extern kontroll av konformationen av laddade peptider möjliggör
således kontroll av peptidernas bindningsbenägenhet till celler och därmed också kontroll
av aktiveringen av specifika cellfunktioner. Ledande polymerer har redan använts för att
externt kontrollera konformationen av biomolekyler, till exempel genom att applicera en
potential över en Poly(3,4-etylendioxitiofen)tosylat-plattform (PEDOT:TOS) kunde man
inducera en förändring i konformationen av fibronektin, ett protein som finns i
extracellulär matris [17, 18].
Poly(3,4-etylendioxitiofen)polystyrensulfonat (PEDOT:PSS) är en av de mest kända
ledande polymererna och används redan i ett flertal bioelektroniska applikationer [19,
20]. PEDOT:PSS har många utmärkta egenskaper som är idealiska för bioelektroniska
apparater, den är till exempel kommersiellt tillgänglig, kan tillverkas till transparenta och
flexibla filmer [10, 20, 21], är biokompatibel [8, 19, 22] och har hög ledningsförmåga
[21]. Alla dessa egenskaper gör PEDOT:PSS till ett spännande och praktiskt material att

57

Anni Eklund

6. SUMMARY IN SWEDISH – SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING

använda i bioelektroniska applikationer, även för tillverkning av en bioelektronisk
aktiveringsplattform för kontroll av laddade peptiders konformation.
Syftet med denna avhandling är att visa att det är möjligt att använda transparenta och
ledande PEDOT:PSS-filmer som bioelektroniska aktiveringsplattformer för att potentiellt
inducera en konformationsförändring i positivt laddade peptider.

6.2 Teori
6.2.1 Ledningsförmågan hos PEDOT:PSS
PEDOT:PSS är en π-konjugerad polymer, vilket innebär att dess kolatomer bildar en
ryggrad av alternerande enkel- och dubbelbindningar. Denna alternerande ryggrad är
nyckeln till ledningsförmågan i konjugerade polymerer. PSS fungerar som ett
dopningsmedel som skapar ett laddat centrum, dvs. en positiv laddning på PEDOTryggraden samtidigt som systemets nettoladdning balanseras. Detta laddade centrum gör
laddningstransporten längs den konjugerade ryggraden lättare, och därmed ökar
polymerens ledningsförmåga. Den kemiska strukturen för PEDOT:PSS kan ses i figur 6.1
nedan.

Figur 6.1. Kemisk struktur av PEDOT:PSS. PEDOT (nedre) och PSS (övre) som skapar
ett laddat centrum i PEDOT-ryggraden.

Trots att ledningsförmågan i PEDOT:PSS baserar sig på att laddningar kan röra sig fritt
längs med den konjugerade ryggraden påverkas ledningsförmågan på en makroskopisk
nivå starkt av strukturen och morfologin av PEDOT:PSS-filmen. Laddningarna rör sig i
en PEDOT:PSS-film mellan områden med högre ledningsförmåga genom perkolering

58

Anni Eklund

6. SUMMARY IN SWEDISH – SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING

(eng. percolation). Hur nära dessa områden är, dvs. hur lätt laddningar transporteras
mellan dessa områden, påverkar därmed starkt PEDOT:PSS-filmens ledningsförmåga.
En viktig parameter som påverkar morfologin av en PEDOT:PSS-film är förhållandet av
PEDOT-till-PSS i den lösning från vilken filmerna tillverkas. Det är uppenbart att en
högre mängd PSS i lösningen resulterar i att mer PSS finns i den resulterande filmen.
Ledningsförmågan hos PEDOT:PSS-filmer har även rapporterats minska med en ökad
mängd PSS [29]. Det är ofta önskvärt att ytterligare förbättra polymerfilmers
ledningsförmåga. Det vanligaste sättet att öka ledningsförmågan hos ledande polymerer
är genom att tillsätta ett sekundärt dopningsmedel (även kallat sekundärlösningsmedel)
till polymerlösningen före deposition. Tillsatsen av till exempel 5 % v/v dimetylsulfoxid
(DMSO) har rapporterats leda till en ökning av ledningsförmågan hos polymerfilmer [19,
28, 30, 31, 32].
Ett materials resistivitet, dvs. ett materials förmåga att motstå elektrisk ström, är en viktig
faktor att ta hänsyn till när man arbetar med bioelektroniska apparater. Resistiviteten i
tunna polymerfilmer kan mätas med hjälp av en fyrpunktssond (eng. four-point probe).
Figur 6.2 nedan visar en illustration av systemet.

Figur 6.2. Illustration av en fyrpunktssond med jämnt sondavstånd, s, mellan alla fyra
sonder.

För en noggrann beräkning av resistiviteten i filmen krävs att geometrin av anordningen
och provet är välkänd. Dessutom måste polymerfilmerna antas vara homogena över hela
plattformsytan för att resistivitetsberäkningen ska ge ett så korrekt värde som möjligt.
Genom att applicera en ström mellan de två yttre sonderna kan den resulterande

spänningen i materialet mätas med de två inre sonderna. Resistiviteten ρ av en isotropisk

där 𝑡 är filmens tjocklek, 𝑉 potentialen och I strömmen. 𝐹1 , 𝐹2 och 𝐹3 är
korrigeringsfaktorer som tar hänsyn till plattformsgeometrin och sondernas placering på
plattformen. Den första korrigeringsfaktorn, 𝐹1 , beaktar filmtjockleken och beror på
gränstypen mellan substratet och polymerfilmen. Denna faktor beror på ifall substratet är
ledande eller isolerande. Den andra korrigeringsfaktorn, 𝐹2 , beaktar sondens placering
med avseende till filmens kant. För att minimera denna faktors effekt på resistiviteten är
det viktigt att placera sonderna i mitten av filmen då den mäts. Den tredje
korrigeringsfaktorn, 𝐹3 , tar hänsyn till filmens geometri. Dess värde skiljer sig för
kvadratiska, rektangulära- och cirkulära filmer som en funktion av bredden (eller
diametern för cirkulära filmer) dividerat med sondavståndet.
Resistiviteten hos en homogen polymerfilm, som ges i Ω.m, kan nu erhållas med hjälp av
de ovan nämnda korrigeringsfaktorerna och ekvation (1). Filmens ledningsförmåga 𝜎,
som ges i S/m, erhålls enkelt som inversen av resistiviteten

6.2.2 PEDOT:PSS-filmer som bioelektroniska aktiveringsplattformar
Den bioelektroniska aktiveringsplattformen består av ett ITO substrat med ett tunt lager
PEDOT:PSS. PEDOT:PSS filmen har biofunktionaliserats genom att fästa korta
peptidsekvenser med en positiv ändgrupp till tillgängliga bindningsplatser. Figur 6.3 visar
en schematisk illustration om plattformens struktur.

Funktionsmekanismen bakom aktiveringsplattformen är förmågan att reglera potentialen
över PEDOT:PSS filmen. Filmpotentialen har i sin tur förmågan att ändra
konformationen av de laddade peptiderna genom elektrostatiska interaktioner. Denna
mekanism har redan visats fungera på guldelektroder som var funktionaliserade med
RGD-peptider med positivt laddade ändgrupper. Genom att applicera en negativ eller
positiv potential över guldelektroden ändrades konformationen av RGD-peptiderna
mellan en linjär och cyklisk konformation [45]. Den elektrostatiska interaktionen mellan
den

laddade

ändgruppen

och

filmytan

hävdades

vara

orsaken

till

konformationsförändringen. Den positivt laddade ytan motiverades repellera bort de
positivt laddade ändgrupperna, medan den negativt laddade ytan motiverades attrahera
ändgrupperna, vilket ledde till att RGD-peptiderna erhöll en cyklisk konformation. I detta
arbete användes en kort peptidsekvens med en positivt laddad ändgrupp och teoretiskt bör
konformationen av denna peptidsekvens kunna ändras genom elektrostatiska
interaktioner på samma sätt som RGD-peptiderna.
Den potentiellt inducerade konformationsförändringen kan demonstreras med hjälp av
kontaktvinkelmätningar under vatten. Kontaktvinkeln mellan en icke-polär oljedroppe
och plattformsytan ändras på basen av hur hydrofobisk eller hydrofilisk ytan är. Om ytan
är mer hydrofilisk, dvs. oleofobisk, är kontaktvinkeln för oljedroppen större än om ytan
vore mer hydrofobisk. Ändgruppen i peptidsekvensen som används i detta arbete består
av en positivt laddad ändgrupp som på grund av dess laddning är hydrofilisk. Den
hydrofila ändgruppen i peptidsekvensen påverkar ytans hydrofilicitet när den repelleras
bort från eller attraheras mot plattformsytan då potentialen över polymerfilmen ändras.

61

Peptidernas konformation påverkar således oljedroppens kontaktvinkel med ytan genom
att ändra ytans hydrofilicitet. Detta demonstreras schematiskt i figur 6.4.

Detta beror på positionen av den hydrofila ändgruppen i peptidsekvensen. När
polymerfilmen oxideras repelleras den hydrofila peptidändgruppen bort från ytan, och
detta leder till att ytan är hydrofilisk, dvs. oleofobisk. När filmen reduceras böjs den
hydrofila ändgruppen mot ytan och döljs, vilket gör plattformsytan mer hydrofobisk, dvs.
oleofilisk. Genom att mäta oljedroppens kontaktvinkel på en reducerad och oxiderad
PH1000:chem film som har biofunktionaliserats med peptiderna, och jämföra detta med
vinkeln då ingen potential applicerats, kan man således undersöka förändringen i
peptidernas konformation.

6.3 Material och experimentella metoder
Egenskaperna av två olika PEDOT:PSS-lösningar, PH1000 och AI4083, förbättrades
genom att tillsätta tre olika tillsatsmedel. För att erhålla stabila och olösliga PEDOT:PSSfilmer i organiska lösningar tillsattes 1 % v/v (3-Glycidyloxipropyl)trimetoxisilan
(GOPS), 5 % v/v

dimetylsulfoxid

(DMSO)

tillsattes

för

att

öka

filmernas

ledningsförmåga och 0,25 % v/v 4-Dodecylbenzensulfonatsyra (DBSA) tillsattes för att
främja filmformation. PEDOT:PSS-lösningarna deponerades på rengjorda substrat

genom spinnbeläggning varefter

polymerfilmerna torkades på en värmeplatta. Proven med de tre tillsattsmedlena refereras
som PH1000:chem och AI4083:chem i resten av avhandlingen.
UV-Vis absorptionsmätningar utfördes för att avgöra om tillsatsen av GOPS resulterade
i att PEDOT:PSS-filmerna blev olösliga i fosfatbuffrad saltlösning (PBS) och
dimetylformamid (DMF). Absorptionen av PEDOT:PSS-filmer (med och utan GOPS)
som inkuberats två timmar i antingen PBS eller DMF jämfördes med absorptionen av
oinkuberade filmer.
Ledningsförmågan av ITO och två olika filmtjocklekar av både PH1000:chem och
AI4083:chem mättes med hjälp av en fyrpunktssond. Ledningsförmågan av
PH1000:chem-filmerna mättes också efter att filmerna hade biofunktionaliserats för att
se ifall biofunktionaliseringen påverkade filmernas ledningsförmåga. Ledningsförmågan
beräknades sedan automatiskt med hjälp av ekvation (1) i ett LabVIEW-program.
Filmernas tjocklek mättes med ett atomkraftsmikroskop.
Antalet tillgängliga amingrupper på ytorna kvantifierades för ITO, glas, PH1000:chemoch AI4083:chem-filmer efter att ytorna funktionaliserats genom silanisering. Två
referensprov av varje typ tillverkades också. För referensproven utelämnades
funktionalisering genom silanisering för att se om det påverkade antalet tillgängliga
amingrupper på ytorna.
För att se om PEDOT:PSS-filmerna kunde användas för att potentiellt inducera en
konformationsförändring

på

de

positivt

laddade

peptiderna

genomfördes

kontaktvinkelmätningar under vatten. Baserat på cykliska voltammetrimätningar valdes
– 0,4 V och + 0,2 V som den negativa, respektive positiva, potentialen som applicerades
över plattformarna.

6.4 Resultat och diskussion
PEDOT:PSS-filmernas löslighet i organiska lösningar
För

att

PEDOT:PSS-filmerna

skulle

kunna

användas

som

bioelektroniska

aktiveringsplattformar var det av största vikt att filmerna var stabila och olösliga i de
organiska lösningarna PBS och DMF. Dessa två lösningar användes under
biofunktionaliseringsprocessen, dvs. processen där de laddade peptiderna fästes vid
filmytan. För att analysera ifall tillsatsen av GOPS resulterade i stabila och olösliga filmer
mättes absorptionen av filmer som var inkuberade i PBS och DMF och jämfördes med
filmer som inte hade inkuberats. Ett differensspektrum av transmissionen, dvs. hur
mycket ljus som passerade genom de inkuberade filmerna, jämfört med en oinkuberad
film, beräknades och presenteras i figur 6.5 för PH1000.

Figur 6.5. Differensspektrum av transmissionen för PH1000-filmerna. Notera skillnaden
i skalorna för de två våglängdsintervallerna.

En negativ skillnad i differensspektrumet indikerar att mera ljus passerar genom provet,
vilket innebär att det finns mindre film som kan absorbera ljuset. Däremot indikerar en
liten förändring, dvs. en förändring nära noll, att samma mängd ljus passerar genom
provet. Ingen signifikant förändring har således skett i filmen. Från figur 6.5 är det klart
att filmerna utan GOPS som inkuberats i antingen PBS eller DMF släpper igenom mera
ljus. Från figuren är det även uppenbart att skillnaden i transmissionen av PH1000filmerna med GOPS förblir nära noll. Detta indikerar två saker: i) tillsatsen av GOPS
ändrar inte filmen avsevärt och ii) tillsatsen av GOPS resulterar i stabila filmer eftersom
ingen förändring i mängden ljus som passerar genom filmerna sker fastän de har
inkuberats i PBS och DMF. Samma resultat erhölls även för AI4083-filmerna. Återigen

var det uppenbart att utan GOPS i polymerlösningen påverkades filmerna kraftigt av
inkubation i både PBS och DMF. Genom att tillsätta GOPS i PEDOT:PSS-lösningarna
erhölls däremot stabila och olösliga filmer.

Ledningsförmågan i PEDOT:PSS-filmerna
Ledningsförmågan av två olika filmtjocklekar av PH1000:chem och AI4083:chem mättes
med

en

fyrpunktssond.

Ledningsförmågan

i

PH1000:chem-filmerna

efter

biofunktionalisering mättes också för att se om biofunktionaliseringen påverkade filmens
ledningsförmåga. Ledningsförmågan för de olika proven hittas i tabell 6.1.

Resultaten visar att PH1000:chem-filmerna är betydligt mer ledande än AI4083:chemfilmerna. Skillnaden i ledningsförmågan mellan dessa PEDOT:PSS-lösningar kan
förklaras orsakas av skillnaden i förhållandet mellan PEDOT-till-PSS. AI4083 har ett
förhållande på 1:6, medan PH1000 har ett förhållande på 1:2,5; vilket innebär att det finns
mer PSS i de resulterande AI4083-filmerna jämfört med PH1000-filmerna. Som nämnts
tidigare har en högre mängd PSS argumenterats leda till en lägre ledningsförmåga och
således är resultaten i bra överenskommelse med vad som var förväntat. Resultaten visar
även att filmtjockleken inte påverkade ledningsförmågan signifikant, vilket också har
rapporterats av andra [52]. Resultaten visar även att biofunktionaliseringen av
PH1000:chem-filmen inte påverkade filmens ledningsförmåga.

Antalet tillgängliga amingrupper på ytan
Funktionalisering av ytor med hjälp av amingrupper har rapporterats öka adhesionen av
biomolekyler [53, 54]. Antalet tillgängliga amingrupper på ytor kan kvantifieras med
hjälp av en 4-NBA analys [53, 55, 56]. Yttätheten av 4-NBA motsvarar yttätheten av
tillgängliga amingrupper (1:1 förhållande), vilket i sin tur sägs motsvara antalet
bindningsplatser för biomolekyler. En 4-NBA analys användes för att se om silanisering
med APTES resulterade i tillgängliga amingrupper på PEDOT:PSS-filmerna. Fyra olika
provtyper: ITO och glas samt PH1000:chem- och AI4083:chem-filmer jämfördes med
avseende på yttätheten av tillgängliga amingrupper. Resultatet av denna analys hittas i
tabell 6.2.

Mätningen visar att den högsta yttätheten av tillgängliga amingrupper erhölls för vanligt
glas. PH1000:chem-filmerna visade en lite högre yttäthet av amingrupper jämfört med
AI4083:chem-filmerna. Detta innebär att det finns flera bindningsplatser för peptiderna
på PH1000:chem-filmytan efter funktionalisering genom silanisering. Denna mätning
visade även att utan silanisering erhölls inga tillgängliga amingrupper på ytorna.
Silaniseringsprocessen är därmed kritisk för att man skall kunna fästa peptider på
filmytorna.

Kontaktvinkelmätningar under vatten
Kontaktvinkelmätningar under vatten utfördes på biofunktionaliserade PH1000:chemfilmer på ITO substrat för att se om en potentiellt inducerad konformationsförändring på
de positivt laddade peptiderna kunde uppnås. PH1000:chem-filmen valdes för denna
mätning på basen av filmens ledningsförmåga och antalet amingrupper som var
66

Anni Eklund

6. SUMMARY IN SWEDISH – SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING

tillgängliga efter silanisering. Som kontrollgrupp analyserades även prov där peptiderna
utelämnades. Dessa kontrollprov fungerade som referenser för att se om förändringen i
kontaktvinkeln berodde på peptidens konformation och inte på en förändring i själva
PEDOT:PSS-filmen.
Några problem noterades under mätningarna som är bra att nämna: för det första varierade
storleken på oljedropparna avsevärt, även om inga ändringar i parametrarna gjordes under
eller mellan mätningarna. Det har noterats att kontaktvinkeln kan beror på droppstorleken
beroende på ytans heterogenitet [58, 59]. Effekten droppstorleken har i detta specifika
system är okänd, vilket innebär att skillnaden i oljedroppens storlek kan ha haft en stor
inverkan på kontaktvinklarna. De resultat som erhölls kan därför vara vilseledande och
bör tolkas kritiskt.
För det andra noterades det att droppens kontaktvinkel ändrades som funktion av tiden.
En minskning av kontaktvinkeln på alla provtyper noterades då kontaktvinkeln för samma
droppe mättes efter några minuter igen (utan att ändra potentialen över ytan). En möjlig
förklaring till detta kan vara polymerfilmens hydrogelstruktur [60] och dess växelverkan
med elektrolyten. Ytterligare mätningar behövs dock innan en slutsats om hur
PH1000:chem-filmen och systemet påverkar kontaktvinkeln som funktion av tiden kan
dras.
För det tredje visade mätningarna att kontaktvinkeln minskade för droppar som färdigt
var placerade på ytan då en potential applicerades. Först mättes kontaktvinklarna för två
droppar på varje film då ingen potential applicerats, varefter antingen – 0,4 V eller
+ 0,2 V applicerades och kontaktvinklarna för samma droppar mättes igen. Samma
resultat erhölls för alla provtyper, dvs. de med peptider och kontrollproven, oavsett av
potentialens polaritet. Denna observation innebär att oljedropparna attraherades av
ytorna, dvs. filmerna blev mer oleofiliska efter att en potential applicerats över dem.
Eftersom samma effekt noterades för både de reducerade och oxiderade PH1000:chemfilmerna, med och utan peptider, kan man dra slutsatsen att det finns en gemensam faktor
bakom minskningen av kontaktvinkeln. Förändringen i kontaktvinkeln efter att en
potential applicerats var av samma storlek som den som observerades för droppar mätta
med några minuters mellanrum och kan därmed ha orsakats på grund av polymerfilmens
hydrogelstruktur och dess växelverkan med elektrolyten. Mera mätningar krävs dock för
att få en bättre uppfattning om detta.

6. SUMMARY IN SWEDISH – SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING

För att jämföra plattformarna med och utan peptiderna utan att en minskning i
kontaktvinkeln hann ske, mättes kontaktvinklarna för oljedropparna omedelbart efter att
dropparna placerats på filmytan. För båda plattformversionerna, dvs. med peptider och
kontroll versionerna, användes separata plattformar för applicering av den positiva och
negativa potentialen. Förändringen i ytspänningen efter att potentialen applicerats
beräknades sedan med hjälp av ekvation
′
∆𝛾 = 𝛾𝑜𝑙 (cos 𝜃𝑜𝑙
− cos 𝜃𝑜𝑙 )
′
där 𝜃𝑜𝑙
var kontaktvinkeln mätt efter att potentialen applicerats, 𝜃𝑜𝑙 kontaktvinkeln som

mättes innan potentialen applicerats och 𝛾𝑜𝑙 = 26,54 ± 0,51 mN m-1 är gränsspänningen
mellan oljedroppen och elektrolyten [49]. Skillnaden, ∆γ, är ett mått på hur mycket
ytspänningen förändrades efter att en potential applicerats över PH1000:chem-filmen.
Resultaten av denna analys finns i figur 6.6.

Figur 6.6. Förändring i ytspänningen efter att en potential applicerats över plattformen
jämfört med när ingen potential applicerats. De prickade linjerna separerar olika
sampelversioner och varje kolumn inom ett prickat område representerar skilda droppar.
De heldragna linjerna separerar olika provtyper. De blå kolumnerna indikerar en ökning
av ytspänningen, beige nästan ingen förändring (< 0,5) och de röda en minskning av
ytspänningen.
68

Anni Eklund

6. SUMMARY IN SWEDISH – SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING

Figur 6.6 visar en ökning av ytspänningen när en negativ potential applicerats över
filmerna med peptiderna (SV1 – 0.4 V). Detta motsvarar en minskning av
kontaktvinkeln, dvs. oljedroppen attraheras av ytan och ytan är därmed mera oleofilisk.
När en positiv potential applicerats över filmerna med peptiderna, kan man se en
minskning av ytspänningen som motsvarar en ökning av kontaktvinkeln. Ytan har alltså
blivit mera oleofobisk. Som diskuterades i kapitel 6.2.2 resulterar en negativ potential
över polymerfilmen i att den positivt laddade, dvs. hydrofila, ändgruppen av peptiderna
böjs ner mot ytan och därmed döljs. Detta skulle göra ytan mer oleofilisk. En positiv
potential över polymerfilmen resulterar däremot i att den hydrofila ändgruppen av
peptiden repelleras bort från ytan, vilket gör ytan mer hydrofil. dvs. oleofobisk.
Hypotesen om hur plattformen borde fungera och resultaten är alltså i god enighet för
PH1000:chem-filmerna funktionaliserade med de positivt laddade peptiderna. För att få
en bättre förståelse om hur PH1000:chem-filmerna påverkar peptidernas konformation
och för att förstärka hypotesen skulle man kunna upprepa mätningarna med filmer
biofunktionaliserade med negativt laddade peptider. Ifall plattformen skulle fungera som
det antas skulle applicering av en positiv eller negativ potential resultera i en motsatt
hydrofilicitet till vad som erhölls då filmerna biofunktionaliserats med positivt laddade
peptider.
För kontrollproven, dvs. där det inte fanns någon peptid på ytan, kunde man se en
minskning av ytspänningen när både en positiv och en negativ potential applicerats. Ytan
blev alltså mer oleofobisk i båda fallen. Det är värt att notera att PH1000:chemkontrollproven hade biofunktionaliserats ända upp till peptidbindningen. Streptavidinmolekylen på ytan av kontrollproven kan således ha påverkats av en förändring i
PEDOT:PSS-filmens ytegenskaper orsakat av potentialen som applicerats. Streptavidinmolekylen kan i sin tur ha påverkat hydrofiliciteten av kontrollproven. Fler mätningar
krävs dock för att få en bättre förståelse om hur PEDOT:PSS-filmens ytegenskaper
påverkas av en potentialförändring och hur denna förändring påverkar streptavidinmolekylen och filmens hydrofilicitet.
Resultaten från detta arbete visade att det är möjligt att använda PEDOT:PSS-filmer som
bioelektroniska aktiveringsplattformer. Flera experiment krävs dock för att få en bättre
förståelse för hur potentialen över filmerna påverkar konformationen av laddade peptider
och hur aktiveringsplattformen kan optimeras för framtida användning.
