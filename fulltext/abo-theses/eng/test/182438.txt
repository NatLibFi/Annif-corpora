Abstract
For the past decades, the Blaine value has been the predominant characteristic when
controlling the process parameters of a cement grinding circuit. The Blaine method
measures the permeability of the cement, and therefore, describes the fineness of the
cement. This thesis investigated how the particle size distribution (PSD) could be
implemented as input data to the process control in a closed grinding circuit. This thesis
consists of sets of experiments exploring the effects of process parameters on the PSD
of the product.
A series of experiments were conducted to study how process parameter changes
affected the particle size distribution of the product. The results from the first and the
second sets of experiments showed that the PSD of the cement changed only by small
margins when the Blaine value was kept constant. Several linear regression models
were developed to understand the effect size of process parameter changes on PSD
characteristics of the product.
The third set of experiments was conducted to study the effects of the separator speed
and separator airflow on the product's PSD without maintaining a constant Blaine value.
Changes to separator speeds and separator airflow significantly affected the PSD of the
product. The process parameter changes did not have a linear effect on PSD
characteristics. Thus, future research should explore the non-linear behavior of process
parameters on the PSD of the product.

1 Introduction
For decades, the cement industry has used the Blaine value, a mean of the specific area
for particles (m2/kg), to control the cement grinding process. The Blaine value is a wellestablished permeability parameter that gives an average number for a sample that does
not necessarily describe cement quality in the same manner as a Particle Size
Distribution (PSD) curve. Although the Blaine value analysis is an established method
for cement, there are a few significant limitations. For example, the Blaine value can be
identical for two entirely different cement samples with different performance
characteristics because the Blaine value is merely a mean value. Another limitation of
Blaine analysis is that the accuracy declines with a large fraction of fine particles. The
measurement technology is often manual and, therefore, difficult to incorporate into an
autonomous system.
As cement performance is related to the composition and the general distribution of the
particle sizes, it is essential to analyze these properties to fully determine the cement
quality at an early stage. With the particle analyzer Camsizer, which produces dynamic
image analysis (DIA), Finnsementti can produce new continuous data sets and
accurately describe the cement quality. We may better understand the cement sample
quality by characterizing different factors of interest from the PSD curve, which is not
possible for the Blaine method. For example, from a PSD curve, one can attain
information about the fraction of the fine particles in a cement sample, which is
impossible by solely analyzing the Blaine value.
Generally, Portland Cement (PC) should have between 50-70% of its particles between
the size interval from 2 and 32 microns in order to have desired attributes (Blasco).
Also, small particles are good for early setting times, while big particles give longer
(28-day) setting times, predicted from the PSD curve. However, an excess number of
fine particles 3 µm or smaller may result in the cement curing exothermically, rupturing
the final product. Factors such as these are easily monitorable with analysis methods
that consider a particle distribution, which the Blaine method does not.

2
The use of DIAs for the steering of the process could enhance the cement quality and
simultaneously keep drift conditions stable. By monitoring factors from a PSD curve,
for example, the slope of the curve ‘n’ and the particle size after 50% of the material has
passed ‘d50’ and adjusting process parameters based on the factors from the PSD curve,
the final product should be more consistent. By analyzing the correlation between the
DIA and cement quality parameters, a process can be optimized to manufacture good
cement quality. If useful and consistent correlations are found, which can be
implemented into the process control, an opportunity to automize the production further
arises. By continuously analyzing the cement quality with DIA, a process can be
adapted to minor changes during operation.
This project aims to have process-specific recommendations on producing consistent
and high-quality cement based on the desired PSD curve for said cement.
This thesis will examine the usage of analysis methods for the steering of the cement
grinding process, which could improve the overall quality by making the cement a more
consistent, reproducible product. This may be accomplished by adjusting process
parameters, e.g., separator RPMs and feed air, with the help of data from DIAs to make
consistent and high-quality cement.

2 Theory
2.1 Cement production
Cement is a hydraulic binder used in the construction industry for strong and stable
bonds with additive aggregates, e.g., sand, gravel, and crushed stone. Cement consists
mainly of Portland Cement Clinker (PCC), consisting of limestone, clay constituents,
silica sands, and iron oxide substances. Some modern cement types do not consist
mainly of PCC, for example, some CEM III types. Cement classification will be
discussed later in this thesis.
Clinker ingredients are ground to form a raw meal homogenized in a silo and preheated
in cyclones, eventually burned in a clinker kiln. High calorific fuels are used in a clinker
kiln to maintain a high temperature in the kiln. At Finnsementti Parainen, typical fuels
are coal, asphaltene, and alternative fuels, i.e., rubber and recycled alternative fuels. The
raw meal is in direct contact with the flame in the clinker kiln, and therefore, the clinker
is affected by the fuel types used. In preheating, the raw meal goes through a series of
cyclones heating up as the raw meal is fed into the clinker kiln. At 900 ℃, the raw meal
starts to calcinate, i.e., CO2 is released from the intermediate product. In the rotating
clinker kiln, temperatures rise to 1450 ℃, and clinker balls form. The clinker is quickly
cooled, which leads to microcracks within alite crystals that are beneficial in the cement
grinding process. Rapid cooling of the clinker is also necessary for the clinker to obtain
good hydraulic properties.
Grinding of clinker and other additives, e.g., blast furnace slag, fly ash, limestone, and
gypsum, occurs in a vertical ball mill to make cement. All feed components have unique
grindability traits and affect the PSD of the cement. Generally, harder clinkers result in
higher circulation loads (Belhaj m.fl. 2016). After the grinding mill, the classifier
separates particles according to their sizes. Airflow and the ratio between separator feed
and air are two crucial parameters that affect the PSD of cement. The bag filter
minimizes emissions after the separator. Pressure losses may occur in bag filters, which
affect the PSD of cement directly. Cement is finally transported to silos, from where it
will be loaded to bulk transport vessels (boats or trucks).

4

2.2 Particle Size Distribution
Particle size distribution (PSD) describes the relative sizes of particles in a powder. The
PSD of cement is often plotted according to either the Gates-Gaudin-Schaumann (GGS)
or the Rosin-Rammler-Sperling-Bennet (RRSB) mathematical formulas as given below.
These methods highlight different size fractions that are of great importance to cement’s
chemical and mechanical structure. Different PSD profiles give varying early and late
strength development characteristics. The PSD profile also affects the capillary porosity
percolation, diffusivity, heat transfer, exothermic reactions, microstructure, and
shrinkage (Celik 2009).

Figure 1 Cumulative PSD curve for separator flows (Finnsementti 2021)

The correlation between PSD characteristics and cement strength has been researched to
some degree. The strength of cement is influenced mainly by particles between the size
of 3 to 32 µm, and particles over 60 microns have practically no other function than a
“filing” factor for the cement. Celik notes that the PSD curve should contain over 65%
of its particles between 3 and 32 µm and around 10% under 3 µm (Celik 2009). Due to
differences in the measurement techniques, the Blaine value may differ from case to
case. For example, specific cement particle areas were obtained using laser diffraction
and permeability tests (Ferraris & Garboczi 2013).

5

Celik also concludes that the late strength of cement is affected the most by particles in
the 16 to 24 µm fraction, where smaller particles are mainly affected by the early
strengths of the cement (Celik 2009). Overgrinding is not desirable for cement due to
extra energy costs and because finer types of cement produce more heat (by drying
faster) when solidifying, which can cause cracks in the final product. However, if the
product is not ground enough and too coarse, the final product has a prolonged
solidification period and may fail to sufficiently reach a sufficient strength.
The factor ‘n’ in a PSD defines the steepness or the spread of the function. The curve’s
steepness is related to how uniformly the particle sizes are divided and related to the
cement's characteristics. A wide PSD curve increases the packing density of the cement
as small particles get into the pore structure created by larger particles, leading to a
reduced water demand. If the uniformity factor is close to 1, the PSD curve is very narrow,
which enhances the hydration reaction rate. Kuhlman et al. argue that if the particle size
distribution within the 15-32 µm interval is the same for two sets of cement, the longterm strength will be roughly the same as this range influences the long-term strength the
most (Kuhlmann m.fl. 1985).
Kuhlmann et al. also studied the Blaine value, uniformity factor, and position parameter
effects on cement hydration. They concluded that the same hydration rates could be
achieved for cement with high Blaine and wide PSD curves with low Blaine and narrow
PSD curves. The increase of strength in types of cement with narrow uniformity factor is
due to a proportional increase of hydrated fine particles. If the Blaine value can be
lowered, some energy-saving measures may be implemented, as the grinding is not as
extensive.

2.2.1 Rosin-Rammler-Sperling-Bennett

The Rosin-Rammler-Sperling-Bennett (RRSB) distribution method is a mathematical
expression widely used in the cement industry to characterize cement and other fine

6
materials to make PSD curves. With the coefficients from the RRSB method, it is
possible to implement quality control measures for the manufacturing process.
RRSB is useful for grinding operations involving a wide range of particle sizes(Jess &
Wasserscheid 2020). The RRSB equation may be written as:

𝑅=𝑒

−(

𝑛
𝑑
)
𝑑𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛

(1)

where R is the mass fraction, 𝑑𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 is the mean particle size when R=1/e=0.368 and n
is the spread measurement for the function (Allen 1997).
The equation can be rearranged to its more common form:
1

log (log (𝑅)) = 𝑛 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑑

𝑑

𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛

) + log(log(𝑒))

(2)

or:
1
𝑑
)
ln (ln ( )) = 𝑛 𝑙𝑛 (
𝑅
𝑑𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛

(3)

1

The parameter n is the slope of a straight line when log (log (𝑅)) is plotted against
𝑛 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑑

𝑑

𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛

). According to Jess & Wasserscheid, an “ideal” RRSB function is shown

in Figure 2 with a straight one-to-one line.

7

Figure 2 Example of an ideal particles size distribution curve according to the RRSB function for n=1,3: (a) Eq.1 and
(b) Eq.2

Only a few studies have been made comparing RRSB and lognormal distributions for
cementitious materials. The RRSB method produces more fitting errors for non-grinded
materials in PSD curves compared with the lognormal method. Therefore, a lognormal
distribution method may be a more reliable to develop PSD curves than the RRSB
method, especially if the sample has large ratios of non-grinded materials such as blast
furnace slag or fly ash (Gao m.fl. 2018).
At Finnsementti Parainen, the Dynamic Image Analysis (DIA) tool Camsizer is used.
The Camsizer utilizes RRSB curves to produce Gaussian distributions as PSDs. DIA is
discussed in more detail later in this thesis.

2.3 Cement characteristics
There are many cement sorts, each sort with unique characteristics designed for specific
tasks. Cement sorts are characterized according to the EN197-1 standard in Europe.
Table 1 lists the differences in cement according to EN197-1.

8
Table 1 Common types of cement characterized according to the EN 197-1 standard (British Standards Institution
2011)

The cement type in focus for this thesis is a CEM II/A-LL 42,5 R (Rapid). The
production feed for Rapid is 87-89% clinker, 5-6% gypsum, 4-6% limestone, and
additives such as filter dust (bypass) and grinding aids. The relatively large amounts of

9
clinker in Rapid production means that the clinker properties have a significant effect on
grindability and, ultimately, the PSD of the product.

2.3.1 Clinker and its ingredients

Cement is a mixture of ingredients, which can be noted in Table 1 above. The main
ingredient for cement is clinker. Clinker is formed in a rotating kiln where it sinters to
roughly spherical shapes with diameters between 0.5 and 5 cm. Limestone containing
silica, alumina, and iron oxides is the main ingredient for clinker. The intermediate
product mainly consists of alites, belites, aluminates, ferrites, and free CaO, among
other things (Ferrari m.fl. 2012). A simplified version of clinker burning in a cement
kiln is demonstrated in the stoichiometry below.

𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑒 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝑎𝑡 1400 ℃):
𝐶𝑎𝑂 + 2𝐶𝑎𝑂2 · 𝑆𝑖𝑂2 → 3𝐶𝑎𝑂 · 𝑆𝑖𝑂2
Tricalcium silicate, alite, or C3S, is a main ingredient of clinker. Alite is directly
correlated with early strengths for cement due to its large fraction of Ca, which
increases reactivity. Alite contains a large number of micro-cracks which improves the
grindability. Micro-cracks are formed when the clinker is rapidly cooled (Ravaszová &
Dvorak 2018). When Odigure studied the alite particle size optical photography, it was

10
found that the alite crystal size was predominately between 20 and 30 µm when clinker
was burned at 1380 ℃. When clinker was burned at 1420 ℃, alite started recrystallizing
to larger alite crystals (Odigure 1999).
Belite mainly consists of dicalcium silicate and contributes to the late strength of cement
due to its low reactivity. Belite is more difficult to grind than alite, especially if belite is
clustered in the clinker. The grindability of the clinker impacts the PSD of the ground
material, especially for cement types that contain large ratios of clinker (Maki m.fl.
1993). The amount of alite and belite in clinker affects the total energy cost of cement
grinding.
Calcium-aluminate, also known as C3A, provides early high heat generation in cement.
C3A is primarily formed of calcium oxides from limestone and secondarily from other
aluminum sources such as bauxite. The hydration of cement is enhanced if the particle
size of C3A is small, i.e., less than 10 µm, and its PSD curve narrow due to increased
contact between particles and water (Liu m.fl. 2019). C3A has a crucial role in
developing good conditions in the kiln during clinker production by transforming it into
an intermediate melt.
Calcium aluminoferrite, ferrite or C4AF, does not directly contribute to cement
properties but functions as an intermediate melt product to obtain sufficient conditions
in the kiln for cement production. Ferrite is a dark-colored mineral and contributes to
the color of the cement. Like belite, ferrite has poor grindability properties due to high
mechanical strength in the mineral. However, research shows that ferrite may influence
microcrack fixation clinker surface, which improves clinker grindability (Odigure
1999).
Alite, belite, calcium-aluminate, ferrite, and other clinker minerals have different
physical characteristics and have significant differences in grindability, which should be
noted when producing cement. The initial grindability of the clinker is mainly
influenced by the porosity of the clinker. The effect of porosity on grindability gradually
lessens over the grinding process, and during intermediate grinding, the alite content is
the predominant factor for grindability. Aluminate and aluminoferrite content affect the
final grindability of clinker (Tavares m.fl. 2009).

11
Process steering using PSD values benefit when standard deviations are minimized in
clinker production i.e. when clinker quality and structure of minerals are consistent over
time. In reality, there will always be deviations in clinker quality which affects the
grinding process of cement and the PSD characteristics of cement. The relative amounts
of clinker minerals on a typical clinker are given in Table 2.

2.3.2 Other cement ingredients

For Rapid production, around 12% of the total feed is composed of other minerals than
those that make up the clinker. The most significant non-clinker ingredient is gypsum
which is just above 6% of the total feed. For multi-component cement, the grindability
of components affects the PSD of the cement. Components that are easily grindable
contribute to types of cement with a wide PSD curve. For example, types of cement
with fly ash or limestone generally have wider PSD curves than cement types
containing trass, as fly ash and limestone are generally softer minerals and, therefore,
more grindable (Opoczky 1996).
The primary purpose of gypsum is to slow down cement's hydration rate and allow
longer setting times after water is added to the cement. PCCs with gypsum tend to have
higher strengths than non-gypsum types of cement due to their high amounts of SO3,
which is crucial for high-strength PCCs. When gypsum is ground, it turns into
hemihydrate gypsum where approximately three-quarters of the water in the original
hydrated gypsum is evaporated (Öksüzoğlu & Uçurum 2016). Gypsum is a soft and
easily grindable mineral that also reduces particle agglomeration.

12

Limestone is used as an inert filler which enhances the compressive strength, water
demand, and workability for multi-component types of cement (Vuk m.fl. 2001).
Limestone is a soft mineral compared with clinker, which improves its grindability and,
therefore, its pulverization.
Grinding aids are used to minimize particle agglomeration by reducing electrostatic
forces in cement particles. Grinding aids do not directly impact the PSD of the cement
due to the small amount added. However, its effects on the Tromp curve and separator
efficiency (both to be discussed later in this thesis) impact the cement production, and
ultimately, the PSD of the product.

2.3.3 Blaine
The Blaine value measures the specific area of a powder and relates to the fineness of
the powder. Blaine is expressed as cm2/g or m2/kg, where a higher Blaine number
correlates with a powder with more surface area, i.e., smaller particles (Tsakalakis &
Stamboltzis 2008). The operating principle of the Blaine value is based on the
proportionality between a level of fineness (or the specific area) and the permeability of
the testbed. During the test, airflow through a cement bed is measured with vacuum and
atmospheric pressure on the other side. The surface area is calculated with the KozenyCarman approximation theory, which assumes spherical shapes for the cement particles
(Ferraris & Garboczi 2013).
Generally, it is assumed that the Blaine index correlates with physical characteristics of
the cement, such as rheology, setting time, and fluid strength. However, due to the
Blaine index being a mean parameter of the specific area of the particles, the Blaine
index cannot describe a whole PSD curve. Therefore, cement characteristics cannot be
fully defined by the Blaine value alone. The Blaine analysis method does not consider
the actual shape of cement particles but assumes spherical particles. The assumption of
spherical particles is, however, common for many analysis methods in the cement
industry. Blaine also does not reflect a particle's specific area, as there are dead zones on
the particle surface due to nonturbulent airflow leading to no airflow at the surface. The
actual specific area being larger than the Blaine value has consequences when

13
predicting the quality of hydration (Ferraris & Garboczi 2013). The fineness of cement
is influenced by the fresh feed material feed, separator speed, and the airflow in the
separator (Schneider m.fl. 2011a). At Finnsementti, the Blaine analysis method is
conducted according to the ASTM C204 standard, the most common method in the
cement industry.

2.3.4 Sieve Analysis
The sieve residue analysis measures the fraction of particles above a specific size that
stays on a wire mesh. Sieve residue analysis is not a standard analysis method in largescale production environments due to it being expensive and requiring much time. Sieve
analysis is also relatively easy to replace with laser diffraction or dynamic image
analysis, as the same information is easily obtained from a PSD curve (Ferraris &
Garboczi 2013).
2.3.5 Laser Diffraction
Laser diffraction works based on the principle of Fraunhofer diffraction theory, which
states the proportionality of the particle size and the intensity of light scattering when
light hits the particle. Laser diffraction (LD) measurements can be conducted either in a
liquid (wet-LD) or a gas (dry-LD). A key benefit of LD analysis is a PSD curve, which
the Blaine method or sieve analysis does not produce. However, LD assumes that
particles are spherical, which is not the case for cement particles, although commonly
assumed (Bowen m.fl. 2016).

2.3.6 Dynamic Image Analysis

At Finnsementti Parainen, PSD curves are produced using the Camsizer X2 by having a
flow of particles passing a camera system. The advantage of having a dynamic system
compared with a static system is the reliability of the result as the number of particles is
much larger. Camsizer X2 has two cameras where the top camera analyzes big particles
and the bottom camera small particles. The cement sample is fed into a vibrating chute,
distributing the sample evenly into the Camsizer X2. The sample falls through the field
of view, where both cameras analyze the particles used to form a PSD of the sample.

14
Finally, the particles are automatically discarded by a vacuum cleaner. The data
collected from the Camsizer X2 are collected into MS-XLS, see Figure 3, which can
subsequently be used to develop a PSD of the sample.

Figure 3 Demonstration of the data of a cement sample analyzed with the Camsizer X2

The measuring range for the Camsizer X2 is between 0.8 µm and 8 mm, which covers
well the particles size range for PCC. The basic functioning principle for the Camsizer
X2 is given in Figure 4.

2.3.7 Ball mill

A ball mill is used for grinding raw materials and reject feed from the separator. The
ball mill is divided into two chambers which are separated by a diaphragm. In the first
chamber, the grinding of coarse material is conducted by a cataract motion of the balls,
i.e., the rotating mill lifts the balls, and the impact of the fall crushes the feed material.

16
In the second chamber, a cascade motion of the balls grinds the material, mainly as a
shear force. Generally, the ball diameter in the first chamber is 60-90 mm, and in the
second chamber, 40-50 mm and 17-30 mm. Smaller balls grind the material to a finer
product but use proportionally more energy. Cement grinding constitutes roughly 30%
of the total energy demand in cement production, highlighting the need for optimized
griding practices (Tsakalakis & Stamboltzis 2008).
The temperature in the mill should be uniform. Suppose the temperature is too low in
the mill. In that case, the moisture of the raw materials may cause problems in the
diaphragm. However, too high temperatures cause de-watering in the gypsum, which
lowers the cement quality. A suitable temperature for the outlet feed is 120 °C. Also, the
airflow through the mill should be kept constant as it removes moisture, cools the
process, and, to some degree, transports the material forward. A too high airflow may
lead to insufficient grinding of the material.
2.3.8 Separator / classifier
At Finnsementti, a third-generation dynamic separator is used to separate particles from
the mill outlet in a closed milling system. The material feed to the separator is fed from
the top to a rotating distribution plate. The material is dispersed by circulating air and
forms a cylindrical distribution in the classifying zone. The material is forced between
guide vanes and a rotating cage. The drag force pulls the material towards the rotating
cage, and the centrifugal force pushes the material back towards the guiding vanes. The
difference in particle sizes allows the small particles to penetrate the rotating cage and
be further transported as a product. The coarse particles are bounced back by the
rotating cage and guided into vanes and from there back to the grinding circuit. In
Figure 5, the forces that affect the feed and the basic operating principle are
demonstrated.

17

Figure 5 Separating forces affecting the particle in the separation zone (Belhaj m.fl. 2016)

The separation process is affected by:
•

The spin rotor blades' position, number of spin rotor blades, distributor plate
speed, and material leaks affect operating parameters and technical
specifications.

•

The PSD and the humidity of the infeed material, density, and feed rate affect
the Separator feed.

•

Feed air is affected by temperature, humidity, feed rate, viscosity, and density
(Belhaj m.fl. 2016).

In a top-feed third-generation separator, the material is subjected to centrifugal force
(Fc), drag force (Fd), and gravity (Fg):

From equations 1-3, one can notice that the difference in the forces is dictated mainly by
the particle diameter, i.e., particle size (Toprak & Benzer 2019).
The coarse particles are returned to the mill as a reject feed to be further ground, while
the fine particles continue to the product silos via a bag filter. At Finnsementti Parainen,
bag filters are used for separating particles from the outgoing air.
Separators are used in grinding processes to enhance the effectiveness of the process
and to save energy.
2.3.8.1 Tromp curve

The Tromp curve is used to measure the effectiveness of a separator. This method is
standard throughout the cement industry, which is beneficial for comparing efficiency
results. The Tromp curve describes different size fractions in the coarse stream of the

19
separator. The grade efficiency curve (GEC) describes the size fraction in the fine
stream.
Figure 6 compares a typical Tromp curve to an ideal step function. The bypass point is
the lowest in the Tromp curve and, therefore, indicates which size fraction is most
efficiently separated. Generally, the left side of the bypass point gives higher values
than the actual bypass point. The phenomenon is known as a fish-hook. Fish-hooks
occur due to the agglomeration of small particles caused by electrostatic charges in the
second compartment of the ball mill. Small particles that become charged tend to stick
to each other and form momentarily large clumps or stick to large particles and end up
in the return feed (Belhaj m.fl. 2016). Therefore, a less controlled separation is obtained
for very small particles. Material with low fluidity correlates with a larger fish-hook in
classifiers (Altun m.fl. 2016). The electrostatic charges can be reduced with additives in
the milling process, which enhances the effectivity of the separator (Toprak & Benzer
2019).

Figure 6 Demonstration of an ideal separator (Belhaj m.fl. 2016)

The sharpness factor, k, measures the steepness of the Tromp curve and is calculated
according to:
𝐷

𝑘 = 𝐷75
25

(7)

20
where D25 and D75 are the particle sizes for which 25% and 75% of the product mass
fraction have passed.
An ideal separator would assume the sharpness value to k = 1 and bypass = 0. In the
ideal case, all particles larger than the cut size would flow back to the mill, and the
particles smaller than the cut size would be obtained as a product.
The Tromp curve and the GEC can be calculated according to:

𝑇𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑝 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑣𝑒 =

𝑓2𝑖

𝑓 −𝑓

2𝑖

(8)

3𝑖

𝑓3𝑖 𝑓1𝑖 − 𝑓2𝑖
∙
𝑓1𝑖 𝑓3𝑖 − 𝑓2𝑖

𝐺𝐸𝐶 =

(9)

Critical parameters for the Tromp curve are:
•

Cut size, X50 is the particle size for which 50% of the material passes. The
cut size is directly proportional to the airflow rate to separator wheel speed
(Altun m.fl. 2016).

•

Sharpness, k, is the measurement of steepness between 25% and 75% of the
material.

•

The minimum indicates the bypass or short circuit in the curve. The bypass
demonstrates which size fraction is most efficiently separated.

At a steady-state process, the mass balance is:
𝐵1 = 𝐵2 + 𝐵3

(10)

B1 is the separator feed mass flow, B2 is the coarse mass flow or the separator return,
and B3 is the fine mass flow or the product. Figure 7 demonstrates mass flows B1, B2,
and B3. The equation can be further developed to:

21
(11)

𝐵1 𝑓1𝑖 = 𝐵2 𝑓2𝑖 + 𝐵3 𝑓3𝑖

where 𝑓1𝑖 , 𝑓2𝑖 , 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑓3𝑖 describe a portion of the material in the i-th fraction size of B1,
B2, and B3 feeds. For material feeds, the index i is 0-1 µm, 1-2 µm, 2-3 µm, etc.
The fractional value for a specific particle size can be calculated according to:

𝑇𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑝 (𝑖) =

𝐵2 𝑓2𝑖
𝐵1 𝑓1𝑖

(12)

Figure 7 Grinding flows, Julin 2021.

The circulation factor CF and the circulation flow CL describe the ratio between material
flows in the cement grinding system. These are valuable parameters for the optimization
of the grinding system. A too low circulation factor may indicate that the system is not
optimized correctly. A high circulation factor indicates that the feed rate is too high and
that the separation in the dynamic separator is poor. The circulation CF and the
circulation flow CL are calculated according to:

2.3.8.2 Other separator efficiency measurements

The imperfection factor, I, is a guiding estimate of the separator efficiency and is
calculated according to:

𝐼=

𝑑75 − 𝑑25
2 ∙ 𝑑50

(14)

Factors d75, d50, d25 are the particle sizes for 75%, 50%, and 25% of the Tromp curve yaxis. The classification of the separator quality using the imperfection factor is
demonstrated in Table 4.

Table 4 Classification of separator quality using the imperfection factor I

I < 0.2

0.4 < I < 0.6

Excellent separator

Poor separator

0.2 < I < 0.3

0.6 < I < 0.7

Good separator

Bad separator

0.3 < I <0.4

0.7 > I

Normal separator

Execrable separator

Suppose a, f, and r are specific fineness for separator feed mill discharge, the fine
fraction of the product, and the coarse fraction of the back-feed material. In that case,
respectively, the separator efficiency can be calculated:

η=

𝑎−𝑟 𝑓
∙ ∙ 100%
𝑓−𝑟 𝑎

(15)

The separator efficiency equation does not describe the proportion of fine particles in
the return feed and is, for this reason, not as helpful as a Tromp curve analysis (Belhaj
m.fl. 2016). It is essential to have an effective separation process to save energy and to
increase the production rate. Separator performance affects the PSD of cement directly
and must therefore be considered in cement production control.

23
2.3.9 Airflow and feed impact on the PSD
Filter fan power is used at almost maximum capacity at Finnsementti Parainen and can
not be increased much. An increase in airflow will increase the drag force, Fd, which
increases the cut size of the separation.
When adjusting separator settings, one should maintain the centrifugal particle
acceleration required for separation and minimize the pressure drop. A finer cut size
will be achieved by keeping the distribution plate rotational speed constant and adding
more countervanes to the distribution plate. Also, by reducing the gap between
countervanes, the cut size will be reduced.
For rotational cage classifiers, which are the most common variants in modern cement
grinding plants, high volumes of separating air will contribute to a higher acceleration
for particles towards the cage. As small particles are accelerated more than large
particles, the probability of a small particle passing through the cage is higher.
Too high loads in the separator will reduce the separation quality, i.e., the sharpness of
the cut will be broader, and the fraction of bypass will increase in the return feed. Poor
comminution in the mill will increase the circulation factor and, consequently, the load
in the separator.

2.3.10 Material flow in the system affects PSD
The elevator effect should not be the main steer parameter as the whole system will
struggle to maintain a steady state. Separator settings should be investigated at the
separator inlet and outlet to compare the static pressure differences when different ratios
of air and material reach the separator.

2.4 Literature overview of air separator modeling in the cement
industry
The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is a computationally intensive method of
simulating many small particles. DEM has been used to simulating conditions inside air
separators. However, due to the method being computationally intensive and time-

24
consuming, DEM is generally not used to predict PSD but rather to demonstrate the
effect of parameters in the separation process (Irannezhad m.fl. 2009).
2.4.1 Computational Fluid Dynamics
Computational fluid dynamic, CFD, is a tool for modeling multiphase flows. CFD
models may be used to predict particle trajectories and thereby predict separation
efficiency. In the last decade, CFD modeling has become more popular for constructing
models for dynamic separators.
Guizani et al. were among the first to publish about CFD modeling a third-generation
dynamic separator. They created a model that predicts the cut-size, d50, using a
stochastic Lagrangian discrete phase model (DPM). However, the DPM did not describe
the fish-hook effect accurately due to the model not considering electrostatic forces
between the particles or interactions between particles. Guizani et al. also concluded
that bubble-type vortexes, as shown in Figure 8, influence the selectivity in a separator.
Identifying bubble-vortexes could improve separation efficiency and ultimately aid to
develop a PSD controlled system (Guizani m.fl. 2014).

Figure 8 Example of bubble-type vortexes in a dynamic separator (Guizani m.fl. 2014)

Another study conducted by Guizani et al. studied the effect of the rotor speed on flow
characteristics and separation performance using the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM).
Guizani et al. found that increased rotor speed in a Sepol third-generation separator

25
increases the pressure drop in the separator (R. Guizani m.fl. 2014). CFD studies are
generally designed explicitly for unique cases, and, therefore, a unique CFD model
should be considered by Finnsementti Parainen to fully understand flow patterns in the
separators.
Empirical models typically describe the process at a steady state by determining
empirical relationships in the process, for example, the Tromp curve. Empirical models
require sampling data for validation in a simulation. Irannezhad et al. showed that an air
separator simulator based on the Whiten function could optimize the Tromp curve
parameters or simulate PSD and flow rates of the fine and coarse streams (Irannezhad
m.fl. 2009).

26

3 Experiment series I: On-site testing and data collection
For this thesis, the effect on PSD and Tromp curves when altering feed rate and the
airflow to the separator was studied while maintaining the Blaine value constant. The
changes to parameters were divided into two days, 22.2.2021 and 23.2.2021. A
reference sample from the separator product stream was collected 22.2.2021 before any
changes to process parameters were made. The reference sample is, therefore, a
reflection of the process at a balanced and normal condition. After process parameter
changes had been made and the process appeared steady, samples of the separator feed,
separator reject, and the product were taken. Demonstrated in Figure 9 are the collection
points for the separator samples. A large sample, about 30 kg of the product, was
collected for strength and concrete tests.

Figure 9 Sample collection points Julin (2021)

Cement grinding involves many variables, such as moisture content, clinker quality,
ambient temperatures. It was essential to minimize any process fluctuations to attain
reliable data. Parameter fluctuations were minimized by using a high-quality clinker
from one source (a clinker silo) and collecting the samples as soon as the process was
steady to minimize unnecessary time delays. However, due to the complex nature of the
process, the number of variables, and relatively few samples, the findings of this
experiment must not be considered statistically significant but as guidance for future
research.

3.1 Sample collection
On the first day of testing, the power of the filter fan was changed from 260 kW to 200
kW and, therefore, separator airflow was reduced. Samples were collected when the

27
process was stable at 260 kW, 230 kW, and 200 kW fan powers. The samples for 230
kW were taken twice as the first set of samples was not at a steady state due to the
circulation factor increasing momentarily. The second set of 230 kW samples was taken
30 minutes after the first set as the process was at a steady state.
By changing the elevator power from 16 kW to 11.5 kW, the total feed to the separator
was reduced from 143 t/h to 93 t/h. Unfortunately, there was no measurement system
for airflow, so a precise reduction of the air to feed flow is unknown. However, data on
fresh feed, elevator power, chamber one and two fill degree, temperatures, filter fan
power, filter pressure difference, and electricity consumption per ton cement produced
were available.

3.2 Analysis methods
Particle size distribution curves were developed by dynamic image analysis using the
Camsizer at Finnsementti Parainen. Also, strength analysis and the Blaine value were
established, and CO2 and SO3 fractions were determined from the product feed at
Finnsementti Parainen. The strength (MPa) analysis determined the strength after 1, 2,
7, and 28 days.
Concrete tests were conducted by Contesta Oy, who carried out strength measurements
for various concrete recipes and workability measurements.

3.3 Results from parameter change test.
Key PSD parameters and the Blaine value from the experiments during 22-23.2.2021
are listed in Table 5. Calculations for the RRSB parameters are defined earlier in this
thesis. Unfortunately, the exact time of collecting the reference sample was not
recorded. The process parameter values for the reference sample are the mean value of
the process for three hours from when the reference sample was taken. The reference
sample was only collected from the product stream. Therefore, only a PSD curve for the
product stream can be developed but not a Tromp curve.

The PSD curves for the cement are demonstrated in Figures 10-a and 10-b. The
differences between the PSD curves are minor, and any definitive conclusions cannot be
made. More apparent differences in cement characteristics can be observed in Figures

3.4 Analysis of results
The differences in PSD curves are marginal, which can be observed in Figures 10-a and
10-b. However, increased differences between the reference sample and the adjusted
filter fan power samples can be observed. For particles over 30 µm, a difference
between the reference sample, the adjusted 11.5 and 13 kW filter fan power samples,
and the rest of the sample size fraction can be observed. The PSD curves for all samples
with differing filter fan powers and the first elevator power sample (16 kW) have
virtually no particles over 40 µm. However, the reference sample, the 13 kW, and the
11.5 kW elevator power samples show very similar PSD curves, even for particle sizes
between 30 and 40 µm.
Table 5 shows that when the elevator power was 13.3 kW, the product had the highest
‘n’ value, i.e., it has the narrowest PSD curve. Again, the differences in the PSD curves
are marginal below 30 µm particle size.
In Table 6, one can notice that when the feed to the separator was at its lowest, i.e.,
when the separator power was 11.3 kW, the separator bypass value was at its lowest.
The lowest bypass is achieved when the circulation factor decreases, and therefore, the
total feed to both the mill and the separator is low. The reduced amount of material in
the separator leads to an increased separator cut size (X50) and a decreased bypass point
(M. Boulvin m.fl. 2003). This phenomenon can be observed in Table 6, where the X50
and bypass values for the lowest elevator power (11.3 kW) are outliers. Also, in Figure
12-b, the Tromp curve is shifted to the right for the lowest elevator power, i.e., it has a
higher cut-point than its counterparts and a lower bypass point. The size fraction
distribution density in Figure 11-a shows that the sample has the lowest size fractions in
the particle size range between 7 and 22 µm compared with other test results.
The 11.3 kW sample also shows similar results when comparing the X10, X50, and X90
values in Table 5, which would indicate that the 11.3 kW sample has the widest
distribution of particles. The 11.3 kW sample has the highest Blaine value, which
highlights the problem with the Blaine value, i.e., high Blaine values do not necessarily
imply that the sample contains a higher amount of specific fine fraction size than a

34
sample with lower Blaine. When the Blaine value is compared with its corresponding
PSD values in Table 5, particle size after 10%, 50%, 63.2%, and 90% shows no
correlation with the Blaine value. The Blaine value has a 21 m2/kg (4.5%) difference
between the maximum and minimum Blaine of the elevator power samples and a 29
m2/kg (6.5%) difference for the filter fan power samples.
No significant differences in cement strengths can be found from the experimental
results. The highest strengths are found in samples with the highest SO3 fractions,
consistent with the literature. Cement strengths, CO2,- and SO3 fractions for each
sample are given in Table 7.

3.5 Sources of error
One sample per parameter change was collected at all eight sampling points. The
sample was accumulated over an approximately 2-3 minute time period, leading to a
sample that may not represent the whole production. The cement milling did not
maintain a steady state, and fluctuations in the circulation factor occurred. Therefore,
when adjusting the filter fan power, two samples were collected and analyzed.
An unintended consequence of rapid parameter changes to the process resulted in
significant differences in the Blaine value.

3.6 Experiment series II: Process parameter experiment with statistical
analysis
The second set of experiments was conducted to investigate whether it is possible to
attain statistically significant differences in PSD characteristics for cement while
maintaining the Blaine value at a 450 m2/kg target range. A 2k factorial design was
chosen to investigate the effect of material feed and airflow in the separator on PSD
characteristics.
A 2k factorial design experiment is used in statistics to determine different variables’
relevance. By limiting the independent factors (process parameters) to high and low
values, one can observe their effects on dependent factors, e.g., PSD characteristics,
using statistical methods. Different dependent variables are obtained when independent
variables are systematically tested for every possible combination, as demonstrated in
Table 8.

For the high independent values, 260 kW for the filter fan and 17 kW for the elevator
were selected, and for the separate low values, 200 kW and 11 kW were chosen,
respectively. Dependent variables of interest were the n and d’ values of the RRSB
distribution and the particle sizes after 10%, 50%, and 90% of the volume-based
cumulative distribution, i.e., Q3(µm). Also, PSD distributions were plotted and
compared using Microsoft Excel worksheets.
3.6.1 Factorial experiment results
The results from the experiment are analyzed with statistical models according to 2k
factorial design methods. The experiment consisted of two factors, k, is the elevator
power and the filter fan power. Thus, the significance of the effects of elevator power,
filter fan power, and their interaction on dependent variables can be analyzed. The
results from the experiment are given in Table 9 below.

When the p-value is greater than α, we cannot reject the null hypothesis, i.e., the
independent variable does not affect the dependent variable. The independent factor
does not significantly affect the dependent value at a 95% confidence interval.
However, if the p-value is less than α, we can conclude a statistically significant
relationship between the independent and dependent variables. In Table 8, we can see
three statistically significant relationships between the independent and dependent
variables.

3.7 Stepwisefit regression
Data collected from regular production was analyzed using stepwise regression.
Stepwise regression intends to find and select significant independent variables for a
regression model. Stepwise regression does not generally yield high R2 values due to the
suppression of independent variables that are non-correlated or correlate very little with
the dependent variable (Lewis 2007).
A standardization of independent variables was conducted to ensure that the
independent variables were comparable when making the regression model. Ten
independent variables for the regression model were chosen based on the literature and
expertise available. Multicollinearity, e.g., the correlation between independent
variables, was considered when choosing the independent variables.
In RStoolbox, the command rsstandrard returns the design matrix, i.e., dependent
variables, as columns where the mean equals zero and variance is equal to one. The
standardized regression coefficient is demonstrated in the equation below:
𝑆𝑥𝑗
𝑏𝑗,𝑠𝑡𝑑 = 𝑏𝑗 ( )
𝑆𝑦
where 𝑆𝑦 and 𝑆𝑥𝑗 are standard deviations for a dependent variable and the corresponding
independent variable j. Furthermore, 𝑏𝑗 is the independent value for the corresponding
dependent value at j and 𝑏𝑗,𝑠𝑡𝑑 is the standardized value corresponding to 𝑏𝑗 .
R2 is a proportional value that compares the variance of dependent variables that are
predicted from independent variables. R2 is defined according to equation 19:

2
𝑆𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑠 𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛: 𝑆𝑆𝑅 = ∑(𝑦̂𝑖 − 𝑦̅)
𝑖

(16)

𝑖

(18)

39

𝑅2 =

𝑆𝑆𝑅
𝑆𝑆𝑇

(19)

where SSR is the variance in the predictions for a model, i.e., the regression line and
SST are the total variances. The terms ȳi, ŷi, and yi are the mean value of y, the predicted
value, and the actual value, respectively. For all R2 calculations using predictor
variables, the ordinary least-squares regression (OLS) is used.
The value psig determines if the null-hypothesis for significance testing of independent
variables is correct. The null hypothesis, H0, is that an independent variable does not
affect the dependent variable within the significance interval.
If psig < α, then the null-hypothesis is rejected. The value for pLOF describes how well
the data fit the theoretical model.
Rstoolbox provides psig and pLOF for independent variables and R2 for the model. The
model was tested using process data from Finnsementti Parainen between 14.2.2020 and
4.5.2021. A total of 642 data points was used for the development of the regression
model. Each process data point, e.g., independent variables, is an average of one hour of
process data to the corresponding dependent variable. Half of the data was used as
predictor data and the other half as validation data. The predictor data was used to
develop and plot predicted values compared with actual dependent variable data points.

3.8 Stepwise regression results
Results from the stepwise regression are demonstrated in Table 10. The significant
independent variables (α < 0.05) are colored green or red depending on their positive or
negative impact on the dependent variables. A green-colored cell has a positive impact
on the dependent variable and, therefore, an increased positive independent variable
leads to an increased value to the dependent variable. Interestingly, the elevator power
and the fill level in the first chamber do not significantly affect any dependent variables.
The elevator power determines the feed rate to the separator. It is a crucial process
parameter that affects the separation efficiency of the separator, which can be observed
in Figure 12-b comparing Tromp curves for three different elevator powers. For elevator

40
power data collected for stepwise regression between 14.2.020 and 4.5.2021, the
elevator power did not alter significantly and remained close to 15 kW most days. The
largely uniform elevator power may have reduced the significance of elevator power in
the regression models and thus excluding it from the models. The fill level in the first
mill chamber does not show significance in any regression model and, therefore, does
not appear to significantly affect the product's PSD. However, it is essential to maintain
optimum fill levels in both chambers to ensure an excellent grinding efficiency in the
mill.
The sizes of the effect of the significant independent variables are the values in the cells
observed in Table 10. A linear theoretical regression model can be constructed using the
Bi values. B0 is a constant base value for the theoretical model for the dependent
variable. B1-10 are constant values for the independent variables related to their specific
regression equations. The empirical model, y, contains only significant independent
variables and compares the equation against actual results. The value x is the value of
the independent variable in the theoretical and empirical models. Epsilon, ε, is an error
term for the theoretical,- and empirical models.

The linear theoretic model based on the regression analysis is as follows:

𝑦 = 𝐵0 + 𝐵1 𝑥1 + 𝐵2 𝑥2 + 𝐵3 𝑥3 + 𝐵4 𝑥4 + 𝐵5 𝑥5 + 𝐵6 𝑥6 + 𝐵7 𝑥7 + 𝐵8 𝑥8 + 𝐵9 𝑥9 + 𝐵10 𝑥10 + 𝜀

(20)

42
The empirical model only includes significant independent variables. For example, the empirical
model for the dependent variable, the fraction of particles between 3 and 32 µm, can be written
as:

𝑦̂ = 𝐵0 + 𝐵2 𝑥2 + 𝐵3 𝑥3 + 𝐵7 𝑥7 + 𝐵9 𝑥9 + 𝜀

(21)

When the terms from Table 10 are added, the empirical model for the fraction size of
particles between 3 and 32 µm is:
𝑦̂ = 77.24 + 1.36𝑥2 + 0.11𝑥3 − 0.095𝑥7 − 0.56𝑥9 + 𝜀

(22)

When values for the independent variables, i.e., circulation factor, separator speed, filter
fan power, and gypsum feed, are chosen, the linear empirical model will predict the
dependent variable, i.e., the fraction size of particles between 3 and 32 µm. The model's
accuracy was tested using one-half of the collected cement grinding data, i.e.,
dependent,- and independent variables. The rest of the data was then used to verify the
model. The coefficient of determination, R2, was calculated for all theoretical models.
The results are demonstrated in Table 11.

The R2 values are the highest for theoretical models explaining various particles, i.e., the
fraction of particles between 3 and 32 µm and particles over 32 µm. The models for
these two dependent variables show an R2 of roughly 58%. R2 for the empirical models
could be improved by adding independent variables that affect dependent variables or
include non-linear variables.
The dependent value of the fraction of particles between 16 and 32 µm shows a poor R2
value of 0.074. The plotted predictions compared with the values show that the
empirical model almost consistently underestimates the dependent variable, i.e., the
fraction of particles between 16 and 32 µm. The models' undervaluation can be
observed in Figure 15. The empirical model poorly predicts outlier results, especially if
the actual values were drastically lower than the average, e.g., low real values between
test numbers 125 and 200. The undervaluation suggests that the model needs additional
independent variables or that non-linear terms should be added to explain better which
independent variables affect the outcome, i.e., the fraction of 16 to 32 µm particles.

Figure 15 Predicted vs. real values for particles in the 16-32 µm size range

The highest R2 for any dependent value is for the fraction sizes between 3 and 32 µm,
which is 0.5884. The empirical model equation 21 is tested in Figure 16. The empirical
model for particle sizes between 3 and 32 µm shows a greater accuracy when predicting

44
the dependent variable than the prediction of size fraction of 16 to 32 µm, hence the
better R2 value.
The data collected for the stepwise regression are observed data, which usually produce
lower R2 values than regression models based on experimental data. Experimental data
are produced by a specific test method, i.e., data produced during an experiment. In
contrast, observed data are produced during continuous production and, therefore,
contain more irregularities than experimental data. The collection of the cement samples
measuring the PSD occurred every four hours during production. As different workers
manually collected the samples at non-specific times, error in the sampling process is
possible. Although the Camsizer X2 requires a small amount of manual work,
deviations may occur in the analysis of the samples as different workers operate the
Camsizer X2. Generally, regression models with dependent variables containing a larger
fraction of particles, i.e., 3-32 µm, 0-16 µm, and 16-32 µm, show higher R2 values,
suggesting that small fractions cannot be accurately predicted with regression models.
The independent variables, i.e., what may be derived from the process data, are the
mean value of a one-hour period of process data before collecting the cement sample.
The accuracy of the regression model could benefit if the process data compared to the
cement samples were a mean value of a shorter period. Depending on the process
parameter change, approximately 10 to 20 minutes is needed for a process parameter
change to influence the product from the cement grinding system. The R2 of the
regression models may be lowered due to the process data points being an average value
from a relatively long period, i.e., two hours. Thus, significant process parameter
changes may have occurred before collecting the cement sample.
Although the R2 value is relatively low for many empirical models, the p-value is lower
than 0.05 for every modeled parameter except for the n and the Blaine value models.
The low p-values, i.e., p-values > 0.05, suggest that the overall regression is significant
and that the predictors affect the dependent variables. These findings are stochastic and
should only be used as guidance when applying the results to control the process.
The inability to find statistically significant empirical models for predicting the Blaine
value highlights the difficulty of predicting Blaine values using process parameters. The

45
unpredictability of using the Blaine value as the only dependent variable in process
control may lead to increased standard deviations in cement quality. As regression
models cannot explain the Blaine value.

The third experiment on 12-13.8.2021 was conducted to investigate the effects of
separator speed (rpm) and the filter fan power (kW) on the PSD curve. For four filter
fan power settings, three separator speeds were studied. Table 12 lists the order of

Figures 13-15 show an increased fraction of particles between 3 and 15 µm for all three
filter fan power levels when the separator speed was 275 rpm. When the separator speed
was 235 rpm, an increased amount of particles over the size of 28 µm can be observed
for all filter fan powers.

Table 13 lists PSD values from experiment series III. It can be observed that the
steepness, n, varies for all separator speeds at a given filter fan power. However, the
steepness was more consistent when the separator speed was high, i.e., 275 rpm.
Table 13 also lists the fraction sizes of particles between 3 and 32 µm. One can observe
that the fraction size of particles between 3 and 32 µm increases for higher separator
speeds. A separator speed increase of 40 rpm increased the fraction of particles between
3 and 32 µm by 6.67%, 4.66% and, 6.45% for filter fan power levels at 250 kW, 240
kW, and, 230 kW respectively.
When the separator speed was 255 rpm, one could also observe a gradual increase of
particles between 3 and 32 µm when filter fan power was reduced from 250 kW to 230
kW. A decrease of 10 kW led to approximately one percent increase of particles in the 3
to 32 µm fraction.
In Figures 16 and 17, the effect of separator speed on PSD is shown. Same separator
speeds have the same color in the graphs to highlight PSD differences for all three
separator speeds. One can observe that the PSD curves do not vary much for the lowest
separator speed setting, i.e., 235 rpm. The same phenomenon can be observed in Table
13, which lists similar particle sizes at 10%, 50%, and 90% of the cumulative volume
flow. A 40 rpm decrease in separator speed increases the particle size of d’ by one µm
for every 14.5 rpm, 13.7 rpm, and 8.40 rpm for filter fan powers at 250 kW, 240 kW,
and 230 kW, respectively. According to the regression model, a 25.6 rpm decrease in
the separator speed results in a one µm increase in particle size at d’.
A gradual increase in particles size at d’ for varying filter fan powers was only recorded
when the separator speed was 235 rpm. The particle size at d’ was increased when filter
fan power was at 240 kW and the separator speed was 255 rpm and 275 rpm. Therefore,
how the filter fan power affects d’ should be investigated more to verify if it is a process
variable used to control the PSD of the product.
Figures 16 and 17 show that the PSD curves are very similar when the separator speed
is 235 rpm. This would suggest that the airflow does not remarkably influence the PSD

51
at low separator speeds, i.e., 235 rpm. At 235 rpm, the classification of particles bigger
than 24 µm is greater than for the two faster separator speeds, i.e., 255 rpm and 275
rpm. Therefore, the fraction of particles between 3 and 32 µm is smaller when the
separator speed is 235 rpm, as shown in Table 13.

Figure 16 The effects of separator speed on fractional PSD curves: Yellow curves are for separator speeds at 275
rpm, green curves are at 255 rpm, black curves are at 235 rpm, and red is the reference sample (260 rpm).

Changes in the separator speed influence the differences in PSD more than changes in
the filter fan power. Especially when the separator speed was 235 rpm, no remarkable
differences can be noticed for varying filter fan powers, as shown in Figure 17.
However, clear differences in PSD curves can be observed when the separator speeds
were increased to 255 rpm, and 275 rpm. Figure 18 shows that the filter fan power
affected particles' fractions between 5 and 20 µm when the separator speed was 255 rpm
or 275 rpm. Notably, the separator speed and the filter fan power influenced the fraction
of particles in the 6 to 10 µm size class, demonstrated in Figure 18. One can observe
that an increased separator speed increases the size fraction of particles between 6 and
10 µm and that when the filter fan power is lowered, the fraction of particles between 6
and 10 µm is also increased.

Figure 17 Filter fan power effect on fine particles for separator speeds at 255 rpm and 275 rpm

The effect of separator speed and filter fan power on particles between 3 and 32 µm is
similar to the stepwise regression model. The stepwise regression predicts that a nine
rpm separator speed increase results in a one percent increase in particles between 3 and
32 µm. As previously stated, a 40 rpm increase in separator speed increased the fraction
of particles between 3 and 32 µm by 6.67%, 4.66% and, 6.45% for filter fan powers at
250 kW, 240 kW, and, 230 kW respectively. The regression model predicts a 4.44%
increase in particles between 3 and 32 µm for a 40 rpm separator speed increase.
The regression model also predicts a one percent decrease for particles between 3 and
32 µm for every 10.5 kW increase in filter fan power. The fraction of particles between
3 and 32 µm declined by one percent for every 23.4 kW, 8.06 kW, and 17.6 kW change
in filter fan power when the separator speed was 275 rpm, 255 rpm, and 235 rpm,
respectively.
The regression model for the fraction of particles between 3 and 16 µm predicts a one
percent increase for every 8.33 rpm increase in separator speed. Based on the
experiment, the fraction size of particles between 3 and 16 µm increased one percent for
every 6.16 rpm, 7.90 rpm, and 5.08 rpm increase for when filter fan power was 250 kW,
240 kW, and 230 kW, respectively.

54
The effects of process parameter changes are summarized in Table 14. The fraction of
particles between 3 and 16 µm is affected more by process parameter changes than the
fraction of particles between 16 and 32 µm.

4 Results and discussion
Findings from data analysis, experiments, and the literature review contribute to an indepth understanding of variables that affect the separation in the grinding system. Due
to the dynamic nature of cement grinding systems, any findings and solutions should be
considered unique to that system and cement sort. Similar analysis methods can be used
for other grinding circuits. However, expertise should be utilized during the process to
obtain results that can be implemented.
The PSD of cement affects the cement properties, for example, strength properties,
setting times, heat release, capillary porosity, diffusivity, chemical shrinkage, internal
relative humidity, and autogenous shrinkage (Bentz m.fl. 1999). For this thesis, the
production of cement with PSDs that enhance cement strength has been the focus.
Particles between the size range of 3 and 32 µm affect the strength development the
most. Particles over 60 µm do not affect cement strength properties in a significant way.
Fine particles contribute to early strengths, and coarse particles affect the late strength
of cement. Celik et al. showed that with a lower Blaine value with greater homogeneity,
late strengths improved, i.e., the uniformity factor, n, affect cement strengths due to a
more uniform cement having a decreased average particle size compared to non-uniform
cement (Schneider m.fl. 2011b) (Celik 2009).
The main factors affecting the PSD of cement are the separator design characteristics,
separator speed, and the airflow in the separator. Separator efficiency, e.g., the Tromp
curve or the GEC, influences the fine stream of cement and, therefore, the PSD of the
product. If the feed rate to the separator increases, the material per unit of air in the
separator increases, leading to an increased portion of fine particles in the coarse flow
(Belhaj m.fl. 2016).
Cement production with the desired PSD curve requires an understanding of the whole
cement grinding circuit. As the dynamic separator system is affected by various
parameters and variables, PSD-controlled cement grinding must consider which process
parameters are feasible to control the process with. An increased separator feed

56
decreases the separation efficiency leading to a higher circulation factor. A high
circulation factor may reduce the grinding efficiency in the cement mill, leading to high
energy usage and unpredictable material flows in the cement grinding mill. Consistent
cement quality cannot be achieved if the separator feed is unstable and, therefore,
keeping the grinding process at a steady-state should be a priority. The process
parameter changes need to be minor in order to avoid significant deviations in the
process.

4.1 Experimental conclusions
Plotted PSDs from experiments conducted between 22 and 23.2.2021 (experiment I)
and between 14 and 15.4.2021 (experiment II) show only minor differences in the
cement samples' PSD curves. However, differences in Tromp curves were found when
studying the Tromp curves for cement samples collected during the first of three process
parameter experiments. The bypass point was lowered when airflow in the separator
increased and when the separator feed was decreased, thus improving the separation in
the dynamic classifier. As the airflow and the separator feed mainly affect the separator
efficiency and not the PSD of the product, these process parameters should be
considered as secondary process parameters used to control the cement grinding
process. However, Figures 11-a and 11-b suggest more significant deviations in the PSD
are obtained by adjusting the elevator power rather than the airflow in the separator. No
significant differences in cement strengths could be observed for the cement samples.
Experiment III was conducted to characterize the effect of process parameters on
cement PSD and verify the accuracy of regression models. The results indicate that
regression models can be used to understand better which process parameters affect the
PSD of the product. However, with current data sampling methods and linear regression
models, a model that gives R2 values that reach 0.90 is difficult.

57

4.2 Stepwise, - and 2k regression conclusions
The inability to make definite conclusions based on plotted PSDs suggested that a
numerical approach to study PSDs was necessary. Fractions of specific cement particle
size classes were studied using stepwise regression models. The stepwise regression
models show which process parameters are significant for a specific PSD fraction.
At least two dependent variables, i.e., PSD variables, should be chosen to control the
grinding process to ensure better quality consistency than a product using the Blaine
value as the control measure. Regression models for dependent variables that show
sufficient R2, psig, and pLOF values as independent variables could be the basis for
selecting which dependent variables are chosen to control the grinding system. The pLOF
value is the probability of observing a test statistic as more extreme than that observed if
the null hypothesis, i.e., the regression model is true.
Small pLOF values (pLOF > 0.05) indicate a lack-of-fit, i.e., the regression model is not
acceptable. Suggested fractions to consider are the fraction of particles between 3 and
32 µm and particle size after 63.2% (d’) of the product has passed. The regression
models for the two dependent variables show adequate pLOF values (pLOF > 0.05),
indicating that the terms in the models fit the data.
The empirical model for the fraction of particles between 3 and 32 µm:
𝑦̂ = 77.42 + 1.36𝑥2 + 0.11𝑥3 − 0.095𝑥7 − 0.56𝑥9 + 𝜀

(23)

The empirical model the particle size at d’ (63.2% of passing):
𝑦̂ = 10.46 + 0.081𝑥1 − 0.039𝑥3 + 0.052𝑥7 + 0.83𝑥9 + 𝜀

(24)

The empirical model the particles over 32 µm:
𝑦̂ = 18.51 − 1.51𝑥2 − 0.12𝑥3 + 0.0.90𝑥7 − 0.15𝑥8 + 0.61𝑥9 + 𝜀

(25)

Experiment III showed that the regression model for predicting the fraction size of 3 to
32 µm is accurate for three separator speeds at 275 rpm, 255 rpm, and 235 rpm when
the filter fan power was 240 kW. Changes in filter fan powers showed that the

58
regression model only was adequate when the separator speed was 255 rpm. When
comparing experiment III results to the regression model, the regression model
overestimates the effect of the separator speed on d’. Changes in responses are not linear
even if the changes in the predictors are, as is demonstrated in Table 13. The
nonlinearity of the responses highlights the need for in situ testing to learn the effect of
process parameters on the product.

4.3 Recommendations on PSD control
The relative standard deviation for the Blaine value was 3.59% between 15.2.2020 and
4.5.2021. The fraction of particles between 3 and 32 µm has a relative standard
deviation of 2.05% in the same period, suggesting that cement grinding control using
the Blaine value affects the size fraction of particles between 3 and 32 µm. Significant
variations in relative standard deviation occur for particle size fractions under 3 µm
(12.3%) and over 32 µm (14.2%). By minimizing the relative standard deviations for the
fraction size under 3 µm and over 32 µm, the product would be of more consistent
quality. The amount of particles over 32 µm is controlled via separator speed and filter
fan power as shown in equation 25 and demonstrated in experiment III.
Based on the empirical models (equations 23 and 24), Table 15 of ranked process
parameters used to control cement grinding was made. Process parameters used to
control the process are divided into primary and secondary parameters. Primary process
parameters should control the process after the periodical cement sample is collected
and analyzed during normal production. Secondary process parameters should be
changed based on long-term changes in the production and not as a direct consequence
of ordinary cement samples.

The most important process parameter to control the PSD of the product is the separator
rotor speed, which is an independent variable in equations 23 and 24. The effect of
separator rotor speed on the variables (fraction size between 3 and 32 µm and particle
size after 63.2%) should be individually determined for every unique grinding circuit. It
is known from experience that an increase of 4 to 8 rpm to separator speed requires
approximately a 10 kW increase of filter fan power to maintain the same Blaine value.
Based on experiment series I, the required separator rpm for different elevator powers
and filter fan powers were found. The interaction between separator rpm and filter fan
power is of primary interest as the two process parameters are primary process
parameters. Table 13 lists PSD values and Blaine values for specific filter fan powers
with constant elevator power. The results suggest that for the lowest filter fan power
(200 kW), the separator speed could be dropped by 30 rpm and still maintain a similar
Blaine value. A similar comparison between filter fan power at 260 kW and 230 kW
shows that the separator speed difference is only six rpm. However, the Blaine value is
much lower for the 260 kW sample despite having similar PSD values as the other
samples. Thus, these PSD characteristics cannot explain the low Blaine value for the
specific sample.

*Results from a process that was not at a steady state.

The filter fan power affects the separation efficiency in the separator. For cement mill 7
at Finnsementti Parainen, the filter fan power during the production of Rapid is
approximately 250 kW. The maximum power output for the filter fan is 260 kW,
therefore, only a moderate increase in filter fan power is possible. However, it is
unknown how an increase in filter fan power affects the airflow in the separator or the
pressure after the separator.
The elevator power is not a statistically significant process parameter in any of the
regression models. However, it is well known that the separator feed affects the
separation efficiency, and therefore, the circulation factor (CF). CF is a significant
variable in empirical models shown in equations 23 and 24. As previously mentioned,
the changes in elevator power should be minimal to ensure stable conditions in the
separator.
The fresh feed mass fraction and the gypsum feed mass fraction should not be used to
control the product's PSD. The fresh feed to cement mill seven is approximately 40 tons
per hour, which is deemed the ideal feed rate for the cement mill. Changes to the feed
rate based on cement samples gathered every two hours could destabilize the production
in the grinding circuit and significantly reduce the grinding efficiency of the mill. Minor
changes to the targeted feed rate, i.e., increase or decrease the feed rate by one ton per

61
hour, could optimize the separation efficiency in the separator. Based on the stepwise
regression models, the feed rate to the grinding circuit does not appear to affect PSD
characteristics.

4.4 Further research and improvements
Further research should be conducted to fully understand the effects of process
parameters on the cement's PSD and improve the product. Also, improvements to the
grinding circuit have been proposed to aid the system's control with PSD.
1. In order to understand fluid dynamics in the separator, a CFD simulation could
be done. A detailed CFD model would identify flow patterns in the separator for
specific airflows. Different filter fan powers on the airflow before and after the
separator could assist when developing a CFD model.
2. To enhance specific cement properties, i.e., cement strength or workability,
cement with varying PSDs but the same chemical ratios should be investigated
to discover the effect of PSD on the particular properties. When an ideal PSD is
established, the cement grinding process can be altered to produce a product
based on the ideal PSD.
3. Automatic sample collectors would lead to more precise process data for each
cement sample and, therefore, improve the usefulness of the data. Furthermore,
as on-line testing of PSD characteristics of cement is possible, continuous
monitoring of the product feed is possible. Continuous PSD testing (on-line
testing) connected with process control could reduce the standard deviations of
PSD values in the product. Automatic sample collectors are common in the
industry.
4. On-line testing and PSD results could minimize the fluctuations in the process.
Constant PSD testing connected with process steering could reduce the standard
deviations of PSDs in the product. There are new applications on the market
that use laser diffraction for real-time product screening for instant PSD
analysis.
5. Research and trials about control theory with several PSD parameters
functioning as feedback to control a dynamic system, i.e., the cement grinding
circuit.

62

5 Conclusions
Experiments series I and II do not show significant differences in PSD curves when the
separator feed and the filter fan power are changed, and the Blaine value is kept at a
target value. This suggests that a steady Blaine value does not influence the PSD of the
product significantly. The product's highest relative standard deviations are found at the
low and the high end of the particle size spectrum, i.e., particles smaller than 3 µm and
larger than 32 µm. Several PSD parameters for the product should be controlled to
ensure consistent cement quality. The fraction size of particles between 3 and 32 µm,
fraction size of particles over 32 µm, and d’ are three PSD parameters that would
improve the consistency of the quality if the standard deviations were minimized.
Changes to process parameters affect PSD values in different degrees. In this thesis, the
size effect of process parameters has been studied both with statistical analysis and in
situ testing.
Stepwise regression models show which process parameters affect PSD values. The
primary process parameter is the separator speed which affects every size class of the
product. The secondary process variable to control PSD variables is the airflow in the
separator, which is controlled with adjustments to filter fan power. Experiment III
studied separator speed and filter fan power changes to understand how these
parameters affect PSD values. Experiment III showed that for average filter fan power,
i.e., 250 kW, a separator speed reduction of 40 rpm reduced the fraction of particles
between 3 and 32 µm by 6.67%. For varying filter fan powers at near-normal separator
speeds, i.e., 255 rpm, a reduction of 20 kW increased the fraction of particles between 3
and 32 µm by 4.97%. The reduction was not linear, though, which must be
acknowledged when implementing the results to the automated control system. Other
process parameters should not be used as control measures in the grinding system to
avoid unstable cement flows, i.e., separator feed, product flow, and separator reject.
The automated control system of the grinding system should be based on experiments
and regression analysis results. The automated control system for the grinding circuit
makes changes to process parameters based on the two previous results from cement
sampling. In the current system, the automated system changes the separator speed

63
based on the two latest Blaine values. An automated control system based on PSD
parameters requires updates to the script of the automated control system. Each PSD
parameter, e.g., the fraction of particles between 3 and 32 µm, fraction of particles over
32 µm, and d’, require an individual control model to keep the system at the desired
state. The control model for the fraction size of particles between 3 and 32 µm should
be prioritized as it is an essential PSD parameter for cement. Secondary PSD
parameters, i.e., the fraction of particles over 32 µm and d’ should be controlled with
less significance than the primary PSD parameter. Practical applications of the control
theory in the cement grinding system are not in scope of this thesis and should be
investigated further to ensure process control of a dynamic system with various PSD
parameters as feedback.
Using PSD as the control measure instead of the Blaine value creates possibilities to
reduce standard deviations of the product. The transition to PSD-controlled cement
grinding also opens new opportunities for on-line control of the grinding circuit. Active
control of the system would reduce the time between the product sampling and the
control measure drastically. However, an active control system would require a
significant investment that requires extensive preparations and planning.

Svensk sammanfattning
Styrning av cementets partikelstorleksfördelning i en kvarnkrets
Inom cementindustrin har mätningen av den specifika ytan varit ett vanligt sätt att mäta
kvaliteten på produkten. Blainemetoden mäter ett värde för luftpermabiliteten i cementet
som betecknas m2/kg. Cementets specifika yta är ett värde som beskriver cementet som
en helhet. Partikelstorleksfördelningskurvan för cementet beskriver diversiteten för
partikelstorleksordningen. Många av cementets egenskaper påverkas av
partikelstorleken. Små partiklar (0–8 µm) påverkar mest den tidiga (1 dygn och 7 dygn)
hållbarheten medan stora partiklar (8-32 µm) påverkar mera hållfastheten efter 28 dygn.
Cementpartiklar över 32 µm hydreras inte totalt och bidrar därmed inte till hållfastheten
i samma skala som partiklar under 32 µm (Zhang & Napier-Munn 1995). Hållfastheten
kan öka då den specifika ytan ökar eftersom cementpartiklarna i medeltal är mindre,
speciellt då andelen partiklar över 32 µm minskar. Om produkten har för stor andel små
partiklar påverkas torkningstiden, cementets värmeavgivning och porositeten (Bentz
m.fl. 1999). Om produkten mals för fin ökar också energikostnaderna eftersom
cementmalningen är en mycket energikrävande process.
Jag utförde mitt diplomarbete för Finnsementti i Pargas. Diplomarbetes mål var att
undersöka hur processparametrar påverkar cementets partikelstorleksfördelning och hur
dessa parametrar kunde användas för att styra kvarnkretsen.
För att producera cement av jämn kvalitet undersöktes hur malningsprocessens
processparametrar påverkade produktens partikelstorleksfördelningskurva. För att
undersöka processparametrarnas påverkan på partikelfördelningen av cement gjordes tre
provkörningar. I den första provkörningen undersöktes hur luftmängden och matningen
i separatorn påverkade produktens partikelfördelning. Även separatorns verkningsgrad
undersöktes genom att jämföra skillnaderna mellan inmatningen, returmatningen och
produkten i separatorsystemet. I den första provkörningen justerades luftmängden och
matningen till separatorn samtidigt som produktens specifika yta bibehölls jämn för alla
prov med ändringar i separatorhastigheten. Skillnaderna i partikelfördelnings-kurvorna
var små för alla prov vilket tyder på att en produkt med samma specifika yta har
liknande partikelfördelningskurva. När matningen till separatorn var som minst hade
produkten den största andelen av små partiklar, det vill säga partiklar under 5 µm, vilket

65
också påverkade produktens specifika yta (484 m2/kg). Luftmängden i separatorn
påverkade separatorns verkningsgrad men inte produktens partikelfördelning.
Trompkurvorna från provkörningen visade att separeringen var bäst när luftmängden i
separatorn var maximerad.
För att undersöka hur luftflödet och separatormatningen påverkade partikelfördelningen
genomfördes provkörning II, där höga och låga processinställningar jämfördes med
varandra. Filterfläktens effekt var antingen 260 kW eller 200 kW och elevatorns effekt
var antingen 17 kW eller 11 kW. Som på provkörning I, styrdes produktens specifika
yta med justeringar i varvtalet. Proven från provkörning II hade små skillnader i
produktens specifika ytor. Skillnaderna i partikelfördelningarna skedde när
elevatoreffekten justerades. Då elevatoreffekten var 17 kW hade proven en högre andel
av partiklar mellan 11 och 24 µm medan när effekten var 11 kW var andelen partiklar
över 25 µm högre. Ändringar i fläkteffekten visade inga stora skillnader i
partikelfördelningen.
En tredje provkörning utfördes för att undersöka fläkteffektens och
separatorhastighetens inverkan på produktens partikelfördelning utan att hålla jämn
specifik yta. Provkörning III visade i vilken skala separatorhastigheten och luftmängden
i separatorn påverkar olika andelar av partikelfördelningen. När separatorns fläkteffekt
var 250 kW och separatorhastigheten minskades med 40 varv/min minskade andelen av
partiklar mellan 3 och 32 µm med 6,67%. När separatorhastigheten var 255 varv/min
och separatorns fläkteffekt minskades med 20 kW, blev andelen av partiklar mellan 3
och 32 µm 4,97% större. Skillnaderna i andelen av partiklar mellan 3 och 32 µm var
inte linjära vilket visas i tabell 14. Alla tre provkörningar visade hur processparametrar
påverkar viktiga delar av partikelfördelningen, som till exempel andelen partiklar
mellan 3 och 32 µm, andelen partiklar över 32 µm och partikelstorleken efter att 63,2%
av provet har passerat siktresten. När man kan styra processen för att tillverka en önskad
partikelfördelningskurva kan man producera cement av jämn kvalitet och minska
standardavvikelserna i produktens partikelstorleksandelar. De relativa
standardavvikelserna är speciellt höga för partiklar under 3 µm (12,3%) och över 32 µm
(14,2%). Om man jämför dessa med den relativa standardavvikelsen för den specifika
ytan (3,6%) kan man konstatera att produktens kvalitet blir jämnare om andelen
partiklar under 3 µm och över 32 µm kan produceras med mindre avkastningar.

66

En regressionsanalys gjordes av processdata och korresponderande partikelfördelningsdata av produkten. Processdata samlades in mellan 14.2.2021 och 4.5.2021.
Regressionsanalysen visade vilka processparametrar som signifikant påverkar
produktens partikelfördelning. Resultaten från regressionsanalysen är sammanfattad i
tabell 11. Regressionsanalysen visar vilka processparametrar påverkar
partikelfördelningen och i vilken grad dessa processparametrar påverkar
partikelfördelningen. När resultaten från provkörning III och regressionsanalysen
jämförs kan man se att resultaten, dvs förändringarna i partikelstorleksfördelningen,
visar minst avvikelser med varandra när provkörning III 12-13.8.2021 var nära vanliga
processparametrar. Processparametrarna som påverkar partikelstorleksfördelningen
mest är separatorhastigheten, fläkteffekten och cirkulationsfaktorn (vilket korrelerar
med separatormatningen). De empiriska modellerna som byggdes på basis av
regressionen visade relativt låga R2-värden. Högsta R2-värdet är för modellen som
beskriver andelen partiklar mellan 3 och 32 µm (58,8%). Låga R2 kan förknippas med
att bara linjära termer användes i modellerna och att provtagningen inte skedde vid en
exakt tidpunkt, och därmed beskriver processdata produktens partikelfördelning dåligt.
Provkörningarna I, II och III visade att stora förändringar i separatormatningen kunde
orsaka problem med att hålla cirkulationsfaktorn jämn, vilket gör separatormatningen
till en dålig processparameter att styra produktens partikelfördelning med.
Provkörningarna konkretiserade även hur separatorns luftmängd och hastighet
påverkade produkten. Det kan rekommenderas att produktens partikelfördelning styrs
huvudsakligen genom justeringar i separatorhastigheten och filterfläktens effekt. För att
minimera relativa standardavvikelser bör standardavvikelserna för partiklar under 3 µm
och över 32 µm i produkten minimeras. Kvarnkretsen styrs i dagens läge med
produktens specifika yta. Automationen som styr kvarnkretsen bör ändras så att flera
variabler från cementprov styr processen. Förändringar i automationen kräver mera
undersökning och behandlades inte i detta arbete.

7 Appendices

7.1 Appendix A 2k-factorial design
In a 2k-factorial design, each independent variable is measured at two levels: high and
low. These levels are often coded as binary values of 1 and -1, where 1 depicts the high
value and -1 the low value. Every combination is tested once in the design matrix X,
consisting of 1s and -1s. The number of runs, n, is equal to 2k, where k is the number of
independent variables. For example, a 2k design matrix with three independent variables
has a 3×8 design matrix, which is demonstrated below (Kuhuri & Mukhopadhyay
2010).
−1 − 1 − 1

The average effect sum of squares, mean square, f-value, and p-value and the effect of
an independent variable were analyzed from the results.
Average effect size is calculated according to:

𝐴𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡 =

1
[𝑎𝑏 + 𝑎 − 𝑏 − (1)]
2𝑛

(23)

𝐵𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡 =

1
[𝑎𝑏 − 𝑎 + 𝑏 − (1)]
2𝑛

(24)

𝐴𝐵𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡 =

𝑎𝑏 − 𝑎 − 𝑏 + (1)
2𝑛

Sum of Squares:

𝑆𝑆𝐴 =

𝑆𝑆𝐵 =

[𝑎𝑏 − 𝑎 + 𝑏 − (1)]2
4𝑛

(27)

𝑆𝑆𝐴𝐵 =

[𝑎𝑏 − 𝑎 − 𝑏 − (1)]2
4𝑛

(28)

Where A and B are the independent factors and a, b, ab, and (1) are sums of replicate
runs. An example of these factors is demonstrated in Table 12 with data from the 2kfactorial experiment.

The mean square (MSi) for every factor is equal to the sum of the same factor of squares
due to the degrees of freedom being one (1) in a 2k-factorial design.
