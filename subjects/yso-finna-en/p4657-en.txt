Bruegel's Peasants: Art and Audience in the Northern Renaissance examines the nature of the Northern Renaissance and the criteria used to recognize its humanistic themes. By identifying an audience with professional and personal ties to Bruegel, and analyzing the factors that influenced their reception of several of his most important paintings, Margaret Sullivan counters the view of Bruegel's peasant subjects as a parochial antihumanistic phenomenon. The artist's northern audience, she argues, "saw" the paintings within a framework that was largely conditioned by a knowledge of the ancients conveyed principally through literature. These provided models for the unheroic, less idealizing underside of classicism, the ungainly, ordinary, and grotesque in genres such as satire in which the didactic and the amusing coexist. As "earnest jests," Bruegel's depictions of peasants present philosophical problems humorously. They reflect, moreover, the interest and concerns of humanists in the Low Countries in the mid-sixteenth century, successfully meeting the high expectations of an audience that applied the rigorous standards of the ancients to the art of its own time.

"This book studies everyday writing practices among ordinary people in a poor rural society in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Using the abundance of handwritten material produced, disseminated and consumed some centuries after the advent of print as its research material, the book's focus is on its day-to-day usage and on 'minor knowledge,' i.e., text matter originating and rooted primarily in the everyday life of the peasantry"--Provided by publisher.

"This book examines the structures and texture of rural social relationships, using one type of document found in abundance over all the four component parts of Britain and Ireland: petitions from tenants to their landlords. Exploring the authorship, form, and style of more than 2,000 petitions as well as their content, and looking at variations in petitioning as a communication strategy, it uses requests for help to understand the diverse material and social lives of those who worked the land in an era of profound change. Ranging over the many practices of lordship and estate management, the book offers unexpected angles on many aspects of society and economy on estates in north-west England, the Highland margin of Scotland, the north of Ireland, and Wales. Broad in geographical and chronological scope, it integrates, compares, and contrasts the experience of the rural population in different parts of the British Isles. Primarily social and cultural in focus, it also extends understandings of local, regional, and national histories. "--

Rural development : theories of peasant economy and agrarian change
This book investigates the forms that the aggression and violence of peasant elites could take in early modern Fennoscandia, and their role within society. The contributors highlight the social stratification, inner divisions, contradictions and conflicts of the peasant communities, but also pay attention to the elite as leaders of resistance against the authorities. With the formation of more centralised states, the elites status and room for agency diminished, but regional and temporal variations were great in this relatively drawn-out process, and there still remained several favourable contexts for their agency. Even though the peasant elite was not a homogenous entity, the chapters in this collection present us one uniting feature the peasant elites tendency to assert themselves with an active and aggressive agency, even if this led to very different outcomes.
