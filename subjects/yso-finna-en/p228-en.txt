Speed and quality in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery : is there a connection?
One ministry many roles : deacons and deaconesses through the centuries
In this paper we study the connection between coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operation time and quality. Our quality metric was the improvement in health related quality of life (HRQoL) survey score in a sample of 432 patients admitted to Kuopio University Hospital. Patients were interviewed with a structured questionnaire a day before the procedure and the follow-up questionnaires were mailed 6 and 12 months after the surgery. However, the HRQoL metric used did not have high retest reliability. Subsequently, we did not find any connection between CAGB operation times and HRQoL. Likewise, we did not find the speed of the surgeon to have any connection to HRQoL improvement.

A charismatic approach to social action
The Bloomsbury Guide to Pastoral Care provides a framework for reflection on pastoral care practice and identifies frontier learning from the new and challenging practical contexts which are important in pastoral care research today. In this collection of essays from leading practitioner-scholars, Bernadette Flanagan and Sharon Thornton set out core principles underpinning professional identity and the practice of pastoral care in rapidly changing social settings. Such pastoral challenges as, developing compassionate and effective companioning to those who have suffered trauma, torture, catastrophic events, social disintegration, the moral wounds of war and cultural dislocation are treated with insight and deep care. The new frontiers of pastoral care in more familiar circumstances such as family, health settings where patients facing life-challenging medical events and multi-cultural communities are also explored. With contributions from Kevin Egan, Michael O'Sullivan SJ, Rita Nakashima Brock and Julia Prinz VDMF, The Bloomsbury Guide to Pastoral Care is an essential reference for the theory and practice of pastoral care.

Like Jesus and the other faithful in Israel and the church in history, Christians in our experience will not only take pleasure in God and enjoying life as much as possible (leitourgia), but also, helped by the Holy Spirit, act as God would act if God were a human being (diakonia). In this study the author suggests that readers can learn much about diakonia and the corresponding attitude from post-modern art. They keyword is aisthesis - Observing: Do we dare to really open our eyes - as artists do - and look around us at the world? If we do, if we have the courage to observe, we will see what "being looked after" by God can mean for our own lives. We will have an eye for those who are suffering because of injustice and hatred in our world: we will see in a different light what is going on in our society. Dare we open our eyes and mind? Dare were observe?
