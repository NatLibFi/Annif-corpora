Subjects in process : diversity, mobility, and the politics of subjectivity in the 21st century
"Acts of Knowing aims to provide readers with a means of understanding the issues from the perspective of Critical Pedagogy; an educational philosophy which believes that 'knowing' must be freed from the constraints of the financial and managerialist logics which dominate the contemporary university. Critical Pedagogy is important for three key reasons: it conceptualises pedagogy as a process of engagement between the teacher and taught; secondly that that engagement is based on an underlying humanistic view about human worth and value; and thirdly that the 'knowing' which can come out of this engagement needs to be understood essentially as exchange between people, rather than a financial exchange"--Provided by publisher.

Education and Racism is a concise and easily accessible primer for introducing undergraduate and graduate students to the field of race and education. Designed for introductory courses, each chapter provides an overview of a main issue or dilemma in the research on racial inequality and education and the particular approaches that have been offered to explain or address them. Theme-oriented chapters include curriculum, school (re)segregation, and high stakes testing as well as discussions on how racism intersects with other forms of marginality, like socio-economic status. The focus on particular educational themes is the strength of this book as it paints a portrait of the systematic nature of racism. It surveys multiple approaches to racism and education and places them in conversation with one another, incorporating both classical as well as contemporary theories. Although conceptually rich and dense with critical perspectives and empirical study, the book uses clear and transparent language throughout for easy comprehension. Perfect for courses in Multicultural Education, Sociology of Education, Ethnic Studies and more, Education and Racism is the ideal primer for engaging students new to race and education without sacrificing the content for those who are already familiar with the field.
Critical pedagogy in uncertain times : hope and possibilities
The texts of Paulo Freire
Theatre teachers are forced to adapt constantly. Whether responding to advancing technologies, cuts to (or the growth of) their programme or ever-changing governmental mandates, they struggle to serve both their students and their craft. Using a theatre arts programme at one Midwestern high school, this book explores how change, good or ill, directly impacts students as well as teachers. Building on the work of the previous edition of Temporary Stages, Jo Beth Gonzalez shows teachers how to sustain confidence and outlines 'critically conscious' teaching, a technique that encourages students to practise self-agency and critical awareness. Essential reading for all theatre teachers, this indispensible resource is a font of innovative classroom and production practices.

Promoting critical practice in adult education
"This collection draws from research studies to build theory, critique reality, and provide practical recommendations for readers. Essays from each section speak to current school matters, with a range of students in different spaces across the U.S. and abroad. Readers are invited to visualize what can be in schools and how teacher educators can serve as leaders in the fight for social justice-oriented curriculum development and implementation. Researchers are challenged to pose different kinds of questions -- questions that look at the possibilities rather than those of difficulties in their work to address and transform institutional and systemic inequality, inequity, oppression, marginalization, and discrimination in education"--Provided by publisher.

Critical pedagogy and cultural power
History and Education is a text that engages the history of the global class war, from the United States to the former Soviet Union, from the People's Republic of China to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in order to contribute to the development of communist pedagogy. Central to this communist pedagogy is the struggle for Native American sovereignty and for the self-determination of oppressed nations within the U.S. Pedagogical theory is mobilized to highlight the centrality of seizing state power in the movement for transforming capitalist production relations and bourgeois society into socialist relations and a communist form of society premised on the self-determination of racial, ethnic, and linguistic minorities. In the process History and Education challenges both the white chauvinism of pure proletarian communists as well as the anti-communism that, for decades, has dominated the Left in general, and the educational Left in particular, especially in the U.S. The book contributes to the current resurgence in the popularity and appeal of socialism as an achievable and necessary internationalist, solidarity-based alternative to capitalism.

Critical pedagogy : notes from the real world
Tyson E. Lewis and Richard Kahn argue for a new critical theory of the monster as an imaginary other on the margins of human and animal. Through a unique combination of critical, posthumanist, and educational theories, the authors engage in a surreal journey into the worlds of feral children, alien reptoids, and faery faiths in order to understand how social movements are renegotiating the boundaries of community. Part philosophy of imagination, part political theory, and part pedagogical critique, this book is a twenty-first century bestiary – a catalog to navigate the monstrous world in which we live. By engaging an encyclopedic range of figures from the philosophical tradition and popular culture, Lewis and Kahn lead us on a journey to discover the monsters that populate our posthuman world. We are confronted by horrible and fearsome beasts of violence, exploitation, and destruction, but we also recognize ourselves in creative monsters that blur the boundaries between human and nonhuman life. Lewis and Kahn propose paths to train the monsters of our world, a monstrous education, a pedagogy for the beautiful monsters we can become.

Although talk about dialogue is common, nothing clear, significant, and educationally useful has been written about the nature of dialogue and the principles and conditions that support or undermine it. Against Indoctrination argues that true dialogue and education require beliefs, rules, virtues, and habits that facilitate learning while preventing the acquisition of doctrines. Tasos Kazepides shows that the prerequisites for dialogue and education are similar to Ludwig Wittgenstein's concept of river-bed propositions - propositions that are the foundation of our ability to think and act reasonably. He argues that understanding education as genuine dialogue ought to become central to educational theory and practice because it is the most appropriate and effective way to motivate and engage students and the best way to guard against indoctrination. The pivotal importance of education as dialogue is emphasized for its capacity to encourage critical thought, in contrast to indoctrination, which arrests, limits, or frustrates thought.

Mentoring the mentor : a critical dialogue with Paulo Freire
Place pedagogy change is a work of creative experimentation in which we explore the ways in which pedagogies of place can enable the relational learning of connections between people, places and communities. In adding the element of place to the dynamic relations between teacher, learner, and knowledge, we articulate a pedagogy of ethical uncertainty. Ethical refers to our mutual responsibilities to others and to the more-than-human world, and uncertainty to the unpredictability inherent in our relationship with this world. In Place pedagogy change, we examine the nature of such innovative pedagogies as they emerged across the curriculum from early childhood to school and community education, and in teacher education. The book will provide a useful text for teachers and teacher eductors wishing to address questions of place and sustainability in educational research and practice.

In this new collection, contributors from a variety of disciplines provide a critical context for the relationship between feminist pedagogy and academic feminism by exploring the complex ways that critical perspectives can be brought into the classroom. Feminist Pedagogy in Higher Education discusses the processes employed to engage learners by challenging them to ask tough questions and craft complex answers, wrestle with timely problems and posit innovative solutions, and grapple with ethical dilemmas for which they seek just resolutions. Diverse experiences, interests, and perspectives—together with the various teaching and learning styles that participants bring to twenty-first-century universities—necessitate inventive and evolving pedagogical approaches, and these are explored from a critical perspective. The contributors collectively consider the implications of the theory/practice divide, which remains central within academic feminism's role as both a site of social and gender justice and as a part of the academy, and map out some of the ways in which academic feminism is located within the academy today.

Critical ethnography and education
Feminist pedagogy in higher education : critical theory and practice
Critical revolutionary pedagogy spiced by pedagogical love
In most Western developed countries, adult life is increasingly organized on the basis of short-term work contracts and reduced social security funds. In this context it seems that producing efficient job-seekers and employees becomes the main aim of educational programs for the next generation. Through case studies of young people from urban and countryside marginalized populations in Germany, USA and Brazil, this book investigates emerging educational practices and takes a critical stance towards what can be seen as neoliberal educational politics. It investigates how mediating devices such as CVs, school reports, school files, photos and narratives shape the ways in which those marginalized students reflect about their past as well as imagine their future. By building on process philosophy and time theory, post-structuralism, as well as on Vygotsky's psychological theory, the analysis differentiates between two discrete modes of human development: development of concrete skills (potential development) and development of new societal relations (virtual development, which is at the same time individual and collective). The book outlines an innovative relational account of learning and human development which can prove of particular importance for the education of marginalized students in today's globalized world.

In this research I'm moving and exploring in a landscape of an inter-disciplinary improvisation performance. The  research is structured by choosing one performance which functions as a documented snippet of an ongoing interdisciplinary  improvisation practice and is a vehicle to analyse what sort of skills and knowledge enable and are  developed in that specific ongoing practice. I map out the validity of those skills and knowledge in relationship to  a dancer's know-how in a new paradigm of performing arts, as well as how to facilitate them and what sort of  philosophical and ethical notions and issues arise in such a facilitation process. The mode of this thesis is practicebased  art-pedagogical research.  I'm proposing that the skills and knowledge that enable inter-disciplinary improvisation, and that are  simultaneously developed in the practice, are a dancer's self–reflection and decision making process; a dancer's  own research and awareness of senses and perceptions; the awareness of interaction of performer(s) and audience  during a performance situation and the collaborative approaches towards learning and creating artistic work.  These skills and knowledge share similar terrain with the skills and knowledge of a dancer in a new paradigm of  performing arts, including the new paradigm of contemporary dance, defined by a performative shift.  In addition to these, what can be specifically drawn from inter-disciplinary improvisation practice is a dancer's  awareness of her/his inherent concepts that frame her/his perception in working situations, as well as discipline  specific inherent working practices and terminology that are taken as a given, yet come up for discussion and  reflection through inter-disciplinary work.  I'm proposing that these skills and knowledge can be facilitated and developed through dialogical and critical  pedagogical approaches that take in consideration notions of freedom, responsibility, artistic ownership, artistic  integrity, as well as a notion of wider socio-political landscapes that the work exists in.  In terms of practice based working methods that can facilitate this sort of skills and knowledge, there are many  routes. One possible way are the inter-disciplinary working methods introduced in this thesis, that emphasize  action-research based working cycles, working collaboratively both within a group, as well as in co-facilitating and  approaching a facilitation process as a not-yet-known situation. This mode of working approaches a teacher as an  active researcher and facilitator, who also engages in a process of self-reflection and dialogue.
