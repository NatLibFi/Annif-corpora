The book Managing Virtual Teams explores the critical elements that must be considered in managing virtual teams in organizations from structural, managerial, and process points-of-view. Based in solid research, the book provides a deep look at the nature of virtual teams and the factors that enable their success.Using a text-analysis method, the book consolidates results from both academic and practitioners' sources about virtual team inputs, processes, and outcomes. It lays out in clear detail the key characteristics of virtual teams and traces their emergence within organizations and research literature. Managing Virtual Teams addresses the particular practices of virtual teams, not only technological-focused but also socio-emotional, including the managerial attitudes required in virtual environments seeking well-performing teams. Incorporating case studies and research results, this book demonstrates how academic research can be used to successfully manage businesses in a virtual context.This book is a valuable contribution with clear guidelines for managerial practice, both for researchers interested in learning about virtual teams and to managers and organizations dealing with the challenges of managing them. Students will also benefit from this book as they learn how to become effective and operational virtual team members, and in future, successful managers.

Nonlinear dynamics and chaos
Most undergraduate books for engineering dynamics exhibit a continuing disconnect from either the requirements of subsequent coursework or the practice of dynamics in an engineering career. Dynamics in Engineering Practice, Tenth Edition counters this dated viewpoint with a modern approach that is better suited to today's engineering study and practice. The books begins by establishing the premise that most "dynamics engineers" are developing and analyzing models to predict motion, and that the subject of differential equations is the natural language for dynamics. From this starting point, the author immediately presents mechanical vibration examples to demonstrate applications of f=ma and work-energy principles, and he includes multiple "real-world" 1DOF and MDOF planar dynamics examples, which are completely worked out.

Dynamics of floodplain forests at Bura, Tana River, Kenya: results from a permanent sample plot study
Extant populations growing in regions that were refugia during the last glacial period are expected to show higher genetic diversity than populations that moved from these refugia into new areas in higher latitudes. Such new populations likely faced harsher climatic conditions, being established with reduced population size and experiencing the effects of genetic bottlenecks. In this study we employed data from nuclear SSR markers for detecting molecular signatures of genetic bottlenecks, and germination experiments to evaluate reduction of populations' fitness in natural populations of Luehea divaricata Mart. et Zucc., growing in the southern range of the species distribution (around 30°S latitude). Signatures of genetic bottlenecks and reduction of populations' fitness were observed in all populations. Lower levels of observed heterozygosity are correlated with populations' fitness, decreasing germination capacity and increasing the proportion of anomalous germinated plantlets. Promoting the connection among populations is proposed as a key strategy towards conservation of L. divaricata genetic resources in its southernmost distribution range. The offspring from crosses among populations would significantly increase the observed heterozygosity and fitness of multiple populations.

"Considering that wavelet transforms have proved useful in the solution and analysis of engineering mechanics problems, up to now there has been no sufficiently comprehensive text on this use. Wavelet Methods for Dynamical Problems: With Application to Metallic, Composite, and Nano-Composite Structures addresses this void, exploring the special value of wavelet transforms and their applications from a mechanical engineering perspective. It discusses the use of existing and cutting-edge wavelet methods for the numerical solution of structural dynamics and wave propagation problems." "Available books on wavelet transforms generally cover their mathematical aspects and effectiveness in signal processing and as approximation bases for solution of differential equations. However, this book discusses how wavelet transforms are an optimal tool for solving ordinary differential equations obtained by modeling a structure. It also demonstrates the use of wavelet methods in solving partial differential wave equations related to structural dynamics, a topic that has not been sufficiently explored in the literature to this point. Many well-established transforms, such as Fourier, have severe limitations in handling finite structures and specifying non-zero boundary/initial conditions. As a result, they have limited utility in solving real-world problems involving high frequency excitation." "This book carefully illustrates how the use of wavelet techniques removes all these shortcomings and has a potential to become a sophisticated analysis tool for handling dynamical problems in structural engineering. Designed to be useful for both professional researchers and graduate students alike, it provides MATLAB scripts that can be used to solve problems and numerical examples that illustrate the efficiency of wavelet methods and emphasize the physics involved."--Book jacket.

On modelling and stability of axially moving viscoelastic materials
This book lays the foundations of gas- and fluid dynamics. The basic equations are developed from first principles, building on the (assumed) knowledge of Classical Mechanics. This leads to the discussion of the mathematical properties of flows, conservation laws, perturbation analysis, waves and shocks. Most of the discussion centers on ideal (frictionless) fluids and gases. Viscous flows are discussed when considering flows around obstacles and shocks. Many of the examples used to illustrate various processes come from astrophysics and geophysical phenomena.--

We investigated the impact of natural enemies on the cocoon mortality of the common pine sawfly (Diprion pini L.) during a six-year period in eastern Finland. The enemies were classified into parasitoids (insect families Chalcidoidea, Ichneumonidae, and Tachinidae), and predators (birds, small mammals, and insect families Elateridae and Carabidae). The appearance of D. pini was estimated as the intensity of annual defoliation. The impact of stand characteristics on the performance of parasitoids and predators was also investigated. Influence of the natural enemy complex on cocoon mortality of D. pini was nearly stable, but defoliation intensity slowly declined towards the end of the study period. Annual cocoon mortality by natural enemies varied between 66% and 80%. Our results verified that the most significant mortality factors were ichneumonid parasitoids and small mammals. Random Forest classification indicated that stand characteristics, such as basal area, and coverage of lichen (Lichenes) and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.) affected the performance of parasites and predators. We suggest that a combination of optimal stand characteristics, abiotic environmental factors and mild to moderate control by natural enemies acted as drivers, which drove the pine sawfly population to extended gradation. For future forest health management, detailed information on abiotic and biotic regulating factors, along with long-term monitoring campaigns for conifer sawflies are needed to adapt Fennoscandian forests to altered climatic and silvicultural conditions..
