The paper examines the impact of American Depositary Receipt (ADR) listings on   the return of underlying Russian stocks.The contribution of this   paper is twofold.First, it looks at a new sample of ADRs issued by Russian companies.Second, the technique used to estimate the market model is different from the previous studies.The returns are modeled to follow a GARCH process, as opposed to the usual OLS procedure, which assumes homoscedasticity in   residual returns.Average abnormal returns and cumulative average abnormal returns are calculated for the [-25, +25] event window, with the ADR listing date being the event date.The results indicate a significant negative abnormal local market return on an ADR listing day.Return volatilities after the listing are compared to those before the listing. Eleven out of sixteen companies experienced increased volatility of local returns after cross-listing .

The role of the financial market variables in forecasting macrovariables in Finland : does the financial crisis make a difference?
The paper focuses on the forecasting content of stock returns and volatility versus the term spread for GDP, private consumption, industrial production and inflation rate. The results suggest that during normal times the term spread is a much better tool than stock market variables for predicting real activity. However, during exceptional times the forecast performance is improved by combining the terms spread and the stock market information.
