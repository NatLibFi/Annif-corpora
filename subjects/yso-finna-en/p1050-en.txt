Humor in the Classroom provides practical, research-based answers to questions that educational researchers and language teachers might have about the social and cognitive benefits that humor and language play afford in classroom discourse and additional language learning. The book considers the ways in which humor, language play, and creativity can construct new possibilities for classroom identity, critique prevailing norms, and reconfigure particular relations of power. Humor in the Classroom encourages educational researchers and language teachers to take a fresh look at the workings of humor in today's linguistically diverse classrooms and makes the argument for its role in building a stronger foundation for studies of classroom discourse, theories of additional language development, and approaches to language pedagogy.

Teacher Language and Student Learning enables teachers to observe their actions and ask, "Do I know how children perceive my behaviors?" It also helps them to understand reasons for children's responses to their words and actions. Teachers' behaviors are categorized in vignettes, and readers determine where they fit and what changes ought to be made for their teaching practices to be more effective.

"Why do I need a teacher when I've got Google? is just one of the challenging, controversial and thought-provoking questions Ian Gilbert poses in this urgent and invigorating book. Questioning the unquestionable, this fully updated new edition will make you re-consider everything you thought you knew about teaching and learning, such as: - Are you simply preparing the next generation of unemployed accountants? - What do you do for the 'sweetcorn kids' who come out of the education system in pretty much the same state as when they went in? - What's the real point of school? - Exams - So whose bright idea was that? - Why 'EQ' is fast becoming the new 'IQ'. - What will your school policy be on brain-enhancing technologies? - Which is the odd one out between a hamster and a caravan? With his customary combination of hard-hitting truths, practical classroom ideas and irreverent sense of humour, Ian Gilbert takes the reader on a breathless rollercoaster ride through burning issues of the twenty-first century, considering everything from the threats facing the world and the challenge of the BRIC economies to the link between eugenics and the 11+. As wide-ranging and exhaustively-researched as it is entertaining and accessible, this book is designed to challenge teachers and inform them - as well as encourage them - as they strive to design a twenty-first century learning experience that really does bring the best out of all young people. After all, the future of the world may just depend on it"--

How can low-income, non-English-speaking parents become advocates, leaders, and role models in their children's schools? A Cord of Three Strands offers a close study of the Logan Square Neighborhood Association, a grassroots organization on the northwest side of Chicago, whose work with parents and schools has drawn national attention. The author identifies three elements - induction, integration, and investment - that together capture the dynamic and developmental nature of successful parent engagement.

Social stratification and classroom discourse : a sociolinguistic analysis of classroom practice
This book provides a wide-ranging and in-depth theoretical perspective on dialogue in teaching. It explores the philosophy of dialogism as a social theory of language and explains its importance in teaching and learning. Departing from the more traditional teacher-led mode of teacher-student communication, the dialogic approach is more egalitarian and focuses on the discourse exchange between the parties. Authors explore connections between dialogic pedagogy and sociocultural learning theory, and argue that dialogic interaction between teacher and learners is vital if instruction is to lead to cognitive development. The book also presents prosody as a critical resource for understanding between teachers and students, and includes some of the first empirical studies of speech prosody in classroom discourse.

The International Handbook of Research on Teachers and Teaching" provides a fresh look at the ever changing nature of the teaching profession throughout the world. This collection of over 70 original articles addresses a wide range of issues that are relevant for understanding the present educational climate in which the accountability of teachers and the standardized testing of students have become dominant. The international collection of authors brings to the handbook a breadth of knowledge and experience about the teaching profession, and a wealth of material across a number of comparative dimensions, such as between developed and developing countries, and Eastern and Western cultures. In addition, many articles address the emerging challenges to education and to the lives of teachers which are brought about by the globalization trends of the 21st Century. The handbook is divided into two volumes, and focuses on the following general topic areas: Theory and Research on Teachers; Becoming a Teacher; Characteristics of Teachers; Teacher Behaviors; Teacher Life Cycles; Theories of Teaching and Learning Teaching in Classrooms; Teaching Specific Student Populations; The Teaching of Individual Subjects; Great Debates about Teachers; and, Teaching. The handbook is written for students and researchers in the fields of education, the social sciences and the behavioral sciences. In addition, it is a valuable resource for policy-makers who want knowledge and insights based on the latest research findings. Many author recommendations are relevant for the development of educational reform policies in both developed and developing societies.
Help seeking in academic settings : goals, groups, and contexts
Critical incidents in teaching
Children's attachments to early caregivers, either inside or outside of the home, have consequences on their development. One adult relationship that is particularly salient to children outside of the home is their relationship with teachers. As children spend more of their time at school and working with teachers, the development of positive academic, behavioral, and social competence are placed in the hands of these adults. The current study explored how student-teacher relationships influence children's academic and behavioral development as evaluated by both teacher and student variables. A total of 10 third-grade teachers completed the Student-Teacher Relationship Scale (Pianta, 1992a), the Academic Competence Evaluation Scales- Teacher Form (DiPerna & Elliot, 2000), and the Social Skills Rating System- Problem Behaviors (Gresham & Elliot, 1990). A total of 80 third-grade student participants completed the Student Perception of Teacher Relationships Scale, a newly developed measure assessing students' perceptions of the relationship they share with their teacher. In addition, students' academic competence was evaluated with Curriculum-Based Measurement Oral Reading Fluency (Shinn & Shinn, 2002) and Curriculum-Based Measurement Mathematics Fluency probes (Shinn, 2002). Student behavior was evaluated through classroom observations utilizing the Behavioral Observation of Students in Schools (Shapiro, 1996). Results indicated that there was no relationship between students' and teachers' perceptions of the student-teacher relationship. Teacher perspectives of the student-teacher relationship predicted indirect measures of student problem behavior and direct measures of student classroom engagement. Student perspectives of the student-teacher relationship did not predict any student outcome variables. Limitations, directions for future research, and implications for school practice are discussed.

Numerous real world examples and learning exercises are included.
