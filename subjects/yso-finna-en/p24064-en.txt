This thesis examines the development possibilities of the Degree Programme in Tourism (DPT) in Tampere University of Applied Sciences (TAMK) from the different stakeholders' perspective. The focus development area is the curriculum of the study programme which is under renewal and will be established in 2013. The aim of the thesis is to produce concrete development ideas from the experiences and opinions of the internal and external stakeholders of TAMK. The internal stakeholders are represented by the students of the DPT, and the external stakeholders are the representatives of the local labour market. The possible cooperation between the stakeholders is investigated in order to bring working life closer to the students and studies and to benefit the local businesses. Primary data was collected from the internal stakeholders with group theme interviews and from the external stakeholders with a semi-structured questionnaire, as well as with a semi-structured élite interview. Secondary data included existing data such as scientific literature, statistics, notes, the Internet, researches and other available publications. In the thesis process, the theories of competencies and qualifications were used as well as the Learning by Developing model of Laurea University of Applied Sciences discovered by benchmarking. The collected and analyzed data revealed the target areas of development. According to the internal stakeholders the improvements should be targeted to the working life relation of the studies; to the quality of education and the course contents; to the guidance received; and to the more practical approach in studies. All these would prepare the students better for the future working life. The external stakeholders stressed that the practical know-how and multidisciplinary skills are the requirements of the working life, and that the attention should be paid to the requirements imposed by the tourism industry trends in the Tampere Region in the DPT studies. The results indicate that mutually beneficial changes to the curriculum and cooperation between the stakeholders can be made, in which case the studies would prepare the students with competencies to meet the qualifications of the working life. According to the writers' of the thesis the working life relation in the studies should be emphasized more and it would also be one area for further research. Key words: Curriculum, developing, DPT, stakeholder, Tampere Region.

Global leadership competencies
For the past few decades, technology has been touted as the cure for all of healthcare's ills, yet medicine stubbornly resisted computerization-- until now. Thanks largely to billions of dollars in federal incentives, healthcare has finally gone digital. Wachter examines healthcare at the dawn of its computer age, and shows how technology is changing care at the bedside. He questions whether government intervention has been useful or destructive-- and does so with clarity, insight, humor, and compassion.

Abstract: The purpose of this final project was to discover the perceptions and expectations of ethnically diverse population regarding culturally competent care. We also wanted to find out what the patients considered to be the main barriers in providing culturally competent care. We aimed to find studies specifically in primary care settings.     This final project is a part of Local and Global Development in Social Services and Health Care (LOG-Sote) project. This project aims to develop heath care services in Finland towards a more immigrant-friendly direction. The methodology of this final project was a systematic literature review consisting of fifteen research articles obtained through CINAHL, PUBMED and OVID (MEDLINE) databases.     The findings indicated that the patients expected the care they received from the health care providers to be family-orientated, respectful and holistic. Patients also wanted their cultural, religious and traditional beliefs and practices to be taken into account throughout their care. The main barriers to culturally competent care, according to the patients from various different ethnic backgrounds, were mostly related to communication, lack of common language between the patients and the healthcare providers, inadequate information provided to the patients by the healthcare providers and unmet health care need.     If the patients' expectations and perceptions regarding culturally competent care are discovered, it would help the health care professionals to understand their patients' needs and provide culturally appropriate care. This could help the health care professionals to further develop their cultural competence skills, thus, improving the cooperation with patients from different ethnical backgrounds..
In-service teachers' learning through integrating theory and practice
Vocational education aims to prepare competent workforce for the needs of continuously changing work life. A competent employee does not only carry out routine tasks but is also required to have the ability to act in the communities of practice in his field and develop his way of working. The challenge of Finnish school-based vocational education has been in creating such learning environments that promote learning professional knowledge demanded by work life. The challenge has required vocational teachers to develop their competences in collaboration with employers. The research covers the role of Finnish vocational teachers' authentic work placement periods in developing competences from the viewpoint of sociocultural learning. During the work placement period, a teacher furthers his or her competences by working in goal-oriented and planned ways in the work communities of enterprises or in the public sector of their fields. The purpose of the present qualitative case study is to increase the understanding of the role of authentic work placement periods in vocational teachers' competence. Experiences of teachers representing different subjects were studied during their work placement periods. The results show that work placement period supports the development of teachers' competences and provides prerequisites for work-based vocational education.
