This article deals with the positive and negative consequences of foreign labour migration in Russia. The authors emphasize that Russia is not a homogeneous country. The socio-economic implications for regions differ. This study has found foreign labour migration to be a complicated socio-economic phenomenon, which has a dual effect on the labor market in Russia: on the one hand it is filling the gap in the labour force caused by the demographic crisis; on the other hand it increases the tension on the labour market because of migrants.

What connects the Baltimore Washington International Airport and South Korea's Songdo International Business District? What are the cultural narratives that unfold from their bold visions of mobility and of the city in transit and transition? Put another way, what are the relations between modernity, mobile lifestyles, and urban spaces as we move deeper into what the French sociologist Marc Augé has called the age of 'supermodernity'? Perhaps more importantly, are there alternative ways of thinking about mobility and the future of society in a rapidly shrinking, globally interconnected and, at the same time, socially and culturally divided world?

Most classical authors and modern historians depict the ancient Greek world as essentially stable and even static, once the so-called colonization movement came to an end. But Robert Garland argues that the Greeks were highly mobile, that their movement was essential to the survival, success, and sheer sustainability of their society, and that this wandering became a defining characteristic of their culture. Addressing a neglected but essential subject, Wandering Greeks focuses on the diaspora of tens of thousands of people between about 700 and 325 BCE, demonstrating the degree to which Greeks were liable to be forced to leave their homes due to political upheaval, oppression, poverty, warfare, or simply a desire to better themselves. Attempting to enter into the mind-set of these wanderers, the book provides an insightful and sympathetic account of what it meant for ancient Greeks to part from everyone and everything they held dear, to start a new life elsewhere--or even to become homeless, living on the open road or on the high seas with no end to their journey in sight. Each chapter identifies a specific kind of "wanderer," including the overseas settler, the deportee, the evacuee, the asylum-seeker, the fugitive, the economic migrant, and the itinerant, and the book also addresses repatriation and the idea of the "portable polis." The result is a vivid and unique portrait of ancient Greece as a culture of displaced persons.

Are you ready to run? Is there a bridge from the injury-ridden world of the modern runner to the promised land that barefoot running and Born to Run have led us to believe exists? Is there an approach designed to unlock all the athletic potential that may be hidden within? Can we run faster, longer, and more efficiently? In a direct answer to the modern runner's needs, Dr. Kelly Starrett has focused his revolutionary movement and mobility philosophy on the injury-plagued world of running. Despite the promises of the growing minimalist-shoe industry and a rush of new ideas on how to transform running technique, more than three out of four runners suffer at least one injury per year. Life in the modern world has trashed and undercut dedicated runners wishing to transform their running. The harsh effects of too much sitting and too much time wearing the wrong shoes has left us shackled to lower back problems, chronic knee injuries, and debilitating foot pain. In this book, you will learn the 12 standards that will prepare your body for a lifetime of top-performance running.--From publisher description.

Today, industries and consumer markets are increasingly using services exposed from wireless sensor and actuator networks. Such systems are here referred to as cyber-physical machine-to-machine systems. These systems rely on the capability to communicate, compute, monitor and control by using information. The motivation for the present research arises from problems detected in the remote interaction with embedded devices over dynamic wireless networks in such systems. The problems are caused by the heterogeneity of devices, networks and operating environments, mobility, dynamic presence, security demands of the owners and of use, multiple radios, unreliability, dynamic topologies, and changes happening in the system.The approach selected in this research to address these problems is based on the application of the small-world paradigm to cyber-physical systems. The small-world paradigm is based on the observation that people are often linked in a successful social communication chain by, on average, six intermediate steps. In the present study, it is assumed that the concept of small world can be expanded to also cover communication with wireless embedded devices in cyber-physical systems context. In addition, it is expected that creation of wireless short-cuts can, in accordance with the small-world paradigm, improve the scalability and efficiency of dynamic wireless networking.The main contributions of this research are the technical enablers referred to as dynamic communication spaces, dynamic M2M service spaces, configuration and remote use of services, communication overlay, access systems selection, integrated mobility, secure ad hoc networking, situated opportunistic communication, hierarchical networking for small-world networks, and short-cuts for network optimization. Each of the provided technical enablers contributes towards making remote interaction withembedded devices over dynamic wireless networks possible. The enablers have been evaluated as separate technical methods and means by means of experiments and/or simulations. On the basis of the analysis and synthesis, it was established that they work well as separate building blocks and that they can be combined to expand the concept of small world to also cover communication with embedded devices. Furthermore, it was established that creation of wireless short-cuts can, in accordance with the small-world concept, improve the scalability and efficiency of dynamic wireless networking. In addition, weak links were observed to be essential in the small-world neighbour discovery process. In sum, the evaluation results indicate that the provided enablers help the remote interaction with embedded devices and promote the application of the smallworld concept to dynamic wireless cyber-physical systems.
The career potential of migrant scholars in Finnish higher education : emerging perspectives and dynamics
"In the current historical moment borders have taken on heightened material and symbolic significance, shaping identities and the social and political landscape. "Borders"--defined broadly to include territorial dividing lines as well as sociocultural boundaries--have become increasingly salient sites of struggle over social belonging and cultural and material resources. How do contemporary activists navigate and challenge these borders? What meanings do they ascribe to different social, cultural and political boundaries, and how do these meanings shape the strategies in which they engage? Moreover, how do these social movements confront internal borders based on the differences that emerge within social change initiatives? Border Politics, edited by Nancy A. Naples and Jennifer Bickham Mendez, explores these important questions through eleven carefully selected case studies situated in geographic contexts around the globe. By conceptualizing struggles over identity, social belonging and exclusion as extensions of border politics, the authors capture the complex ways in which geographic, cultural, and symbolic dividing lines are blurred and transcended, but also fortified and redrawn. This volume notably places right-wing and social justice initiatives in the same analytical frame to identify patterns that span the political spectrum. Border Politics offers a lens through which to understand borders as sites of diverse struggles, as well as the strategies and practices used by diverse social movements in today's globally interconnected world.

The article examines the reproduction of labor potential in the Republic of Karelia. Particular attention in the research is given to the effects of the main types of social and labor mobility (territorial, educational, professional and medical). The article stems from theoretical explorations of this subject by Russian researchers and the results of an economic and sociological survey of the working-age population of the Karelia region. It was conducted with the participation of the author in 2012 in the three municipalities of the Republic of Karelia. The research surveyed 450 respondents. The survey and statistical analysis of demographic data helped to establish the information base, which allowed performing a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the reproduction of labor potential while evaluating the impact of social and labor mobility..

Abstract: This article examines the interconnectedness of geographical and social mobility using the empirical case of young, highly educated Russian women's migration to Finland. My qualitative interview data shows that an insecure migrant status channels young migrant women to a precarious gendered path from au pairing to studying and working in a low-skilled sector in order to continue residence in Finland. The stories of highly educated migrant women doing domestic and low-skilled work show how geographical mobility is achieved at the cost of descending social status. The empirical discussion demonstrates that “subjects on the move” celebrated by the new mobility paradigm are, in fact, unequally mobile, and achieve mobility at a high social cost, including social downgrading and deskilling. Furthermore, structural vulnerabilities in terms of insecure migrant status create dependence on employers and produce opportunities for the exploitation of migrant labour.
