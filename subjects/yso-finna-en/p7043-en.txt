The majority of India's labor force is self-employed in the unorganized micro enterprise sector. Faced with financial constraints, lack of access to credit and professional advice, such enterprises are vulnerable and susceptible to external shocks and disasters. Knowing how micro enterprises cope after disasters, how they make strategic plans, take credit, invest and save, how they deal with suppliers and customers is important for understanding the potential of this sector and for improving micro development strategies. This study analyzes business and investment strategies of micro enterprises in disaster affected areas of Gujarat, India, using a case study and survey supported approach. Key questions are: How do micro enterprises manage their businesses? How do they handle credit, savings and investment? What are priorities of investment? How do micro enterprises overcome and adapt to disasters/external shocks? What factors define success or failure of micro enterprises? How does the organization in a Chamber of Commerce for micro enterprises affect the business? Results show that investing in social expenses in order to build up social capital can go to the detriment of financial capital and thus, increases vulnerability. Savings are a main factor of business success as long as they are used for long-term productive investments and not for short-term social expenses which can use up all resources and possibly expose micro entrepreneurs to exploitative credit conditions. However, not formal education but financial literacy would seem to inform individual choices and priorities concerning investment of savings. These choices are what determines whether micro entrepreneurs are able to minimize their vulnerability to structural givens within their sphere of influence. In order to enhance financial literacy, savings and access to micro credit, the connection between social and financial capital should be further explored. Lessons learnt from informal businesses can lead to an adaptation of development strategies assisting micro entrepreneurs in the unorganized informal sector. -- -- T.p. verso.

This book demonstrates that the much-needed global shift in energy production and use must happen at a territorial level in order to be truly successful and sustainable. This book enables regional implementation efforts by connecting broad EU environmental policies with plans for action at the territorial level, analysing efficient resource allocation and cost effectiveness to achieve national objectives. Each EU Member State is considered in depth, in order to identify the opportunities and challenges of this regional approach. The regional dimension of the authors' analysis refers to the territorial level NUTS 1 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) that, starting from the administrative borders of the EU countries, divides the territory into 97 regions on the basis of major socio-economic characteristics. Because the model of the EU "green economy" is characterized typically by top-down interventions that focus exclusively on the resource productivity and investment business, its practical implementation can be de-railed. This book provides the pivotal missing piece- the detailed territorial comparative analysis necessary to obtain an optimal energy mix of renewable energy sources (RES), energy conservation and energy efficiency characteristics of each specific local context.

This book looks both backward and forward with regard to the European Union's political strategies towards its neighbouring countries. By bringing together the perspectives of critical geopolitics, policy studies and border studies, it presents a comprehensive review of the European Neighbourhood Policy and how it impacts the ongoing construction of the EU's external frontiers. Is the EU committed to promoting integration in a 'wider' European space, or is a "fortress Europe" emerging where the strengthening of internal cohesion is coupled with the militarisation of its external borders? The book aims to problematize this question by showing how the EU's external policies are based on a mixture of openness and closure, inclusion and exclusion, cooperation and securitisation. The European Neighbourhood Policy is a controversial strategy where regionalization and bordering, homogenisations and differentiations, centrifugal and centripetal forces proceed side-by-side, in an explicit attempt to construct a selective, mobile and fragmented border. A specific focus is devoted to the diversity of geo-strategies the EU is pursuing in its neighbouring countries and regions, macro-regional strategies and cross-border cooperation initiatives as new scales of cooperation, and the role of other global players.

"Could information and communication technology (ICT) become the transformative tool for a new style of global development? Could ICT promote knowledge-based, innovation-driven, and smart, adaptive, participatory development? As countries seek a way out of the present period of economic contraction, they are trying to weave ICT into their development strategies, in the same way organizations have learned to use ICT to transform their business models and strategies. This integration offers a new path to development that is responsive to the challenges of our times. In e-Transformation, Nagy Hanna identifies the key ingredients for the strategic integration of ICT into national development, with examples from around the world. He draws on his rich experience of over 35 years at the World Bank and other aid agencies to outline the strategic options involved in using ICT to maximize developmental impact - transforming public service institutions, networking businesses for innovation and competitiveness, and empowering communities for social inclusion and poverty reduction. He identifies the key interdependencies in e-transformation and offers a holistic framework to tap network effects and synergies across all elements of the process, including leadership, cyber policies, institutions, human resources, technological competencies, information infrastructure, and ICT uses for government, business, and society."--Book cover
