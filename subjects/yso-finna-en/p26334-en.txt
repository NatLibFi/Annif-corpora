Corporate Responsibility Reporting Based on GRI Reporting Standard : Development of reporting of case companies Cargolux, Finnair and SAS
This book introduces the integrated management concept of "Sustainable Value Creation", which delivers sustainability inside-out from the core business. It is based on the premise that sustainability can provide a platform for growth, if it is implemented in a company's products, services and supply chains (combined also known as the 'Value Chain'). Managing the Value Chain from the outset with a sustainability mindset subsequently allows profitable economical, ecological and societal growth. It combines the need for increased sustainability and its implementation in the operations of a company. The book addresses the following issues: How do economic, environmental and societal factors impact the value-creation process of a company? What requirements and expectations need to be met to balance economic, ecologic and societal value creation? What are the building blocks and measures that can be utilized on the journey towards building a sustainable value chain? What benefits can be achieved through sustainable value chains? What are the practical examples of sustainable value chains in leading companies that can inspire others to follow? The book includes contributions from the following organisations and companies: Beiersdorf, SAP, Klenk und Hoursch, VAUDE, Infineon Technologies, Independent Capital Management, BASF, Nanogate, the Federal German Council for Sustainable Development, Henkel, Symrise, shared.value.chain, Siemens, Fairphone and Thin Air Factory

The Corporate Responsibility Code Book has become the go-to guide for companies trying to understand the landscape of corporate responsibility and searching for their own, unique route towards satisfying diverse stakeholders.
Sustainability advanced to an omnipresent topic among academics and business leaders, while at the same time a growing share of a firms total expenditure accounts for purchased materials and services. Yet, academic research still lacks a detailed understanding of how sustainability considerations affect the relationship between buyers and suppliers in a competitive supply chain setting. With his three articles on Sustainability in Supply Chains, Thomas Leppelt contributes to extant literature across the disciplines of supply chain management and marketing by cross-functionally investigating the effects of sustainability on supplier-buyer relationships from both a supplier and a buyer perspective. Contents Sustainable supplier relationship management Marketing of sustainable supply chain management capabilities in business markets Drivers of marketing-purchasing integration at the supplier level Target Groups Researchers and students in the fields of supply chain management, marketing, and management Managers and experts who are interested in strategically managing their supply chain towards sustainability About the Author Dr. Thomas Leppelt received his doctors degree from Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nrnberg in business administration at the Chair of Prof. Dr.-Ing. Evi Hartmann. He is working in the automotive industry. In his research he focuses on sustainability aspects in interdependent supply chain settings.

This book examines the key legal and business aspects of sustainability in depth.Recognizing the firm's need for integrated approaches to law and sustainability as well as adaptive goal setting, the book unites scholars from environmental law, energy, risk regulation and intellectual property. Most firms now recognize that global resources are finite and will grow increasingly scarce.They acknowledge that their actions have social, economic and environmental consequences. Some firms now practice 'whole life-cycle' analysis in marketing and product design, seek sustainable inputs and energy sources, and track and report sustainability performance overall, however it can be measured. But standard practices have not kept pace.Regulators must support such efforts with mandatory structures for all firms enabling leaders to gain competitive advantages and laggards to pay the price.The variety of regulatory tools has grown to include cooperative funding, intellectual property rights, information disclosures, and other means.And that variety is most urgently needed in transition economies where the forces of international competition can be the strongest.The chapters in this book push beyond the traditional boundaries separating these dimensions of law, business and sustainability to offer both practical insights and directions for future research in this immense and growing nexus.

Corporate social responsibility and sustainability are global issues. Many companies participate in the movement towards more sustainable operations and develop corporate social responsibility principles. The objective of this thesis was to find out what aspects have to be taken into consideration in order to manage corporate social responsibility successfully. Furthermore, it was examined how corporate social responsibility is man-aged in practice at Nanso Group Oy. Literature from different sources was gathered to form a theoretical framework. The case study method was used to gather information for the research part. At the beginning of the strategy formulation process central issues have to be selected. A company has to follow certain national and international laws when operating. Furthermore, the company has to be aware of certain risks and problems when producing abroad. Different stakeholders have to be taken into consideration when choosing the target areas for the strategy. The goals have to be defined and actions to reach the goals. Goals can be timeless or have a specific numeric goal. In addition to that, performance indicators have to be chosen in order to measure changes. Furthermore, it has to be decided how efforts regarding corporate social responsibility are communicated to company's stakeholders. According to theory, many aspects have to be taken into consideration in order to manage corporate social responsibility successfully. In practice, challenging in the corporate social responsibility strategy process was the phase where the strategy has to gain a foothold.  It had to get through to the employees with the goal that they incorporate it in their daily work. Furthermore, limited availability of resources sets challenges.

"The Business of Good narrates the story behind social entrepreneurship as told by the individuals compelled to create a change in the world--not just another business. Serial and social entrepreneur Jason Haber intertwines case studies, anecdotes, and initiatives that have become part of the larger narrative of entrepreneurship. From Main Street to Wall Street, today's social entrepreneurs are rebooting capitalism, challenging the charitable industrial complex, and are disrupting the way companies do business with exciting innovations designed to solve society's most vexing problems. In this book, Haber examines Capitalism 2.0, philanthropy, and the role and power of media alongside the world's response as social entrepreneurship changes how we give, how we invest, and who we are.

When it comes to perceptions of what is a sustainable economy and how it may be realised, companies expanding into Central and Eastern European markets face the challenge of diverse people, attitudes and history. Corporate Social Performance in Emerging Markets provides an effective tool for companies to help them engage in CSR activities and become a responsible company in CEE countries such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia and Slovenia. It does this by enabling them to focus on the difference of stakeholders and their attitudes to those of Western Europe.The author, Zsofia Lakatos, provides a review of the major differences between the various CEE countries, supported by interview research from leading executives in some of the blue-chip companies already operating in the region.

Abstract: Corporate responsibility reporting based on GRI reporting standard : development of reporting of case companies Cargolux, Finnair and SAS. This thesis examined the corporate responsibility (CR) reporting. The thesis consists of theoretical part and a multiple case study, in which the CR reports of three European airlines are analysed. All of the case companies are reporting according to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, which is the most commonly used reporting standard globally. The aim of the study was to find out how the CR reports of the case companies have developed during the past five years and how well the reports match the GRI reporting guidelines. Also some conclusions were drawn on how the reports could be improved further. This study was conducted by using qualitative research methods. The theoretical part was constructed by thorough research of literature on the topic. The main sources of information for the case study were the CR reports of the case companies from the past five years. Also an interview of one company representative was conducted to gain insight to matters that were left unanswered after the study of the literature and the reports. The findings of the study show that GRI guidelines set a good basis for the reporting, but still leave enough latitude for the companies to emphasise the matters they find the most relevant. It was noticed that environmental issues were given the most space in the reports, but during the recent years there has been a significant rise in the reporting of social matters.

This book explores the current state of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in 24 European nations, examining the state of the development and practice of CSR and sustainability for organizations in these countries. The common denominator for all of the bookâs 25 chapters is a management perspective rather than an ethical discourse. The book therefore represents a comprehensive survey of initiatives and activities in the field of CSR and provides a wealth of complete cases and examples for different approaches to sustainable and responsible management practice. The book also reviews the relevant political and governmental guidelines and frameworks for organizations, both on a national and a European level. Europe has taken a leading role in the promotion and implementation of CSR. This book showcases how, through CSR, enterprises can significantly contribute to achieving the European Unionâs treaty objectives of sustainable development and a highly competitive social market economy.

In recent years, corporations of all sizes and orientations have become more sensitive to social issues and stakeholder concerns, and they are collectively striving to become better corporate citizens (in some cases, urged on by shareholder pressure or government regulations). The best practices in corporate sustainability are no longer the exclusive domain of companies like Ben & Jerry's or Body Shop as they were a decade ago; now, large, multi-national companies like G.E. and Wal-Mart are leading the way with significant financial and organizational commitments to social and environmental issues. To help managers and academics keep their eye on the ever-moving target of sustainability, award-winning author and academic Marc Epstein's provides an authoritative and comprehensive guide to implementing corporate sustainability initiatives and to measuring both their social and financial impacts.

Environmental management systems : understanding organisational drivers and barriers
In 1984, R. Edward Freeman published his landmark book, Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach, a work that set the agenda for what we now call stakeholder theory. In the intervening years, the literature on stakeholder theory has become vast and diverse. This book examines this body of research and assesses its relevance for our understanding of modern business. Beginning with a discussion of the origins and development of stakeholder theory, it shows how this corpus of theory has influenced a variety of different fields, including strategic management, finance, accounting, management, marketing, law, health care, public policy, and environment. It also features in-depth discussions of two important areas that stakeholder theory has helped to shape and define: business ethics and corporate social responsibility. The book concludes by arguing that we should re-frame capitalism in the terms of stakeholder theory so that we come to see business as creating value for stakeholders.

"A thought-provoking investigation of an urgent issue facing American communities today, Edward C. Lorenz's book examines the intersection of corporate irresponsibility and civic engagement. At the heart of this case study is a group of firms responsible for seven of the most contaminated Superfund sites in the United States, the largest food contamination accident in U.S. history, stunning stock and financial manipulations, and a massive shift of jobs offshore. In the face of these egregious environmental, employee, and investor abuses, several communities impacted by these firms organized to confront and combat failures in corporate and bureaucratic leadership, winning notable victories over major financiers, lobbyists, and indifferent or ineffective government agencies. A critical analysis of public and private leadership, business and economic ethics, and civic life, this book concludes with a stirring blueprint for other communities facing similarly overwhelming opposition"--
