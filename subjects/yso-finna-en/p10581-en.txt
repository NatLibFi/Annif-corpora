The pages were optimized for search engines using .htaccess file for URL rewriting as well as valid XHTML and CSS code, descriptive meta tags and informational page titles.

Abstract: The purpose of this thesis was to explore the different ways of publishing multimedia content on the web using HTML5 to allow an easier and more effective implementation of the dynamic content on the web.    A brief history and overview of HTML and its progression are covered to show how HTML5s development came about. HTML5 features are discussed focusing mainly on HTML5 video, audio and canvas. The practical part of the project includes the development of a custom player that is implemented using HTML5, JavaScript and cascading style sheets.    With the help of this thesis, one would be able to build a custom video player that would allow easier customization with JavaScript and cascading style sheets, depending on the developers competence. It would also allow the developer to develop the application further as the basics are provided in this thesis. The results of the project were tested on different devices and browsers in order to see how they were supported. This provided us with excellent results that allowed us to stream clips across different browsers considering it was a demo application. It is however important to keep in mind that the standards of HTML 5 are still under development and may therefore be changed at any time..

Microsoft Sharepoint for Office 2013 : brief
New perspectives on HTML and CSS : introductory
Custom SharePoint Solutions with HTML and JavaScript shows you how to build and customize SharePoint solutions to suit a wide range of business needs. You don't need a background in Microsoft technologies; you’ll learn how to rapidly build and customize sites entirely on the front end, starting with out-of-the-box features and extending them with HTML and JavaScript code. The book starts with an introduction to working with SharePoint on the front end, and how this can help you avoid common pitfalls associated with deploying custom code on the server. You’ll start by using SharePoint’s browser-based tools to place and manipulate out-of-the-box web parts on a page. Then learn to inject some simple HTML and JavaScript to manipulate these web parts, and use JSLink to rapidly style and manipulate data in the List web part. You'll also see examples of how to build your own custom web parts using HTML, JavaScript and CSS. For those who want to dive deeper into JavaScript on SharePoint, chapters cover working directly with built-in JavaScript methods and properties and the JavaScript object model (JSOM), and how to work with the powerful new REST API, which gives you the ultimate flexibility over what you do with your data. Whatever your background, whether it's web development, working with SharePoint on the server side, or if you're a SharePoint user looking to learn new skills, Custom SharePoint Solutions with HTML and JavaScript will show you how to get what you want from SharePoint, quickly and reliably.
