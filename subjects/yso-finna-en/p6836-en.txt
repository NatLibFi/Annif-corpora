COGNITION & COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY. Human faces are unique biological structures which convey a complex variety of important social messages. Even strangers can tell things from our faces - our feelings, our locus of attention, something of what we are saying, our age, sex and ethnic group, whether they find us attractive. In recent years there has been genuine progress in understanding how our brains derive all these different messages from faces and what can happen when one or other of the structures involved is damaged. Face Perception provides an up-to-date, integrative summary by two authors who have helped develop and shape the field over the past 30 years. It encompasses topics as diverse as the visual information our brains can exploit when we look at faces, whether prejudicial attitudes can affect how we see faces, and how people with neurodevelopmental disorders see faces.

The primacy of movement
An authentic, unique and memorable destination image is of crucial importance to be competitive in the long-term. Verena Schwaighofer analyses the currently transferred image of the United Arab Emirates as a tourist destination and to what extent the traditional Arabian culture is integrated into the image strategies of image developers in this country. First of all, a detailed theoretical overview referring to various image types, the current image transfer including critical topics related to the religion of Islam, womens role in society, behaviour, body language and dress code and the open-mindedness of the United Arab Emirates regarding local traditions related to the religion of Islam, is given. In the empirical part, a mixed method, including a qualitative media analysis (focusing on print and new media of image developers as well as newspaper articles published by journalists in the United Arab Emirates and the surrounding countries) and qualitative expert interviews are selected as appropriate research methodology. Contents Image and Destination Brands The Image of the United Arab Emirates The traditional Arabian Culture Target Groups Researchers and students in the fields of management and innovation in tourism Executives in these areas The Author Verena Schwaighofer wrote her master thesis under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Sc. Othmar M. Lehner at the Department of Innovation and Management in Tourism at Fachhochschule Salzburg, Austria.

From the writings of Keith Bain, Michael Campbell has collated a step-by-step course for students and teachers on the principles and practice of Australia's great teacher of Movement. In simple language he lays out the secrets of self-knowledge that lie behind understanding the body and mind. 'Movement', says Bain, 'is both how we move and what moves us, Movement is the look in our eyes, the tensions and the tone in our muscles, our breathing, our thinking, our longings and fears. Movement has equal concern for the inner and outer aspects, with each clarifying the other.

Why is it that some teachers have a kind of magical charisma and charm in the classroom which sets them apart from their peers? The answer is: they have the 'X-Factor'. White and Gardner's gripping text, The Classroom X Factor, examines the notion of having what the public has come to call the 'X-Factor' from the perspective of the teacher, offering fascinating insight into the use of non verbal communication in the classroom. Using classroom and curricular examples this book sets out to show how both trainee and practicing teachers can identify their own 'X-Factor' in order to help transform their perspectives and perceptions of themselves during the 'live act' of teaching. White and Gardner show that by following simple methods borrowed from psychology and cognitive science teachers can develop their own 'X-Factor' and in so doing increase their enjoyment and efficacy as professionals. The techniques described include some of the following: - Facial and vocal expression - Gesture and body language - Use of space and physical arrangement of the classroom - Pupil motivation - Pedagogical approaches.

Many theatre practitioners think of physical theatre as one thing and text-based theatre as another. In this book, Dymphna Callery, author of Through the Body: A practical guide to physical theatre, shows how exercises and rehearsal techniques associated with physical and devised theatre can be applied to scripted plays. Working 'through the body' enables performers to discover what really makes a play work. Drawing on key practitioners, including Jacques Lecoq, Joan Littlewood, Peter Brook and Simon McBurney, The Active Text offers a complete approach to working with a scripted play, leading the reader through a process of active exploration and experimentation that includes: Uncovering a play's internal dynamics, Using improvisation and theatre games, Exploiting the languages of the body, Getting inside the words that are spoken (as well as those that aren't!), Discovering image structures, Understanding the impact on the audience. Throughout the book, the author draws on a core selection of well-known texts (from Sophocles and Shakespeare to Brecht, Arthur Miller, Steven Berkoff and Sarah Kane), showing how an active approach to text can challenge assumptions about even the most familiar of plays. Packed with theatre games, improvisation exercises and rehearsal techniques, The Active Text is an inspirational guide for performers, directors, students and teachers. It will revitalise work in the rehearsal room, workshop or classroom – anywhere that dramatic text needs to be brought to life.

The moving body : teaching creative theatre
Jacques Lecoq was one of the most inspirational theatre teachers of our age. The International Theatre School he founded in Paris remains an unrivalled centre for the art of physical theatre. In The Moving Body, Lecoq shares his unique philosophy of performance, improvisation, masks, movement and gesture which together form one of the greatest influences on contemporary theatre. Neutral mask, character mask, and counter masks, bouffons, acrobatics and commedia, clowns and complicity: all the famous Lecoq techniques are covered here - techniques that have made their way into the work of former collaborators and students inluding Dario Fo, Julie Taymor, Ariane Mnouchkine, Yasmina Reza and Theatre de Complicite.
