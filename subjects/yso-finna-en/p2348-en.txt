Orexins are neuropeptides for which signalling effects have been noted in multiple functions of the central nervous system, and also potentially in the periphery of the body. Orexin receptors couple to a number of different proteins eliciting cellular responses such as activation/inhibition of ion channels, kinase activation, and second messenger generation, and downstream effects such as neuronal excitation, synaptic plasticity, and cell death. The majority of knowledge on orexin signalling has been obtained from recombinant expression systems, thus studies of signalling responses in specific cell or tissue types are desired. The goal of this master's thesis project was to investigate orexin signalling in two mouse brown adipocyte precursor cell lines (C3H10T1/2 and HIB1b) with native OX1 receptor expression. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation was assessed by western blot analysis, while phospholipase D (PLD) activity, arachidonic acid (AA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) release, and adenylyl cyclase activity were assessed by radioactive prelabelling, extraction and separation of the molecular species, and quantification of radioactivity. p38 was activated by orexin in C3H10T1/2 cells, but not HIB1b cells; PLD, AA, and 2-AG showed no response to orexin; and adenylyl cyclase appears to be both stimulated and inhibited by orexin, at different concentrations. The results indicate that orexin signalling in these cell lines significantly differs from recombinantly expressed orexin receptors. This raises interesting questions regarding the variability of responses to orexin in different tissue types.
Splicing of introns and joining of exons to yield mature and functional mRNA molecules is carried out through two sequential trans-esterification reactions by two distinct spliceosomes; the major U2-dependent and the minor U12-dependent spliceosomes. Alternative splicing is common in eukaryotes and occurs mostly with U2 type introns. The level of minor spliceosomes specific proteins, U11-48K and U11/U12-65K, are regulated via alternative splicing where U11 snRNP binds to the USSE (U11 snRNP binding splicing enhancer), a tandem repeat of 5'ss of U12-type introns, and activates an upstream 3'ss of the U2 dependent spliceosome. Here, I carried forward the study done in Verbeeren et al, 2010, through manipulation of the distance between the two 5'ss within the USSE element, and the distance between the upstream 3'splice site and USSE. The mechanisms through which USSE recognition by the U11 snRNP is achieved, as well as the distance constraints the USSE element imposes on alternative splicing, were analyzed. RT-PCR analysis shows that (a) occurrence of the alternative splicing event drops with reduced distance between 3'ss-USSE, and is finally lost when the distance is reduced to zero, (b) both increased and decreased distance between the two 5'ss within the USSE resulted in reduced long isoform formation. The data set suggests that the simultaneous binding of two 5'ss within USSE by U11/U12 snRNPs and their interaction is necessary for USSE mediated alternative splicing activation. So, the evolutionary conserved sequence within USSE, and the distance to 3'ss are critical for USSE mediated alternative splicing.

"New Arcadia is a city-sized oil rig off the coast of the Canadian Maritimes, now owned by one very wealthy, powerful, byzantine family: Lynch Ltd. Hwa is of the few people in her community to forgo bio-engineered enhancements, but her expertise in the arts of self-defense and her record as a fighter mean that her services are yet in high demand. When the youngest Lynch needs training and protection, the family turns to Hwa. But can even she protect against increasingly intense death threats seemingly coming from another timeline? Meanwhile, a series of interconnected murders threatens the city's stability and heightens the unease of a rig turning over. All signs point to a nearly invisible serial killer, but all of the murders seem to lead right back to Hwa's front door. Company Town has never been the safest place to be - but now, the danger is personal" --
