Human rights education : reflections on theory and practice
This major new study focuses on human rights education in theory and practice. It has three main themes that are inter-related and developed over a range of national and international contexts. The first theme addresses the role of human rights teaching in citizenship education and in education for sustainable development. The second theme focuses on the rights of children in education and the concept of 'voice'. The third theme locates human rights education in curriculum design and classroom practice. This book, which brings together a range of papers originally presented at a conference hosted by the Centre for Human Rights and Citizenship Education in St. Patrick's College in Dublin, makes an important contribution to the current thinking and best practice in human rights education. Contributors include Fionnuala Waldron, Hugh Starkey, James A. Banks, Peter Kirschlaeger, Anita Prunty, Paula Murphy, Susan Pike, Brian Ruane, Colum Kenny and Fintan McCutcheon.

"This book discusses how consultations with young children could signal a change of thinking about how children might influence policy and shape the development of a child-friendly state. While the consultations in this study were germane to political decisions, they took place as multi-modal dialogue with children in their educational settings. Framed by Australia's national early years learning framework which focuses on children's belonging and identity, the consultations saw unique partnerships formed among children, educators, families and policy officers, providing ways in which children's voices may be engaged in educational spaces throughout the world. Using a qualitative case study approach, these consultations were documented through observations, interviews, artefact collection and document analyses, allowing the authors to construct a framework for engaging children as citizens that is transferable to a variety of settings. Chapters provide: - an insight into the various aspects involved in children's consultations from conceptualizing and planning consultations with young children, to implementation and documentation, through to the uptake and consequence of children's messages; - factors that contribute to the effectiveness of consultations, challenges that arise, and areas for improvement when engaging with children's voices; - implications for children's participation as valued citizens and a framework for considering young children's voices in decision-making processes. This book offers fresh ideas for working with young children in the decision making process and will appeal to early childhood researchers, educators, policymakers and practitioners across various sectors, agencies and disciplines"--

"In this concluding volume, the series editor discusses education about Europe, how education contributes to the construction of the identities of young people in contemporary Europe, and the education that might be thought necessary in order to 'be a European'. Starting from the premise that concepts such as identity, citizenship, nation and Europe are inventions or constructions made by and shared with members of a particular society, this book reflects on current changes in society, and particularly European society, and how these affect the way in which young people conceptualise and construct their identities and their social relationships with their societies."--BOOK JACKET.

Democracy, lifelong learning and the learning society : active citizenship in a late modern age
There is strong social and political interest in active citizenship and values in education internationally. Active citizenship requires children to experience and internalize moral values for human rights, developing their own opinions and moral responsibility. While investment in young children is recognised as an important factor in the development of citizenship for a cohesive society, less is known about how early years teachers can encourage this in the classroom. This book will present new directions on how teachers can promote children's learning of moral values for citizenship in classrooms. The research provided offers important insights into teaching for active citizenship by: * providing an analysis of educational contexts for moral values for active citizenship * highlighting teachers' beliefs about knowing and knowledge (personal epistemologies) and how these relate to children's learning and understanding about social and moral values * discussing the impact of teachers' beliefs on teaching practices. Evidence suggests that investment in the early years is vital for all learning, and specifically for developing an understanding of active citizenship for tolerant and cohesive societies. This book will be essential reading for the professional education of early years teachers interested in teaching for active citizenship.
