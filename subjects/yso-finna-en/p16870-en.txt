image analysis
Studies scale issues from three interrelated perspectives: land surface properties, patterns, and processes. Addresses the impact of new frontiers in Earth observation technology (high-resolution, hyperspectral, Lidar sensing, and their synergy with existing technologies) and advances in remote sensing imaging science (object-oriented image analysis and data fusion).

The purpose of this study is to explore and analyse the characteristics that make photographs attractive and appealing to young Finnish adults, and by contrast what makes photographs unattractive and even odious. The focus of the study is on photographs of Finnish nature, which show a diversity of landscapes, seasons and life forms. The author aims to obtain more a profound understanding regarding the creation of nature photographs for communication purposes. This study refines and takes further a Nuuksio Nature Centre 1 study conducted by a group of Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences students in autumn 2010.     In the theoretical section of this study concepts and theories related to the visual culture, images and visual analysis of photographs are introduced and explained. The principles of semiotics are explained and the Nuuksio Nature Centre 1-study is presented in more detail, as it is closely connected with this study and its results.     The theoretical part is followed by a methodology section, which illustrates the methods and procedures of this research. The data analysis method applied in this qualitative research is visual content analysis, combined with a concise semiotic visual analysis. In the empirical section of this thesis the research process and data analysis are presented. This section focuses on reporting a qualitative visual analysis of Finnish nature photographs conducted during spring 2011.     Results and findings of visual analysis are presented in the empirical section, which is reiterated by presenting conclusions of the research. The study illustrated that some of the common characteristics for the studied photographs were as follows: size of the frame, horizontal angle, colour harmony and natural direct lightning. The content, vertical angle and composition seemed to have the most affect the attractiveness of photographs.    This thesis is concluded with an evaluation of the entire research and by assessing the utility and outcomes of it.

The research presented in this volume is very recent, and the general approach is that of rethinking popular musicology: its purpose, its aims, and its methods. Contributors to the volume were asked to write something original and, at the same time, to provide an instructive example of a particular way of working and thinking. The essays have been written with a view to helping graduate students with research methodology and the application of relevant theoretical models. The team of contributors is an exceptionally strong one: it contains many of the pre-eminent academic figures involved in popular musicological research, and there is a spread of European, American, Asian, and Australasian scholars. The volume covers seven main themes: Film, Video and Multimedia; Technology and Studio Production; Gender and Sexuality; Identity and Ethnicity; Performance and Gesture; and, Reception and Scenes and The Music Industry and Globalization. "The Ashgate Research Companion" is designed to offer scholars and graduate students a comprehensive and authoritative state-of-the-art review of current research in a particular area. The companion's editor brings together a team of respected and experienced experts to write chapters on the key issues in their speciality, providing a comprehensive reference to the field.

How to Read Impressionist Painting' is a new, original exploration of the 19th-century movement that changed art forever, and made household names of such painters as Monet, Renoir, Degas, Seurat and Cassatt. James Rubin organizes this new look at the movement by subject matter, rather than by artist or chronologically, looking at urban views and city life, interiors and still life, family and friends, and other common themes. In discussing Impressionism in this manner, he provides readers with the tools to think critically and analytically about the movement, and offers a new understanding of the collective momentum that drove the artists to work with such originality and commitment to modern themes. Through close readings and comparisons of specific paintings, and a wealth of illustrations, Rubin establishes links between the broad visual culture of the period and the various Impressionist artists, and within the artists. own careers. The entire history of Impressionism is covered, in an entirely new way.
