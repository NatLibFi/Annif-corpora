The recent exponential rise in the number of behaviour disorders has been the focus of a wide range of commentaries, ranging from the pedagogic and the administrative, to the sociological, and even the legal. This book will be the first to apply, in a systematic and thorough manner, the ideas of the foundational discipline of philosophy. A number of philosophical tools are applied here, tools arising through the medium of the traditional philosophical debates, such as those concerning governance, truth, logic, ethics, free-will, law and language. Each forms a separate chapter, but together they constitute a comprehensive, rigorous and original insight into what is now an important set of concerns for all those interested in the governance of children. The intention is threefold: first, to demonstrate the utility, accessibility and effectiveness of philosophical ideas within this important academic area. Philosophy does not have to be regarded an arcane and esoteric discipline, with only limited contemporary application, far from it. Second, the book offers a new set of approaches and ideas for both researchers and practitioners within education, a field is in danger of continually using the same ideas, to endlessly repeat the same conclusions. Third, the book offers a viable alternative to the dominant psychological model which increasingly employs pathology as its central rationale for conduct.

Many people with dyspraxia and dyslexia also have ADHD. This fully revised edition of David Grant's thought-provoking, insightful book develops our understanding of specific learning differences and considers the further challenges presented by these overlapping conditions. New sections explore mental imagery [visualisation] and synaesthesia, enabling the reader to gain a fuller understanding of the sensory experiences and thoughts of individuals with specific learning differences. As well as providing information defining Dyslexia, Dyspraxia and ADHD, "That's the Way I Think" addresses topics including: colours and reading; becoming creative; sports, genes and evolution; and, 'invisible' girls and women. The accessible style of this book, which includes numerous anecdotes and personal insights, will immediately strike a chord with anyone who has first- or second-hand experience of these specific learning differences. Essential and enlightening reading for people with specific learning differences as well as their parents and/or partner, this book also provides an invaluable insight for teachers, teaching assistants and SENCos.

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) will soon be the most frequently diagnosed chronic condition among children, surpassing asthma. Yet research shows that ADHD can't be that prevalent. ADHD, a problem once thought to affect a small percentage of children, has exploded into one of the most misdiagnosed psychiatric conditions. Now doctors and Big Pharma are targeting children and adults worldwide to get the diagnosis and take medications that will, they say, transform their lives. In ADHD Nation, acclaimed New York Times journalist Alan Schwarz takes readers behind the scenes to tell the full story of this billion-dollar industry. There's the father of ADHD, Dr Keith Conners, who spent fifty years promoting the disorder in the US and pills like Ritalin before realising just what he had wrought; a troubled young girl and studious, teenage boy who get entangled in the ADHD machine and are prescribed medications that lead to serious problems; and the pharmaceutical industry that promoted the disorder and continues to earn billions from the rampant mishandling of ADHD. An investigation of how Big Pharma and medical professionals are complicit in the creation, maintenance and continuing expansion of the ADHD industry, this book sounds the alarm for UK readers and demands we wake up to the problem that we too could face in the future.
Asperger's syndrome : a guide to helping your child thrive at home or in school
A critical look at four high-prevalence mild disabilities as seen from several unique perspectives. Learners with Mild Disabilities focuses on four high-prevalence disorders: mild intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, emotional/behavioral disorders, and ADHD. The text also considers the Autism Spectrum Disorders, such as HFA and Asperger's Syndrome, in addition to other mild conditions such as communication disorders. This text looks first at the concept of disability from conventional categorical perspectives, and then shifts to focusing on learners from the perspective of alternative, non-categorical frameworks. It describes students with disabilities and related conditions with respect to a variety of individual strengths and needs, considering their cognitive, perceptual, language, academic learning, and social/emotional characteristics.

ADHD : living without brakes
It isn't easy to be a loving partner to someone who is routinely distracted, has trouble restraining their impulses, and finds it difficult to communicate with others. But for those who have partners living with attention deficit disorder, or ADD, these issues are everyday struggles. Often, ADD symptoms manifest in ways that are destructive to healthy relationships. In Loving Someone with Attention Deficit Disorder, marriage and family therapist Susan Tschudi (whose husband has ADD) presents practical guidance readers can use to set healthy boundaries, clarify their expectations, and ensure their partners fulfill their responsibilities. The book focuses on helping the reader meet his or her own needs in the relationship, not just on addressing the needs of their partners. It offers thorough and practical advice for moving through obstacles as a couple, accepting that ADD will always be a part of the relationship, and defusing anger and frustration that may arise.

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder : a multidisciplinary approach
Rates of diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are skyrocketing, throughout America and the rest of the world. U.S. rates of youth diagnosis have increased 40% from just a decade ago. Adults with ADHD are now the fastest-growing segment of the population receiving diagnosis and medication. The disorder is painful and sometimes disabling for individuals and tremendously costly for society; yet, widespread misinformation, skepticism, and unanswered questions have jeopardized effective diagnosis and treatment. Researched and written by Stephen Hinshaw, an international expert on ADHD, and Katherine Ellison, a Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist and author, ADHD: What Everyone Needs to Know® is the go-to book for authoritative, current, accurate, and compelling information about the global ADHD epidemic.

This concise and highly accessible book contains everything that parents and busy professionals need to know about ADHD.The author describes the spectrum of ADHD, the co-occurring symptoms, and common difficulties that parents face. The rest of the book focuses on solutions, based around four rules. Rule number one is keeping it positive: punishments can change behavior, but only positive approaches can improve attitude. Rule number two is keeping it calm: it's difficult thinking clearly enough to solve problems logically if you are feeling overwhelmed. Rule number three is keeping it organized: this rule relates particularly to the child's school life. Rule number four is to keep doing rules one to three. Finally, Dr. Kutscher discusses the role of medication for treating ADHD. The concluding chapter summarizes the information covered and can also be read as a complete, freestanding text. Useful checklists and further reading recommendations are also included.
