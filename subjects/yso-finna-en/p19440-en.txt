Summary: The defoliation process of tamaracks (Larix laricina) during an outbreak of the larch bud moth (Zeiraphera improbana) is described. The degree of defoliation correlated positively with the age, height and reproduction index of trees. The degree of defoliation did not correlate with the growth rate of tamaracks. On the basis of field observations alternative models to explain the age-specific resistance of trees to insect defoliators were developed and discussed.

"In the last decade, research on the previously dormant field of camouflage has advanced rapidly, with numerous studies challenging traditional concepts, investigating previously untested theories and incorporating a greater appreciation of the visual and cognitive systems of the observer. Using studies of both real animals and artificial systems, this book synthesises the current state of play in camouflage research and understanding. It introduces the different types of camouflage and how they work, including background matching, disruptive coloration and obliterative shading. It also demonstrates the methodologies used to study them and discusses how camouflage relates to other subjects, particularly with regard to what it can tell us about visual perception. The mixture of primary research and reviews shows students and researchers where the field currently stands and where exciting and important problems remain to be solved, illustrating how the study of camouflage is likely to progress in the future"--
