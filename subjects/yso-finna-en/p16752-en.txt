Corpus Linguistics for Translation and Contrastive Studies provides a clear and practical introduction to using corpora in these fields. Giving special attention to parallel corpora, which are collections of texts in two or more languages, and demonstrating the potential benefits for multilingual corpus linguistics research to both translators and researchers, this book: explores the different types of parallel corpora available, and shows how to use basic and advanced search procedures to analyse them; explains how to compile a parallel corpus, and discusses their uses for translation purposes and to research linguistic phenomena across languages; demonstrates the use of corpus extracts across a wide range of texts, including dictionaries, novels by authors including Jane Austen and Mikhail Bulgakov, and newspapers such as The Sunday Times; is illustrated with case studies from a range of languages including Finnish, Russian, English and French. Written by two experienced researchers and practitioners, Corpus Linguistics for Translation and Contrastive Studies is essential reading for postgraduate students and researchers working within the area of translation and contrastive studies.

The research process in education
The development and widespread use of Web surveys have resulted in an outpouring of research on their design. In this volume, Tourangeau, Conrad, and Couper provide a comprehensive summary and synthesis of the literature on this increasingly popular method of data collection. The book includes new integration of the authors' work with other important research on Web surveys, including a meta-analysis of studies that compare reports on sensitive topics in Web surveys with reports collected in other modes of data collection. Adopting the total survey error framework, the book examines sampling and coverage issues, nonresponse, measurement, and the issues involved in combining modes. In addition, the conclusion provides a model for understanding the errors in estimates that combine data collected in more than one mode. Web surveys have several important characteristics that affect their ability to collect accurate survey data. Discussing these in detail, the authors address basic design decisions from input widgets to background colors. They additionally focus on the visual character of Web surveys, on their ability to automatically interact with respondents, and on the Web as a method of self-administration. The Science of Web Surveys is relevant for those with the practical goal of improving their own surveys and those with an interest in understanding an increasingly important method of data collection.

The construction of Anglo-Saxon legendary history
"A classic in its own right, this book continues to provide an introduction to modern generalized linear models for categorical variables. The text emphasizes methods that are most commonly used in practical application, such as classical inferences for two- and three-way contingency tables, logistic regression, loglinear models, models for multinomial (nominal and ordinal) responses, and methods for repeated measurement and other forms of clustered, correlated response data. Chapter headings remain essentially with the exception of a new one on Bayesian inference for parametric models. Other major changes include an expansion of clustered data, new research on analysis of data sets with robust variables, extensive discussions of ordinal data, more on interpretation, and additional exercises throughout the book. R and SAS are now showcased as the software of choice. An author web site with solutions, commentaries, software programs, and data sets is available"--

A basic Finnish climate data set 1961-2000 - description and illustrations
This study analyzes how the socioeconomic positions of cohabiting partners affect the transition to marriage by using information on both partners characteristics. The study uses a register-based data set compiled at Statistics Finland. The study population consists of 3,648 women born in 1966-1971 who were in a cohabiting union in January 1996, and who continued to cohabit or married their cohabiting partner during the period 1996-2003. Transition to marriage was analyzed with Cox regression model. Several control variables were included. As in previous studies, a favourable socioeconomic position encouraged marriage, as marriage rate increased with higher levels of education and income. Partners relative positions also had importance, since marriage rate was low when the female partner had high and the male partner low income, and the male partners unemployment discouraged marriage especially when the female partner had no unemployment. Marriage rate was low when both partners were studying .
The coding manual for qualitative researchers
What are the most effective methods to code and analyze data for a particular study? This book reviews the selection criteria for coding and analyzing any set of data--whether qualitative, quantitative, mixed, or visual. The authors systematically explain when to use verbal, numerical, graphic, or combined codes, and when to use qualitative, quantitative, graphic, or mixed-methods modes of analysis. Chapters on each topic are organized so that researchers can read them sequentially or can easily "flip and find" answers to specific questions. Nontechnical discussions of cutting-edge approaches--illustrated with real-world examples--emphasize how to choose (rather than how to implement) the various analyses. The book shows how using the right analysis methods leads to more justifiable conclusions and more persuasive presentations of research results. Useful features for teaching or self-study: Chapter-opening preview boxes that highlight useful topics addressed. End-of-chapter summary tables recapping the 'dos and don'ts' and advantages and disadvantages of each analytic technique. Annotated suggestions for further reading and technical resources on each topic. Subject Areas/Keywords: analyses, coding, combined methods, data analysis, data collection, dissertation, graphical, interpretation, mixed methods, qualitative, quantitative, research analysis, research designs, research methods, social sciences, thesis, visual Audience: Researchers, instructors, and graduate students in a range of disciplines, including psychology, education, social work, sociology, health, and management; administrators and managers who need to make data-driven decisions.
