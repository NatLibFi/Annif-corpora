Enhancing occupational safety and health
Falling is the main cause of domestic accidents and fatal injuries to seniors at home. In this paper, we describe the design process for a new pervasive technology (CIRDO). The aim of this technology is to detect falls (via audio and video sensors) and to alert the elderly's family or caregivers. Two complementary studies were performed. Firstly, the actual risk situations of older adults were analyzed. Secondly, social acceptance was investigated for the different homecare field stakeholders. Our results highlight the tensions among social actors towards the tool and their impacts on technology acceptance by the elderly. Also, we show a significant change in the fall process due to the device. In actuality, the social functions associated with CIRDO implementation and the necessity of iterative design processes suggest that the CIRDO system should be more flexible and versatile to better fit the risk behaviors of seniors that evolve using this device..

"In recent years, building a corporate online presence has become nonnegotiable for businesses, as consumers expect to connect with them in as many ways as possible. There are benefits to companies that use online technology, but there are risks as well. Managing Online Risk presents the tools and resources needed to better understand the security and reputational risks of online and digital activity, and how to mitigate those risks to minimize potential losses. Managing Online Risk highlights security and risk management best practices that address concerns such as data collection and storage, liability, recruitment, employee communications, compliance violations, security of devices (in contexts like mobile, apps, and cloud computing), and more. Additionally, this book offers a companion website that was developed in parallel with the book and includes the latest updates and resources for topics covered in the book"--

ERM - from Risk Management to Leading the Opportunities
This purpose of this thesis was to make the reader familiar with the requirements of a disaster recovery plan. The objective was to give readers a basic knowledge of making a disaster recovery plan for their own company or organization. The thesis describes on a general level which facts should be included in the recovery plan, how the whole recovery plan process flow in general proceeds, and how the recovery plan should be analyzed. The target group of the thesis was a validation laboratory of an electronics industry, whose point of view had to be taken into account in the requirements of the disaster recovery plan. The special features of the validation laboratory of the electronics company were also taken into account. The companies should have a valid disaster recovery plan. Especially the companies should take care of their organizations or departments that find it difficult to recovery from disasters.The validation laboratories of electronics companies are included in a high-risk group, because the laboratories use measuring equipment that requires a lot of resources to reorder new equipment, and new measuring equipment has long delivery times. It is common that the delivery times are at least six months or even longer. It is also difficult to find and rebuild new premises for a validation laboratory and it will require a lot of resources and capital from the company. In the thesis process flows for the creation of the disaster recovery plan for the validation laboratory of the electronics industry were developed The whole disaster recovery plan process, step by step, was explained using the process flows, and the special features of the validation laboratory were taken into account. In addition, tables and methods that support designing the disaster recovery plan for the validation laboratory were developed in the thesis.The descriptions of process flows can also be used when designing a disaster recovery plan for other organizations or companies. Before re-using the process flows in another organization, all special features of the plan to be taken care of should be considered. The process flows should be updated to suit to the new organization or company.

A big bang after the Orange revolution? : - a Finnish perspective on managing political risk in the Ukranian business environment
The premise of this volume is that business regulations are expected to grow in the near future as a consequence of the emergence of a (world) risk society. Risks related to terrorism, climate change, and financial crises, for example, will penetrate all conditions of life. Increasingly, the decisions and actions of some bring about risks for many in this era of globalization. Controlling these risks implies managing the world through high-quality regulation, with a particular emphasis on businesses and financial institutions. Central to this approach is the argument that a major, if not the primary, aim of regulation is to internalize externalities, or in a broader context, to repair market failure. Such repair can only be accomplished when the costs are smaller than the welfare gains. Featuring contributions from researchers and policy analysts from the fields of economics, management, law, sociology, political science, and environmental policy, this book focuses on three major topics: social risks and business regulation preconditions for better business regulation, theoretical issues related to better business regulation collectively, the authors demonstrate that the easier it is for regulated businesses to comply at the lowest costs possiblewithout jeopardizing the related public goalsthe greater the degree of compliance. When successful, the net result is a balance of individual and collective net benefits, and by further implication, sustainable business practice and economic growth.

Currency Risks and Currency Risk Management
This paper quantifies the spring wheat yield conditional on temperature- and rainfall-based weather indices in Finland. The estimating equations are standardized and simplified so that they provide information for designing tradable contracts. A simple basket of weather indices, consisting of growing degree days, night frost and rainfall measures, has the potential to hedge about 38% of the wheat grower yield risk, with the remaining 62% being left as uninsured basis risk. Our results have several important implications for the design of simple and tractable weather index-based insurance contracts. The data suggest that the marginal products of weather events have a large variation across time and they are the most significant within certain critical time periods. Therefore, the weather events triggering the indemnity payments should be bounded within certain critical time regimes over their distribution along the growing season.
