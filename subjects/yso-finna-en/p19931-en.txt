Helminth infections are common, cause considerable pathology, and alter a host's immune profile. This can have important consequences not only on the host's ability to control a helminth infection, but also on their ability to control unrelated infections. In endemic areas, understanding how helminth infection influences the outcome of common infectious diseases and changes the efficacy of childhood vaccination programs is an important public health question. This book reviews how host immunity to helminths alters our ability to respond to the major pathogens that exist in helminth endemic regions. Current understanding of how helminths alter important but relatively neglected contributors to the host's anti-helminth immune responses are addressed, namely host antibody responses and how maternal infection may alter a child's immune development. These are discussed in relation to the control of helminth infection and unrelated infections. Also covered are how helminth infections alter the host's ability to control TB, HIV and malarial infections along with neglected bacterial infections, such as cholera, and how endemic helminth infections are likely to alter our ability to respond to life-saving vaccination strategies.

"Ultrasonography of the Prenatal and Neonatal Brain is a clinical text and atlas valuable to both residents and practitioners. This comprehensive reference covers topics ranging from biometry of the fetal brain and using ultrasound and MRI to diagnose the fetal face, eye, and brain to neurobehavioral development of the fetal brain. The third edition is completely updated to reflect the tremendous advances made in resolution and three dimensional Doppler technology since the release of the last edition"--Provided by publisher.

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a pattern of anomalies in affected children due to maternal alcohol administration at vulnerable stages of fetal development. Intrauterine growth restriction and facial malformation are the presenting phenotypes of FAS.In this investigation, novel pathomechanisms of intrauterine growth restriction and facial malformation were the primary aims.We found by a FAS mouse model that AceCS1 gene expression and polyamines are the immediate targets of fetal alcohol exposure. The AceCS1 product is a precursor for lipid synthesis and protein acetylation and possibly, for polycation acetylation. We cloned the Mus musculus nuclear-cytosolic AceCS1 gene, and showed that its expression is developmentally regulated with a dynamic localization in the cytosolic and nuclear compartment. The enzyme plays an essential role in de novo synthesis of acetyl Coenzyme A.Fetal alcohol administration targets nutrient supplying networks, which are localized at critical barriers. The main findings were reduced surface of the labyrinthine zone, destruction of gap junctions in the hemotrichorial placenta, reduced syncytiotrophoblastic cell layers and loosening of interaction between cell layers and embryo endothelial cells, reduced Reichert's membrane thickness with discontinued Reichert's trophoblast and loss of interaction by Reichert's-parietal cells, reduction of capillary network and reduced vascularization in the brain area, and perturbed neural crest migration and formation of neural tube defect. Alteration of angiogenesis -regulating proteins such as VEGF, PlGF, PECAM was detected in FAS, with no significant changes in placental angiogenesis of the labyrinthine zone, but up-regulation of VEGF/PlGF caused permeability changes in the placenta and yolk sac. On the other hand, the PECAM pool in embryos' brain was reduced, which in turn led to decreased angiogenesisand vascularization.

This proceedings volume will contain chapters based upon the presentation of the 2nd International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer in Colorado, 2013. The various topics explore the affects of alcohol on: liver and breast cancer, cell signaling and cancer, stem cells, biomarkers and metabolomics, aerodigestive cancers, cancer and the immune system, and more. In the recent years, a significant amount of research has emerged connecting the link between alcohol and cancer. The field has rapidly advanced, especially since the complex connection between alcohol and cancer has several unique sub areas that are being investigated and this volume gives a comprehensive overview of these advancements.

This book documents the consequences of the exposure of infants to the influence of intrauterine chemicals.... The international team of contributors sets out to inform the reader of the potential risks to infants exposed to a range of intrauterine chemicals that are potentially neuroactive, including medicinal drugs such as antiepileptics, antidepressants and antipsychotics, as well as drugs of abuse, including alcohol, opiates, and recreational drugs such as cannabis and tobacco. They review the teratogenic action of some of the chemical processes and the relationship of exposure to the stage of pregnancy. Some agents alter anatomic structure; others alter the chemical balance of neurotransmitters and may thus alter the regulation of brain function, with profound effects on the child's behaviour and propensity to behavioural disturbances. The book explores strategies to support these children and those who care for them, including statutory agencies.--From publisher description.

"To celebrate the Center for Perinatal Biology's 40th Anniversary, an illustrious group gathered at Loma Linda University in February 2013. That gathering of experts and this volume of the proceedings are a tribute to the founder of the Center, Lawrence D. Longo, M.D. These chapters present contributions from individuals who in some way or another were influenced by Dr. Longo. Covering a wide range of topics, and illustrating the diversity of thinking and scientific interests, these proceedings address basic science through to clinical problems in the developmental programming of health and disease." -- (Springer)
