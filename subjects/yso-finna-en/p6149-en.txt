Countercyclical macroprudential policy is to be strengthened in the euro area. The European Central Bank will be assuming new macroprudential powers, as single banking supervision commences in autumn 2014 and the countercyclical buffer requirement is due to be introduced in all euro area countries no later than the beginning of 2016. Even so, a significant part of euro area macroprudential policy will continue in the future to be the responsibility of national authorities. In the operating environment of the single monetary policy, euro area Member States will be able to support their own and the area's economic stability and to improve the financial system's resilience to crises through pursuing robust national macroprudential policies..
The countercyclical capital buffer requirement is one of the new macroprudential instruments that will come into use in Finland. It enables the strengthening of the banking sector's resilience to systemic risks resulting from excessive credit growth. In setting the requirement, strong emphasis should be placed on a small range of indicators to be selected, defined and published in advance. In contrast, reducing or releasing the buffer should primarily be based on judgment by the relevant authorities..

Abstract: World Factory in Crisis : Global Economy Downturn as a Speedbump on the Path of Development in China's Pearl River Delta, and the Twisty Road for Recovery. As one of the world's largest and most dynamic economies, as well as an important member of international matters, China attracts enormous attention and the focus is on the opportunities and challenges associated with China's emergence. The Pearl River Delta Special Economic Zone of Guangdong province in the southeast China, is the pioneer of the Chinese Economic Reform initiated by Deng Xiaoping in 1978, and has been the most dynamic economic region since then. During the ongoing reform process, this region has become a manufacturing center of global importance, the province with the highest GDP, and one of the fastest growing economic regions in the world. Being the leader of China's economic reform and global manufacturing centre, the region is suffering from a sharp decline in export demand, large-scale of small and medium companies shutting-down and lay-offs of migrant workers. The traditional industry mode based on cheap labour and low value-added manufacturing is facing much limitation due to rising cost of land and labour. An industrial upgrading and restructuring is the solution. To cope with the problems caused by the crisis and to transform traditional industries into high value-added and high-tech industries, local governments have implemented a series of policies to support the region's industrial upgrading. Some relevant and valuable lessons can be learnt from Taiwan's industrial upgrading. With the once-in-a-decade political change in China in November 2012, how will the new national political body affect the Pearl River Delta's revolutionary road?
