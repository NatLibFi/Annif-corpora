The No Outsiders team, a collaboration of primary education practitioners and university researchers, has taken groundbreaking steps in addressing lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality in primary schools. This book continues Trentham's commitment to challenging homophobia and heterosexism in and through education and follows Atkinson and DePalma's account of sexualities equality in children's worlds in school and beyond: Invisible Boundaries - addressing sexualities equality in children's world. In "Interrogating Normativity" they and their colleagues from the ESRC-funded No Outsiders research team explore and analyse central issues which permeate the team's challenge to gender conformity through primary education. The need for primary teachers and other professionals working with children to address equality in relation to sexual orientation and gender expression is becoming increasingly urgent in the light of recent changes in UK legislation.The Civil Partnership Act (2006), the Equality Act (2007) and new legislative requirements for ensuring the active promotion of child wellbeing, gender equality and community cohesion all place demands on schools and support services which they are ill-equipped to meet. This book fills a gap by examining how we might go about addressing these demands. "Interrogating Heteronormativity in Primary Schools" brings together the wide-ranging expertise of the project's large research team, plus a chapter by Susan Talburt. It explores key themes related to the project's work: silence and speaking out; faith and culture; leadership and role-modelling; personal and emotional investment; gay rights/liberal humanist and queer perspectives; safety and risk-taking; the possibility of a queer pedagogy; and intersections between queer theory and practice.^

Tourism is the back bone of Nepalese economy. Nepal is naturally blessed country with lots of prospects and potentialities in the field of tourism. Despite of having plenty of scarce natural resources, Nepal is not able to make any revolutionary progress in tourism industry due to various reasons. Being largest industry of the nation, tourism plays pivotal and significant role in overall economic development of Nepal.     The objective of this research is to study the prospects and also to identify the problems that have been hindering the development of tourism in Nepal. Besides, there is a thorough evaluation and analysis of current tourism marketing strategy in order to fulfill the demand for sustainable tourism products in international markets. This research is concluded with viable recommendations in order to improve tourism marketing strategy.      The data needed for this research were gathered from various literature reviews, surveys, books and journals. In order to implement empirical part of this research, quantitative questionnaires were prepared for tourists, tour operators and other governing bodies of Nepal.    Political instability, decade long Maoist insurgency, lack of fund, improper management, and lack of promotional marketing strategy were the key issues to make detrimental impacts in tourism industry of Nepal. In order to improve Nepalese tourism marketing strategy, focus on price, product, people, place and destination promotion is recommended.

Wellness and taking care of ones own health has become trendy and public forces are trying to find out ways to get people more interested of their own health and well being. Also corporations launch wellness and workplace health promotion programs more commonly to reduce employee turnover and to increase company profits. In the future there will be increase in the amount of elderly people in Finland and this emphasizes the need for work related health services and preventive health behaviour. In work environments more focus needs to be laid on motivation and work well being. This creates a demand for wellness event for corporate groups aiming to motivate employees and to stimulate them to exercise to improve their health. The aim of this thesis is to point out factors that are essential when developing a wellness event concept and based on those make a proposal of potential concept for an event and programme organiser. The thesis has two parts: the theoretical frame of reference and a plan of a wellness event concept. The framework is created based on the literature of wellness, workplace health promotion, event marketing, event as a product and event product development. Also the process of wellness event development is descriped based on the descriptions of workplace health promotion, event marketing and event product development. When planning a wellness event for a corporate group the customer needs, expectations, resources and participation level needs to be found out before decisions about the content of the event can be made. Since event as a product is immaterial and it is produced and consumed simultaneously, also the people providing the event are a part of the product and affect the experience of a customer.     In the project part of the thesis a wellness event concept is created. The idea of wellness event  bases on co-operation between an event and programme organiser and a fitness chain. The event is targeted to all companies wanting to motivate the employees to improve their health by exercise. A potential product called Wellness Week is created to give a better picture of the potential event.

The main aim of this thesis has been to give the reader fisrt of all a general knowledge of the main concepts that are contained within it, such as internationalization, exporting and the Spanish market. This is an objective decided together with the commissioner InnoConnections with the aim of being able to find export organizations based in Madrid and that are interested in working in the Nordic / Finnish market. The process of researching has not been simple, and also it has not lead to the expected results, which were to be able to contact with at least a few organizations and obtain some feedback from them. Most intents of making contact with the given organizations have received no feedback, leading to a series of conclusions that point to the fact that this particular period in time may not be the best to approach the Spanish market, as it is affected by a strong economic crisis which makes all businesses fearful of putting at risk any of their assets. However, these findings may still be useful to the commissioner as well as other businesses planning to approach such market, as they give an insight to how Spanish companies are actually reacting to this difficult situation and therefore gives the opportunity to businesses to possibly look for other options when trying to internationalize or look for Spanish customers, as at this point in time they are companies that are being very cautious and that may not be willing to extend to other countries as this is often considered risky.
