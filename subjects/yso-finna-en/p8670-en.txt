The son
The tension among the survivors of the bus accident reaches its threshold as the one-week deadline finally arrives. The three killers may have confessed, but does this mean that all their sins are accounted for? What truly constitutes a crime? Or to what extent is an action criminal? And when the gavel falls on their sentences, perhaps all might not be as it seems.
Creeds & confessions of faith in the Christian tradition. Vol. 3, Statements of faith in modern Christianity
"In liberal, democratic and capitalist societies today, we are increasingly invited to disclose our innermost thoughts to others. We are asked to turn our gaze inwards, scrutinizing ourselves, our behaviours and beliefs, while talking and writing about ourselves in these terms. This form of disclosure of the self resonates with older forms of church confession, and is now widely seen in practices of education in new ways in nurseries, schools, colleges, universities, workplaces and the wider policy arena. This book brings together international scholars and researchers inspired by the work of Michel Foucault, to explore in detail what happens when these practices of confession become part of our lives and ways of being in education. The authors argue that they are not neutral, but political and powerful in their effects in shaping and governing people; they examine confession as discursive and contemporary practice so as to provoke critical thought.International in scope and pioneering in the detail of its scrutiny of such practices, this book extends contemporary understanding of the exercise of power and politics of confessional practices in education and learning, and offers an alternative way of thinking of them. The book will be of value to educational practitioners, scholars, researchers and students, interested in the politics of their own practices"-- "In liberal, democratic and capitalist societies today, we are increasingly invited to disclose our innermost thoughts to others.

During the last twenty years, the theory of recognition has become an established field of philosophy and social studies. Variants of this theory often promise applications to the burning political issues of current society, such as the challenges of multiculturalism, group identity, and conflicts between ideologies and religions. The seminal works of this trend employ Hegelian ideas to tackle the problem of modernity. Although some recent studies also investigate the pre-Hegelian roots of recognition, this concept is normally considered to be a product of the secular modernity of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Recognition and Religion: A Historical and Systematic Study challenges this assumption and claims that important intellectual roots of the concept and conceptions of recognition are found in much earlier religious sources. Risto Saarinen outlines the first intellectual history of religious recognition, stretching from the New Testament to present day. He connects the history of religion with philosophical approaches, arguing that philosophers owe a considerable historical and conceptual debt to the religious processes of recognition. At the same time, religious recognition has a distinctive profile that differs from philosophy in some important respects. Saarinen undertakes a systematic elaboration of the insights provided by the tradition of religious recognition. He proposes that theology and philosophy can make creative use of the long history of religious recognition.

The Good of Recognition analyses the polysemy of recognition operative in the thought of two contemporary French thinkers, Emmanuel Levinas (1906-1995) and Paul Ricoeur (1913-2005). Author Michael Sohn shows that recognition -- a concept most often associated with Hegel's works -- appears prominently throughout the works of Levinas and Ricoeur, which exist at the intersection of phenomenology, ethics, politics, and religion. Sohn situates recognition in the sociopolitical context of Levinas and Ricoeur and excavates the philosophical and religious sources that undergird the two thinkers' use of recognition before contextualizing recognition within the broader themes of their thought. By reflecting on phenomenology, ethics, and religion in "The Good of Recognition", Sohn not only shows how Levinas and Ricoeur articulated a response to the pervasive problems of nonrecognition and misrecognition in their day but also suggests how their thought can contribute to a better understanding of our contemporary social and political landscape. -- Review: "In this new and exciting book, Michael Sohn offers a fresh perspective on the concept of recognition by interfacing the ethical project of Emmanuel Levinas with the work of Paul Ricoeur. By interfacing these two figures in particular, Sohn also helps us see the similarities and differences in thinking through Christian and Jewish ethics, an important relation for both thinkers but certainly for readers of Emmanuel Levinas. His book is a significant contribution to the secondary literature not only on Levinas and Ricoeur, but also to those working thematically on recognition--including Hegel scholars, scholars working on psychoanalysis, and feminist theorist." -- Claire Katz, Professor of Philosophy & Women's & Gender Studies, Texas A&M University "Michael Sohn makes a significant contribution to the contemporary debates in philosophy of religion and political philosophy while pushing them in important new directions, impressively offering an account of recognition that is both theologically sophisticated and also historically aware. This book demonstrates that sophisticated work in continental philosophy can still be clear, lucid, and convincing." -- J Aaron Simmons, Assistant Professor of Philosphy, Furman University

"Lifelong learning has become an increasingly important theme in contemporary society through which each citizen is encouraged to become a constant learner. Such narratives are often seen as positive and all-inclusive. In this book, practices of lifelong learning will be considered as practices of confession. Today, people are constantly encouraged to verbalize themselves to others, whether on TV shows, in newspapers, in family life or together with friends. In The Confessing Society, the authors argue that society has become a confessing society by illustrating how confession operates in the practices of family involvement in school, in-service training, educational guidance, through coaching in the media, etc. Together, such practices shape and govern an active and responsible citizen. The authors, drawing on Foucault's later work on confession and governmentality, carefully analyse how confession operates within practices of lifelong learning as a way to shape activated and responsible citizens. Chapters include: - Reflection and Reflective Practices - Deliberation and Therapeutic Intervention - Lifelong Guidance - Medialised Parenting. This book is international in its scope and the argument pursued is related to current debates regarding trans-national policy and to research discussions on education, lifelong learning and governance, and it will provoke lively debate amongst educational practitioners, academics, postgraduate and research students in education and lifelong learning in Europe, North America and Australasia"--Provided by publisher.
"Getting someone to tell the truth is an essential skill that very few people possess. In the boardroom, classroom, or our own homes, every day we interact with others and try to get the truth from them. People are often untruthful out of fear of negative consequences associated with divulging information. But if a person is made to forget the long-term outcomes, he or she can be influenced to disclose sensitive information that's being withheld. The aim is to encourage the person to remain in short-term thinking mode, shifting focus away from the long-term ramifications of telling the truth. As former CIA agents and bestselling authors of Spy the Lie, Philip Houston, Mike Floyd, and Susan Carnicero are among the world's best at recognizing deceptive behavior and eliciting the truth from even the most accomplished liars. Get the Truth is a step-by-step guide that empowers readers to elicit the truth from others. It also chronicles the fascinating story of how the authors used a methodology Houston developed to elicit the truth in the counterterrorism and criminal investigation realms, and how these techniques can be applied to our daily lives. Using thrilling anecdotes from their careers in counterintelligence, and with easy-to-follow instructions, the authors provide a foolproof means of getting absolutely anybody to give an honest answer. Get the Truth is the easy and effective way to learn how to get the truth every time"--
The catalogue identifies works used to explain the creed in Carolingian collection volumes compiled for the instruction of the clergy. It includes both edited and unedited works and some recently edited in a companion volume to this one, 'Symbola, expositiones et explanationes fidei aeui Carolini' (CC CM, 254). The catalogue shows that the teaching of the creedal faith was assembled from snippets of, or whole, patristic works, homilies, personal professions of faith, and works of many other genres. In the past, we have had little concept of the range of works known to those responsible for teaching the faith at the parish and missionary level of the Carolingian world. In this catalogue crucial attention is paid to the contents of the manuscripts as a whole in which the creed explanation is found and how these collection volumes may have functioned. It is hoped that the manuscript descriptions will be of benefit to students and specialists working on other kinds of texts for the education of the clergy.
