"Only two can keep a secret if one of them is dead. David and Adele seem like the ideal pair. He's a successful psychiatrist, she is his picture-perfect wife who adores him. But why is he so controlling? And why is she keeping things hidden? As Louise, David's new secretary, is drawn into their orbit, she uncovers more puzzling questions than answers. The only thing that is crystal clear is that something in this marriage is very, very wrong. But Louise can't guess how wrong - and how far a person might go to protect their marriage's secrets. "--

"Insurance today is a global economic colossus and a fixture in the developed countries of the world. Dependant upon a considerable dose of moral exhortation and enlightened appeal, the insurance industry has become a pervasive agent of social and economic control through its delineation of acceptable (compensated) and unacceptable (uncompensated) risk.

Abstract: A case study :  an analysis of a Finnish construction site meeting through the lens of chaos and control theories. The purpose of the dissertation is to examine and analyse a Finnish construction site meeting through the lens of chaos and control theories and to determine why the construction site meeting did not work out well and how to solve the issues aroused in the meeting. As construction site meetings play a key role in the communication and integration between all crucial participants of construction site meetings, this study will contribute in understanding the meetings better and the nature of chaos and control in construction site meetings and how to make the construction site meetings more efficient. A qualitative analysis of a confidential Finnish construction site meeting was conducted and a critical review of chaos and control theories was carried out. Some chaotic aspects can be seen in the case study as the degree of control is fairly low making the meeting inefficient and long lacking of direction. In this case there is a need for control in construction site meetings because a higher degree of control instead of chaos in this construction site meeting will make the meetings more efficient whereas low level of control only lead to long discussions instead of innovation and creativity. However, as chaos and control theories have been applied only to this one particular case study the findings cannot be generalized into meetings. The end result of construction site meetings might also be dependent of the group dynamics, culture and background of the participants and therefore they need to be examined more.

"Controversies over issues such as genetically engineered food, foot-and-mouth disease and the failure of risk models in the global financial crisis have raised concerns about the quality of expert scientific advice. The legitimacy of experts, and of the political decision-makers and policy-makers whom they advise, essentially depends on the quality of the advice. But what does quality mean in this context, and how can it be achieved? This volume argues that the quality of scientific advice can be ensured by an appropriate institutional design of advisory organisations. Using examples from a wide range of international case studies, including think tanks, governmental research institutes, agencies and academies, the authors provide a systematic guide to the major problems and pitfalls encountered in scientific advice and the means by which organisations around the world have solved these problems"--

With regard to urban footpaths, there are two actors with different interests, the municipal authorities who, in theory, pursue town planning and maintain footpaths for the convenience of pedestrians, and the poor homeless living illegally on footpaths with the constant fear of being forced to leave. There exists a clear difference in stand-point between authorities and pavement dwellers on the use of footpaths: the former has a power to keep the public space free from encroachment but the latter finds the footpaths a space advantageous for living. The discussion focuses on pavement shrines that have become more ubiquitous in Chennai city, South India, since the 1990s and are mostly huilt and maintained by the socially and economically weaker sections of the city population. Footpath shrines may have and represent a power of resistance against authorities in the name of the sacred places they have been erected on, and are thus a weapon of the weak in their tactics for survival in the city. This ethnigraphic example holds an important theoretical connotation in terms of the emergence of a dynamic concept of sacred by suggesting that the edge or boudary of the dominant ideological social space or the boudary between the legal and the illegal in its context embraces a potentiality of producing sacrality, as is suggested by Veikko Anttonen's rethinking of the notion of sacred from the viewpoint of cognitive categorization.

"The control of multinational corporations is an area of law that has attracted immense attention both at national and international level. In recognition of the importance of the subject matter, the United Nations secretary general has appointed a special representative to work in this area. The book discusses the current trend by MNCs to self regulate by employing voluntary corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy. Olufemi Amao argues that the CSR concept is insufficient to deal with externalities emanating from MNCs' operations, including human rights violations. Amao maintains that for CSR to be effective, the law must engage with the concept. In particular, he examines how the law can be employed to achieve this goal. While noting that the control of MNCs involves regulation at the international level, it is argued that more emphasis needs to be placed on possibilities at home, in States and host States where there are stronger bases for the control of corporations. This book will be useful to academic scholars, students, policy makers in developing countries, UN, UN Agencies, the African Union and its agencies, the European Union and its agencies and other international policy makers"--

The Appeal of Insurance traces the ways in which insurance, over the past three centuries, has grown in concert with a clientele largely of its own making. Drawing on the fields of history, sociology, criminology and economics, these essays break new ground in insurance studies by illuminating the dialectical relationship between the expansion of the insurance business and the public demand for economic and social security."--pub. desc.

"Communities are intertwined with social control, and sometimes with religion and apparently there is no permanent human group in which we could't find the functioning of social control. Social control, as to make a generalization, is oriented to realizing the possibility of coexistence of people, in other words - to prevent a war of all against all. From the thesis, drawn according by interdisciplinary research principles, follow that religion and social control theory used by criminology has at least one interface, it is deviance identification and prevention. The thesis pays much attention on establishing the fact whether religion has an unlawful behavior inhibiting ability or not. Materials examined in this dissertation give the base to state that religion can act as a barrier to unlawful conduct. But why it has such an influence, and by what routes does it influence, it is not possible to say using contemporary knowledge. In the thesis a number of opportunities are noticed and it isn't ruled out that religion has a complex influence principle or concurrence that influences every person in different ways. However, I accept that despite all ways by what religion can affect individual behavior, the most universal way is the existence of a moral community, which can affect even those individuals who have identified themselves as non-religious. The role of religion and its effectiveness in social control sphere in the near future can not be precisely predicted, but according to the prevailing approach to religion in different societies it can be expected, that at least based on the historical tradition the influence of religion will last in the process of social control. In secular countries such as Estonia, there is probably no reason to hope that religion and religiosity would be a significant aid to fight against crime or deviance in general. For that effect religion in secular states has too little influence and constituency."
