Male victims of elder abuse : their experiences and needs
"In this cutting edge collection authors examine risk thinking in a range of policy and practice contexts, including special needs education, digital exclusion, domestic violence and abuse, child protection and youth work. Four key interlinking themes emerge from the chapters. The first is how, within a neoliberal context, risk agendas can be used to justify and normalise the rationing and targeting of services. The second theme shows how the use of such agendas can in themselves redefine what is constituted as social problems, and how they are understood and responded to. Thirdly, welfare practice itself is being re-structured and re-theorised to adapt and conform to the new definitions and understandings that risk thinking has brought about. Finally, the fourth theme is how the use of risk as a negative organising discourse is not inevitable but, in different contexts, can create positive outcomes for service users, practitioners and society"--

Confronting child abuse
Between 100,000 and 200,000 women were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military between the early 1930s and 1945. Yet successive post-war Japanese governments have refused to acknowledge what took place and no reparations have been made to the mainly Korean victims. Recent developments in human rights and women's rights in Korea have led to the surviving Comfort Women to overcome traditional taboos of chastity, defilement and shame to speak out for the first time. This book contains 19 exclusive first-hand testimonies from surviving Comfort Women, which portray the coercion, violence, abduction, rape and false imprisonment they suffered at the hands of the Japanese military. The Comfort Women's stories were originally published in Korean by the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan (formed in 1990 to campaign for recognition and reparation for the surviving Comfort Women).

But when Iris sets two of the young goats free to save them from slaughter, the tensions between her and Aunt Sue come to a frightening and violent head. Can Iris recover from tragedy for a second time and find a way to save not only her beloved goats but also herself? Powerful and deeply moving, "What Comes After" is at its heart an affirmation of the redemptive power of animals and the resilience of the human spirit / WorldCat.

Kindesmiβhandlung in Europe = Child abuse in Europe = La maltraitance děnfants en Europe. 1
A number of cases of serious child abuse have resulted from beliefs that children may be possessed by evil spirits and may then be given the power to bewitch others. Misfortune, failure, illness and even death may be blamed on them. The 'cure', nowadays called deliverance rather than exorcism, is to expel the spirits, sometimes by violent means. This book draws together contributions on aspects of possession and witchcraft from leading academics and expert practitioners in the field. It has been put together following conferences held by Inform, a charity that provides accurate information on new religions as a public service. There is no comparable information publicly available; this book is the first of its kind. Eileen Barker, founder of 'Inform', introduces the subject and Inform's deputy director goes on to detail the requests Inform has answered in recent years on the subject of children, possession and witchcraft. This book offers an invaluable resource for readers, whether academic or practitioner - particularly those in the fields of the safeguarding of children, and their education, health and general welfare.
