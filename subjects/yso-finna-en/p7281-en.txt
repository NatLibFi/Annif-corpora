"A revised and updated edition of the classic handbook for women seeking a safe, organic, eco-friendly, and natural pregnancy, featuring an integrative-based approach with new medical, herbal, and nutritional information. Over the last two decades, The Natural Pregnancy Book has ushered thousands of women through happy and healthy pregnancies. Addressing women's health from conception to birth, Dr. Romm describes herbs that can promote and maintain a healthy pregnancy, and allays such familiar concerns as anxiety, fatigue, morning sickness, and stretch marks. She also discusses the components of a healthy diet, with an emphasis on natural foods. New to this edition is integrative health advice based on Dr. Romm's new credentials as a Yale-trained physician, combined with her twenty years of experience as a midwife and herbalist"--

What to expect when you're expecting
Fed up of advice that did not take into account a less than perfect pregnancy, Dr Chiara Hunt and Marina Fogle set up their pregnancy course, The Bump Class, in London in 2013. They wanted to help prepare new mothers thoroughly for the birth of their babies and instil in them the joy and happiness of birth, no matter what the method, time or setting of the labour. This book is a pragmatic and honest look at pregnancy, giving pregnant women and new mothers sensible and practical advice on what is to be expected (as well as the often unexpected!) in a friendly and open manner.

The day-by-day pregnancy book : comprehensive advice from a team of experts and stunning images for every single day
Heat shock factors have been found to regulate heat shock protein expression. Heat shock factor 2 has been found to be expressed in differentiation and developmental processes. The specific microRNA miR-18 has been reported to downregulate glucocorticoid receptor in the brain. miR-18 has been shown to negatively regulate HSF2 expression during mouse spermatogenesis. Object of this thesis was to study the expression of miR-18 and HSF2 during mouse embryogenesis. The importance was to find out when and where miR-18 and HSF2 are expressed in mouse embryo and whether miR-18 and HSF2 expression correlate during mouse embryogenesis.  The aim was to find out if the same correlation between miR-18 and HSF2 that has been found during mouse spermatogenesis also exists during mouse embryogenesis. The expression of miR-18 and HSF2 was studied in three male mouse embryos at six different time points. Used methods were PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The results show miR-18 expression in the brain, other neuronal regions and limbs. Strongest miR-18 expression was detected at time points E10.5 and E11.5. HSF2 expression was detected in the whole embryo but the strongest expression was detected in the brain, other neuronal regions and limbs. HSF2 expression was detected at every studied time point, but the strongest expression was detected at time point E11.5. miR-18 and HSF2 were found to be expressed in the same areas in mouse embryo which indicates of correlation between miR-18 and HSF2 expression.
