Production system engineering
This book is aimed at engineers and technicians who need to have a clear, practical understanding of the essentials of process control, loop tuning and how to optimize the operation of their particular plant or process. The reader would typically be involved in the design, implementation and upgrading of industrial control systems. Mathematical theory has been kept to a minimum with the emphasis throughout on practical applications and useful information. This book will enable the reader to: Specify and design the loop requirements for a plant using PID control, Identify and apply the essent.

Manufacturing Process Selection Handbook provides engineers and designers with process knowledge and the essential technological and cost data to guide the selection of manufacturing processes early in the product development cycle. Building on content from the authors' earlier introductory Process Selection guide, this expanded handbook begins with the challenges and benefits of identifying manufacturing processes in the design phase and appropriate strategies for process selection. The bulk of the book is then dedicated to concise coverage of different manufacturing.

The Television Handbook is a critical introduction to the practice and theory of television. The book examines the state of television today, explains how television is made and how production is organised, and discusses how critical thinking about programmes and genres can illuminate their meanings. This book also explores how developments in technology and the changing structure of the television industry will lead the medium in new directions. The Television Handbook gives practical advice on many aspects of programme making, from an initial programme idea through to shooting and the post-p.

The project work for this thesis was commissioned by the Havi candle factory,  Riihimäki, and it is intended for testing a transportation technique for  the conveying of wick sustainers or wick tabs from a storage tank to the  production line of the tea light candle in the factory. The aim of the project work was to perform various tests on different  techniques or systems for the transportation of wick sustainers from a  storage unit or tank at the base of the work floor to the tea light candle  production line. The objective of this thesis was to present a layout structure  of the most efficient and economical method of transporting the wick  sustainers from the list of tested methods.  In this thesis, the Havi candle factory was introduced with emphasis on the  tea light candle production line. More insight was also paid to the needs  for a transport mechanism for the wick tabs to the production line of the  tea light candle. This was followed by a theoretical view of pressurized  gas systems. Furthermore, the various ideas for transporting the wick tabs  were tested and the most efficient method which was the use of pressurized  gas systems was further developed. The result obtained after various testing was performed shows that the direct  and overhead tank methods of transporting of the wick sustainers using  pneumatic technology (pressurized gas system) as the primary transportation  medium is a more efficient and economical way of transporting  the wick sustainers to the tea light candle production line.

Dance Production: Design and Technology introduces you to the skills you need to plan, design, and execute the technical aspects of a dance production. While it may not seem that staging a dance production is that different from a play or musical, in reality a dance performance offers up unique intricacies and challenges all its own, from scenery that accommodates choreography, to lighting design that sculpts the body, and costumes that complement movement. This unique book approaches the process of staging a dance production from a balanced perspective, making it an essential resource for dancers and designers alike. Covering a broad range of topics, author Jeromy Hopgood takes the reader through the process of producing dance from start to finish - including pre-production planning (collaboration, production process, personnel, performance spaces), design disciplines (lighting, sound, scenery, costumes, projections), stage management, and more. Bridging the gap between theatrical and dance design, the book includes a quick reference guide for theatrical and dance terminology, useful in giving dancers and designers a common working vocabulary that will ensure productive communication across the different fields.
