The pharmaceutical industry has faced many significant challenges since the early 1990s. The fundamental issue that needs to be addressed is how to improve the efficiency of drug discovery and development. The current research and development (R&D) cost for developing a new therapeutic drug is greater than $800 million. Additionally, it takes an average of 12 years to get a new drug to market with an attrition rate greater than 90%. Reviewing the overall pharmaceutical R&D process, it has become clear that many of the drug failures are due to our lack of knowledge in population diversity, which is responsible for differences in drug efficacy and toxicity. In fact, not a single approved drug is 100% safe and efficacious for all patients. For researchers, the key question is: How can we discover biomarkers that can be used to distinguish patients who will respond to the drug without adverse effects from those who will not respond and/or will have adverse effects? There is tremendous urgency to address this question. Biomarkers also fit perfectly with the vision of personalized medicine, the new expectation of medical practice. This is why biomarker research has been a central focus in many research labs across academia, government agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry. There are many different ways to define biomarkers based on molecular properties, applications, and methods.
Of the thousands of biomarkers that are currently being discovered, relatively few are being validated for further applications, and the potential of a biomarker can be quite difficult to evaluate. To aid in this imperative research, Dr. Kewal K. Jain’s Handbook of Biomarkers thoroughly describes many different types of biomarkers and their discovery using various "-omics" technologies, such as proteomics and metabolomics, along with the background information needed for the evaluation of biomarkers as well as the essential procedures for their validation and use in clinical trials. With biomarkers described first according to technologies and then according to various diseases, this detailed book features the key correlations between diseases and classifications of biomarkers, which provides the reader with a guide to sort out current and future biomarkers. Comprehensive and cutting-edge, The Handbook of Biomarkers serves as a vital guide to furthering our understanding of biomarkers, which, by facilitating the combination of therapeutics with diagnostics, promise to play an important role in the development of personalized medicine, one of the most important emerging trends in healthcare today.

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and type 2 diabetes is reaching a global epidemic. Epidemiological studies have identified numerous risk factors and pharmacotherapies in relation to these cardiometabolic diseases. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of these risk factors and drug therapies generally remain incompletely understood. Elucidating the underlying molecular effects would be essential for better understanding of the disease pathogenesis and also for discovering new therapeutic targets. Quantitative serum metabolomics, which allows for simultaneous quantification of multiple circulating metabolic measures, provides a hypothesis-free approach to systematically inspect the metabolic changes in response to endogenous and exogenous stimuli. Metabolomics thus presents a valuable tool to study the detailed molecular effects of disease risk factors and drug therapies. However, current metabolomics studies are mostly conducted in small cross-sectional studies and the causal relations of the risk factors on the metabolic measures are generally unclear, providing limited public health impact. The present thesis serves as a proof-of-concept to illustrate that well-designed observational studies can be used to infer causality. With the exemplars of assessing molecular effects of two risk factors (body mass index and sex hormone-binding globulin) and two drug therapies (statins and oral contraceptives), the thesis demonstrates that an improved causal inference can be achieved in observational studies via the combination of multiple study designs, including cross-sectional, longitudinal and Mendelian randomization analysis. This robust study design approach together with metabolomics data can be also extended to study the molecular effects of other risk factors and drug therapies. With an improved molecular understanding of a wide range of risk factors and therapies, better understanding of disease pathogenesis is ensured.
