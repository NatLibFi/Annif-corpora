During the past year, there has been intense debate over the correlation between fiscal consolidation and economic growth. This article argues that the observed growth forecast errors for euro area countries in 2010-2011 were not caused by underestimated fiscal multipliers. Instead, the errors were due to a general reassessment of euro area sovereign risk, which disproportionately impacted the more vulnerable euro area countries. These countries experienced a sharp increase in their sovereign borrowing costs, a tightening of credit conditions and ultimately a sharper-than-expected contraction of domestic demand..

This book provides a clear and impartial analysis of the Eurozone crisis and what it means for the politics and economics of the Eurozone and European Union. This is the first book to provide a full and dispassionate account of the politics and economics of the Eurozone crisis, focusing on the interlinked origins and impacts of the Euro-Zone crisis and the policy responses to it. The book is distinguished from existing research by its avoidance (and rejection) of the too-often simplistic analysis that has characterized political, media and regrettably some academic coverage, and by its attempt to escape from the tyranny of day-to-day events and short-term developments. Each of the contributors identifies an important question and undertakes a careful empirical, theoretically-informed analysis that produces novel perspectives. Together they seek to balance many of the existing accounts that have rushed to sometimes unwarranted conclusions, concerning, for example, the locus of institutional power in European crisis-management; the power and centrality of particular member states, notably Germany which has been attributed with 'hegemonic' status; the supposed entrapment of EU policy makers by an 'austerity ideology'; and the deep flaws that apparently afflict the solutions to the crisis put painstakingly in place, such as Banking Union. While it will be some time before the EU can put the crisis behind it, and the dust finally settles on the revised institutional system that emerges, The Political and Economic Dynamics of the Eurozone Crisis marks an important step towards a considered, reflective analysis of the tumultuous events and developments of the crisis period.

The effects of the Eurosystem's expanded asset purchase programme (EAPP) are already visible on the financial markets. The achievements of the programme are, however, only intermediate goals from a central bank perspective, through which the effects of the programme can work through to the real economy and prices. To a small open economy such as Finland, the effects of the programme are transmitted particularly via lower market interest rates and a weaker exchange rate. According to calculations conducted at the Bank of Finland, the EAPP will stimulate Finland's GDP growth by 0.2 of a percentage point and inflation by 0.3 of a percentage point in 2015..

Monetary policy in the euro area has been highly accommodative in recent years. The accommodative stance has also been reflected in banks' lending rates. The transmission of monetary policy has become more effective, following the strengthening of the euro area banking system and the improvement in banks' capital adequacy from previous years.
Central banks have acted forcefully to provide monetary accommodation. With little room for manoeuvre for standard interest rate policy, unconventional measures have been adopted. Committing to monetary accommodation gains importance as interest rates go down and inflation expectations increasingly deviate from the target; the expectations channel of monetary policy transmission becomes key when the aim is to raise inflation expectations and improve confidence. One example of the new monetary policy instruments is the Eurosystem's expanded asset purchase programme, which demonstrates the determination of the Governing Council to return price developments to a path in line with its price stability objective..

Eurozone Dystopia traces the origin of the Eurozone and shows how the historical Franco-German rivalry combined with the growing dominance of neo-liberal economic thinking to create a monetary system that was deeply flawed and destined to fail. William Mitchell argues that the political class in Europe is trapped in a destructive groupthink. Based on a flawed understanding of macroeconomic fundamentals, groupthink extols the virtues of the erroneous concept of the self-regulating free market and prevents Europe from seeing its own policy failures. As a result millions are unemployed, with imperiled member states caught in a cycle of persistent stagnation and rising social instability. Providing a detailed historical analysis of the evolution of the Eurozone and its failings from the 1940s to the present day, the book argues that the Eurozone lacks the necessary monetary architecture, particularly the existence of a federal fiscal function which could have resolved the economic crisis quickly. The author examines the options available to Europe and concludes that an orderly abandonment of the euro and a return to national currencies is the superior option available. The justification for this conclusion is exhaustively argued within a Modern Monetary Theory framework.

"In the EU experience, the very concept of union was formally used for the first time in the preamble of the 1957 Rome Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (EEC), when the signatory states expressed their determination "to lay the foundations of an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe". This concept was then strengthened in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty or Treaty establishing the European Union (TEU), when the signatory states reaffirmed in the Treaty's preamble their resolution "to continue the process of creating an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe""--

A non-stationary perspective on the European and Swedish business cycle
Euro area inflation has long been below the European Central Bank's objective for price stability and has continued to slow in recent months. This has given rise to heightened concerns that the euro area could soon be facing a prolonged period of deflation, as recently in Japan. The case of the United States shows, however, that the Japanese experience can be avoided. The key would seem to be the anchoring of inflation expectations. In the euro area, new measures of monetary accommodation have contributed to reducing the risk of Japanese-style deflation.
Countercyclical macroprudential policy is to be strengthened in the euro area. The European Central Bank will be assuming new macroprudential powers, as single banking supervision commences in autumn 2014 and the countercyclical buffer requirement is due to be introduced in all euro area countries no later than the beginning of 2016. Even so, a significant part of euro area macroprudential policy will continue in the future to be the responsibility of national authorities. In the operating environment of the single monetary policy, euro area Member States will be able to support their own and the area's economic stability and to improve the financial system's resilience to crises through pursuing robust national macroprudential policies..

This paper assesses the impacts of Economic and Monetary Union and the euro on developments within the eight most advanced accession candidates in Central and Eastern Europe.The single currency completes the project for a single market in Europe, and overall, clear efficiency gains for participating countries are expected. This should spur foreign trade with e.g. the accession countries. Accession candidates may use a variety of foreign exchange rate regimes before they join the EU, but ultimately their economic policies become a matter of common interest.Pressure to peg to the euro obviously increases as membership approaches, but there is compelling evidence that countries should hold back on pegging to the euro until they have achieved sufficient convergence to attain credibility for a policy of fixed exchange rates.  Keywords: Economic and Monetary Union, Central and Eastern Europe, exchange rate policy, integration .

Assessment of the euro's implications for economic  development in the Central and Eastern Europe
The Eurosystem currently implements monetary policy in circumstances that are very different from those of the early years of the financial and debt crisis. The Governing Council of the ECB has pursued an accommodative monetary policy and lowered the central bank's policy rates close to zero, meaning that the scope for lowering the expected real interest rate by deployment of traditional monetary policy instruments is now limited. Inflation expectations that are lower than the Eurosystem's objective of price stability raise the real interest rate. This article looks at the non-standard monetary policy instruments with which, despite the zero lower bound, the Eurosystem has been able to steer market interest rates and strengthen expectations of a continuation of the accommodative monetary policy stance..

Democratic politics in a European Union under stress
Increasing market uncertainty over the condition of banks in early 2016 was not due solely to concerns about global economic growth but also above all reflected concerns about banks' non-performing loans and declining profitability amid low interest rates and subdued growth. Nonetheless, the condition of the European banking sector is gradually improving, despite major cross-country differences. Notwithstanding the positive developments, banks nevertheless remain vulnerable to deteriorations in the operating environment.

Should Sweden join the EMU? : an analysis of general equilibrium effects through trade
China was able to combine slow inflation with very rapid economic growth for more than a decade. Finally, in 2007 inflation started to accelerate and there are a number of factors that may increase the pressure on China's price level in the near future. Most importantly, money supply growth is expected to remain rapid due to the ballooning foreign currency inflows. In addition, according to some estimates, economic growth has accelereated above its long-term potential and also a number of structural factors are likely to push production costs up. Counterbalancing part of the rising costs, productivity growth has somewhat accelerated during recent years. With low cost levels and fastly growing exports, China is believed to have exported deflation into its trading partners in recent years. However, due to the fact that the direct impacts of globalisation on inflation in the advanced economies have been moderate, also the effect of a possible rise in China's cost leve!  l on inflation in eg euro area is expected to remain small. However, the indirect impacts on price dynamics are much more difficult to forecast.  Keywords: China, inflation, monetary policy .
The natural rate of interest is the real interest rate that brings the economy into equilibrium and would prevail if the output of the economy were at its potential level, i.e. in a situation where the economy is neither in an upswing nor in a downswing. The equilibrium would lead to stable inflation over the long term. During the last 10 years, the natural rate of interest in the advanced economies is estimated to have declined substantially. This not only affects the assessment of current monetary policy but also the future challenges facing monetary policy. However, estimates of the level of the natural rate of interest are very uncertain, which hampers the use of this interest rate as a monetary policy guide..

Euro area banking sector gathers strength
The operating environment for monetary policy has changed: the euro area macroprudential system - or macroprudential framework -for dampening country and sector-specific overheating is now stronger than before the financial crisis. The new system is, however, not yet complete, which increases the need to contribute to the maintenance of financial stability also via monetary policy measures. Even if the macroprudential system were stronger than it currently is, it is very difficult to fully prevent the possibly unfavourable side-effects of an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy. In the current situation, however, the strengthening of economic growth via monetary policy measures does also support financial stability.

The Governing Council of the ECB decided on an expanded asset purchase programme (EAPP) in January 2015. Purchases have thus far been conducted to a total value of almost EUR 780 billion. At its monetary policy meeting in March 2016, the Governing Council decided to further ease the monetary policy stance. Accordingly, markets expect monetary policy to remain accommodative for a prolonged period..

In the years since the financial crisis and up until recent months, domestic consumer prices have risen at a higher pace than in the euro area, and Finland is currently the most expensive country in the euro area as measured by consumer prices. The elevated price level erodes consumers' purchasing power, while the rapid increase in prices weakens the cost-competitiveness of Finnish export industries. Compared with the rest of the euro area, the price rise has been particularly rapid for commodities with large components of labour costs and indirect taxes..

"This interdisciplinary volume probes the economic and political impact of both, the 2008-09 financial-economic crisis and the subsequent sovereign debt crisis in Europe. Basing their analysis on a well-researched depiction of the origins and scope of the crisis, leading experts from Europe and North America critically examine its potentially destabilizing political effects. These include questions on the capacity of the European Union to respond swiftly and effectively, challenges to key EU policy commitments (such as climate change and anti-protectionist trade policies), and the manner in which potentially discontent electorates hold their leaders to account. This volume is unique in devoting special attention to the post-communist states, both those that have joined the European Union as well as Russia, and suggests that a global crisis of this type does not respect traditional political or economic boundaries, but rather that it has effects at the regional, national and supranational level. By extending the geographic scope, the authors address important questions about why some countries have suffered more that others and what the crisis will mean for the future shape of Europe"--

The decision by the ECB Governing Council to ease monetary policy through an expanded asset purchase programme will boost demand and accelerate inflation via a number of different channels. Completion of the comprehensive assessment of banks allied to the steps taken by the ECB will improve monetary policy transmission to the real economy via bank lending. More relaxed financing conditions for non-financial corporations and the reasonable level of indebtedness in the euro area's corporate sector provide fertile ground for recovery in investment. Households' large debt-servicing costs and low net assets will sustain the pressures in many euro area countries for a reduction in debt levels and weaken household demand. Although the exceptionally accommodative monetary policy is justified in order to safeguard price stability, negative side-effects cannot be entirely ruled out. The channelling of the accommodative monetary policy into fixed investment rather than the housing market can be supported through macroprudential policy..

This paper examines possible effects of EU membership and the shift to the euro on the monetary and exchange rate policies of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.The Baltics, which have extensive economic integration with euro-area states, all apply monetary policies based on fixed exchange rates.Estonias kroon is pegged directly to the euro.The external value of the Latvian lats is determined by a currency basket with a heavy euro weighting.Lithuania is currently shifting its peg of the litas from the US-dollar to a euro-dominated basket.The switch to the euro as the Baltics anchor currency has compelling practical reasons.Euro-area countries now provide a significant share of foreign direct investment into the Baltics and they collectively comprise the Baltics largest trading partner.The Baltic financial sectors are also extensively integrated with the euro area.Finally, the Baltic economies are natural candidates for fixed exchange rates, due to their small size and openness.Nevertheless, fixed exchange rate regimes always involve risks.Two of the biggest challenges facing the Baltic states are finding ways to keep productivity growth in line with real wage growth and increasing the flexibility of labor markets. .
