Children's Speech distills scientific evidence from around the world on sound disorders across the areas of speech acquisition, assessment, analysis, diagnosis, and intervention, and presents it with practical knowledge to prepare speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to work with children and their families. The book is guided by two contemporary frameworks that direct the successful management of speech sound disorders in children: evidence-based practice (EBP) and the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health—Children and Youth (ICF-CY). The foundation knowledge covers important topics including defining the population, types of speech sound disorders, anatomical structures, articulation and transcription of speech sounds, and theoretical foundations of speech and speech acquisition. Practical evidence-based knowledge is covered in chapters that mirror the stages of contact when working with children with speech sound disorders including assessment, analysis, goal setting, intervention principles and plans, intervention procedures, phonological interventions, motor speech interventions, and the conduct of EBP. The last chapter provides comprehensive clinical information for five clinical cases, including transcribed speech samples, case history information, assessment results and other real-life material. Throughout, readers are directed to complete clinical application tasks, drawing on the case-based information in this final chapter.

The Handbook of Adult Language Disorders is the essential guide to the scientific and clinical tenets of aphasia study and treatment. It focuses on how language breaks down after focal brain damage, what patterns of impairment reveal about normal language, and how recovery can be optimally facilitated. It is unique in that it reviews studies from the major disciplines in which aphasia research is conducted―cognitive neuropsychology, linguistics, neurology, neuroimaging, and speech-language pathology―as they apply to each topic of language. For each language domain, there are chapters devoted to theory and models of the language task, the neural basis of the language task (focusing on recent neuroimaging studies) and clinical diagnosis and treatment of impairments in that domain. In addition, there is broad coverage of approaches to investigation and treatment from leading experts, with several authors specializing in two or more disciplines. This second edition focuses on characterizing the cognitive and neural processes that account for each variant of aphasia as a first step toward developing effective rehabilitation, given that aphasia is one of the most common and disabling consequences of stroke.
