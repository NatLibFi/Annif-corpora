"This book is an in-depth examination of the growing alignment between powerful global bioindustries and education reform in the U.S. Utilizing a biopolitical methodology, the book focuses on how value-added measures and other neoliberal strategies embedded in policies such as 'race to the top' are involving schools in a project to manage and regulate educational life for competing in a new 'flat world'. Understanding the educational present, this work argues, requires individuals to consider what advanced industrialized nations across the globe are viewing as the future. Biocapitalist development in areas such as genetic engineering, drug therapies, and cellular cloning is the promissory future driving nations like the U.S. to out-compete and out-educate one another at any cost. This book assesses the implications for education in the biocapitalist era and points to alternative futures not based on such a vision of life and its productive potential"--

"This book resulted from experiences gained working in biotechnology and while teaching a graduate course entitled Biotechnology Operations and offered to graduate students in the Master of Science (M.S.) in Biotechnology Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (http://www.ms-biotech.wisc.edu/ ). In this course we examine the undertaking of developing biotechnology products, focusing on the scientific and management skills of biomanufacturing, clinical trials, non-clinical studies, project management, quality assurance, quality control, and regulatory affairs. The course emphasizes both operational planning for success and integration of plans and efforts in these seven functional areas. The instructors realized from their experience in the biotechnology industry the great need to carefully plan and fully integrate biotechnology development projects. The course is taught in that manner and this book reflects that philosophy with the outcome is a practical guide for students and for those employed or interested in biotechnology"--Provided by publisher.
