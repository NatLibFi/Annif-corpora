This book presents topics on the basics of materials selection and design which will give a better understanding on the selection methods and then find suitable materials for the applications. This book draws the simple and straightforward quantitative methods followed by knowledge-based expert system approach with real and tangible case studies to show how undergraduate or post-graduate students or engineers can apply their knowledge on materials selection and design. Topics discussed in this book contain special features such as illustration, tables, and tutorial questions for easy understanding. A few published books or documents are available, hence this book will be very useful for those who use (or want to use) materials selection approach without the advantages of having had comprehensive knowledge or expertise in this materials' world.

This thesis investigates the reliability of printed conductors on flexible substrates under cyclic bending. The topic is approached by studying the effects of several key design parameters on the bending lifetime of printed conductors under dynamic loading.In this thesis, the test specimens with various cross-sectional geometries were printed on different plastic and paper substrates. The test samples were fabricated with two printing methods, silk screen and roll-to-roll printing, by utilizing three different silver pastes as the conductive material. To evaluate the long-term performance of the printed traces, the test specimens were exposed to cyclic bending and their electrical behaviour during the test was monitored with resistance measurements.The bending test results were analysed by utilizing the Weibull analysis, with a 20% increase in resistance as the failure criterion. This method yielded a characteristic lifetime for a test population, including 10 individual test specimens. When comparing the characteristic lifetimes of all of the fabricated test populations, it was observed that all of the varied design parameters had an effect on the bending reliability of the printed traces. However, within the studied geometries and materials, the substrate was found to have the highest impact on the long-term electrical performance of printed conductors under cyclic bending.The study proves that the bending reliability of printed conductors can be enhanced by proper design choices. This is done by minimizing the strain when the printed trace is subjected to bending.

Stuff Matters tells the stories and explains the science behind some of the most fascinating and important inventions of our species: the materials of the man-made world. Many of these inventions are so familiar that we barely notice them - fibres for clothes, metals for tools, ceramics for storage, paper for communication, chocolate for pleasure - and yet they have transformed mankind. Others, such as aerogel, the lightest solid known to man, are utterly strange and literally transparent. From the towering skyscrapers of our cities to the most ordinary objects in our homes, from the tea cup to the jet engine, the silicon chip to the paper clip, world-leading materials scientist Mark Miodownik reveals the miracles of engineering and ingenuity that permeate every aspect of our lives. Along the way, he introduces metals that can heal themselves and implants that become living bone - radical new materials that will shape our future - as well as showing how every material, in its own way, has a profound effect on who we are

Between 1990 and 2010, the English language learner (ELL) population in U.S. schools grew by 80 percent. While the highest concentration of English language learners, now more commonly referred to as emergent bilinguals (EBLs) remains in the traditional immigrant destination states of California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, and New Jersey, in all 50 states there are growing numbers of emergent bilinguals. Interest in these learners has encouraged research and publications, but most of this research has centered on the students themselves and the politics surrounding their education. Publications featuring the research of teacher educators preparing teachers to work with EBLs in schools are much needed. Teacher educators must know how to help inservice teachers provide effective instruction to the increasing number of linguistically diverse students in the schools.

Carbon nanotubes are a promising material for various applications due to their unique collection of properties. However, carbon nanotube material as such is inert and insoluble, which hampers the true realization of its potential. In order to enhance the applicability of carbon nanotubes, their surface must be modified. This work concerned the chemical modification of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) by the Birch reduction, which is based on the reduction of the SWNT surface with the valence electron of alkali metal solvated in liquid ammonia. The reduction generates a SWNT anion, which reacts with electrophiles resulting in the covalent attachment of functional groups to the tube surface. In this work, aryl halides or alcohols were used as electrophiles to yield arylated or hydrogenated SWNTs, respectively.At first, the goal was to modify SWNTs as a filler material for polystyrene. The use of five halogenated ethenylphenyl derivatives as electrophiles revealed that the structure of electrophile affected the success of functionalization and the solubility of SWNTs in polystyrene-toluene solution. The most successful functionalization and solubilization of SWNTs were achieved with 1-chloro-4-ethenylbenzene.In the second part, liquid ammonia was replaced with a new solvent, 1-methoxy-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethane (diglyme) in order to avoid the restrictions, hazards and inconvenience of its handling. The work concentrated on the study of alkali metal reduction of SWNTs in diglyme by the use of arylation with 4-iodobenzoic acid or 4-chlorobenzoic acid and hydrogenation as model reactions. Li, Na or K was used as an alkali metal while naphthalene or 1-tert-butyl-4-(4-tert-butylphenyl)benzene was used in order to enhance the solvation of electrons. As a result, functionalization was simplified and enhanced. Electrophile affected the functionalization in such a way that arylation was significantly more successful than hydrogenation. The effect of alkali metal and electron carrier varied with electrophile. The most successful hydrogenation was achieved with the complex of Li and 1-tert-butyl-4-(4-tert-butylphenyl)benzene while arylation was the most successful with the complex of K and naphthalene. The solubility of SWNTs in water, ethanol, methanol and dimethylformamide was clearly improved by arylation whereas hydrogenation led to moderate improvement.
